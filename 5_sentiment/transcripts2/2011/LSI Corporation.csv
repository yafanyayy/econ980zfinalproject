30956,118060178,95658,"LSI Corporation, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2011",2011-01-26,"Earnings Calls","LSI Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Sujal. Good afternoon and welcome. Over the past several years, LSI has undergone a significant transformation and we're pleased with the progress we have made today.

Over the past several years, LSI has undergone a significant transformation and we're pleased with the progress we have made today. During this time, we have been investing ahead of revenue as we rebuild our key businesses for future success. We're now strongly positioned with differentiated products, technology leadership and wins with market leaders and are beginning to see new product cycles materializing with our key customers.
In 2010, we grew revenue 16% year-over-year and nearly doubled our non-GAAP operating income margins to 13% on track towards our business model targets. We also generated approximately $370 million in operating cash flow and repurchased over 50 million shares further strengthening our balance sheet while reducing our outstanding share count. 
In Q4, we grew revenues over 5% sequentially to $664 million at the high end of our guidance with growth and storage systems, HDD and fast standard compliance. Now, I want to review additional business highlights for Q4. I'll begin with storage systems, which includes both external storage systems and server RAID adaptors and software. Our storage systems business grew 14% sequentially and 6% year-over-year in Q4. We saw our growth across midrange and entry-level platforms with sequential growth at IBM, Oracle and Dell. We also saw sequential growth with our emerging Tier 2 OEM base. We continue to see very strong adoption of our entry level 2600 storage platform achieving the fastest volume ramp for new storage platform in our history. We've further expanded our customer base for this platform over the past quarter with six additional customers now shipping the 2600, bringing our total to 16 OEMs in production. This product family is also shipping to distributors and white box resellers. 
In our server RAID adapter and software business, growth in 2010 far exceeded server unit growth due to share gains and OEMs and in the distribution channel through the combination of our MegaRAID and 3ware product families. Direct attached storage within servers is seeing a resurgence driven by its certain data in architectures, larger virtualized server parameter and flash.
I'll now turn to storage semiconductors, which includes SAS, SAN and HDD. In SAS, we have the broadest portfolio of server and external storage solutions and continue to extend our leadership position. In 2010, our SAS product line revenues grew over 21% outpacing both the server and external storage unit growth rates. This growth was accomplished through both share gains and OEMs and new products expanding our participation. Looking forward, we expect to extend our number one position in server SAS through 6-gig design wins we have already secured across a long list of server OEMs for the upcoming Intel Romley generation. Our wins include IBM, Dell, Cisco, Supermicro, Fujitsu, NEC, Hitachi, Toshiba, as well as Oracle. 
With our timely market and performance advantages in SAS storage processors, we've also made significant process at another leading server OEM starting with the Romley generation. We are enhancing our product volume for margins for service by providing advanced software features on top of our SAS ROC and MegaRAID solutions. These software products enable our customers to take advantage of performance, ensuring benefits of Solid State Drives and are being used by IBM and Dell. 
The external storage SAS infrastructure opportunity continues to develop nicely for LSI. In 2010, this market grew to over $200 million and is expected to surpass $300 million in size in 2012 based on our estimates. In 2010, LSI doubled its revenue in this space through a broad offering of SAS expanders and now holds over 35% share. We expect to grow faster than the market through timely market and performance leadership. To further our participation in the space, we launched our SAS system-level switch in the distribution channel in Q4, and we expect to ramp at major OEMs later this year.
To further address opportunities in the flash market, last quarter we talked about bringing PCI express base SSD adopters to the market. We successfully launched this product in the channel and are pleased to announce that Cisco, Supermicro and SGI will be launching our SSD adapters this quarter. In addition, we expect to begin ramping SSD custom controllers targeted to enterprise applications this year. 
Turning to hard disk drives. We are strongly positioned to grow SSD share as our solutions become increasingly deployed by both existing and new customers. Last quarter, we increased shipments of our SSC and the Seagate Savio and Constellation enterprise drives and began shipping 40-nanometer SSDs into Hitachi desk star family of drives. In addition, LSI's participating in hybrid programs at our leading HDD customer. We are also seeing success with our PA 2900 preamps, which have a common architecture for desktop, mobile and enterprise drives and are shipping across all of these segments. We expect to grow share in 2011 building upon this product success.
Looking forward, we continue to hit our development milestones to expand our customer base for SSCs. In November, we launched a second-generation 40-nanometer rechannel. It is now sampling to hard disk drive manufacturers. This product features multiple force optimized for high-speed or low-power applications enabling significant density increases while reducing power consumption and supporting data rates exceeding four gigabits per second.
Now I would like to the review networking business where we continue to experience strong momentum driven by network processors, DSPs and custom products that serve the wireless and enterprise markets. For the full year 2010, revenues in our networking investment areas grew over 50%, driven by design wins materializing into revenue at market leading customers. Network processors and DSP growth by driven by Ericsson, Nokia Siemens, Cisco and Fallway. And in custom products, growth was fueled by Alcatel Lucent, Huawei and ZTE.
As approved point of our strategy and execution, we are now in production for client gigabit ethernet with the leading PC chipset company and expect our share to approach 15% of the worldwide PC market in 2011.
We've also won the next-generation gigabit ethernet five with the same customer in 40-nanometer technology, extending this revenue stream into the future. LSI enabled solutions are now participating in the adoption of 10-gig ethernet and FCOE in the data center for server and switching platforms. We continue to increase shipments of 10 gig silicon for long and adapter applications to Emulex. In addition, we have begun sampling our custom data centers switch solution to the leading data networking company and expect to release this product into production next quarter. 
In wireless access, we continue to grow through market share gains and are benefiting from global expansion of 3G and 4G networks. Network processors volumes nearly double for the full year driven by Ericsson and Nokia Siemens wireless access platforms. Further, we entered high volume production with Ericsson's next-generation mobile media gateway that incorporates our DSPs and network processors. 
In summary, our networking business performed very well in 2010 driven by end market growth and significant market share gains. Before I turn it over to Bryon for financials, I want to stress that we are expecting continued revenue growth and operating income expansion as we move through 2011. The top priority of the management team is to make continued progress towards our operating model goal of 17% non-GAAP operating income. We have a number of new product cycles that we expect to contribute to revenues as we move through the year and expect to maintain tight controls on operating expenses. The long-term fundamentals of our business are solid. Our large and growing multi-year design win pipeline continues to move towards and into production, and we continue to deepen our engagements with market leading customers to establish growth drivers for future. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Bryon who will take you through our results and provide guidance."

I'd like to begin by providing a few highlights and perspectives on LSI's financial performance for the full year. We closed 2010 with annual revenues of $2.6 billion, representing 16% year-ove",1250,"Thanks, Abhi, and thanks everyone for joining the call today. I'd like to begin by providing a few highlights and perspectives on LSI's financial performance for the full year. We closed 2010 with annual revenues of $2.6 billion, representing 16% year-over-year growth. Our systems business grew 20% and semiconductors grew 14%. We delivered gross margins excluding special items above business model throughout 2010, posting full year gross margins of 48.3%, an improvement of 370 basis points over 2009. 
Our operating expenses excluding special items were $990 million for the year. We remain focused on expense control throughout the year, reporting effectively flat non-GAAP operating expense for each quarter in 2010, while driving 16% topline growth year-over-year.
We delivered solid progress towards our business model, producing double-digit non-GAAP operating income percentage for every quarter in 2010. And on a year-over-year basis, we nearly doubled our non-GAAP operating income, growing from 6.7% for fiscal 2009 to 12.6% for 2010, significant progress towards our business model target of 17%.
In addition, one of our key focus areas has consistently been to maintain and grow our net cash position, while driving efficient working capital management. In 2010, we delivered $367 million in operating cash flows or an 80% improvement over 2009. We closed the year with a cash and short-term investment balance of $677 million and zero debt, while also having utilized $250 million of cash to buy back stock.
Now, some highlights from the recent quarter. Total revenues for Q4 were $664 million at the high-end of our guidance range, sequentially up 5.6% and up 4.2% on a year-over-year basis. Semiconductor revenues for Q4 were $393 million, sequentially up 1% from Q3 and up 3% on a year-over-year basis.
Our storage, semiconductor revenues were sequentially up $6 million or 3% to $248 million, driven by strength in HDD and SAS. Storage semiconductors represented 37% of total revenues in the fourth quarter. Q4 revenues in our networking business were $119 million, sequentially flat to Q3 and represented 18% of total revenues for the quarter. Revenues for the IP business in the fourth quarter were $25 million, in line with our expectations.
Turning now to our storage systems business, which includes both external storage systems and server RAID adapters and software. Storage systems revenues were sequentially up 14% to $272 million, a record high for this business. This represented a 6% improvement in systems revenues as compared to Q4 2009. Storage systems segment represented 41% of LSI's total revenues in the fourth quarter.
Moving next to gross margins. LSI's consolidated Q4 gross margin, excluding special items, was 48.0%, consistent with the guidance we provided in October. Non-GAAP gross margins were sequentially down 130 basis points from Q3, primarily due to a higher concentration of systems revenues as a percentage of total, along with lower IP revenues and mix within our semiconductor products.
Non-GAAP gross margins improved 60 basis points compared to the same quarter a year ago. Semiconductor gross margins excluding special items were 53.5%, approximately 170 basis points below Q3. Again, primarily due to lower IP revenues and product mix. Storage systems gross margins for the fourth quarter excluding special items sequentially improved 50 basis points to 40.0%.
Moving to operating expenses. R&D together with SG&A expenses, excluding special items, were sequentially up $2 million to $230 million in Q4. Non-GAAP operating margin sequentially improved by approximately 40 basis points to 13.4% or $89 million. We successfully delivered operating margin expansion for three quarters in a row as we continue to drive progress towards our business model targets. 
Interest income and other net of interest expense excluding special items was approximately $8 million for Q4.
Now let me turn to the special items we recorded in the fourth quarter, which netted to approximately $103 million. During the quarter, we made the decision to terminate several software programs associated with our external systems business and recorded several charges as a result. These programs were isolated primarily to one customer and unrelated to our current core product offerings. We do not expect any material impact to near-term or future revenues due to these actions.
Special items primarily non-cash included approximately $49 million in restructuring and other items, primarily relating to the actions I just mentioned. $40 million in amortization of acquisition-related items and $15 million of stock based compensation expense.
Moving next to tax. For Q4, we recorded a provision of $7 million for both GAAP and non-GAAP. As a reminder, our tax provision on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis can vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on our profitability in different geographic tax jurisdictions and discreet items.
On a GAAP basis, fourth quarter net loss was $13 million or $0.02 per share. Net income excluding special items was $90 million sequentially improving from $0.13 to $0.14 per share. Share count for the period was 617 million shares for GAAP and 626 shares on a non-GAAP basis.
Turning now to cash flows and the balance sheet. Operating cash flows in the fourth quarter were $112 million and $367 million for fiscal 2010. We exited the year with a cash and short-term investments balance of $677 million. During the quarter, we utilized approximately $32 million of cash for share repurchases. During the full year, we repurchased a total of 51 million shares and utilized $250 million under the current share repurchase authorization.
In addition, depreciation and software amortization was $26 million for Q4 and $105 million for fiscal 2010. And capital expenditures were $12 million for the fourth quarter and $52 million for the year.
The following is our guidance for Q1 2011: Revenues in the range of $605 million to $635 million. At the midpoint, this is sequentially down about 7% following a strong Q4, and this is somewhat better than historical seasonality, which is typically been down on average about 10%. We expect both our networking semiconductor and storage system businesses to be down relative to Q4, while we expect our storage semiconductor business to be roughly flat. Consolidated gross margin excluding special items is expected to be between 46.5% and 48.5%. We expect gross margins, excluding special items, to be approximately 52% for the semiconductor segment and approximately 40% for the systems segment. Operating expenses excluding special items are expected to be in the range of $225 million to $235 million, which is sequentially flat at midpoint.
Interest income and other interest expense is expected to net to income of approximately $3 million. Special items are expected to net to approximately $40 million to $60 million. The GAAP and non-GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately $7 million for Q1. We expect Q1 GAAP net income per share in the range of negative $0.03 to positive $0.07, and EPS excluding special items to be in the range of $0.07 to $0.13 per share. The share count is expected to be approximately 625 million shares for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes. In addition, we expect depreciation and software amortization of approximately $26 million and capital expenditures of approximately $15 million.
Before we go to your questions, I just want to note that the consistent expansion of non-GAAP operating margin throughout 2010 underscores our continued commitment to drive the business model performance. We are running above our business model goals on gross margin and expect to maintain tight control on operating expenses to improve our earnings growth as we demonstrated in 2010.
I would now like to turn the call back to Sujal."

But clearly, this has been something that we've been watching very closely given what the overall industry experienced last year this time in the first half. So we've gone to great lengths to really get as much visibility as we can into our customers inventories, who got with all our customers, assuming trying to extract color around the channel inventories and to whatever extent, PC OEM inventories, taking that into account, as well as placing the temp for Q1 on the lower end of the spectrum that's been discussed out there from $155 million to $168 million. I've even heard some numbers slightly above. We're sort of assuming $160 million unit temp coming into this quarter. And so that's what's kind of modeled into our forecast. We certainly have the ability to respond to a stronger end market, but we decided to put our temp on the lower end caution. Relative to storage semi or hard disk drive for the year, we continue to believe that growth in the year is somewhere probably in the mid to high single digit in terms of unit for hard disk drive. I think that's supported by not only the PC growth but definitely supported by half the hard disk drive market that has nothing to do with PCs and associated with everything from homes to cloud build out to drives that are making in to TVs and set top boxes and so forth, that part of the hard disk drive market continues to grow to pretty healthy pace."

But if you look at the overall year, I'll give you a couple of data points that will put that into perspective or the overall networking business in perspective. Our legacy business was quite strong in the first half of the year. Some of it driven by last time buys and some of the surge buildup occurred on some older system products with our customers. The legacy business did absolutely drop in the second half relative to the first half. So that definitely played a bit of a role. But we also saw quite a bit of strength in Q3, in Q2 and Q3 in our go forward networking areas that sort of strengthens subsides a little bit going into Q4. There were also some inventory in Q2 and Q3 as it was also worked through in the wireless space, which I think has been fairly well-documented out there. So that's how we provide some color on that. I think the other thing to keep in mind, especially when it pertains to our products versus potentially FPGA, or products of that sort, our supply line cycle is for our customers in the telecom service provider space, typically running in there from 12 to 15 months in terms of lead times and so forth. So we are a bit off shifted relative to what you see in terms of end system revenue versus our revenue. So I think those three factors sort of explain the experience that we're having in our networking business."

The midrange is the biggest segment in itself, a lot of different product lines, entries growing incredibly fast. My point there is there is a lot of opportunities in that particular overall market segment. Opportunities also for our business model in terms of  make versus buy. Most OEMs cannot cover the full spectrum. There's probably only one or two companies that have the revenue scale to fulfill all the product segments that we have to immediately compete as well as keep building the software position. So the opportunities the remains as it has in terms of specific opportunities that we're focused on and certainly, cultivating and growing our entry product as we talked about earlier is a home run in terms of value proposition, competitiveness, price performance. And it is the most ubiquitous platform that we've had in the history in terms of OEMs and customers shipping this product. And the growth rate in the entry segment is very strong. In terms of customers, we continue to be very focused on helping Oracle leverage our storage system in particular around their database and database platform, their overall integrated solution. We've seen that business now grow two quarters in a row. We're seeing a far greater level of focus and intensity in bigger deals going down. So we are excited to continue to see that grow.

In 2010, we grew revenue 16% year-over-year and nearly doubled our non-GAAP operating income margins to 13%, on track towards our business model targets. We also generated approximately $370 million in operating cash flow and repurchased over 50 million shares, further strengthening our balance sheet while reducing our outstanding share count. 
In Q4, we grew revenues over 5% sequentially to $664 million at the high end of our guidance, with growth and storage systems, HDD and SAS standard compliance [ph]. Now I want to review additional business highlights for Q4. I'll begin with Storage Systems, which includes both external storage systems and server RAID adaptors and software. 
Our Storage Systems business grew 14% sequentially and 6% year-over-year in Q4. We saw our growth across midrange and entry-level platforms, with sequential growth at IBM, Oracle and Dell. We also saw sequential growth with our emerging Tier 2 OEM base. We continue to see very strong adoption of our entry-level 2600 storage platform achieving the fastest volume ramp for new storage platform in our history. We've further expanded our customer base for this platform over the past quarter, with six additional customers now shipping the 2600, bringing our total to 16 OEMs in production. This product family is also shipping to distributors and white box resellers. 
In our Server RAID Adapter and Software business, growth in 2010 far exceeded server unit growth due to share gains at OEMs and in the distribution channel through the combination of our MegaRAID and 3ware product families. Direct attached storage within servers is seeing a resurgence, driven by its certain data center architectures, larger virtualized server environment and flash tuners. 
I'll now turn to Storage Semiconductors, which includes SAS, SAN and HDD. In SAS, we have the broadest portfolio with our server and external storage solutions and continue to extend our leadership position. In 2010, our SAS product line revenues grew over 21%, outpacing both the server and external storage unit growth rates. This growth was accomplished through both share gains and OEMs and new products expanding our participation. 
Looking forward, we expect to extend our number one position in server SAS through 6-gig design wins we have already secured across a long list of server OEMs for the upcoming Intel Romley generation. Our wins include IBM, Dell, Cisco, Supermicro, Fujitsu, NEC, Hitachi, Toshiba, as well as Oracle. 
With our timely market and performance advantages in SAS storage processors and controllers, we have also made significant progress at another leading server OEM, starting with the Romley generation. We are enhancing our product value and margins for servers by providing advanced software features on top of our SAS ROC and MegaRAID solutions. These software products enable our customers to take advantage of performance, ensuring benefits of solid state drives and are being used by IBM and Dell. 
The external storage SAS infrastructure opportunity continues to develop nicely for LSI. In 2010, this market grew to over $200 million and is expected to surpass $300 million in size in 2012 based on our estimates. In 2010, LSI doubled its revenue in this space through a broad offering of SAS expanders and now holds over 35% share. We expect to grow faster than the market through timely market and performance leadership. To further our participation in the space, we launched our SAS system-level switch in the distribution channel in Q4, and we expect to ramp at major OEMs later this year.
To further address opportunities in the flash market, last quarter we talked about bringing PCI Express base at 50 adapters to the market. We successfully launched this product in the channel and are pleased to announce that Cisco, Supermicro and SGI will be launching our SSD adapters this quarter. In addition, we expect to begin ramping SSD custom controllers targeted to enterprise applications this year. 
Turning to Hard Disk Drives. We are solidly in position to grow SSD share as our solutions become increasingly deployed by both existing and new customers. Last quarter, we increased shipments of our SSCs in the Seagate Savio and Constellation enterprise drives and began shipping 40-nanometer LDPC  SSCs into Hitachi's Deskstar family of drives. In addition, LSI's participating in hybrid programs at our leading HDD customer. We are also seeing success with our PA 2900 preamps, which have a common architecture for desktop, mobile and enterprise drives and are shipping across all of these segments. We expect to grow share in 2011 building upon this product success.
Looking forward, we continue to hit our development milestones to expand our customer base for SSCs. In November, we launched a second-generation 40-nanometer rechannel. It is now sampling to hard disk drive manufacturers. This product features multiple cores optimized for high-speed or low-power applications, enabling significant density increases while reducing power consumption and supporting data rates exceeding four gigabits per second.
Now I would like to the review Networking business, where we continued to experience strong momentum driven by network processors, DSPs and custom products that serve the wireless and enterprise markets. For the full year 2010, revenues in our networking and investment areas grew over 50% driven by design wins materializing into revenue at market-leading customers. Network processors and BSP growth by driven by Ericsson, Nokia Siemens, Cisco and Huawei. And in custom products, growth was fueled by Alcatel-Lucent, Huawei and ZTE.
As proof point of our strategy and execution, we are now in production for client Gigabit Ethernet PHYs with the leading PC chipset company and expect our share to approach 15% of the worldwide PC market in 2011.
We've also won the next-generation Gigabit Ethernet PHY with the same customer in 40-nanometer technology, extending this revenue stream into the future. LSI-enabled solutions are now participating in the adoption of 10-gig Ethernet and FCoE in the data center for server and switching platforms. We continue to increase shipments of 10-gig silicon for long and adapter applications to Emulex. In addition, we have begun sampling our custom data centers switch solution to the leading data networking company and expect to release this product into production next quarter. 
In Wireless Access, we continue to grow through market share gains and are benefiting from global expansion of 3G and 4G networks. Network processor volumes nearly doubled for the full year, driven by Ericsson and Nokia-Siemens wireless access platforms. Further, we entered high volume production with Ericsson's next-generation mobile media gateway that incorporates our DSPs and network processors. 
In summary, our Networking business performed very well in 2010, driven by end-market growth and significant market share gains. Before I turn it over to Bryon for financials, I want to stress that we are expecting continued revenue growth and operating income expansion as we move through 2011. 
The top priority of the management team is to make continued progress towards our operating model goal of 17% non-GAAP operating income. We have a number of new product cycles that we expect to contribute to revenues, as we move through the year and expect to maintain tight controls on operating expenses. 
The long-term fundamentals of our business are solid. Our large and growing multi-year design win pipeline continues to move towards and into production, and we continue to deepen our engagements with market-leading customers to establish growth drivers for future. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Bryon who will take you through our results and provide guidance."

I'd like to begin by providing a few highlights and perspectives on LSI's financial performance for the full year. We closed 2010 with annual revenues of $2.6 billion, representing 16% year-over-year growth. Our Systems business grew 20% and Semiconductors grew 14%. We delivered gross margins excluding special items above business model throughout 2010, posting full year gross margins of 48.3%, an improvement of 370 basis points over 2009. 
Our operating expenses excluding special items were $990 million for the year. We remain focused on expense control throughout the year, reporting effectively flat non-GAAP operating expense for each quarter in 2010, while driving 16% top line growth year-over-year.
We delivered solid progress towards our business model, producing double-digit non-GAAP operating income percentage for every quarter in 2010. And on a year-over-year basis, we nearly doubled our non-GAAP operating income, growing from 6.7% for fiscal 2009 to 12.6% for 2010, a significant progress towards our business model target of 17%.
In addition, one of our key focus areas has consistently been to maintain and grow our net cash position, while driving efficient working capital management. In 2010, we delivered $367 million in operating cash flows or an 80% improvement over 2009. We closed the year with a cash and short-term investment balance of $677 million and zero debt, while also having utilized $250 million of cash to buy back stock.
Now, some highlights from the recent quarter. Total revenues for Q4 were $664 million at the high end of our guidance range, sequentially up to 5.6% and up 4.2% on a year-over-year basis. Semiconductor revenues for Q4 were $393 million, sequentially up 1% from Q3 and up 3% on a year-over-year basis.
Our Storage Semiconductor revenues were sequentially up $6 million or 3% to $248 million, driven by strength in HDD and SAS. Storage Semiconductors represented 37% of total revenues in the fourth quarter. Q4 revenues in our Networking business were $119 million, sequentially flat to Q3 and represented 18% of total revenues for the quarter. Revenues for the IP business in the fourth quarter were $25 million, in line with our expectations.
Turning now to our Storage Systems business, which includes both external storage systems and server RAID adapters and software. Storage systems revenues were sequentially up 14% to $272 million, a record high for this business. This represented a 6% improvement in systems revenues as compared to Q4 2009. The Storage Systems segment represented 41% of LSI's total revenues in the fourth quarter.
Moving next to gross margins. LSI's consolidated Q4 gross margin, excluding special items, was 48.0%, consistent with the guidance we provided in October. Non-GAAP gross margins were sequentially down 130 basis points from Q3, primarily due to a higher concentration of systems revenues as a percentage of total, along with lower IP revenues and mix within our semiconductor products.
Non-GAAP gross margins improved to 60 basis points compared to the same quarter a year ago. Semiconductor gross margins, excluding special items, were 53.5%, approximately 170 basis points below Q3. Again, primarily due to lower IP revenues and product mix. Storage Systems gross margins for the fourth quarter excluding special items sequentially improved to 50 basis points to 40.0%.
Moving to operating expenses. R&D together with SG&A expenses, excluding special items, were sequentially up $2 million to $230 million in Q4. Non-GAAP operating margin sequentially improved by approximately 40 basis points to 13.4% or $89 million. We successfully delivered operating margin expansion for three quarters in a row, as we continue to drive progress towards our business model targets. 
Interest income and other, net of interest expense excluding special items, was approximately $8 million for Q4.
Now let me turn to the special items we recorded in the fourth quarter, which netted to approximately $103 million. During the quarter, we made the decision to terminate several software programs associated with our External Systems business and recorded several charges as a result. These programs were isolated primarily to one customer and unrelated to our current core product offerings. We do not expect any material impact to near-term or future revenues due to these actions.
Special items, primarily non-cash, included approximately $49 million in restructuring and other items, primarily relating to the actions I just mentioned, $40 million in amortization of acquisition-related items and $15 million of stock based compensation expense.
Moving next to tax. For Q4, we recorded a provision of $7 million for both GAAP and non-GAAP. As a reminder, our tax provision on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis can vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter based on our profitability in different geographic tax jurisdictions and discreet items.
On a GAAP basis, fourth quarter net loss was $13 million or $0.02 per share. Net income excluding special items was $90 million, sequentially improving from $0.13 to $0.14 per share. Share count for the period was 617 million shares for GAAP and 626 shares on a non-GAAP basis.
Turning now to cash flows and the balance sheet. Operating cash flows in the fourth quarter were $112 million and $367 million for fiscal 2010. We exited the year with a cash and short-term investments balance of $677 million. During the quarter, we utilized approximately $32 million of cash for share repurchases. During the full year, we repurchased a total of 51 million shares and utilized $250 million under the current share repurchase authorization.
In addition, depreciation and software amortization was $26 million for Q4 and $105 million for fiscal 2010, and capital expenditures were $12 million for the fourth quarter and $52 million for the year.
The following is our guidance for Q1 2011: Revenues in the range of $605 million to $635 million. At the midpoint, this is sequentially down about 7%, following a strong Q4. And this is somewhat better than historical seasonality, which has typically been down on average about 10%. We expect both our Networking Semiconductor and Storage System businesses to be down relative to Q4, while we expect our Storage Semiconductor business to be roughly flat. 
Consolidated gross margin excluding special items is expected to be between 46.5% and 48.5%. We expect gross margins, excluding special items, to be approximately 52% for the Semiconductor segment and approximately 40% for the Systems segment. Operating expenses excluding special items are expected to be in the range of $225 million to $235 million, which is sequentially flat at midpoint.
Interest income and other in interest expense is expected to net to income of approximately $3 million. Special items are expected to net to approximately $40 million to $60 million. The GAAP and non-GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately $7 million for Q1. We expect Q1 GAAP net income per share in the range of negative $0.03 to positive $0.07, and EPS excluding special items to be in the range of $0.07 to $0.13 per share. 
The share count is expected to be approximately 625 million shares for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes. In addition, we expect depreciation and software amortization of approximately $26 million and capital expenditures of approximately $15 million.
Before we go to your questions, I just want to note that the consistent expansion of non-GAAP operating margin throughout 2010 underscores our continued commitment to drive the business model performance. We are running above our business model goals on gross margin and expect to maintain tight control on operating expenses to improve our earnings growth as we demonstrated in 2010.
I would now like to turn the call back to Sujal."

And so, I can certainly offer a perspective for the full year in terms of the market. But clearly, this has been something that we have been something we've been watching very closely, given what the overall industry experienced last year this time in the first half. So we've gone to great lengths to really get as much visibility as we can into our customers' inventories. We've got hubs with all our customers, assuming we're trying to extract color around the channel inventories and to whatever extent, PC OEM inventories, taking that into account, as well as placing the TAM for Q1 on the lower end of the spectrum that's been discussed out there from $155 million to $168 million. I've even heard some numbers slightly above that. We're sort of assuming $160 million unit TAM coming into this quarter. And so that's what's kind of modeled into our forecast. We certainly have the ability to respond to a stronger end market, but we decided to put our TAM on the lower-end caution. Relative to storage semi or hard disk drive for the year, we continue to believe that growth in the year is somewhere probably in the mid- to high-single digit in terms of units for hard disk drive. I think that's supported by not only the PC growth but definitely supported by half the hard disk drive market that has nothing to do with PCs and associated with everything from home to cloud buildout to drives they're making into TVs and set-top boxes and so forth. That part of the hard disk drive market continues to grow at a pretty healthy pace."

But if you look at the overall year, I'll give you a couple of data points that will put that into perspective or the overall Networking business in perspective. Our Legacy business was quite strong in the first half of the year. Some of it driven by last-time buys and some of the surge that buildout that occurred on some older system products with our customers. The Legacy business did absolutely drop in the second half relative to the first half. So that definitely played a bit of a role. But we also saw quite a bit of strength in Q2 and Q3 in our go-forward networking areas that sort of -- that strengths sort of subsided a little bit going into Q4. There were also some inventory in Q2 and Q3. It was also worked through in the wireless space, which I think has been fairly well-documented out there. So that's how we provide some color on that. I think the other thing to keep in mind, especially as it pertains to our products versus potentially FPGA, or products of that sort. Our supply line or cycles for our customers in the telecom service provider space, typically running in there from 12 to 15 months in terms of lead times and so forth. So we are a bit pre-shifted relative to what you see in terms of end-system revenue versus a part of revenue. So I think those three factors sort of explain the experience that we're having with our Networking business."

We're hitting all our milestones, and Silicon's looking really good and we're even more positive today than we were three months ago and six months ago relative to these things materializing into share gains. And our share objective that we've put out there certainly is to have us go from the low 20s to the 40% range over the course of time."

We will see other SoCs come into the revenue stream, but that will be, as I pointed earlier, second half as those programs kick in.

From a market-size standpoint, it's about $55 billion to $60 billion in size, many, many different segments. The midrange is the biggest segment in itself, a lot of different product lines, entries growing incredibly fast. My point there is there's a lot of opportunities in that particular overall market segment, opportunities also for our business model in terms of  make versus buy. Most OEMs cannot cover the full spectrum. There's probably only one or two companies that have the revenue scale to fulfill all the product segments that we need have to effectively compete as well as keep building the software position. So the opportunities the remains as it has. In terms of specific opportunities that we're focused on and certainly cultivating and growing, our entry product, as we talked about it earlier, is a home run in terms of value proposition, competitiveness, price performance. And it is the most ubiquitous platform that we've had in our history in terms of number of OEMs and customers buying and shipping this product. And the growth rate in the entry segment is very strong. In terms of customers, we continue to be very focused on helping Oracle leverage our storage system, in particular, around their database and database platform, their overall strategy for an integrated solution. We've seen that business now grow two quarters in a row. We're seeing a far greater level of focus and intensity in bigger deals going down. So we're excited to continue to see that grow.

I don't have a precise number as to how far we are. But this upgrade cycle started in earnest about the middle of '09 and really kicked in the year, as it exited '09 and has been very strong throughout this year. I think several things that are going on. There's certainly an upgrade cycle, but there's so many new demands that are driving server growth. Demands associated with data center buildouts that are occurring here are increasingly participating in data center through our Channel business. It's selling into the big data centers that sort of that comes. That buildout continues to happen. There is data center buildout that's taking place relative to even wireless service providers, who are increasing having to deal with data and services to support all the handheld clients from smartphones to now tablets and so forth. There's that buildout that's going on. We're seeing certainly buildout associated with hosting companies, because the hosting space, whether it's Software-as-a-Service or IT hosting, that's also growing.

Over the past several years, LSI has undergone a significant transformation, and we are pleased with the progress we have made to date. During this time, we have been investing ahead of revenue, as we rebuild our key businesses for future success. We're now strongly positioned with differentiated products, technology leadership and wins with market leaders and are beginning to see new product cycles materializing with our key customers.
In 2010, we grew revenue 16% year-over-year and nearly doubled our non-GAAP operating income margins to 13%, on track towards our business model targets. We also generated approximately $370 million in operating cash flow and repurchased over 50 million shares, further strengthening our balance sheet while reducing our outstanding share count. 
In Q4, we grew revenues over 5% sequentially to $664 million at the high end of our guidance, with growth and storage systems, HDD and SAS standard compliments. Now I want to review additional business highlights for Q4. I'll begin with Storage Systems, which includes both external storage systems and server RAID adaptors and software. 
Our Storage Systems business grew 14% sequentially and 6% year-over-year in Q4. We saw growth across midrange and entry-level platforms, with sequential growth at IBM, Oracle and Dell. We also saw sequential growth with our emerging Tier 2 OEM base. We continue to see very strong adoption of our entry-level 2600 storage platform achieving the fastest volume ramp for new storage platform in our history. We've further expanded our customer base for this platform over the past quarter, with six additional customers now shipping the 2600, bringing our total to 16 OEMs in production. This product family is also shipping to distributors and white box resellers. 
In our Server RAID Adapter and Software business, growth in 2010 far exceeded server unit growth due to share gains at OEMs and in the distribution channel through the combination of our MegaRAID and 3ware product families. Direct attached storage within servers is seeing a resurgence driven by its certain data center architectures, larger virtualized server environment and flash tuners. 
I'll now turn to Storage Semiconductors, which includes SAS, SAN and HDD. In SAS, we have the broadest portfolio with our server and external storage solutions and continue to extend our leadership position. In 2010, our SAS product line revenues grew over 21%, outpacing both the server and external storage unit growth rates. This growth was accomplished through both share gains and OEMs and new products expanding our participation. 
Looking forward, we expect to extend our number one position in server SAS through 6-gig design wins we have already secured across a long list of server OEMs for the upcoming Intel Romley generation. Our wins include IBM, Dell, Cisco, Supermicro, Fujitsu, NEC, Hitachi, Toshiba, as well as Oracle. 
With our timely market and performance advantages in SAS storage processors and controllers, we have also made significant progress at another leading server OEM, starting with the Romley generation. We are enhancing our product value and margins for servers by providing advanced software features on top of our SAS ROC and MegaRAID solutions. These software products enable our customers to take advantage of performance, ensuring benefits of solid-state drives and are being used by IBM and Dell. 
The external storage SAS infrastructure opportunity continues to develop nicely for LSI. In 2010, this market grew to over $200 million and is expected to surpass $300 million in size in 2012 based on our estimates. In 2010, LSI doubled its revenue in this space through a broad offering of SAS expanders and now holds over 35% share. We expect to grow faster than the market through timely market and performance leadership. To further our participation in the space, we launched our SAS system-level switch in the distribution channel in Q4, and we expect to ramp at major OEMs later this year.
To further address opportunities in the flash market, last quarter we talked about bringing PCI Express base SSD adapters to the market. We successfully launched this product in the channel and are pleased to announce that Cisco, Supermicro and SGI will be launching our SSD adapters this quarter. In addition, we expect to begin ramping SSD custom controllers targeted to enterprise applications this year. 
Turning to Hard Disk Drives. We are solidly in position to grow SSD share as our solutions become increasingly deployed by both existing and new customers. Last quarter, we increased shipments of our SSCs in the Seagate Savio and Constellation enterprise drives and began shipping 40-nanometer LDPC SSCs into Hitachi's Deskstar family of drives. In addition, LSI is participating in hybrid programs at our leading HDD customer. We are also seeing success with our PA 2900 preamps, which have a common architecture for desktop, mobile and enterprise drives and are shipping across all of these segments. We expect to grow share in 2011 building upon this product success.
Looking forward, we continue to hit our development milestones to expand our customer base for SSCs. In November, we launched a second-generation 40-nanometer rechannel that is now sampling to hard disk drive manufacturers. This product features multiple cores optimized for high-speed or low-power applications, enabling significant density increases while reducing power consumption and supporting data rates exceeding four gigabits per second.
Now I would like to the review the Networking business, where we continue to experience strong momentum driven by network processors, DSPs and custom products that serve the wireless and enterprise markets. For the full year 2010, revenues in our networking and investment areas grew over 50% driven by design wins materializing into revenue at market-leading customers. Network processors and BSP growth was by driven by Ericsson, Nokia Siemens, Cisco and Huawei. And in custom products, growth was fueled by Alcatel-Lucent, Huawei and ZTE.
As proof point of our strategy and execution, we are now in production for client Gigabit Ethernet PHYs with the leading PC chipset company and expect our share to approach 15% of the worldwide PC market in 2011.
We've also won the next-generation Gigabit Ethernet PHY with the same customer in 40-nanometer technology, extending this revenue stream into the future. LSI-enabled solutions are now participating in the adoption of 10-gig Ethernet and FCoE in the data center for server and switching platforms. We continue to increase shipments of 10-gig silicon for long and adapter applications to Emulex. In addition, we have begun sampling our custom data centers switch solution to the leading data networking company and expect to release this product into production next quarter. 
In Wireless Access, we continue to grow through market share gains and are benefiting from global expansion of 3G and 4G networks. Network processor volumes nearly doubled for the full year, driven by Ericsson and Nokia-Siemens wireless access platforms. Further, we entered high volume production with Ericsson's next-generation mobile media gateway that incorporates our DSPs and network processors. 
In summary, our Networking business performed very well in 2010, driven by end-market growth and significant market share gains. Before I turn it over to Bryon for financials, I want to stress that we are expecting continued revenue growth and operating income expansion as we move through 2011. 
The top priority of the management team is to make continued progress towards our operating model goal of 17% non-GAAP operating income. We have a number of new product cycles that we expect to contribute to revenues, as we move through the year and expect to maintain tight controls on operating expenses. 
The long-term fundamentals of our business are solid. Our large and growing multi-year design win pipeline continues to move towards and into production, and we continue to deepen our engagements with market-leading customers to establish growth drivers for the future. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Bryon who will take you through our results and provide guidance."

I'd like to begin by providing a few highlights and perspectives on LSI's financial performance for the full year. We closed 2010 with annual revenues of $2.6 billion, representing 16% year-over-year growth. Our Systems business grew 20% and Semiconductors grew 14%. We delivered gross margins excluding special items above business model throughout 2010, posting full year gross margins of 48.3%, an improvement of 370 basis points over 2009. 
Our operating expenses excluding special items were $919 million for the year. We remain focused on expense control throughout the year, reporting effectively flat non-GAAP operating expense for each quarter in 2010, while driving 16% top line growth year-over-year.
We delivered solid progress towards our business model, producing double-digit non-GAAP operating income percentage for every quarter in 2010. And on a year-over-year basis, we nearly doubled our non-GAAP operating income, growing from 6.7% for fiscal 2009 to 12.6% for 2010, a significant progress towards our business model target of 17%.
In addition, one of our key focus areas has consistently been to maintain and grow our net cash position, while driving efficient working capital management. In 2010, we delivered $367 million in operating cash flows or an 80% improvement over 2009. We closed the year with a cash and short-term investment balance of $677 million and zero debt, while also having utilized $250 million of cash to buy back stock.
Now, some highlights from the recent quarter. Total revenues for Q4 were $664 million at the high end of our guidance range, sequentially up 5.6% and up 4.2% on a year-over-year basis. Semiconductor revenues for Q4 were $393 million, sequentially up 1% from Q3 and up 3% on a year-over-year basis.
Our Storage Semiconductor revenues were sequentially up $6 million or 3% to $248 million, driven by strength in HDD and SAS. Storage Semiconductors represented 37% of total revenues in the fourth quarter. Q4 revenues in our Networking business were $119 million, sequentially flat to Q3 and represented 18% of total revenues for the quarter. Revenues for the IP business in the fourth quarter were $25 million, in line with our expectations.
Turning now to our Storage Systems business, which includes both external storage systems and server RAID adapters and software. Storage systems revenues were sequentially up 14% to $272 million, a record high for this business. This represented a 6% improvement in systems revenues as compared to Q4 2009. The Storage Systems segment represented 41% of LSI's total revenues in the fourth quarter.
Moving next to gross margins. LSI's consolidated Q4 gross margin, excluding special items, was 48.0%, consistent with the guidance we provided in October. Non-GAAP gross margins were sequentially down 130 basis points from Q3, primarily due to a higher concentration of systems revenues as a percentage of total, along with lower IP revenues and mix within our semiconductor products.
Non-GAAP gross margins improved to 60 basis points compared to the same quarter a year ago. Semiconductor gross margins, excluding special items, were 53.5%, approximately 170 basis points below Q3, again, primarily due to lower IP revenues and product mix. Storage Systems gross margins for the fourth quarter excluding special items sequentially improved 50 basis points to 40.0%.
Moving to operating expenses. R&D together with SG&A expenses, excluding special items, were sequentially up $2 million to $230 million in Q4. Non-GAAP operating margin sequentially improved by approximately 40 basis points to 13.4% or $89 million. We successfully delivered operating margin expansion for three quarters in a row, as we continued to drive progress towards our business model targets. 
Interest income and other net of interest expense excluding special items was approximately $8 million for Q4.
Now let me turn to the special items we recorded in the fourth quarter, which netted to approximately $103 million. During the quarter, we made the decision to terminate several software programs associated with our External Systems business and recorded several charges as a result. These programs were isolated primarily to one customer and unrelated to our current core product offerings. We do not expect any material impact to near-term or future revenues due to these actions.
Special items, primarily non-cash, included approximately $49 million in restructuring and other items, primarily relating to the actions I just mentioned, $40 million in amortization of acquisition-related items and $15 million of stock based compensation expense.
Moving next to tax. For Q4, we recorded a provision of $7 million for both GAAP and non-GAAP. As a reminder, our tax provision on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis can vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter based on our profitability in different geographic tax jurisdictions and discreet items.
On a GAAP basis, fourth quarter net loss was $13 million or $0.02 per share. Net income excluding special items was $90 million, sequentially improving from $0.13 to $0.14 per share. Share count for the period was 617 million shares for GAAP and 626 shares on a non-GAAP basis.
Turning now to cash flows and the balance sheet. Operating cash flows in the fourth quarter were $112 million and $367 million for fiscal 2010. We exited the year with a cash and short-term investments balance of $677 million. During the quarter, we utilized approximately $32 million of cash for share repurchases. During the full year, we repurchased a total of 51 million shares and utilized $250 million under the current share repurchase authorization.
In addition, depreciation and software amortization was $26 million for Q4 and $105 million for fiscal 2010, and capital expenditures were $12 million for the fourth quarter and $52 million for the year.
The following is our guidance for Q1 2011: Revenues in the range of $605 million to $635 million. At the midpoint, this is sequentially down about 7%, following a strong Q4. And this is somewhat better than historical seasonality, which has typically been down on average about 10%. We expect both our Networking Semiconductor and Storage System businesses to be down relative to Q4, while we expect our Storage Semiconductor business to be roughly flat. 
Consolidated gross margin excluding special items is expected to be between 46.5% and 48.5%. We expect gross margins, excluding special items, to be approximately 52% for the Semiconductor segment and approximately 40% for the Systems segment. Operating expenses excluding special items are expected to be in the range of $225 million to $235 million, which is sequentially flat at midpoint.
Interest income and other in interest expense is expected to net to income of approximately $3 million. Special items are expected to net to approximately $40 million to $60 million. The GAAP and non-GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately $7 million for Q1. We expect Q1 GAAP net income per share in the range of negative $0.03 to positive $0.07, and EPS excluding special items to be in the range of $0.07 to $0.13 per share. 
The share count is expected to be approximately 625 million shares for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes. In addition, we expect depreciation and software amortization of approximately $26 million and capital expenditures of approximately $15 million.
Before we go to your questions, I just want to note that the consistent expansion of non-GAAP operating margin throughout 2010 underscores our continued commitment to drive the business model performance. We are running above our business model goals on gross margin and expect to maintain tight control on operating expenses to improve our earnings growth as we demonstrated in 2010.
I would now like to turn the call back to Sujal."

And so, I can certainly offer a perspective for the full year in terms of the market. But clearly, this has been something that we have been something we've been watching very closely, given what the overall industry experienced last year this time in the first half. So we've gone to great lengths to really get as much visibility as we can into our customers' inventories. We've got hubs with all our customers, certainly trying to extract color around the channel inventories and to whatever extent, PC OEM inventories. Taking that into account, as well as placing the TAM for Q1 on the lower end of the spectrum that's been discussed out there from $155 million to $168 million. I've even heard some numbers slightly above that. We're sort of assuming $160 million unit TAM coming into this quarter. And so that's what's kind of modeled into our forecast. We certainly have the ability to respond to a stronger end market, but we decided to put our TAM on the lower-end caution. Relative to storage semi or hard disk drive for the year, we continue to believe that growth in the year is somewhere probably in the mid- to high-single digits in terms of units for hard disk drive. I think that's supported by not only the PC growth, but definitely supported by half the hard disk drive market that has nothing to do with PCs and associated with everything from home to cloud buildout to drives they're making into TVs and set-top boxes and so forth. That part of the hard disk drive market continues to grow at a pretty healthy pace."

In terms of -- from a year-over-year growth rate standpoint, year-over-year growth was pretty impressive as well. But if you look at the overall year, I'll give you a couple of data points that will put that into perspective or the overall Networking business in perspective. Our Legacy business was quite strong in the first half of the year, some of it driven by last-time buys and some of the surge buildout that occurred on some older system products with our customers. The Legacy business did absolutely drop in the second half relative to first half. So that definitely played a bit of a role. But we also saw quite a bit of strength in Q2 and Q3 in our go-forward networking areas that sort of -- that strength sort of subsided a little bit going into Q4. There were also some inventory in Q2 and Q3 that was also worked through in the wireless space, which I think has been fairly well documented out there. So that's how I would provide some color on that. I think the other thing to keep in mind, especially as it pertains to our products versus potentially FPGA, or products of that sort. Our supply line or cycles for our customers in the telecom service provider space typically run anywhere from 12 to 15 months in terms of lead times and so forth. So we are a bit off -- we're a bit pre-shifted relative to what you see in terms of end-system revenue versus a part of revenue.

That consists of a composite of our Semiconductor gross margins, which should be well north of 50% as well as Systems gross margins in the high 30s to about 40%. And again on both sides of this, you've seen that performance and we would expect that opportunities to continue to improve gross margins as we go forward.

Now we'll get even a bigger quarter. With that, we'll continue to see that ramp through this year. We will see other SoCs come into the revenue stream, but that will be, as I pointed earlier, second half as those programs kick in.

From a market-size standpoint, it's about $55 billion to $60 billion in size, many, many different segments. The midrange is the biggest segment in itself, a lot of different product lines, entries growing incredibly fast. My point there is there's a lot of opportunities in that particular overall market segment, opportunities also for our business model in terms of make versus buy. Most OEMs cannot cover the full spectrum. There's probably only one or two companies that have the revenue scale to fulfill all the product segments that they need have to effectively compete, as well as keep building the software position. So the opportunity still remains as it has. In terms of specific opportunities that we're focused on and certainly cultivating and growing, our entry product, as we talked about earlier, is a homerun in terms of value proposition, competitiveness, price performance, and it is the most ubiquitous platform that we've had in our history in terms of number of OEMs and customers buying and shipping this product. And the growth rate in the entry segment is very strong. In terms of customers, we continue to be very focused on helping Oracle leverage our storage system, in particular, around their database and database platform, and their overall strategy for an integrated solution. We've seen that business now grow two quarters in a row. We're seeing a far greater level of focus and intensity in bigger deals going down. So we're excited to continue to see that grow. I think relative to other companies such as Dell, which we had a great relationship and relative to some of the dynamics there, we certainly see opportunities to keep growing our business and help them participate in more and more segments."

I don't have a precise number as to how far we are. But this upgrade cycle started in earnest about the middle of '09 and really kicked into gear as it exited '09 and has been very strong throughout this year. There’s, I think, several things that are going on. There's certainly an upgrade cycle, but there's so many new demands that are driving server growth. Demands associated with data center buildouts that are occurring. We're increasingly participating in data centers through our Channel business. It's selling into the big data centers and sort of dot coms. That buildout continues to happen. There is data center buildout that's taking place relative to even wireless service providers who are increasingly having to deal with data and services to support all the handheld clients from smartphones to now tablets and so forth. There's that buildout that's going on. We're seeing certainly buildout associated with hosting companies, because the hosting space, whether it's Software-as-a-Service or IT hosting, that's also growing.

I'm pleased with how our team executed in Q1 delivering revenue and non-GAAP EPS effectively at the high end of guidance, while continue to drive solid gross margin performance in operating expense control. 
We were very active in buying back stock during the quarter repurchasing 15 million shares. So far, we have utilized only $100 million of our new of $750 million buyback authorization and expect to be aggressive with share repurchases as we move through the year. 
Last month, we announced an agreement to sell our external storage business to NetApp and we expect the transaction to close in the next few weeks. The sale marks a significant milestone in our evolution enabling LSI to transition to a pure play semiconductor company with higher revenue growth, margins and earnings growth potential. 
We are excited by the growth opportunities we have been pursuing in our semi-conductor business and are still only the front edge of new design win rams that we expect to contribute to our top line growth. 
Going forward, we believe we can accelerate the achievement of our current business model established a new richer business model target later in the year and deliver greater long-term shareholder value. 
I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about how investors should think about LSI going forward. We are well-positioned in large growing markets with solid fundamentals and high exposure to increases in business IT spending. Growth in social networking, private and public cloud build outs, the expansion of the mobile Internet and related smartphone tablet services, the rise in video traffic and continued Web commerce growth in emerging markets are some of the major trends feeling growth of servers, storage and networking infrastructure. 
LSI plays a critical role in providing leading products and solution for the storage protection and delivery of digital information and content within this infrastructure. 
Over the last several years, we have been investing ahead of revenue and strengthening our core businesses. We are now emerging from this deep investment cycle with leadership position and expected growth well above end market rates in our served markets. 
We are number one in server and storage fast components, number one in direct attached storage rate adapters and software, number one in fan custom solution, number two in HDD, number two in networking processors, and an leader in flash-oriented solutions for enterprise application. In our served markets, we have established deep incumbency by providing trusted silicon and software solutions that have been hardened over many generation. 
We are positioned for solid operating leverage as revenues grow through share gains and new product cycles. We are committed to achieving our current business model target of 17% non-GAAP operating margins by the end of this year, and expect to communicate a higher, long-term target business model as we move forward. 
In addition, we have a solid balance sheet with no debt and have consistently returning capital to shareholders by buying back stock. We have reduced our outstanding share count by 20% over the past several years and expect to continue to be aggressive in using our current repurchase authorization. 
Now, I want to review additional highlights of our business for Q1. I'll begin with our server and storage-related businesses, which now includes our server RAID adapter and software business in addition to our SAS, fan and HDD businesses. The breath of components in software LSI offers for data protection, management and storage protocol traffic applications in servers and storage is unparalleled in the industry and has often set the cadence and industry standard for such solutions. 
For SAS and servers, we expect to extend our number one position through second-generation, 6-gig design wins across a long list of server OEMs for the upcoming Intel Romley generation. 
In addition, we are now selling solutions to many Web 2.0 and cloud-oriented companies including the leading social networking company. For SAS and external storage, we have been growing and doubled revenue in 2010, achieving 35% share for the sale of our external storage systems business to NetApp enables us to engage more deeply with all the storage system OEMs for additional, fast opportunities. 
In server RAID adapters, our business continues to grow at key OEMs such as IBM, Dell, Cisco, Oracle and ROC as well as the channel. 
Our channel offerings to white box server integrators is a key growth driver through participation in the buildout of mega data centers focused on cloud computing and services. 
Last quarter, we were the first to announce availability of a new RAID adapter solution based upon second-generation 6-gig SAS technology and flash optimized software. 
This product delivers the industry's higher server RAID performance at 465,000 IOPS enabling both the highest performance SSD deployments as well as the best price performance in mix SSD and HDD deployments. 
When it comes to exploiting flash, and enterprise applications, LSI offers a complete, portfolio solutions. Our cascade software which operates in conjunction with our MegaRAID adapters allows servers to easily and efficiently manage flash storage as a secondary as cache within the overall storage system. 
Our SAS Software also operating in conjunction with our MegaRAID adapters enables the industry's highest performance solution using an array of SSDs. Beyond this the introduction of our PCI express base flash adapter called work drive builds out LSI's portfolio solution targeting optimizing storage performance and accelerating applications by utilizing flash. 
Supermicro's, Cisco and SGI have already launched work drive and we are making good progress with additional OEMs and channel partners. 
Turning to hard disk drives, we're solidly positioned to grow SSC share as our solution have become increasingly deployed by both existing and new customers. 
Last quarter, we increased shipments of our SSCs into Seagate Savio and constellation enterprise drives and are now shipping into 4 enterprise platforms. 
Our development milestones continue to be on track and we have now sampled the second-generation 40-nanometer RAID channel across the industry. 
Now, I'd like to review networking business where we continue to experience strong momentum driven by network processors, BSP and customed products that serve the wireless, and enterprise markets. 
In the wireless space, we continue to gain market share and are benefiting from the global expansion of 3G and 4G networks. Our network processors, which are used in wireless access platforms by Ericsson and Nokia Siemens continue to ramp strongly. 
In Q1 we also continue to ramp our customed solution using Huawei base station. In addition, we won a high volume base band processing custom solution on the multi-radio platform of another Tier 1 OEM. 
In the enterprise space, we increased client Gigabit Ethernet via shipments to the leading PC chipset company in Q1, and have extended this revenue stream by winning the next generation design in 40-nanometer technology. In addition to client platforms, we also expect to ship Gigabit Ethernet PHY into platforms for the Romley generation of servers later this year. We also continue to increase shipments to Emulex of 10-gigabit silicon for LAN and motherboard and adapter applications.  
Also in Q1, LSI launched a new power optimized high-performance DSP that extends our leadership in voice and video processing for infrastructure applications. Our DSP volumes continue to ramp in Q1 with Cisco's ISR platform and Ericsson's next-generation mobile media gateway. 
The long-term fundamentals of our business are solid. Our large and growing multiyear design win pipeline continues to move towards and into production, and we continue to deepen our engagements with market-leading customers to establish growth drivers for the future. 
Now, I'll turn the call over to Bryon, who will take you through of results and provide guidance."
30956,129550242,118436,"LSI Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2011",2011-04-27,"Earnings Calls","LSI Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Abhi, and good afternoon, everyone. As mentioned, we ended into a definitive agreement in March to sell our external systems business and are on track to close this transaction in the next few weeks. Accordingly, the financial results and tables i",1071,"Thanks, Abhi, and good afternoon, everyone. As mentioned, we ended into a definitive agreement in March to sell our external systems business and are on track to close this transaction in the next few weeks. Accordingly, the financial results and tables included in our first quarter earnings press release classified this business as a discontinued operation. Since the guidance we provided in January included external systems, I'll provide key results on a comparable basis followed by more detailed financial results for continuing operations only. 
Please note that as we go forward, we are only be providing guidance for continuing operations. Relative to the guidance we provided in January, revenues including external systems were $629 million, $9 million above the midpoint of our guidance and sequentially, down 5.3%. 
Non-GAAP net income including discontinued operations was $82 million or $0.13 per share, $0.03 above midpoint of guidance, primarily as result of higher revenues, a tax benefit in the first quarter and a lower-than-expected operating expenses in continuing operations. 
Now turning to a more detailed discussion on financial results for continuing operations for the quarter beginning with revenues. Q1 revenues were $473 million, up slightly from $471 million in Q4 of 2010 and better than normal seasonality. Our server and storage semiconductor revenues, which include the hard disk drive silicon, SAS standard components, RAID storage adapter and software and storage area network ICs were sequentially up $10 million or 3% to $336 million. 
Server and storage semiconductors represented 71% of total revenues in the first quarter. Q1 revenues in our networking business were $112 million, sequentially down $7 million or 5.7% and represented 24% of total revenues for the quarter. 
Revenues for the IT business were sequentially flat relative to Q4 at $25 million. Moving next to gross margins. LSI's reported Q1 gross margins excluding special items was 52.4%, as you can see, the benefit of the divestiture to the company relative to gross margins is immediately evident. 
Reported gross margins excluding special items are above 52% compared with a consolidated 48% gross margins we reported in Q4. 
Moving to operating expenses. R&D together with SG&A expenses excluding special items totaled $191 million in Q1. Operating expenses were lower-than-expected due to the timing of design takeout and litigation costs, along with some expenses which were classified as discontinued operations in Q1, but will fall into continuing operations going forward. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 12.0% or $57 million. Interest income and other net of interest expense excluding special items was a positive $4 million for Q1. 
Now let me turn to the special items we reported in the first quarter, which netted to $47 million. Special items primarily non-cash included $13 million in amortization of acquisition-related item, $14 million of stock-based compensation expense and $3 million of net restructuring costs and other items. 
Moving next to tax. Our tax provision on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis can vary significantly quarter-to-quarter based on our profitability in different geographic tax jurisdictions and certain discreet items. Such discrete items occurred in Q1 relating to the expiration of certain statutes of limitations and resulted in a net tax benefit of $4.1 million recorded on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.
On a GAAP basis, first quarter income from continuing operations was approximately $19 million or $0.03 per share. Non-GAAP income from continuing operations was $65 million or $0.10 per share. The weighted average share count for the period for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes was 630 million shares. This includes the benefit of purchasing approximately 15 million shares late in the period onto our share repurchase program. 
We utilized approximately $97 million of the $750 million buyback authorization in Q1. And we expect to remain aggressive with share repurchases throughout 2011. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flows. First quarter operating cash flows were $108 million, driven by collections from the seasonally strong fourth quarter. 
Our cash and short-term investments ended the March quarter at approximately $682 million. Even with $97 million of cash being utilized for share repurchases, our net cash position grew slightly from Q4, due to the level of cash provided by operating activities. 
And finally, with respect to Q1 results, depreciation and software amortization was $25 million and capital expenditures were $8 million. 
The following is our guidance for continuing operations in Q2 2011: Revenues in the range of $465 million to $495 million. At the midpoint, this is sequentially up approximately 2%. We expect server and storage semiconductor revenues to be sequentially up in Q2. We expect networking revenues to be sequentially stronger in Q2 as well. Gross margin excluding special items is expected to be between 52% and 54%. Operating expenses excluding special items are expected to be in the range of $190 million to $200 million. 
Interest income and other interest expense excluding special items is expected to income of approximately $5 million. Special items are expected to net to approximately $35 million to $55 million. The GAAP and non-GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately $7 million for Q2. We expect Q2 GAAP income per share from continuing operations in the range of negative $0.02 to positive $0.07, and non-GAAP income from continuing operations in the range of $0.07 to $0.13. 
This share count is expected to be approximately 610 million shares for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes. As we expect to continue to execute on our share purchase program. In addition expect depreciation and software amortization of approximately $17 million, and capital expenditures of approximately $20 million. 
And finally, regarding the tragedy in Japan and its impact on our business, we did not experience any global supply constraint in this most recent quarter. LSI ship less than 2% of its Q1 sales into Japan and we have no manufacturing operations there. So our direct risk is relatively small. We've been working closely with our suppliers and into our guidance we have comprehended any supply related risks. 
As you would expect, there remains an element of risk that one of our customers maybe impacted  by shortages that could affect our business. We're not aware of any such a situation, but we'll continue to monitor this closely. 
As Abhi noted, the long-term fundamentals of our semiconductor businesses is solid, and we are well-positioned as the number one or number two market leader in our served markets. 
And now let me turn the call to Sujal."

During this call, we will be mentioning non-GAAP financial measures, which we may refer to as results excluding special items. Today's earnings release describes the differences between our non-GAAP and GAAP reporting. You can find reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to corresponding GAAP amounts on our website at www.lsi.com/webcast.
At that site, you will also find a copy of the earnings release and a presentation highlighting the key points from today's call and providing an overview of our business. This may be particularly useful to investors who are new to LSI. 
We expect to complete the sale of our External Storage Systems business in the next few weeks. Because of our decision to exit the Storage Systems business, we are reflecting that business as a discontinued operation in our financial statements. 
To facilitate your modeling, we have included on our website historical revenue information for continuing operations by quarter for the years 2008 through 2010. 
I want to remind you that today's remarks will include forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those suggested by the statements made today.

I'm pleased with how our team executed in Q1, delivering revenue and non-GAAP EPS effectively at the high end of guidance, while continuing to drive solid gross margin performance and operating expense control. We were very",1253,"Good afternoon, and welcome. I'm pleased with how our team executed in Q1, delivering revenue and non-GAAP EPS effectively at the high end of guidance, while continuing to drive solid gross margin performance and operating expense control. 
We were very active in buying back stock during the quarter, repurchasing 15 million shares. So far, we have utilized only $100 million of our new $750 million buyback authorization and expect to be aggressive with share repurchases as we move through the year. 
Last month, we announced an agreement to sell our External Storage Systems business to NetApp, and we expect the transaction to close in the next few weeks. The sale marks a significant milestone in our evolution, enabling LSI to transition to a pure play semiconductor company with higher revenue growth, margins and earnings growth potential. 
We are excited by the growth opportunities we have been pursuing in our semi-conductor business and are still only the front edge of new design win ramps that we expect to contribute to our top line growth. 
Going forward, we believe we can accelerate the achievement of our current business model, establish a new richer business model target later in the year and deliver greater long-term shareholder value. 
I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about how investors should think about LSI going forward. We're well positioned in large growing markets, with solid fundamentals and high exposure to increases in business IT spending. Growth in social networking, private and public cloud build outs, the expansion of the mobile Internet and related smartphone tablet services, the rise in video traffic and continued Web commerce growth in emerging markets are some of the major trends filling growth of servers, storage and networking infrastructure. 
LSI plays a critical role in providing leading products and solutions for the storage protection and delivery of digital information and content within this infrastructure. 
Over the last several years, we have been investing ahead of revenue and strengthening our core businesses. We're now emerging from this deep investment cycle with leadership positions and expected growth well above end-market rates in our served markets. 
We are #1 in Server and Storage SAS components, #1 in direct attached storage RAID adapters and software, #1 in SAN custom solutions, #2 in HDD, and #2 in networking processors, and an emerging leader in flash-oriented solutions for enterprise applications. 
In our served markets, we have established deep incumbency by providing trusted silicon and software solutions that have been hardened over many generations. 
We are positioned for solid operating leverage as revenues grow through share gains and new product cycles. We are committed to achieving our current business model target at 17% non-GAAP operating margins by the end of this year, and expect to communicate a higher, long-term target business model as we move forward. 
In addition, we have a solid balance sheet with no debt and have consistently returned capital to shareholders by buying back stock. We have reduced our outstanding share count by 20% over the past several years and expect to continue to be aggressive in using our current repurchase authorization. 
Now, I want to review additional highlights of our business for Q1. I'll begin with our server and storage-related businesses, which now includes our ServeRAID adapter and software business in addition to our SAS, SAN and HDD businesses. The breadth of components and software LSI offers for data protection, management and storage protocol traffic applications in servers and storage is unparalleled in the industry and has often set the cadence and industry standard for such solutions. 
For SAS and servers, we expect to extend our #1 position through second-generation, 6-gig design wins across a long list of server OEMs for the upcoming Intel Romley generation. 
In addition, we are now selling solutions to many Web 2.0 and cloud-oriented companies, including the leading social networking company. For SAS and external storage, we have been growing and doubled revenues in 2010, achieving 35% share. The sale of our External Storage Systems business to NetApp enables us to engage more deeply with all the storage system OEMs for additional SAS opportunities. 
In ServeRAID adapters, our business continues to grow at key OEMs such as IBM, Dell, Cisco, Oracle, NAC as well as the channel.
Our channel offering to white box server integrators is a key growth driver through participation in the build out of mega data centers focused on cloud computing and services. 
Last quarter, we were the first to announce availability of a new RAID adapter solution based upon second-generation 6-gig SAS technology and flash-optimized RAID software. This product delivers the industry's highest ServeRAID performance at 465,000 IOPS, enabling both the highest performance SSD deployments as well as the best-priced performance in mixed SSD and HD deployments. 
When it comes to exploiting flash in enterprise applications, LSI offers a complete portfolio solutions. Our CacheCade software, which operates in conjunction with our MegaRAID adapters, allows servers to easily and efficiently manage flash storage as a secondary cache tier within the overall storage system. 
Our FastPath software, also operating in conjunction with our MegaRAID adapters, enables the industry's highest performance solution using an array of SSDs. Beyond this, the introduction of our PCI Express-based flash adapter, called WarpDrive, builds out LSI's portfolio solutions targeted at optimizing storage performance and accelerating applications by utilizing flash. 
Supermicro, Cisco and SGI have already launched WarpDrive, and we're making good progress with additional OEMs and channel partners. 
Turning to hard disk drives. We're solidly positioned to grow SSC share, as our solutions become increasingly deployed by both existing and new customers. 
Last quarter, we increased shipments of our SSCs in the Seagate Savvio and Constellation enterprise drives and are now shipping into 4 enterprise platforms. 
Our development milestones continue to be on track, and we have now sampled the second-generation 40-nanometer RAID channel across the industry. 
Now, I'd like to review the networking business where we continue to experience strong momentum, driven by network processors, DSP and custom products that serve the wireless, and enterprise markets. 
In the wireless space, we continue to gain market share and are benefiting from the global expansion of 3G and 4G networks. Our network processors, which are used in wireless access platforms by Ericsson and Nokia Siemens continue to ramp strongly. 
In Q1, we also continued to ramp our custom solution using Huawei's base stations. In addition, we won a high-volume baseband processing custom solution on the multi-radio platform of another Tier 1 OEM. 
In the enterprise space, we increased client Gigabit Ethernet via shipments to the leading PC chipset company in Q1, and have extended this revenue stream by winning the next-generation design in 40-nanometer technology. In addition to client platforms, we also expect to ship Gigabit Ethernet PHYs into platforms for the Romley generation of servers later this year. We also continue to increase shipments to Emulex of 10-gigabit silicon for LAN and motherboard and adapter applications.  
Also in Q1, LSI launched a new power optimized high-performance DSP that extends our leadership in voice and video processing for infrastructure applications. Our DSP volumes continue to ramp in Q1 with Cisco's ISR platform and Ericsson's next-generation mobile media gateway. 
The long-term fundamentals of our business are solid. Our large and growing multiyear design win pipeline continues to move towards and into production, and we continue to deepen our engagements with market-leading customers to establish growth drivers for the future. 
Now, I'll turn the call over to Bryon, who will take you through our results and provide guidance."
30956,129550242,118565,"LSI Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2011",2011-04-27,"Earnings Calls","LSI Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Abhi, and good afternoon, everyone. As mentioned, we entered into a definitive agreement in March to sell our External Systems business and are on track to close this transaction in the next few weeks. Accordingly, the financial results and tables",1073,"Thanks, Abhi, and good afternoon, everyone. As mentioned, we entered into a definitive agreement in March to sell our External Systems business and are on track to close this transaction in the next few weeks. Accordingly, the financial results and tables included in our first quarter earnings press release classified this business as a discontinued operation. Since the guidance we provided in January included external systems, I'll provide key results on a comparable basis, followed by a more detailed financial results for continuing operations only. 
Please note that as we go forward, we will only be providing guidance for continuing operations. Relative to the guidance we provided in January, revenues, including external systems, were $629 million, $9 million above the midpoint of our guidance, and sequentially down 5.3%. 
Non-GAAP net income, including discontinued operations, was $82 million or $0.13 per share, $0.03 above midpoint of guidance, primarily as a result of higher revenues, a tax benefit in the first quarter and lower-than-expected operating expenses in continuing operations. 
Now turning to a more detailed discussion on financial results for continuing operations for the quarter, beginning with revenues. Q1 revenues were $473 million, up slightly from $471 million in Q4 of 2010 and better-than-normal seasonality. Our server and storage semiconductor revenues, which include the hard disk drive silicon, SAS standard components, RAID storage adapters and software and storage area network ICs were sequentially up $10 million or 3% to $336 million. 
Server and storage semiconductors represented 71% of total revenues in the first quarter. Q1 revenues in our networking business were $112 million, sequentially down $7 million or 5.7% and represented 24% of total revenues for the quarter. Revenues for the IT business were sequentially flat relative to Q4 at $25 million. 
Moving next to gross margins. LSI's reported Q1 gross margin, excluding special items, was 52.4%. As you can see, the benefit of the divestiture to the company, relative to gross margins, is immediately evident. Reported gross margins, excluding special items, are above 52% compared with the consolidated 48% gross margins we reported in Q4. 
Moving to operating expenses. R&D together with SG&A expenses, excluding special items, totaled $191 million in Q1. Operating expenses were lower-than-expected due to the timing of design tapeouts and litigation costs, along with some expenses which were classified as discontinued operations in Q1, but will fall into continuing operations going forward. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 12.0% or $57 million. Interest income and other, net of interest expense, excluding special items, was a positive $4 million for Q1. 
Now let me turn to the special items we recorded in the first quarter, which netted to $47 million. Special items, primarily noncash, included $30 million in amortization of acquisition-related items, $14 million of stock-based compensation expense and $3 million of net restructuring costs and other items. 
Moving next to tax. Our tax provision on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis can vary significantly quarter-to-quarter based on our profitability in different geographic tax jurisdictions and certain discrete items. Such discrete items occurred in Q1 relating to the expiration of certain statutes of limitations and resulted in a net tax benefit of $4.1 million recorded on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.
On a GAAP basis, first quarter income from continuing operations was approximately $19 million or $0.03 per share. Non-GAAP income from continuing operations was $65 million or $0.10 per share. The weighted average share count for the period for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes was 630 million shares. This includes the benefit of purchasing approximately 15 million shares late in the period onto our share repurchase program. 
We utilized approximately $97 million of the $750 million buyback authorization in Q1. And we expect to remain aggressive with share repurchases throughout 2011. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flows. First quarter operating cash flows were $108 million, driven by collections from the seasonally strong fourth quarter. 
Our cash and short-term investments ended the March quarter at approximately $682 million. Even with $97 million of cash being utilized for share repurchases, our net cash position grew slightly from Q4, due to the level of cash provided by operating activities. 
And finally, with respect to Q1 results, depreciation and software amortization was $25 million and capital expenditures were $8 million. 
The following is our guidance for continuing operations in Q2 2011. Revenues in the range of $465 million to $495 million. At the midpoint, this is sequentially up approximately 2%. We expect server and storage semiconductor revenues to be sequentially up in Q2. We expect networking revenues to be sequentially stronger in Q2 as well. Gross margin, excluding special items, is expected to be between 52% and 54%. Operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be in the range of $190 million to $200 million. 
Interest income and other and interest expense, excluding special items, is expected to net to income of approximately $5 million. Special items are expected to net to approximately $35 million to $55 million. The GAAP and non-GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately $7 million for Q2. We expect Q2 GAAP income per share from continuing operations in the range of negative $0.02 to positive $0.07, and non-GAAP income from continuing operations in the range of $0.07 to $0.13. 
This share count is expected to be approximately 610 million shares for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes, as we expect to continue to execute on our share purchase program. In addition, we expect depreciation and software amortization of approximately $17 million, and capital expenditures of approximately $20 million. 
And finally, regarding the tragedy in Japan and its impact on our business, we did not experience any global supply constraints in this most recent quarter. LSI shipped less than 2% of its Q1 sales into Japan, and we have no manufacturing operations there. So our direct risk is relatively small. We've been working closely with our suppliers. And in our guidance, we have comprehended any supply-related risks. 
As you would expect, there remains an inevitable element of risk that one of our customers may be impacted by shortages that could affect our business. We're not aware of any such situation, but we'll continue to monitor this closely. 
As Abhi noted, the long-term fundamentals of our semiconductor businesses are solid, and we are well positioned as the #1 or #2 market leader in our served markets. 
And now let me turn the call to Sujal."

With me today are Abhi Talwalkar, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bryon Look, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
Abhi will begin the call with some opening remarks and highlights from our business, and then Bryon will provide results for the first quarter and guidance for the second quarter of 2011. 
During this call, we will be mentioning non-GAAP financial measures, which we may refer to as results excluding special items. Today's earnings release describes the differences between our non-GAAP and GAAP reporting. You can find reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to corresponding GAAP amounts on our website at www.lsi.com/webcast.
At that site, you will also find a copy of the earnings release and a presentation highlighting the key points from today's call and providing an overview of our business. This may be particularly useful to investors who are new to LSI. 
We expect to complete the sale of our External Storage Systems business in the next few weeks. Because of our decision to exit the Storage Systems business, we are reflecting that business as a discontinued operation in our financial statements. 
To facilitate your modeling, we have included on our website historical revenue information for continuing operations by quarter for the years 2008 through 2010. 
I want to remind you that today's remarks will include forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those suggested by the statements made today.

I'm pleased with how our team executed in Q1, delivering revenue and non-GAAP EPS effectively at the high end of guidance, while continuing to drive solid gross margin performance and operating expense control. 
We were very active in buying back stock during the quarter, repurchasing 15 million shares. So far, we have utilized only $100 million of our new $750 million buyback authorization and expect to be aggressive with share repurchases as we move through the year. 
Last month, we announced an agreement to sell our External Storage Systems business to NetApp, and we expect the transaction to close in the next few weeks. The sale marks a significant milestone in our evolution, enabling LSI to transition to a pure play semiconductor company with higher revenue growth, margins and earnings growth potential. 
We are excited by the growth opportunities we have been pursuing in our semi-conductor business and are still only at the front edge of new design win ramps that we expect to contribute to our top line growth. 
Going forward, we believe we can accelerate the achievement of our current business model, establish a new richer business model target later in the year and deliver greater long-term shareholder value. 
I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about how investors should think about LSI going forward. We're well positioned in large growing markets, with solid fundamentals and high exposure to increases in business IT spending. Growth in social networking, private and public cloud build outs, the expansion of the mobile Internet and related Smart phone and tablet services, the rise in video traffic and continued Web commerce growth in emerging markets are some of the major trends fueling growth of servers, storage and networking infrastructure. 
LSI plays a critical role in providing leading products and solutions for the storage protection and delivery of digital information and content within this infrastructure. 
Over the last several years, we have been investing ahead of revenue and strengthening our core businesses. We're now emerging from this deep investment cycle with leadership positions and expected growth well above end-market rates in our served markets. 
We are #1 in Server and Storage SAS components, #1 in direct attached storage RAID adapters and software, #1 in SAN custom solutions, #2 in HDD and #2 in networking processors and an emerging leader in flash-oriented solutions for enterprise applications. 
In our served markets, we have established deep incumbency by providing trusted silicon and software solutions that have been hardened over many generations. 
We are positioned for solid operating leverage as revenues grow through share gains and new product cycles. We are committed to achieving our current business model target at 17% non-GAAP operating margins by the end of this year and expect to communicate a higher, long-term target business model as we move forward. 
In addition, we have a solid balance sheet with no debt and have consistently returned capital to shareholders by buying back stock. We have reduced our outstanding share count by 20% over the past several years and expect to continue to be aggressive in using our current repurchase authorization. 
Now, I want to review additional highlights of our business for Q1. I'll begin with our server and storage-related businesses, which now includes our Server RAID adapter and software business in addition to our SAS, SAN and HDD businesses. The breadth of components and software LSI offers for data protection, management and storage protocol traffic applications in servers and storage is unparalleled in the industry and has often set the cadence and industry standard for such solutions. 
For SAS and servers, we expect to extend our #1 position through second generation, 6-gig design wins across a long list of server OEMs for the upcoming Intel Romley generation. 
In addition, we are now selling solutions to many Web 2.0 and cloud-oriented companies, including the leading social networking company. For SAS and external storage, we have been growing and doubled revenues in 2010, achieving 35% share. The sale of our External Storage Systems business to NetApp enables us to engage more deeply with all the storage system OEMs for additional SAS opportunities. 
In Server RAID adapters, our business continues to grow at key OEMs such as IBM, Dell, Cisco, Oracle and NEC as well as the channel.
Our channel offering to white box server integrators is a key growth driver through participation in the build out of mega data centers focused on cloud computing and services. 
Last quarter, we were the first to announce availability of a new RAID adapter solution based upon second generation 6-gig SAS technology and flash-optimized RAID software. This product delivers the industry's highest Server RAID performance at 465,000 IOPS, enabling both the highest performance SSD deployments as well as the best-priced performance in mixed SSD and HDD deployments. 
When it comes to exploiting flash in enterprise applications, LSI offers a complete portfolio solutions. Our CacheCade software, which operates in conjunction with our MegaRAID adapters, allows servers to easily and efficiently manage flash storage as a secondary cache tier within the overall storage system. 
Our FastPath software, also operating in conjunction with our MegaRAID adapters, enables the industry's highest performance solution using an array of SSDs. Beyond this, the introduction of our PCI Express-based flash adapter, called WarpDrive, builds out LSI's portfolio solutions targeted at optimizing storage performance and accelerating applications by utilizing flash. 
Supermicro, Cisco and SGI have already launched WarpDrive, and we're making good progress with additional OEMs and channel partners. 
Turning to hard disk drives. We're solidly positioned to grow SoC share, as our solutions become increasingly deployed by both existing and new customers. 
Last quarter, we increased shipments of our SoCs in the Seagate, Savvio and Constellation enterprise drives and are now shipping into 4 enterprise platforms. 
Our development milestones continue to be on track, and we have now sampled a second generation 40-nanometer Read channel across the industry. 
Now, I'd like to review the networking business where we continue to experience strong momentum, driven by network processors, DSPs and custom products that serve the wireless and enterprise markets. 
In the wireless space, we continue to gain market share and are benefiting from the global expansion of 3G and 4G networks. Our network processors, which are used in wireless access platforms by Ericsson and Nokia Siemens continue to ramp strongly. 
In Q1, we also continued to ramp our custom solution using Huawei's base stations. In addition, we won a high-volume baseband processing custom solution on the multi-radio platform of another Tier 1 OEM. 
In the enterprise space, we increased client Gigabit Ethernet PHY shipments to the leading PC chipset company in Q1, and have extended this revenue stream by winning the next generation design in 40-nanometer technology. In addition to client platforms, we also expect to ship Gigabit Ethernet PHYs into platforms for the Romley generation of servers later this year. We also continue to increase shipments to Emulex of 10-gigabit silicon for LAN and motherboard and adapter applications.  
Also in Q1, LSI launched a new power optimized high-performance DSP that extends our leadership in voice and video processing for infrastructure applications. Our DSP volumes continue to ramp in Q1 with Cisco's ISR platform and Ericsson's next generation mobile media gateway. 
The long-term fundamentals of our business are solid. Our large and growing multiyear design win pipeline continues to move towards and into production, and we continue to deepen our engagements with market-leading customers to establish growth drivers for the future. 
Now, I'll turn the call over to Bryon, who will take you through our results and provide guidance."

As mentioned, we entered into a definitive agreement in March to sell our External Systems business and are on track to close this transaction in the next few weeks. Accordingly, the financial results and tables",1073,"Thanks, Abhi, and good afternoon, everyone. As mentioned, we entered into a definitive agreement in March to sell our External Systems business and are on track to close this transaction in the next few weeks. Accordingly, the financial results and tables included in our first quarter earnings press release classify this business as a discontinued operation. Since the guidance we provided in January included external systems, I'll provide key results on a comparable basis, followed by more detailed financial results for continuing operations only. 
Please note that as we go forward, we will only be providing guidance for continuing operations. Relative to the guidance we provided in January, revenues, including external systems, were $629 million, $9 million above the midpoint of our guidance, and sequentially down 5.3%. 
Non-GAAP net income, including discontinued operations, was $82 million or $0.13 per share, $0.03 above midpoint of guidance, primarily as a result of higher revenues, a tax benefit in the first quarter and lower-than-expected operating expenses in continuing operations. 
Now turning to a more detailed discussion on financial results for continuing operations for the quarter, beginning with revenues. Q1 revenues were $473 million, up slightly from $471 million in Q4 of 2010 and better-than-normal seasonality. Our server and storage semiconductor revenues, which include hard disk drive silicon, SAS standard components, RAID storage adapters and software and storage area network ICs were sequentially up $10 million or 3% to $336 million. 
Server and storage semiconductors represented 71% of total revenues in the first quarter. Q1 revenues in our networking business were $112 million, sequentially down $7 million or 5.7% and represented 24% of total revenues for the quarter. Revenues for the IT business were sequentially flat relative to Q4 at $25 million. 
Moving next to gross margins. LSI's reported Q1 gross margin, excluding special items, was 52.4%. As you can see, the benefit of the divestiture to the company, relative to gross margins, is immediately evident. Reported gross margins, excluding special items, are above 52% compared with the consolidated 48% gross margins we reported in Q4. 
Moving to operating expenses. R&D together with SG&A expenses, excluding special items, totaled $191 million in Q1. Operating expenses were lower than expected due to the timing of design tapeouts and litigation costs, along with some expenses which were classified as discontinued operations in Q1, but will fall into continuing operations going forward. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 12.0% or $57 million. Interest income and other, net of interest expense, excluding special items, was a positive $4 million for Q1. 
Now let me turn to the special items we recorded in the first quarter, which netted to $47 million. Special items, primarily noncash, included $30 million in amortization of acquisition-related items, $14 million of stock-based compensation expense and $3 million of net restructuring costs and other items. 
Moving next to tax. Our tax provision on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis can vary significantly quarter-to-quarter based on our profitability in different geographic tax jurisdictions and certain discrete items. Such discrete items occurred in Q1 relating to the expiration of certain statutes of limitations and resulted in a net tax benefit of $4.1 million recorded on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.
On a GAAP basis, first quarter income from continuing operations was approximately $19 million or $0.03 per share. Non-GAAP income from continuing operations was $65 million or $0.10 per share. The weighted average share count for the period for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes was 630 million shares. This includes the benefit of purchasing approximately 15 million shares late in the period under our share repurchase program. 
We utilized approximately $97 million of the $750 million buyback authorization in Q1. And we expect to remain aggressive with share repurchases throughout 2011. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flows. First quarter operating cash flows were $108 million, driven by collections from the seasonally strong fourth quarter. 
Our cash and short-term investments ended the March quarter at approximately $682 million. Even with $97 million of cash being utilized for share repurchases, our net cash position grew slightly from Q4, due to the level of cash provided by operating activities. 
And finally, with respect to Q1 results, depreciation and software amortization was $25 million and capital expenditures were $8 million. 
The following is our guidance for continuing operations in Q2 2011. Revenues in the range of $465 million to $495 million. At the midpoint, this is sequentially up approximately 2%. We expect server and storage semiconductor revenues to be sequentially up in Q2. We expect networking revenues to be sequentially stronger in Q2 as well. Gross margin, excluding special items, is expected to be between 52% and 54%. Operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be in the range of $190 million to $200 million. 
Interest income and other and interest expense, excluding special items, is expected to net to income of approximately $5 million. Special items are expected to net to approximately $35 million to $55 million. The GAAP and non-GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately $7 million for Q2. We expect Q2 GAAP income per share from continuing operations in the range of negative $0.02 to positive $0.07, and non-GAAP income from continuing operations in the range of $0.07 to $0.13. 
The share count is expected to be approximately 610 million shares for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes, as we expect to continue to execute on our share repurchase program. In addition, we expect depreciation and software amortization of approximately $17 million and capital expenditures of approximately $20 million. 
And finally, regarding the tragedy in Japan and its impact on our business, we did not experience any global supply constraints in this most recent quarter. LSI shipped less than 2% of its Q1 sales into Japan, and we have no manufacturing operations there. So our direct risk is relatively small. We've been working closely with our suppliers. And in our guidance, we have comprehended any supply-related risk. 
As you would expect, there remains an inevitable element of risk that one of our customers may be impacted by shortages that could affect our business. We're not aware of any such situation, but we'll continue to monitor this closely. 
As Abhi noted, the long-term fundamentals of our semiconductor businesses are solid, and we are well positioned as the #1 or #2 market leader in our served markets. 
And now let me turn the call to Sujal."

There's certainly a debate out there relative to where the PC TAM is going to end up, which is certainly a big factor for the hard disk drive TAM. And also, there's been some color provided relative to the tragedy in Japan and the impact it might have in terms of building out complete drives. So a lot of moving parts and a lot of ambiguity. In terms of how we're thinking about it, relative to Q2, we're basically assuming that TAM is going to be flat to Q1, roughly 159 million to 160 million units or so. We do expect growth obviously in the second half and assume that we'll see return to normal seasonality, but Q3 still is a bit unpredictable. Again, largely tied to the supply issues."

As you know, over the past several years, LSI has been undergoing a vast transformation. We've been investing ahead of revenue to strengthen our core businesses while divesting businesses with lower profitability and growth profiles. The net result is that LSI's position to deliver above market growth generate greater profitability and increased shareholder value. We're now entering a new, exciting phase in the evolution of the company where we are driving top line and bottom line growth, as our design win pipeline of new products begins to materialize in the revenue. Our Q2 revenues and guidance for Q3 begin to reflect share gains and new program ramps at new and existing customers. 
We executed solidly in Q2 with revenues above the high end of guidance, driven by strength in our HDD and Networking businesses. We're also active in buying back stock during the quarter, repurchasing 42 million shares. Year-to-date, we have now repurchased a total of 56 million shares and expect to continue to be aggressive with share repurchases as we move through the year. Our revenue guidance for Q3 represents 10% sequential growth from Q2. While there is uncertainty in the macro environment and demand outlook for certain segments, we have factored in various inventory puts and takes and are comfortable with our growth projections for Q3. 
Our growth is being driven by increases in our Hard Disk Drive business, where we are seeing the materialization of share gains in existing client and enterprise platforms, as well as the launch of new client SoC programs in existing customers. We are also expecting strong growth from SAS and network from products in Q3. We have been talking for some time about our rich design win pipeline and we are now beginning to see its impact as we are expecting. 
We remain committed to driving earnings growth and getting to our current business model target. The midpoint of our guidance suggests that we will generate approximately 15% non-GAAP operating margins in Q3, representing a 270 basis points sequential expansion from Q2 and demonstrating the earnings leverage we have created. 
Going forward, we believe LSI is well-positioned in large, growing markets with solid fundamentals. We expect to benefit from growth in the deployment of servers, storage and networking equipment. This is being driven by major trends such as wireless infrastructure build outs supporting rich mobile clients and mobile Internet growth, the growth and adoption of commercial and private clouds, large build outs supporting social networking and new emerging web platforms, as well as continuing growth in data and video traffic. The vast majority of LSI's business is influenced by business and service provider IT spending, which is benefiting from strong corporate balance sheets and the need for companies to use IT technology to stay competitive. 
Now on to review additional business highlights for Q2. I'll begin with our Server and Storage-related businesses which include our SAS, ServeRAID app software, SAN and HDD businesses. 
Based on our demand forecast, visibility into various end customers and earnings releases by peers' serving enterprise IT markets, data center growth incorporate upgrades in areas of server compute and data storage continue to show seasonal patterns going into the second half, which is typically up from the first half. 
For SAS and Servers, we have been awarded a 6-gig Controller design on HP's Romley generation of servers, which begin shipping at end of this year. This will expand our customer base to include all top 10 server OEMs for 6-gig SAS solutions when the industry transitions to Romley in 2012. Earlier this week, LSI announced that it was the first in the industry to sample next generation 12-gig SAS RoHS Controllers and Expanders to major server OEMs, underscoring our clear readership in SAS. We believe we're 6 months ahead of our nearest competition for 12-gig SAS. Our performance and timely market leadership will enable us to grow share in the Romley generation and expand it further when 12-gig SAS begins shipping in server adapters in late 2012 and subsequently in other motherboard in 2013. 
In Server RAID, we have captured a number of Web 2.0 data center wins and our business continues to grow at key OEMs such as IBM, Dell, Cisco and Oracle. Our channel business, which serves end customers through distributors and resellers, has been a great avenue for us to participate in the build out of Web 2.0 platforms in the cloud. LSI products are being used by the likes of Amazon, Blackspace, Akamai, Google and various others. 
Flash is becoming a quite exciting area, and we are experiencing a high level of customer activity. We are expanding and increasing focus on Storage and Server application acceleration, bringing the performance advantages of been NAN flash to enterprise storage, server and networking applications. We're developing and delivering both software- and hardware-based solutions. LSI's CacheCade software, which accelerates application performance by intelligently placing more frequently used data into the higher performance SSD layer, is now being offered by both Dell and IBM. 
We are also seeing significant customer activity with our PCI Express-based flash adapters, called WarpDrive, recently securing a design with another Tier 1 storage system OEM. The WarpDrive card plugged into a standard PCI slot in a server to maximize the transactional I/O performance of applications such as Web serving, data warehousing and data mining. WarpDrive is enabled by LSI's industry-leading SAS Controller. As the market leader in SAS with established relationships with the top server OEMs, WarpDrive is a natural adjacent product, allowing customers to utilize WarpDrive's flash capability within a familiar and well-supported LSI SAS ecosystem. We expect to continue to build our design win funnel for WarpDrive through 2011, with revenue contributions beginning in 2012. 
With our custom silicon capability, we have numerous SSD Controllers at various phases of development and qualification. We have recently secured additional wins for next-generation 12-gig SAS flash controllers with key players in the SSD space. 
In Hard Disk Drives, we saw TAM expansion from Q1 to Q2 and growth from our customers. We are seeing the materialization of share gains across both client and enterprise platforms. In fact, we set new quarterly unit shipment and revenue records for both SoCs and preamps in the second quarter and are expecting additional growth in the second half of this year. 
In addition, our development milestones continue to be on track, and we have now entered volume production on our second generation of 40-nanometer SoCs, which is a proof point of our technology in execution. 
Now I'd like to review the Networking business, where we continue to experience strong momentum driven by wireless infrastructure build outs, growth in video traffic and upgrades to enterprise networks. 
Given its future potential, wireless has been a key focus for us as we try to maximize LSI's footprint in base stations and wireless backing infrastructure. Our offering of advanced network and communication processors, multi-service processors, DSPs and custom silicon has enabled us to win meaningful positions across all top 5 wireless equipment providers namely, Ericsson, Nokia Siemens, Huawei, Alcatel-Lucent and ZTE. 
Our wireless-related revenues have been growing, led by successful growth of Ericsson and Nokia Siemens base stations. We are also benefiting from new ramps of custom products for key base station functions within Huawei's and ZTE's offerings. In terms of new wins at top 5 OEMs, we have secured both standard product and custom product wins which position us well to increase our dollar content in base stations going forward. A key milestone is the adoption of our multicore communications processor by top wireless equipment vendors such as Ericsson. Building upon our very successful network processor heritage, which addresses the data plane market, our multicore product extends our reach into the adjacent communications processor market, which addresses the control plane. Our multicore processor offers industry-leading control plane and transport processing for multi-radio base stations in a single SoC and will start contributing to revenues in 2012. 
In the Enterprise space, we again increased client Gigabit Ethernet PHY shipments to the leading PC chipset company in Q2, and expect to ship an integrated single-chip Ethernet PHY and Controller into platforms for the Romley generation of servers later this year. 
Before I turn the call over to Bryon, I just want to reiterate that we are now entering an exciting time for LSI, where we are well-positioned to increase shareholder value. We're excited about the broad customer activity we are seeing across multiple product lines, growth of share in key businesses and the top line growth we expect to generate. 
Now let me hand the call over to Bryon, who will go through our financial details."

As a reminder, LSI completed the sale of its External Storage Systems business to NetApp on May 6, 2011. The financial results of the External Systems business have been classified as Discontinued Operations in LSI's financial statements. 
Our ongoing business is referred to as Continuing Operations. The results we are covering, as well as our guidance for Q3, will be for continuing operations. 
Now turning to our financial results for the quarter, beginning with revenues. 
Q2 revenues were $501 million, sequentially up 6% from $473 million, and above the high end of our guidance range. Our Networking Semiconductor and Server and Storage Semiconductor businesses performed well, relative to expectations, and delivered solid quarters, representing sequential growth from Q1. Our Server and Storage Semiconductor revenues, which includes products from our Server RAID adapter and software, SAS, SAN and HDD businesses, was sequentially up $23 million or 7% to $359 million. Server and Storage semiconductors represented 72% of total revenues in the second quarter. Q2 revenues in our Networking business were $117 million, sequentially up $5 million or 4%, and represented 23% of total revenues for the quarter. 
Revenues for the IP business were relatively flat sequentially at $24 million. 
Moving next to gross margins. LSI's Q2 gross margin, excluding special items, was 51.9%. Gross margins were sequentially down approximately 50 basis points. Contributing to this decline were unexpected costs associated with manufacturing scrap, along with higher gold prices. 
Moving next to operating expenses. R&D, together with SG&A expenses excluding special items, totaled $198 million in Q2, following a lower-than-expected spending level in Q1. Operating expenses were within the Q2 guidance range, with the sequential increase primarily being driven by compensation, along with increased litigation costs. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 12.4% or $62 million. Interest income and other, net of interest expense excluding special items, was $6 million for Q2. 
Now let me turn to the special items we recorded in the second quarter which netted to $31 million. Special items, primarily noncash, included $29 million in amortization of acquisition-related items, $14 million of stock-based compensation expense and offset by a net $11 million favorable amount associated with restructuring costs and other items. 
Moving next to tax. Our tax provision, on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, can vary significantly quarter-to-quarter based on our profitability in different geographic tax jurisdictions and certain discrete items. The tax provision for Q2 was $9 million. 
On a GAAP basis, the second quarter income from continuing operations was approximately $28 million or $0.05 per share. Second quarter GAAP net income, which includes income from discontinued operations, was approximately $0.48 per share, primarily due to the gain we recorded relating to the sale of External Systems business. Non-GAAP income from continuing operations was $60 million or $0.10 per share. The weighted average share count for the period, for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes, was 611 million shares. This includes the weighted average benefit of purchasing approximately 42 million shares during the period under our share repurchase program. We utilized approximately $397 million of our current $750 million buyback authorization in the first half of the year, and we expect to remain aggressive with share repurchases. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flows. Operating cash flows for Q2 were $38 million, and $146 million for the first half of 2011. Operating cash flows were sequentially down from the first quarter, primarily due to the effects associated with the sale of the External Systems business, along with some inventory pre-builds we completed in Q2 in support of expected Q3 growth. Cash and short-term investments ended the June quarter at approximately $907 million, up 33% from Q1. 
Finally, with respect to Q2 results, depreciation and software amortization was $17 million, and capital expenditures were $15 million. 
The following is our guidance for continuing operations in Q3 2011. Revenues in the range of $535 million to $565 million, which will represent a 10% sequential increase at midpoint. We expect both our Server and Storage Semiconductor and Networking Semiconductor businesses to deliver sequentially higher revenues in Q3. Gross margin, excluding special items, is expected to be roughly flat at 52%, plus or minus 1%. Operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be in the range of $198 million to $208 million. Interest income and others, and interest expense excluding special items, is expected to net to income of approximately $5 million. Special items are expected to net to approximately $35 million to $55 million. 
The GAAP and non-GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately $10 million for Q3. We expect Q3 GAAP income per share from continuing operations in the range of $0.01 to $0.11, and non-GAAP income from continuing operations in the range of $0.11 to $0.17. The share count is expected to be approximately 575 million shares for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes, as we expect to continue to execute on our share repurchase program. In addition, we expect depreciation and software amortization of approximately $16 million and capital expenditures of approximately $20 million. 
In closing, we delivered solid revenues in non-GAAP operating margins in Q2, while positioning ourselves for strong revenue growth and significant non-GAAP operating margin expansion in Q3.

In terms of Server and Storage-related spending, I guess we would characterize it as modest seasonality, which is Q3 is up from Q2.

As you know, over the past several years, LSI has been undergoing a vast transformation. We've been investing ahead of revenue to strengthen our core businesses while divesting businesses with lower profitability and growth profiles. The net result is that LSI's positioned to deliver above market growth, generate greater profitability and increased shareholder value. We're now entering a new, exciting phase in the evolution of the company where we are driving top line and bottom line growth, as our design win pipeline of new products begins to materialize into revenue. Our Q2 revenues and guidance for Q3 begin to reflect share gains and new program ramps at new and existing customers. 
We executed solidly in Q2 with revenues above the high end of guidance, driven by strength in our HDD and Networking businesses. We're also active in buying back stock during the quarter, repurchasing 42 million shares. Year to date, we have now repurchased a total of 56 million shares and expect to continue to be aggressive with share repurchases as we move through the year. Our revenue guidance for Q3 represents 10% sequential growth from Q2. While there is uncertainty in the macro environment and demand outlook for certain segments, we have factored in various inventory puts and takes and are comfortable with our growth projections for Q3. 
Our growth is being driven by increases in our Hard Disk Drive business, where we are seeing the materialization of share gains in existing client and enterprise platforms, as well as the launch of new client SoC programs with existing customers. We're also expecting strong growth in SAS and networking state [ph] products in Q3. We have been talking for some time about our rich design win pipeline and we are now beginning to see its impact as we were expecting. 
We remain committed to driving earnings growth and getting to our current business model target. The midpoint of our guidance suggests that we will generate approximately 15% non-GAAP operating margins in Q3, representing a 270 basis point sequential expansion from Q2 and demonstrating the earnings leverage we have created. 
Going forward, we believe LSI is well positioned in large, growing markets with solid fundamentals. We expect to benefit from growth in the deployment of servers, storage and networking equipment. This is being driven by major trends such as wireless infrastructure build outs supporting rich mobile clients and mobile Internet growth, the growth in adoption of commercial and private clouds, large build outs supporting social networking and new emerging web platforms, as well as continuing growth in data and video traffic. The vast majority of LSI's business is influenced by business and service provider IT spending, which is benefiting from strong corporate balance sheets and the need for companies to use IT technology to stay competitive. 
Now on to review additional business highlights for Q2. I'll begin with our Server and Storage-related businesses which include our SAS, ServeRAID adapter and software, SAN and HDD businesses.  Based on our demand forecast, visibility into various end customers and earnings releases by peers serving enterprise IT markets, data center growth incorporate upgrades in areas of server compute and data storage continue to show seasonal patterns going into the second half, which is typically up from the first half. 
For SAS and Servers, we have been awarded a 6-gig controller design on HP's Romley generation of servers, which begin shipping at end of this year. This will expand our customer base to include all top 10 server OEMs for 6-gig SAS solutions when the industry transitions to Romley in 2012. Earlier this week, LSI announced that it was the first in the industry to sample the next generation 12-gig SAS ROCs controllers and expanders to major server OEMs, underscoring our clear leadership in SAS. We believe we're 6 months ahead of our nearest competition for 12-gig SAS. Our performance and timely market leadership will enable us to grow share in the Romley generation and extend it further when 12-gig SAS begins shipping in server adapters in late 2012 and subsequently in other motherboard in 2013. 
In ServeRAID, we have captured a number of Web 2.0 data center wins and our business continues to grow at key OEMs such as IBM, Dell, Cisco and Oracle. Our Channel business, which serves end customers through distributors and resellers, has been a great avenue for us to participate in the build out of Web 2.0 platforms in the cloud. LSI products are being used by the likes of Amazon, Rackspace, Akamai, Google and numerous others. 
Flash is becoming a quite exciting area, and we are experiencing a high level of customer activity. We're expanding and increasing focus in storage and server application acceleration, bringing the performance advantages of been NAND flash to enterprise storage, server and networking applications. We're developing and delivering both software- and hardware-based solutions. LSI's CacheCade software, which accelerates application performance by intelligently placing more frequently used data into the higher performance SSD layer, is now being offered by both Dell and IBM. 
We are also seeing significant customer activity with our PCI Express-based flash adapters, called WarpDrive, recently securing a design with another Tier 1 storage system OEM. The WarpDrive card plugs into a standard PCI slot in a server to maximize the transactional I/O performance of applications such as Web serving, data warehousing and data mining. WarpDrive is enabled by LSI's industry-leading SAS controller. As the market leader in SAS with established relationships with the top server OEMs, WarpDrive is a natural adjacent product allowing customers to utilize WarpDrive's flash capability within a familiar and well-supported LSI SAS ecosystem. We expect to continue to build our design win funnel for WarpDrive through 2011, with revenue contributions beginning in 2012. 
With our custom silicon capability, we have numerous SSD Controllers at various phases of development and qualification. We have recently secured additional wins for next-generation 12-gig SAS flash controllers with key players in the SSD space. 
In Hard Disk Drives, we saw TAM expansion from Q1 to Q2 and growth from our customers. We are seeing the materialization of share gains across both client and enterprise platforms. In fact, we set new quarterly unit shipment and revenue records for both SoCs and preamps in the second quarter and are expecting additional growth in the second half of this year.  In addition, our development milestones continue to be on track, and we have now entered volume production on our second generation of 40-nanometer SoCs, which is a proof point of our technology and execution. 
Now I'd like to review the Networking business, where we continue to experience strong momentum driven by wireless infrastructure build outs, growth in video traffic and upgrades to enterprise networks.  Given its future potential, wireless has been a key focus for us as we drive to maximize LSI's footprint in base stations and wireless back-end infrastructure. Our offering of advanced network and communication processors, multi-service processors, DSPs and custom silicon has enabled us to win meaningful positions across all top 5 wireless equipment providers namely, Ericsson, Nokia Siemens, Huawei, Alcatel-Lucent and ZTE. 
Our wireless-related revenues have been growing, led by successful growth of Ericsson and Nokia Siemens base stations. We're also benefiting from new ramps of custom products for key base station functions within Huawei's and ZTE's offerings. In terms of new wins at top 5 OEMs, we have secured both standard product and custom product wins which position us well to increase our dollar content in base stations going forward. A key milestone is the adoption of our multi-core communications processor by top wireless equipment vendors such as Ericsson. Building upon our very successful network processor heritage, which addresses the data plane market, our multi-core product extends our reach into the adjacent communications processor market, which addresses the control plane. Our multi-core processor offers industry-leading control plane and transport processing for multi-radio base stations in a single SoC and will start contributing to revenues in 2012. 
In the enterprise space, we again increased client Gigabit Ethernet PHY shipments to the leading PC chipset company in Q2, and expect to ship an integrated single-chip Ethernet PHY and controller into platforms for the Romley generation of servers later this year. 
Before I turn the call over to Bryon, I just want to reiterate that we are now entering an exciting time for LSI, where we are well positioned to increase shareholder value. We're excited about the broad customer activity we are seeing across multiple product lines, growth of share in key businesses and the top line growth we expect to generate. 
Now let me hand the call over to Bryon, who will go through our financial details."
30956,137068026,147399,"LSI Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2011",2011-07-27,"Earnings Calls","LSI Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Abhi, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, LSI completed the sale of its External Storage Systems business to NetApp on May 6, 2011.

As a reminder, LSI completed the sale of its External Storage Systems business to NetApp on May 6, 2011. The financial results of the External Systems business have been classified as Discontinued Operations in LSI's financial statements.  Our ongoing business is referred to as Continuing Operations. The results we are covering, as well as our guidance for Q3, will be for continuing operations. 
Now turning to our financial results for the quarter, beginning with revenues.  Q2 revenues were $501 million, sequentially up 6% from $473 million, and above the high end of our guidance range. Our Networking Semiconductor and Server and Storage Semiconductor businesses performed well relative to expectations and delivered solid quarters, representing sequential growth from Q1. Our Server and Storage Semiconductor revenues, which includes products from our ServeRAID adapter and software, SAS, SAN and HDD businesses, were sequentially up $23 million or 7% to $359 million. Server and Storage semiconductors represented 72% of total revenues in the second quarter. Q2 revenues in our Networking business were $117 million, sequentially up $5 million or 4%, and represented 23% of total revenues for the quarter. Revenues for the IP business were relatively flat sequentially at $24 million. 
Moving next to gross margins. LSI's Q2 gross margin, excluding special items, was 51.9%. Gross margins were sequentially down approximately 50 basis points. Contributing to this decline were unexpected costs associated with manufacturing scrap, along with higher gold prices. 
Moving next to operating expenses. R&D, together with SG&A expenses excluding special items, totaled $198 million in Q2, following a lower-than-expected spending level in Q1. Operating expenses were within the Q2 guidance range, with the sequential increase primarily being driven by compensation, along with increased litigation costs. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 12.4% or $62 million. Interest income and other, net of interest expense excluding special items, was $6 million for Q2. 
Now let me turn to the special items we recorded in the second quarter which netted to $31 million. Special items, primarily noncash, included $29 million in amortization of acquisition-related items, $14 million of stock-based compensation expense and offset by a net $11 million favorable amount associated with restructuring costs and other items. 
Moving next to tax. Our tax provision, on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, can vary significantly quarter-to-quarter based on our profitability in different geographic tax jurisdictions and certain discrete items. The tax provision for Q2 was $9 million. 
On a GAAP basis, the second quarter income from continuing operations was approximately $28 million or $0.05 per share. Second quarter GAAP net income, which includes income from discontinued operations, was approximately $0.48 per share, primarily due to the gain we recorded relating to the sale of the External Systems business. Non-GAAP income from continuing operations was $60 million or $0.10 per share. The weighted average share count for the period, for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes, was 611 million shares. This includes the weighted average benefit of purchasing approximately 42 million shares during the period under our share repurchase program. We utilized approximately $397 million of our current $750 million buyback authorization in the first half of the year, and we expect to remain aggressive with share repurchases. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flows. Operating cash flows for Q2 were $38 million, and $146 million for the first half of 2011. Operating cash flows were sequentially down from the first quarter, primarily due to the effects associated with the sale of the External Systems business, along with some inventory pre-builds we completed in Q2 in support of expected Q3 growth. Cash and short-term investments ended the June quarter at approximately $907 million, up 33% from Q1. Finally, with respect to Q2 results, depreciation and software amortization was $17 million, and capital expenditures were $15 million. 
The following is our guidance for continuing operations in Q3 2011. Revenues in the range of $535 million to $565 million, which would represent a 10% sequential increase at midpoint. We expect both our Server and Storage Semiconductor and Networking Semiconductor businesses to deliver sequentially higher revenues in Q3. Gross margin, excluding special items, is expected to be roughly flat at 52%, plus or minus 1%. Operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be in the range of $198 million to $208 million. Interest income and others, and interest expense excluding special items, is expected to net to income of approximately $5 million. Special items are expected to net to approximately $35 million to $55 million. 
The GAAP and non-GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately $10 million for Q3. We expect Q3 GAAP income per share from continuing operations in the range of $0.01 to $0.11, and non-GAAP income from continuing operations in the range of $0.11 to $0.17. The share count is expected to be approximately 575 million shares for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes, as we expect to continue to execute on our share repurchase program. In addition, we expect depreciation and software amortization of approximately $16 million and capital expenditures of approximately $20 million. 
In closing, we delivered solid revenues in non-GAAP operating margins in Q2, while positioning ourselves for strong revenue growth and significant non-GAAP operating margin expansion in Q3. 
And now, let me turn the call to Sujal."

In terms of what macro aspects have been factored into our forecast, I'll give you the various data points. Relative to the HDD TAM, we're factoring in what our largest HDD customer had sort of disclosed in their earnings call, a TAM of about $165 million to $170 million, which I think is sort of consistent with also where some of the PC forecasts have been, given the softness in terms of U.S. and mature market consumer retail, where PC's annual growth is probably around the mid-single digits sort of level. In terms of server- and storage-related spending, I guess we would characterize it as modest seasonality, which is Q3 is up from Q2. But again, nothing inconsistent from what we're seeing from both our major customers, the likes of IBM, Intel, from a server standpoint.

As you know, over the past several years, LSI has been undergoing a vast transformation. We've been investing ahead of revenue to strengthen our core businesses while divesting businesses with lower profitability and growth profiles. The net result is that LSI's positioned to deliver above market growth, generate greater profitability and increased shareholder value. We're now entering a new, exciting phase in the evolution of the company where we are driving top line and bottom line growth, as our design win pipeline of new products begins to materialize into revenue. Our Q2 revenues and guidance for Q3 begin to reflect share gains and new program ramps at new and existing customers. 
We executed solidly in Q2 with revenues above the high end of guidance, driven by strength in our HDD and Networking businesses. We're also active in buying back stock during the quarter, repurchasing 42 million shares. Year to date, we have now repurchased a total of 56 million shares and expect to continue to be aggressive with share repurchases as we move through the year. Our revenue guidance for Q3 represents 10% sequential growth from Q2. While there is uncertainty in the macro environment and demand outlook for certain segments, we have factored in various inventory puts and takes and are comfortable with our growth projections for Q3. 
Our growth is being driven by increases in our Hard Disk Drive business, where we are seeing the materialization of share gains in existing client and enterprise platforms, as well as the launch of new client SoC programs with existing customers. We're also expecting strong growth in SAS and networking state [ph] products in Q3. We have been talking for some time about our rich design win pipeline and we are now beginning to see its impact as we were expecting. 
We remain committed to driving earnings growth and getting to our current business model target. The midpoint of our guidance suggests that we will generate approximately 15% non-GAAP operating margins in Q3, representing a 270 basis point sequential expansion from Q2 and demonstrating the earnings leverage we have created. 
Going forward, we believe LSI is well positioned in large, growing markets with solid fundamentals. We expect to benefit from growth in the deployment of servers, storage and networking equipment. This is being driven by major trends such as wireless infrastructure build outs supporting rich mobile clients and mobile Internet growth, the growth in adoption of commercial and private clouds, large build outs supporting social networking and new emerging web platforms, as well as continuing growth in data and video traffic. The vast majority of LSI's business is influenced by business and service provider IT spending, which is benefiting from strong corporate balance sheets and the need for companies to use IT technology to stay competitive. 
Now on to review additional business highlights for Q2. I'll begin with our Server and Storage-related businesses which include our SAS, ServeRAID adapter and software, SAN and HDD businesses.  Based on our demand forecast, visibility into various end customers and earnings releases by peers serving enterprise IT markets, data center growth incorporate upgrades in areas of server compute and data storage continue to show seasonal patterns going into the second half, which is typically up from the first half. 
For SAS and Servers, we have been awarded a 6-gig controller design on HP's Romley generation of servers, which begin shipping at end of this year. This will expand our customer base to include all top 10 server OEMs for 6-gig SAS solutions when the industry transitions to Romley in 2012. Earlier this week, LSI announced that it was the first in the industry to sample the next generation 12-gig SAS ROCs controllers and expanders to major server OEMs, underscoring our clear leadership in SAS. We believe we're 6 months ahead of our nearest competition for 12-gig SAS. Our performance and timely market leadership will enable us to grow share in the Romley generation and extend it further when 12-gig SAS begins shipping in server adapters in late 2012 and subsequently in other motherboard in 2013. 
In ServeRAID, we have captured a number of Web 2.0 data center wins and our business continues to grow at key OEMs such as IBM, Dell, Cisco and Oracle. Our Channel business, which serves end customers through distributors and resellers, has been a great avenue for us to participate in the build out of Web 2.0 platforms in the cloud. LSI products are being used by the likes of Amazon, Rackspace, Akamai, Google and numerous others. 
Flash is becoming a quite exciting area, and we are experiencing a high level of customer activity. We're expanding and increasing focus in storage and server application acceleration, bringing the performance advantages of been NAND flash to enterprise storage, server and networking applications. We're developing and delivering both software- and hardware-based solutions. LSI's CacheCade software, which accelerates application performance by intelligently placing more frequently used data into the higher performance SSD layer, is now being offered by both Dell and IBM. 
We are also seeing significant customer activity with our PCI Express-based flash adapters, called WarpDrive, recently securing a design with another Tier 1 storage system OEM. The WarpDrive card plugs into a standard PCI slot in a server to maximize the transactional I/O performance of applications such as Web serving, data warehousing and data mining. WarpDrive is enabled by LSI's industry-leading SAS controller. As the market leader in SAS with established relationships with the top server OEMs, WarpDrive is a natural adjacent product allowing customers to utilize WarpDrive's flash capability within a familiar and well-supported LSI SAS ecosystem. We expect to continue to build our design win funnel for WarpDrive through 2011, with revenue contributions beginning in 2012. 
With our custom silicon capability, we have numerous SSD Controllers at various phases of development and qualification. We have recently secured additional wins for next-generation 12-gig SAS flash controllers with key players in the SSD space. 
In Hard Disk Drives, we saw TAM expansion from Q1 to Q2 and growth from our customers. We are seeing the materialization of share gains across both client and enterprise platforms. In fact, we set new quarterly unit shipment and revenue records for both SoCs and preamps in the second quarter and are expecting additional growth in the second half of this year.  In addition, our development milestones continue to be on track, and we have now entered volume production on our second generation of 40-nanometer SoCs, which is a proof point of our technology and execution. 
Now I'd like to review the Networking business, where we continue to experience strong momentum driven by wireless infrastructure build outs, growth in video traffic and upgrades to enterprise networks.  Given its future potential, wireless has been a key focus for us as we drive to maximize LSI's footprint in base stations and wireless back-end infrastructure. Our offering of advanced network and communication processors, multi-service processors, DSPs and custom silicon has enabled us to win meaningful positions across all top 5 wireless equipment providers namely, Ericsson, Nokia Siemens, Huawei, Alcatel-Lucent and ZTE. 
Our wireless-related revenues have been growing, led by successful growth of Ericsson and Nokia Siemens base stations. We're also benefiting from new ramps of custom products for key base station functions within Huawei's and ZTE's offerings. In terms of new wins at top 5 OEMs, we have secured both standard product and custom product wins which position us well to increase our dollar content in base stations going forward. A key milestone is the adoption of our multi-core communications processor by top wireless equipment vendors such as Ericsson. Building upon our very successful network processor heritage, which addresses the data plane market, our multi-core product extends our reach into the adjacent communications processor market, which addresses the control plane. Our multi-core processor offers industry-leading control plane and transport processing for multi-radio base stations in a single SoC and will start contributing to revenues in 2012. 
In the enterprise space, we again increased client Gigabit Ethernet PHY shipments to the leading PC chipset company in Q2, and expect to ship an integrated single-chip Ethernet PHY and controller into platforms for the Romley generation of servers later this year. 
Before I turn the call over to Bryon, I just want to reiterate that we are now entering an exciting time for LSI, where we are well positioned to increase shareholder value. We're excited about the broad customer activity we are seeing across multiple product lines, growth of share in key businesses and the top line growth we expect to generate. 
Now let me hand the call over to Bryon, who will go through our financial details."
30956,137068026,147458,"LSI Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2011",2011-07-27,"Earnings Calls","LSI Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Abhi, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, LSI completed the sale of its External Storage Systems business to NetApp on May 6, 2011.

As a reminder, LSI completed the sale of its External Storage Systems business to NetApp on May 6, 2011. The financial results of the External Systems business have been classified as Discontinued Operations in LSI's financial statements.  Our ongoing business is referred to as Continuing Operations. The results we are covering, as well as our guidance for Q3, will be for continuing operations. 
Now turning to our financial results for the quarter, beginning with revenues.  Q2 revenues were $501 million, sequentially up 6% from $473 million, and above the high end of our guidance range. Our Networking Semiconductor and Server and Storage Semiconductor businesses performed well relative to expectations and delivered solid quarters, representing sequential growth from Q1. Our Server and Storage Semiconductor revenues, which includes products from our ServeRAID adapter and software, SAS, SAN and HDD businesses, were sequentially up $23 million or 7% to $359 million. Server and Storage semiconductors represented 72% of total revenues in the second quarter. Q2 revenues in our Networking business were $117 million, sequentially up $5 million or 4%, and represented 23% of total revenues for the quarter. Revenues for the IP business were relatively flat sequentially at $24 million. 
Moving next to gross margins. LSI's Q2 gross margin, excluding special items, was 51.9%. Gross margins were sequentially down approximately 50 basis points. Contributing to this decline were unexpected costs associated with manufacturing scrap, along with higher gold prices. 
Moving next to operating expenses. R&D, together with SG&A expenses excluding special items, totaled $198 million in Q2, following a lower-than-expected spending level in Q1. Operating expenses were within the Q2 guidance range, with the sequential increase primarily being driven by compensation, along with increased litigation costs. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 12.4% or $62 million. Interest income and other, net of interest expense excluding special items, was $6 million for Q2. 
Now let me turn to the special items we recorded in the second quarter which netted to $31 million. Special items, primarily noncash, included $29 million in amortization of acquisition-related items, $14 million of stock-based compensation expense and offset by a net $11 million favorable amount associated with restructuring costs and other items. 
Moving next to tax. Our tax provision, on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, can vary significantly quarter-to-quarter based on our profitability in different geographic tax jurisdictions and certain discrete items. The tax provision for Q2 was $9 million. 
On a GAAP basis, the second quarter income from continuing operations was approximately $28 million or $0.05 per share. Second quarter GAAP net income, which includes income from discontinued operations, was approximately $0.48 per share, primarily due to the gain we recorded relating to the sale of the External Systems business. Non-GAAP income from continuing operations was $60 million or $0.10 per share. The weighted average share count for the period, for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes, was 611 million shares. This includes the weighted average benefit of purchasing approximately 42 million shares during the period under our share repurchase program. We utilized approximately $397 million of our current $750 million buyback authorization in the first half of the year, and we expect to remain aggressive with share repurchases. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flows. Operating cash flows for Q2 were $38 million, and $146 million for the first half of 2011. Operating cash flows were sequentially down from the first quarter, primarily due to the effects associated with the sale of the External Systems business, along with some inventory pre-builds we completed in Q2 in support of expected Q3 growth. Cash and short-term investments ended the June quarter at approximately $907 million, up 33% from Q1. Finally, with respect to Q2 results, depreciation and software amortization was $17 million, and capital expenditures were $15 million. 
The following is our guidance for continuing operations in Q3 2011. Revenues in the range of $535 million to $565 million, which would represent a 10% sequential increase at midpoint. We expect both our Server and Storage Semiconductor and Networking Semiconductor businesses to deliver sequentially higher revenues in Q3. Gross margin, excluding special items, is expected to be roughly flat at 52%, plus or minus 1%. Operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be in the range of $198 million to $208 million. Interest income and others, and interest expense excluding special items, is expected to net to income of approximately $5 million. Special items are expected to net to approximately $35 million to $55 million. 
The GAAP and non-GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately $10 million for Q3. We expect Q3 GAAP income per share from continuing operations in the range of $0.01 to $0.11, and non-GAAP income from continuing operations in the range of $0.11 to $0.17. The share count is expected to be approximately 575 million shares for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes, as we expect to continue to execute on our share repurchase program. In addition, we expect depreciation and software amortization of approximately $16 million and capital expenditures of approximately $20 million. 
In closing, we delivered solid revenues in non-GAAP operating margins in Q2, while positioning ourselves for strong revenue growth and significant non-GAAP operating margin expansion in Q3. 
And now, let me turn the call to Sujal."

In terms of server- and storage-related spending, I guess we would characterize it as modest seasonality, which is Q3 is up from Q2. But again, nothing inconsistent from what we're seeing from both our major customers, the likes of IBM, Intel, from a server standpoint. So I think we're taking a modest approach relative to seasonality into the second half."

With this acquisition, LSI now has a complete portfolio of storage products including fast, rock processors and controllers, ACD, SSCs and preamps, custom and standard flash storage processors and PCIE flash adapters and acceleration software, giving us breadth and capability that exceeds any competitor in the space. We believe that SandForce is on-track to generate approximately $60 million of revenue in 2011 and we expect continued growth that will be captured in our 2012 numbers. We expect to close this transaction early in Q1 2012 and expect the deal to be neutral in 2012 earnings per share. 
I now want to address the current environment and more importantly, how to view LSI in light of current conditions. There continues to be a cloud of economic uncertainty and this has now been magnified by the significant disruption in the industry supply chain from the severe flooding in Thailand. Our customers have talked about the disruption to our -- to their factories, logistics, power and availability of labor.  Some of LSI's subcontractors in Thailand land have been similarly impacted and the effects of this have been factored into our outlook for Q4. Our guidance for the current quarter assumes $35 million to $45 million of primarily supply-related constrains, which are mostly affecting our Hard Disk Drive business.  Due to these manufacturing constraints, we're assuming that our Hard Disk Drive business declines over 10% sequentially, which is also consistent with the guidance outlook provided by our largest HDD customer. We continue to work with our suppliers to mitigate risks and execute on alternative plans to maximize our ability to supply to our customers.
Turning to our results, Q3 financials provided a proof point of the strength of our share gains in new product cycles, as well as the operating leverage we have worked hard to create. Despite the deteriorating demand environment, we grew revenues 9% sequentially and expanded non-GAAP operating margin from nearly 300 basis points to 15%, while we witnessed deterioration in demand as we moved through the third quarter, particularly in Hard Disk Drive and wireless markets, we correctly anticipated this softness and factored it into our Q3 guidance back in July. While we cannot control the demand environment, we are positively influencing the factors we can control, including execution of new products, further penetration into market leading accounts, expense control and pursuit of new growth drivers in product cycles. 
Going forward, we believe LSI is well-positioned in large, growing market with solid fundamentals and we expect to benefit from growth in the deployment of servers, storage and networking equipment for data centers, commercial and private clouds, and mobile networks. 
Now I want to review additional business highlights for Q3. I'll begin with our server and storage businesses which include our SAS, Server Rated Afference Software, flash, SAN and HDD businesses. As we mentioned last quarter, for SAS and Servers, we expanded customer base to include all top 10 server OEMs with the award of a 6-gig controller design on HP's next generation of servers. We expect to begin shipping products early next year in conjunction with the rollout of Intel's Romley platform. Going beyond Romley and building upon our time-to-market, LSI was the first in the industry to sample next-generation 12-gig SAS ROCs, controllers and expanders to measure service OEMs earlier this year. As a proof point of our technology leadership, we broke the 1 million IOPS performance barrier with a single 8-port 12-gig SAS brought controller at Intel's develop perform in September. We believe we are now 9 months ahead of our nearest competitor. We continue to make progress with external storage systems customers following the divestiture of our systems business. In fact, Dot Hill, a selected LSI 12-gig SAS silicon and software, are their next generation external storage products. 
In the flash space, we're expanding and increasing focus on storage and server application acceleration bringing the performance advantages of NAND flash enterprise server and storage in networking applications. We are developing and delivering both software and hardware-based solutions and the acquisition of SandForce significantly enhances our position in this space. LSI's CacheCade software which accelerates application performance by intelligently placing more frequently used data into higher performance SSD layer, is now being offered by both Dell and IBM, and Intel and several channel customers are shipping our second generation CacheCade product. We continue to build momentum with our WarpDrive PCI Express flash adapters and expect to start ramping at the major Tier 1 storage vendor at the end of this quarter.  Also with our work drive solution, we won multiple design at the Tier 1 server OEM, displacing 50% of the incumbent competitors opportunity. We won  based on our  superior architecture and portfolio, as well as a natural extension of our current server engagement.
We believe that there are several key differentiating factors to the LSI solution. We have an architectural advantage with our on board industry-leading SAS controller. We still have high risk application performance and low latency without attacking the server CPU resources.  This is critical in all application, but especially in virtualized server environments. Our solution also utilizes LSI's enterprise hard and SAS firmware allowing customers to take advantage of the large established and familiar LSI storage product line. Lastly, we have a solid roadmap that will include the SandForce flash portfolio and have begun sampling next generation PCIE flash adapters supporting SoC flash for applications requiring performance and durability and MLC flash for applications requiring low cost and high density. We have numerous large opportunities and engagement across server OEMs and Web 2.0 data center customers and expect work drive to be a key growth driver in 2012. In Hard Disk Drives, we saw a unit time expand by approximately 6% from Q2 to Q3, and saw the materialization of significant share gains in Seagate's client platforms and continuing ramp of enterprise SoC as expected. In fact, we set new quarterly unit and revenue records for both SoCs and preamps in Q3. On the development side, all programs continue to be on track with both existing and new customers.
Now I'd like to provide an update on new developments in our networking business where we benefit from wireless infrastructure build outs from mobile networks, growth in video traffic and upgrades to enterprise networks.  We continue to be successful in increasing LSI's footprint in base station and wireless backhaul infrastructure and offer a complete portfolio of products from multi-core processors to custom silicon solutions.  Our Axxia multi-core communications processor has been adapted by Ericsson, the leading wireless equipment provider, expanding our footprint from network processors serving data plane functions to multi-core solutions that provide both data plane and controlled plane functions in a single device. We're also seeing success in the sampled our custom silicon solution for the base band function, which sits alongside the data plane controlled plane device and integrates DSP functionality. We expect to have a combination of standard products and custom product solutions shipping into base stations at 4 of the top 5 wireless equipment OEMs next year.
In the enterprise space, we have a number of initiatives to drive future growth. We are already seeing traction as we extend our Axxia multi-core communications processor into products such as data center switches enabling further growth beyond wireless base station applications. In custom products, we have begun ramping silicon for 1-gig Ethernet controllers, integrating Mac and 5 functionality for server platforms at a leading processor OEM. It adds to our existing shipments of gigabit Ethernet 5s into client and server applications. Before I turn the call over to Bryon, I just want to reiterate that we are well-positioned with share gain opportunities and new product cycles to enable us to outgrow the storage and networking markets we serve going forward. Now let me hand the call over to Bryon."

As noted earlier in the call, we announced today the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire SandForce for approximately $322 million in cash, net of cash assumed. And we'll assume approximately $48 million",1172,"Thanks, Abhi, and good afternoon, everyone. As noted earlier in the call, we announced today the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire SandForce for approximately $322 million in cash, net of cash assumed. And we'll assume approximately $48 million of unvested stock options and restricted shares held by SandForce employees. We expect the transaction to be neutral to 2012 non-GAAP earnings per share. We expect to close in early Q1 2012 and consequently, our guidance for Q4 is not effected by this transaction.  We will provide additional information regarding the transaction after the deal closes. 
Now onto Q3 results and the Q4 outlook.
LSI delivered a solid quarter consistent with the guidance we provided in July despite the challenges in the macroeconomic environment.  Revenues increased sequentially by 9.2% to $547 million. Non-GAAP gross margins expanded to 52.2% or 20 basis points higher than midpoint of guidance. We continue to carefully manage expenses with non-GAAP operating expenses of $202.6 million, just under midpoint of guidance.  And we delivered non-GAAP EPS at midpoint of $0.14 per share. Moreover, the company drove double-digit year-over-year growth in both revenues, as well as operating income. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, Q3 revenues were up 21% and non-GAAP operating income was up 38%. Non-GAAP operating margins have now expanded to 15.2% of revenues. 
Now turning to a more detailed discussion of our financial results for the quarter beginning with revenues, Q3 revenues were $547 million, sequentially up 9.2% from $501 million. Our Server and Storage Semiconductor revenues, which include products from our ServeRAID adapter and software, flash, SAS, SAN and HDD businesses were sequentially up $44 million or 12% to $403 million. Server and Storage semiconductors represented 74% of total revenues in the third quarter. Q3 revenues in our networking business were $117 million relatively flat sequentially and represented 21% of total revenues for the third quarter.  Revenues for the IP business were sequentially up $3 million to $27 million. 
Moving next to gross margins. LSI's Q3 gross margin, excluding special items, was 52.2% or 20 basis points above the midpoint of guidance. Gross margins increased sequentially by approximately 30 basis points primarily due to higher revenues and improved product mix and partially offset by higher commodity cost.  In terms of operating expenses, R&D together with SG&A expenses, excluding special items, totaled $202.6 million in Q3, just below the midpoint of guidance.  Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter increased sequentially by 280 basis points to 15.2% or $83 million. Interest income and other net of interest expense excluding special items was $8 million for Q3, approximately 1/2 of which was related to income from transition services associated with the sale of the External Systems business.  We expect most of these service arrangements be completed by the end of the year. 
Now let me turn to the special items we recorded in the third quarter which netted to $51 million. Special items, primarily non-cash, included $29 million in amortization of acquisition-related items, $12 million of stock-based compensation expense, and $11 million of restructuring cost and other items. 
Moving next to tax. Our tax provision on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis can vary significantly quarter-to-quarter based on our profitability in different geographic tax jurisdictions and certain discrete items.  The tax provision for Q3 was $8 million. On a GAAP basis, third quarter income from continuing operations was approximately $32 million or $0.05 per share. Third quarter GAAP net income, which includes income from discontinued operations was $29 million or $0.05 per share. Non-GAAP income from continuing operations was $83 million or $0.14 per share. The weighted average share count for the period for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes was 581 million shares. This includes the weighted average benefit of purchasing approximately 11 million shares during the period under our share repurchase program. Year-to-date, we have repurchased a total of 68 million shares and utilized approximately $472 million of our current $750 million buyback program.  Our share buyback program remains in place with $278 million remaining in our authorization. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flows. Cash and short-term investments ended the September quarter at approximately $879 million. We continue to operate with no debt on our balance sheet. Operating cash flows for Q3 were $45 million and are $191 million year-to-date. 
Finally, with respect to Q3 results. Depreciation of software amortization was $15 million and capital expenditures were $10 million. Next to the discussion of our guidance for continuing operations in Q4 2011. As noted previously, we've been focused on the recent flooding in Thailand and the impact on employees, customers and suppliers in the region. We are grateful that our employees are safe, but the situation continues to be challenging and adds volatility to the business near term. Our exposure from a supply-chain perspective relates primarily to third-party services associated with packaging and test, and from our customer's ability to meet end demand. We continue working to size and mitigate exposure and a providing guidance, taking into consideration our best estimates at this time.  With that said, we expect Q4 revenues in the range of $500 million to $550 million or sequentially down about 4% at midpoint. This assumes approximately $35 million to $45 million of primarily supply-related constraints which are mostly affecting our Hard Disk Drive business. Due to these manufacturing constraints, we're assuming that our HDD business declines over 10% sequentially, which is also consistent with the guidance outlook provided by our largest HDD customer. We expect our Server and Storage Semiconductor revenues to be sequentially down in Q4 driven by HDD declines. In addition, we expect our Networking Semiconductor revenues to be flat-to-down slightly benefiting from some last time buyers of legacy products.  Gross margin excluding special items is expected to be 51%, plus or minus 1%. Operating expenses excluding special items are expected to be roughly flat or in the range of $198 to $208 million to $192 million. Interest income and other and interest expense excluding special items is expected to net to income of approximately $5 million.  Special items are expected to net to approximately $35 million to $55 million.  The GAAP and non-GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately $13 million for Q4. We expect Q4 GAAP income per share from continuing operations in the range of negative $0.04 to a positive $0.08 and non-GAAP income from continuing operations in the range of $0.06 to $0.14 per share. This share count is expected to be approximately 580 million shares for both GAAP to non-GAAP purposes. In addition, we expect depreciation and software amortization of approximately $16 million and capital expenditures of approximately $12 million.
In closing, we delivered solid revenues in non-GAAP operating margins in Q3, and demonstrated solid year-over-year progress on operating income expansion and EPS growth. We remain focused on driving operating leverage and continued partner with our key suppliers and estimators to work through the business challenges associated with the flooding in Thailand. Now let me turn the call to Sujal."

Secondly, LSI's engineering investment and focus in SSDs has been more aimed at a custom implementation for those SSD and NAND providers that are using sort of a custom approach for flash storage processors within their SSDs. SandForce has been focused on delivering a complete standard product with all the firmware product as well. The combination of the 2 companies I think absolutely positions us to be a market leader. As SSD's for Ultrabooks, notebooks and enterprise flash, based solutions gross, so that's the second big objective. And then back to your question around growth. We believe the aggregates sort of market, which is composed of flash based processors for all types of SSDs, as well as the PCIE flash adapter market is going to be at least $2 billion, and we believe we're very conservative and based on what others are saying here in several years and the market in aggregate is growing 40% to 60% annually.

30956,141075541,178698,"LSI Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2011",2011-10-26,"Earnings Calls","LSI Corporation","Executives","Good afternoon, and welcome. I'd like to begin by discussing our announcement to acquire SandForce, a leading provider of flash storage processors extending LSI's industry-leading position and breadth in storage technology solutions. There were several dr",1445,"Good afternoon, and welcome. I'd like to begin by discussing our announcement to acquire SandForce, a leading provider of flash storage processors extending LSI's industry-leading position and breadth in storage technology solutions. There were several drivers that motivated us to make this acquisition. The acquisition greatly enhances LSI's competitive position in the fast-growing server and storage PCIe flash adapter space, where our family of WarpDrive products already uses SandForce and compete with solutions from companies such as Fusion-io. Secondly, the complementary combination of LSI's custom products and SandForce's standard product offering catapults LSI into an industry-leading position for the rapidly-growing, high-volume flash storage process from market for Ultrabooks, notebooks and enterprise SSD and flash solutions. PCIE flash-based adapters and flash storage processors will together represent a greater than $2 billion TAM expansion for LSI in the next several years, extending LSI's exciting growth opportunities.
With this acquisition, LSI now has a complete portfolio of storage products, including SAS, RoC, processors and controllers, ACD, SoCs and preamps, custom and standard flash storage processors and PCIe flash adapters and acceleration software, giving us breadth and capability that exceeds any competitor in the space. We believe that SandForce is on track to generate approximately $60 million of revenue in 2011, and we expect continued growth that will be captured in our 2012 numbers. We expect to close this transaction early in Q1 2012 and expect the deal to be neutral in 2012 earnings per share. 
I now want to address the current environment and more importantly, how to view LSI in light of current conditions. There continues to be a cloud of economic uncertainty and this has now been magnified by the significant disruption in the industry supply chain from the severe flooding in Thailand. Our customers have talked about the disruption to our -- to their factories, logistics, power and availability of labor. Some of LSI's subcontractors in Thailand land have been similarly impacted and the effects of this have been factored into our outlook for Q4. Our guidance for the current quarter assumes $35 million to $45 million of primarily supply-related constraints, which are mostly affecting our Hard Disk Drive business. Due to these manufacturing constraints, we're assuming that our Hard Disk Drive business declines over 10% sequentially, which is also consistent with the guidance outlook provided by our largest HDD customer. We continue to work with our suppliers to mitigate risks and execute on alternative plans to maximize our ability to supply to our customers.
Turning to our results, Q3 financials provided a proof point of the strength of our share gains in new product cycles, as well as the operating leverage we have worked hard to create. Despite the deteriorating demand environment, we grew revenues 9% sequentially and expanded non-GAAP operating margin by nearly 300 basis points to 15%. While we witnessed deterioration in demand as we moved through the third quarter, particularly in Hard Disk Drive and wireless markets, we correctly anticipated this softness and factored it into our Q3 guidance back in July. While we cannot control the demand environment, we are positively influencing the factors we can control, including execution of new products, further penetration into market leading accounts, expense control and pursuit of new growth drivers in product cycles. 
Going forward, we believe LSI is well positioned in large, growing markets with solid fundamentals and we expect to benefit from growth in the deployment of servers, storage and networking equipment for data centers, commercial and private clouds and mobile networks. 
Now I want to review additional business highlights for Q3. I'll begin with our server and storage businesses which include our SAS, ServeRAID adapter and software, flash, SAN and HDD businesses. As we mentioned last quarter, for SAS and servers, we expanded customer base to include all top 10 server OEMs with the award of the 6-gig controller design on HP's next generation of servers. We expect to begin shipping products early next year in conjunction with the rollout of Intel's Romley platform. 
Going beyond Romley and building upon our time-to-market, LSI was the first in the industry to sample the next-generation 12-gig SAS ROCs, controllers and expanders to measure server OEMs earlier this year. As a proof point of our technology leadership, we broke the 1 million IOPS performance barrier with a single 8-port 12-gig SAS RoC controller at Intel's developed performance in September. We believe we are now 9 months ahead of our nearest competitor. We continue to make progress with external storage systems customers following the divestiture of our Systems business. In fact, Dot Hill, has selected LSI 12-gig SAS silicon and software for their next-generation external storage products. 
In the flash space, we're expanding and increasing focus on storage and server application acceleration, bringing the performance advantages of NAND flash to enterprise server and storage in networking applications. We are developing and delivering both software- and hardware-based solutions, and the acquisition of SandForce significantly enhances our position in this space. 
LSI's CacheCade software, which accelerates application performance by intelligently placing more frequently used data into higher performance SSD layer, is now being offered by both Dell and IBM, and Intel and several channel customers are shipping our second-generation CacheCade product. 
We continue to build momentum with our WarpDrive PCI Express flash adapters and expect to start ramping at a major Tier 1 storage vendor at the end of this quarter. Also with our WarpDrive solution, we won multiple designs at a Tier 1 server OEM, displacing 50% of the incumbent competitor's opportunity. We won based on our superior architecture and portfolio, as well as a natural extension of our current server engagement.
We believe that there are several key differentiating factors to the LSI solution. We have an architectural advantage with our on-board industry-leading SAS controller, which delivers high application performance and low latency without attacking the server CPU resources. This is critical in all application but especially in virtualized server environments. Our solution also utilizes LSI's enterprise hard and SAS firmware, allowing customers to take advantage of the large, established and familiar LSI storage product line. 
Lastly, we have a solid roadmap that will include the SandForce flash portfolio and have begun sampling the next-generation PCIe flash adapters supporting SoC flash for applications requiring performance and durability and MLC flash for applications requiring low cost and high density. We have numerous large opportunities and engagements across server OEMs and Web 2.0 data center customers and expect WarpDrive to be a key growth driver in 2012. 
In Hard Disk Drives, we saw our unit time expand by approximately 6% from Q2 to Q3 and saw the materialization of significant share gains in Seagate's client platforms and continuing ramp of enterprise SoC is expected. In fact, we set new quarterly unit and revenue records for both SoCs and preamps in Q3. On the development side, all programs continue to be on track with both existing and new customers.
Now I'd like to provide an update on new developments in our Networking business, where we benefit from wireless infrastructure buildouts from mobile networks, growth in video traffic and upgrades to enterprise networks. We continue to be successful in increasing LSI's footprint in base station and wireless backhaul infrastructure and offer a complete portfolio of products from multi-core processors to custom silicon solutions. Our Axxia multi-core communications processor has been adapted by Ericsson, the leading wireless equipment provider, expanding our footprint from network processors serving data plane functions to multi-core solutions that provide both data plane and controlled plane functions in a single device. We're also seeing success in the sampled custom silicon solution for the baseband function, which sits alongside the data plane, controlled plane device and integrates DSP functionality. We expect to have a combination of standard products and custom product solutions shipping into base stations at 4 of the top 5 wireless equipment OEMs next year.
In the enterprise space, we have a number of initiatives to drive future growth. We are already seeing traction as we extend our Axxia multi-core communications processor into products such as data center switches, enabling further growth beyond wireless base station applications. In custom products, we have begun ramping silicon for 1-gig Ethernet controllers, integrating Mac and PHY functionality for server platforms at a leading processor OEM. This adds to our existing shipments of Gigabit Ethernet PHYs into client and server applications. 
Before I turn the call over to Bryon, I just want to reiterate that we are well-positioned with share gain opportunities and new product cycles to enable us to outgrow the storage and networking markets we serve going forward. Now let me hand the call over to Bryon."
30956,141075541,178698,"LSI Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2011",2011-10-26,"Earnings Calls","LSI Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Abhi, and good afternoon, everyone. As noted earlier in the call, we announced today the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire SandForce for approximately $322 million in cash, net of cash assumed, and we'll assume approximately $48 million",1171,"Thanks, Abhi, and good afternoon, everyone. As noted earlier in the call, we announced today the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire SandForce for approximately $322 million in cash, net of cash assumed, and we'll assume approximately $48 million of unvested stock options and restricted shares held by SandForce employees. We expect the transaction to be neutral to 2012 non-GAAP earnings per share. We expect to close in early Q1 2012 and consequently, our guidance for Q4 is not affected by this transaction. We will provide additional information regarding the transaction after the deal closes. 
Now onto Q3 results and the Q4 outlook. LSI delivered a solid quarter consistent with the guidance we provided in July despite the challenges in the macroeconomic environment. Revenues increased sequentially by 9.2% to $547 million. Non-GAAP gross margins expanded to 52.2% or 20 basis points higher than midpoint of guidance. We continue to carefully manage expenses with non-GAAP operating expenses of $202.6 million, just under midpoint of guidance. And we delivered non-GAAP EPS at midpoint of $0.14 per share. Moreover, the company drove double-digit year-over-year growth in both the revenues, as well as operating income. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, Q3 revenues were up 21% and non-GAAP operating income was up 38%. Non-GAAP operating margins have now expanded to 15.2% of revenues. 
Now turning to a more detailed discussion of our financial results for the quarter beginning with revenues. Q3 revenues were $547 million, sequentially up 9.2% from $501 million. Our server and storage semiconductor revenues, which include products from our ServeRAID adapter and software, flash, SAS, SAN and HDD businesses, were sequentially up $44 million or 12% to $403 million. server and storage semiconductors represented 74% of total revenues in the third quarter. Q3 revenues in our Networking business were $117 million, relatively flat sequentially and represented 21% of total revenues for the third quarter. Revenues for the IP business were sequentially up $3 million to $27 million. 
Moving next to gross margins. LSI's Q3 gross margin, excluding special items, was 52.2% or 20 basis points above the midpoint of guidance. Gross margins increased sequentially by approximately 30 basis points primarily due to higher revenues and improved product mix and partially offset by higher commodity costs. 
In terms of operating expenses, R&D together with SG&A expenses, excluding special items, total $202.6 million in Q3, just below the midpoint of guidance. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter increased sequentially by 280 basis points to 15.2% or $83 million. Interest income and other net of interest expense, excluding special items, was $8 million for Q3, approximately 1/2 of which was related to income from transition services associated with the sale of the External Systems business. We expect most of these service arrangements to be completed by the end of the year. 
Now let me turn to the special items we recorded in the third quarter which netted to $51 million. Special items, primarily non-cash, included $29 million in amortization of acquisition-related items, $12 million of stock-based compensation expense and $11 million of restructuring costs and other items. 
Moving next to tax. Our tax provision on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis can vary significantly quarter-to-quarter based on our profitability in different geographic tax jurisdictions and certain discrete items. The tax provision for Q3 was $8 million. 
On a GAAP basis, third quarter income from continuing operations was approximately $32 million or $0.05 per share. Third quarter GAAP net income, which includes income from discontinued operations, was $29 million or $0.05 per share. Non-GAAP income from continuing operations was $83 million or $0.14 per share. The weighted average share count for the period for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes was 581 million shares. This includes the weighted average benefit of purchasing approximately 11 million shares during the period under our share repurchase program. Year-to-date, we have repurchased a total of 68 million shares and utilized approximately $472 million of our current $750 million buyback program. Our share buyback program remains in place with $278 million remaining in our authorization. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flows. Cash and short-term investments ended the September quarter at approximately $879 million. We continue to operate with no debt on our balance sheet. Operating cash flows for Q3 were $45 million and are $191 million year-to-date. 
Finally, with respect to Q3 results. Depreciation of software amortization was $15 million and capital expenditures were $10 million. 
Next is a discussion of our guidance for continuing operations in Q4 2011. As noted previously, we've been focused on the recent flooding in Thailand and the impact on employees, customers and suppliers in the region. We are grateful that our employees are safe, but the situation continues to be challenging and adds volatility to the business near-term. Our exposure from a supply chain perspective relates primarily to third-party services associated with packaging and tests and from our customers' ability to meet end demand. We continue working to size and mitigate exposure and providing guidance, taking into consideration our best estimates at this time. 
With that said, we expect Q4 revenues in the range of $500 million to $550 million or sequentially down about 4% at midpoint. This assumes approximately $35 million to $45 million of primarily supply-related constraints, which are mostly affecting our Hard Disk Drive business. Due to these manufacturing constraints, we're assuming that our HDD business declines over 10% sequentially, which is also consistent with the guidance outlook provided by our largest HDD customer. We expect our server and storage semiconductor revenues to be sequentially down in Q4, driven by HDD declines. In addition, we expect our Networking semiconductor revenues to be flat-to-down slightly, benefiting from some last-time buys of legacy products.  Gross margin, excluding special items, is expected to be 51%, plus or minus 1%. Operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be roughly flat or in the range of $198 million to $208 million. Interest income and other and interest expense, excluding special items, is expected to net to income of approximately $5 million. Special items are expected to net to approximately $35 million to $55 million. 
The GAAP and non-GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately $13 million for Q4. We expect Q4 GAAP income per share from continuing operations in the range of negative $0.04 to a positive $0.08, and non-GAAP income from continuing operations in the range of $0.06 to $0.14 per share. This share count is expected to be approximately 580 million shares for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes. 
In addition, we expect depreciation and software amortization of approximately $16 million and capital expenditures of approximately $12 million.
In closing, we delivered solid revenues and non-GAAP operating margins in Q3, and demonstrated solid year-over-year progress on operating income expansion and EPS growth. We remain focused on driving operating leverage and continue to partner with our key suppliers and estimators to work through the business challenges associated with the flooding in Thailand.

So there's still a lot of unknowns and everyone's right now focused on Q4, in maximizing output for Q4. I think it's impossible to predict what's going to happen in Q1. It's going to be a function of how fast factories come back online, supply lines come back online, as well as what happens to some of the demand, it doesn't get fulfilled in Q1 and then obviously, inventories likely are going to get heavily depleted through this quarter with this situation and will likely require some recovery in Q1.

Let me -- I mean, those are all good questions, but let me make sure you got the full picture. First of all, let me give you a sense for why we're making the acquisition and the strategic rationale behind it. First and foremost, it significantly enhances our competitive position in the very fast growing server and storage PCIe flash adapter space, which is a marketplace that certainly has been created by companies such as Fusion-io. We are also very active in that product category now and we'll have a very comprehensive product line, and having a flash storage processor capability such as SandForce's only solidifies our competitiveness. Secondly, LSI's engineering investment and focus in SSDs has been more aimed at a custom implementation for those SSD and NAND providers that are using sort of a custom approach for flash storage processors within their SSDs. SandForce has been focused on delivering a complete standard product with all the firmware product ties as well. The combination of the 2 companies, I think, absolutely positions us to be a market leader as SSD is for Ultrabooks, notebooks and enterprise flash base solutions grows, such a second big objective. And then back to your question around growth. We believe the aggregate sort of market, which is composed of flash-based processors for all types of SSDs, as well as the PCIe flash adapter market, is going to be at least $2 billion, and we believe we're very conservative based on what others are saying here in several years and the market in aggregate is growing 40% to 60% annually. So this positions us much more strongly to participate in a very fast-growing market."

30956,141075541,178791,"LSI Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2011",2011-10-26,"Earnings Calls","LSI Corporation","Executives","Good afternoon, and welcome. I'd like to begin by discussing our announcement to acquire SandForce, a leading provider of flash storage processors extending LSI's industry-leading position and breadth in storage technology solutions. There were several dr",1447,"Good afternoon, and welcome. I'd like to begin by discussing our announcement to acquire SandForce, a leading provider of flash storage processors extending LSI's industry-leading position and breadth in storage technology solutions. There were several drivers that motivated us to make this acquisition. The acquisition greatly enhances LSI's competitive position in the fast-growing server and storage PCIe flash adapter space, where our family of WarpDrive products already uses SandForce in compete with solutions from companies such as Fusion-io. Secondly, the complementary combination of LSI's custom products and SandForce's standard product offering catapults LSI into an industry-leading position for the rapidly-growing, high-volume flash storage pROCessing market for Ultrabooks, notebooks and enterprise SSD and flash solutions. PCIe flash-based adapters and flash storage processors will together represent a greater than $2 billion TAM expansion for LSI in the next several years, extending LSI's exciting growth opportunities.
With this acquisition, LSI now has a complete portfolio of storage products, including SAS, ROC, processors and controllers, ACD [ph], SoCs and preamps, custom and standard flash storage processors and PCIe flash adapters and acceleration software, giving us breadth and capability that exceeds any competitor in this space. We believe that SandForce is on track to generate approximately $60 million of revenue in 2011, and we expect continued growth that will be captured in our 2012 numbers. We expect to close this transaction early in Q1 2012 and expect the deal to be neutral in 2012 earnings per share.
I now want to address the current environment and more importantly, how to view LSI in light of current conditions. There continues to be a cloud of economic uncertainty and this has now been magnified by the significant disruptions of the industry supply chain from the severe flooding in Thailand. Our customers have talked about the disruption to our -- to their factories, logistics, power and availability of labor. Some of LSI's subcontractors in Thailand land have been similarly impacted and the effects of this have been factored into our outlook for Q4. Our guidance for the current quarter assumes $35 million to $45 million of primarily supply-related constraints, which are mostly affecting our Hard Disk Drive business. Due to these manufacturing constraints, we're assuming that our Hard Disk Drive business declines over 10% sequentially, which is also consistent with the guidance outlook provided by our largest HDD customer. We continue to work with our suppliers to mitigate risks and execute on alternative plans to maximize our ability to supply to our customers.
Turning to our results, Q3 financials provided a proof point of the strength of our share gains in new product cycles, as well as the operating leverage we have worked hard to create. Despite the deteriorating demand environment, we grew revenues 9% sequentially and expanded non-GAAP operating margin by nearly 300 basis points to 15%. While we witnessed deterioration in demand as we moved through the third quarter, particularly in Hard Disk Drive and wireless markets, we correctly anticipated this softness and factored it into our Q3 guidance back in July. While we cannot control the demand environment, we are positively influencing the factors we can control, including execution of new products, further penetration into market leading accounts, expense control and pursuit of new growth drivers in product cycles.
Going forward, we believe LSI is well positioned in large, growing markets with solid fundamentals and we expect to benefit from growth in the deployment of servers, storage and networking equipment for data centers, commercial and private clouds and mobile networks.
Now I want to review additional business highlights for Q3. I'll begin with our server and storage businesses which include our SAS, ServeRAID adapter and software, flash, SAN and HDD businesses. As we mentioned last quarter, for SAS and servers, we expanded customer base to include all top 10 server OEMs with the award of a 6-gig controller design on HP's next generation of servers. We expect to begin shipping products early next year in conjunction with the rollout of Intel's Romley platform.
Going beyond Romley and building upon our time-to-market leadership, LSI was the first in the industry to sample the next-generation 12-gig SAS ROCs, controllers and expanders to major server OEMs earlier this year. As a proof point of our technology leadership, we broke the 1 million IOPS performance barrier with a single 8-port 12-gig SAS ROC controller at Intel's developer forum in September. We believe we are now 9 months ahead of our nearest competitor. We continue to make progress with external storage systems customers following the divestiture of our Systems business. In fact, Dot Hill, has selected LSI 12-gig SAS silicon and software for their next-generation external storage products.
In the flash space, we're expanding and increasing focus on storage and server application acceleration, bringing the performance advantages of NAND flash to enterprise server and storage in networking applications. We are developing and delivering both software- and hardware-based solutions, and the acquisition of SandForce significantly enhances our position in this space.
LSI's CacheCade software, which accelerates application performance by intelligently placing more frequently used data into higher performance SSD layer, is now being offered by both Dell and IBM, and Intel and several channel customers are shipping our second-generation CacheCade product.
We continue to build momentum with our WarpDrive PCI Express flash adapters and expect to start ramping at a major Tier 1 storage vendor at the end of this quarter. Also with our WarpDrive solution, we've won multiple designs at a Tier 1 server OEM, displacing 50% of the incumbent competitor's opportunity. We won based on our superior architecture and portfolio, as well as a natural extension of our current server engagement.
We believe that there are several key differentiating factors to the LSI solution. We have an architectural advantage with our on-board industry-leading SAS controller, which delivers high application performance and low latency without attacking the server CPU resources. This is critical in all application but especially in virtualized server environments. Our solution also utilizes LSI's enterprise hard and SAS firmware, allowing customers to take advantage of the large, established and familiar LSI storage product line.
Lastly, we have a solid roadmap that will include the SandForce flash portfolio and have begun sampling the next-generation PCIe flash adapters supporting SoC flash for applications requiring performance and durability and MLC flash for applications requiring low cost and high density. We have numerous large opportunities and engagements across server OEMs and Web 2.0 data center customers and expect WarpDrive to be a key growth driver in 2012.
In Hard Disk Drives, we saw our unit time expand by approximately 6% from Q2 to Q3 and saw the materialization of significant share gains in Seagate's client platforms and continuing ramp of enterprise SoC is expected. In fact, we set new quarterly unit and revenue records for both SoCs and preamps in Q3. On the development side, all programs continue to be on track with both existing and new customers.
Now I'd like to provide an update on new developments in our Networking business, where we benefit from wireless infrastructure buildouts from mobile networks, growth in video traffic and upgrades to enterprise networks. We continue to be successful in increasing LSI's footprint in base station and wireless backhaul infrastructure and offer a complete portfolio of products from multi-core processors to custom silicon solutions. Our Axxia multi-core communications processor has been adapted by Ericsson, the leading wireless equipment provider, expanding our footprint from network processors serving data plane functions to multi-core solutions that provide both data plane and controlled plane functions in a single device. We're also seeing success in the sampled or custom silicon solution for the baseband function, which sits alongside the data plane, controlled plane device and integrates DSP functionality. We expect to have a combination of standard products and custom product solutions shipping into base stations at 4 of the top 5 wireless equipment OEMs next year.
In the enterprise space, we have a number of initiatives to drive future growth. We are already seeing traction as we extend our Axxia multi-core communications processor into products such as data center switches, enabling further growth beyond wireless base station applications. In custom products, we have begun ramping silicon for 1-gig Ethernet controllers, integrating Mac and PHY functionality for server platforms at a leading processor OEM. This adds to our existing shipments of Gigabit Ethernet PHYs into client and server applications.
Before I turn the call over to Bryon, I just want to reiterate that we are well-positioned with share gain opportunities and new product cycles to enable us to outgrow the storage and networking markets we serve going forward. Now let me hand the call over to Bryon."

As noted earlier in the call, we announced today the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire SandForce for approximately $322 million in cash, net of cash assumed, and we'll assume approximately $48 million",1171,"Thanks, Abhi, and good afternoon, everyone. As noted earlier in the call, we announced today the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire SandForce for approximately $322 million in cash, net of cash assumed, and we'll assume approximately $48 million of unvested stock options and restricted shares held by SandForce employees. We expect the transaction to be neutral to 2012 non-GAAP earnings per share. We expect to close in early Q1 2012 and consequently, our guidance for Q4 is not affected by this transaction. We will provide additional information regarding the transaction after the deal closes. 
Now onto Q3 results and the Q4 outlook. LSI delivered a solid quarter consistent with the guidance we provided in July despite the challenges in the macroeconomic environment. Revenues increased sequentially by 9.2% to $547 million. Non-GAAP gross margins expanded to 52.2% or 20 basis points higher than midpoint of guidance. We continue to carefully manage expenses with non-GAAP operating expenses of $202.6 million, just under midpoint of guidance. And we delivered non-GAAP EPS at midpoint of $0.14 per share. Moreover, the company drove double-digit year-over-year growth in both the revenues, as well as operating income. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, Q3 revenues were up 21% and non-GAAP operating income was up 38%. Non-GAAP operating margins have now expanded to 15.2% of revenues.
Now turning to a more detailed discussion of our financial results for the quarter beginning with revenues. Q3 revenues were $547 million, sequentially up 9.2% from $501 million. Our server and storage semiconductor revenues, which include products from our ServeRAID adapter and software, flash, SAS, SAN and HDD businesses, were sequentially up $44 million or 12% to $403 million. Server and storage semiconductors represented 74% of total revenues in the third quarter. Q3 revenues in our Networking business were $117 million, relatively flat sequentially and represented 21% of total revenues for the third quarter. Revenues for the IP business were sequentially up $3 million to $27 million.
Moving next to gross margins. LSI's Q3 gross margin, excluding special items, was 52.2% or 20 basis points above the midpoint of guidance. Gross margins increased sequentially by approximately 30 basis points primarily due to higher revenues and improved product mix and partially offset by higher commodity costs. 
In terms of operating expenses, R&D together with SG&A expenses, excluding special items, totaled $202.6 million in Q3, just below the midpoint of guidance. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter increased sequentially by 280 basis points to 15.2% or $83 million. Interest income and other net of interest expense, excluding special items, was $8 million for Q3, approximately 1/2 of which was related to income from transition services associated with the sale of the External Systems business. We expect most of these service arrangements to be completed by the end of the year.
Now let me turn to the special items we recorded in the third quarter which netted to $51 million. Special items, primarily non-cash, included $29 million in amortization of acquisition-related items, $12 million of stock-based compensation expense and $11 million of restructuring costs and other items.
Moving next to tax. Our tax provision on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis can vary significantly quarter-to-quarter based on our profitability in different geographic tax jurisdictions and certain discrete items. The tax provision for Q3 was $8 million. 
On a GAAP basis, third quarter income from continuing operations was approximately $32 million or $0.05 per share. Third quarter GAAP net income, which includes income from discontinued operations, was $29 million or $0.05 per share. Non-GAAP income from continuing operations was $83 million or $0.14 per share. The weighted average share count for the period for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes was 581 million shares. This includes the weighted average benefit of purchasing approximately 11 million shares during the period under our share repurchase program. Year-to-date, we have repurchased a total of 68 million shares and utilized approximately $472 million of our current $750 million buyback program. Our share buyback program remains in place with $278 million remaining in our authorization.
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flows. Cash and short-term investments ended the September quarter at approximately $879 million. We continue to operate with no debt on our balance sheet. Operating cash flows for Q3 were $45 million and are $191 million year-to-date.
Finally, with respect to Q3 results. Depreciation of software amortization was $15 million and capital expenditures were $10 million.
Next is a discussion of our guidance for continuing operations in Q4 2011. As noted previously, we've been focused on the recent flooding in Thailand and the impact on employees, customers and suppliers in the region. We are grateful that our employees are safe, but the situation continues to be challenging and adds volatility to the business near-term. Our exposure from a supply chain perspective relates primarily to third-party services associated with packaging and tests and from our customers' ability to meet end demand. We continue working to size and mitigate exposure and providing guidance, taking into consideration our best estimates at this time. 
With that said, we expect Q4 revenues in the range of $500 million to $550 million or sequentially down about 4% at midpoint. This assumes approximately $35 million to $45 million of primarily supply-related constraints, which are mostly affecting our Hard Disk Drive business. Due to these manufacturing constraints, we're assuming that our HDD business declines over 10% sequentially, which is also consistent with the guidance outlook provided by our largest HDD customer. We expect our server and storage semiconductor revenues to be sequentially down in Q4, driven by HDD declines. In addition, we expect our Networking semiconductor revenues to be flat-to-down slightly, benefiting from some last-time buys of legacy products.  Gross margin, excluding special items, is expected to be 51%, plus or minus 1%. Operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be roughly flat or in the range of $198 million to $208 million. Interest income and other and interest expense, excluding special items, is expected to net to income of approximately $5 million. Special items are expected to net to approximately $35 million to $55 million.
The GAAP and non-GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately $13 million for Q4. We expect Q4 GAAP income per share from continuing operations in the range of negative $0.04 to a positive $0.08, and non-GAAP income from continuing operations in the range of $0.06 to $0.14 per share. This share count is expected to be approximately 580 million shares for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes.
In addition, we expect depreciation and software amortization of approximately $16 million and capital expenditures of approximately $12 million.
In closing, we delivered solid revenues and non-GAAP operating margins in Q3, and demonstrated solid year-over-year progress on operating income expansion and EPS growth. We remain focused on driving operating leverage and continue to partner with our key suppliers and customers to work through the business challenges associated with the flooding in Thailand.
Now let me turn the call to Sujal."

So there's still a lot of unknowns and everyone's right now focused on Q4, in maximizing output for Q4. I think it's impossible to predict what's going to happen in Q1. It's going to be a function of how fast factories come back online, supply lines come back online, as well as what happens to some of the demand that doesn't get fulfilled in Q1 and then obviously, inventories likely are going to get heavily depleted through this quarter with this situation and will likely require some recovery in Q1. But all of those puts and takes, it's really impossible to call Q1 today."

Let me -- I mean, those are all good questions, but let me make sure you've got the full picture. First of all, let me give you a sense for why we're making the acquisition and the strategic rationale behind it. First and foremost, it significantly enhances our competitive position in the very fast growing server and storage PCIe flash adapter space, which is a marketplace that certainly has been created by companies such as Fusion-io. We are also very active in that product category now and we'll have a very comprehensive product line, and having a flash storage processor capability such as SandForce's only solidifies our competitiveness. Secondly, LSI's engineering investment and focus in SSDs has been more aimed at a custom implementation for those SSD and NAND providers that are using sort of a custom approach for flash storage processors within their SSDs. SandForce has been focused on delivering a complete standard product with all the firmware product ties as well. The combination of the 2 companies, I think, absolutely positions us to be a market leader as SSD is for Ultrabooks, notebooks and enterprise flash base solutions grows. And so that's the second big objective. And then back to your question around growth. We believe the aggregate sort of market, which is composed of flash-based processors for all types of SSDs, as well as the PCIe flash adapter market, is going to be at least $2 billion, and we believe we're very conservative based on what others are saying here in several years and the market in aggregate is growing 40% to 60% annually. So this positions us much more strongly to participate in a very fast-growing market."

We have some last-time buys that are taking place in our legacy business, which are certainly helping that business to be the flat to slightly down that we characterized. So that is one certain driver that is setting us apart from others that are out there. I would say that our declines for, let's just say, not in the life-based sort of business, we are declining, and I would say the decline is probably not as significant as others that have guided for Q4. But that's also partly because we have seen the benefits of product cycles and share gains in our go-forward networking business. Does that help?"
