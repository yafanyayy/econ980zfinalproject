That provide our 2011 outlook and we'll take your questions.
Our Q4 results reflected a strong finish to 2010. From a total company perspective, we delivered high quality top and bottom line results in a more difficult environment than any of us has anticipated. We delivered a good balance between volume/mix and pricing despite the significant pricing actions taken since August to offset input costs. In fact, in our base business, vol/mix growth more that 2/3 of our top line growth in both the  fourth quarter and for the full year. At the same time, we continued to invest behind our Power Brands. Advertising and consumer spending in the quarter on our base business was in line with very strong levels in Q4 2009 and up double digit for the full year.  And finally, we realized significant benefits from productivity improvements and overhead cost savings.
Our Q4 momentum was broad-based, with contributions from every geography. In Developing Markets, we once again delivered double-digit revenue growth. Asia Pacific and Latin America led the region, while the trend in our CEEMA business improved with high single-digit growth. In Europe, we delivered another quarter of solid revenue gains with growth in each of our key categories. In addition, despite sharply higher input costs, Europe continue to expand operating margin.
We were especially pleased that North America had a strong finish to the year, with revenue improving sequentially. In fact, top line growth was the strongest we have seen in some time. This was driven by significantly better volumes versus the prior year as we stepped up merchandising activity and introduced several new marketing campaigns. 
Of course, one of our key goals in 2010 was the integration of Cadbury, and I'm pleased to report that it's progressing well. In fact, it's running ahead of our investment case. That said, in the fourth quarter and for the full year, Cadbury revenue growth was somewhat below our expectations. In addition to the inventory destocking we told you about several months ago, the Gum and Candy categories were disproportionally hurt by the weak consumer environment in a number of major markets. Chocolate, however, was ahead of plan, fueled by increased marketing support.
Looking ahead, the inventory destocking is behind us. We'll build on our strong market shares and we're investing in marketing and innovation to reinvigorate growth in the Gum and Candy categories. On the bottom line, the earnings dilution from the acquisition was $0.11, approximately $0.05 better than our expectations. This was driven by our combination of earlier delivery of cost synergies, as well as lower interest expense and share dilution. What's more, we significantly increased advertising and marketing support in key markets, which drove market share growth in all categories, including Gum and Candy. More importantly, we now expect the Cadbury acquisition will turn earnings accretive in 2011. That is accretive to operating EPS, not just to cash EPS, as we had previously guided.
In terms of the balance sheet, our focus on working capital has already begun to pay dividends. Cash generated from the Cadbury business more than doubled versus the 2010 plan and was well in excess of their historical levels. This was a key contributor to the lower leverage on our year end balance sheet. The infusion of Cadbury talent into our organization is all so going well. I'm really pleased with the retention of top talent, and as I've noted before, about a third of our top 400 executives came to us from Cadbury. I'm very proud of how well our people have come together as a team with a shared commitment to a performance-driven, values-led company.
Finally, a quick update on the Cadbury cost synergies. As I said earlier, we're running ahead of plan. In 2010, we realized about 25% of the $750 million in targeted cost synergies. That's better than our earlier estimate of 15%. And we remain on track to deliver about 70% of our synergies in 2011.
On the cost side, we've spent about 40% of the estimated $1.5 billion in Integration Program costs. That's somewhat lower than our prior estimate of 50%, but that's mainly due to timing. 
Let me now turn it over to Tim to discuss our fourth quarter results in more detail."

As I'll outline over the next few minutes, our results were in line with our expectations. We posted stronger operating gains from our base business, offset by rapidly rising input costs and the persistently weak consumer environment in many markets. Now let me provide some details, starting with our top line.
Organic net revenue from the combined business grew 5.7%, as focused investments drove continued strong growth in our Power Brands in every region. In fact, these brands collectively grew 8% in the fourth quarter. In the Kraft base business, organic revenues increased 6.5% driven by 4.6 points from vol/mix and 1.9 points from pricing. The strong vol/mix gains are encouraging, as we raised prices in many categories to offset sharply higher input costs. 
In the Cadbury business, organic revenues rose 2.2%, which was clearly lower than we would expect on an ongoing basis. Growth was tempered again this quarter by our decision to normalize trade inventories in certain markets. This reduced Cadbury's overall top line growth by about 60 basis points. In addition, the Gum and Candy categories were soft. This was a result of economic conditions leading to weaker consumption by team by the heaviest consumers. As Irene said, we have solid plans in place for 2011 to reinvigorate consumption in these important categories.
Turning to profit, our operating interim margin, excluding acquisition and Integration Program costs, was 11.6%. In our Kraft base business, operating income margin fell slightly to 11.1%. There were several factors at work here. On the positive side, we posted strong gains from our productivity programs. And we have significantly lower overhead costs versus the prior year. Offsetting these, we continued to increase investment behind our brands. But the biggest factor in the fourth quarter was the rapid escalation of input costs. This gross tempered both gross margin and outline margins in every region during the quarter.
To give you some perspective, let's look at the trend in year-over-year changes for our Kraft base business. As you can see on Slide 8 in both the fourth quarter 2009 and first quarter 2010, these costs were favorable year-over-year. During these quarters, we benefited from the carryover of 2009 pricing actions. Pricing caught up with input cost levels, and hence, our gross margins were stronger in those quarters. In fact, our gross margins in Q4 2009 were the highest they have been since the fourth quarter of 2004. 
During the second quarter of 2010, the year-over-year impact of input costs was roughly flat, but the trend has continued to deteriorate since then. As we told you in our Q3 call, we had already started to take pricing across several categories. And we knew that margins would be under pressure in the near-term. But even those actions were insufficient, as input costs continued to increase sharply during the fourth quarter. In fact, Q4 input costs in our base business were up nearly $500 million and our margins suffered accordingly. 
Our current expectation is that input costs will remain high throughout 2011. As a result, we're now in the process of implementing further pricing actions to reflect these higher input cost levels. We expect that pricing will continue to lag input cost in the first half of the year. This will pressure gross margins. However, they should recover in the back half of the year as prices and costs become better aligned.
Turning to EPS, let me walk you through the bridge for the quarter.Let's start with Q4 of 2009 where we were $0.48. $0.04 of that came from the divested Pizza business. We also spent $0.03 on Cadbury acquisition-related costs and financing fees. So from a year ago base of $0.47, our operating EPS was essentially flat at $0.46 and in line with our expectations. 
Our Kraft base business had another strong quarter, delivering $0.06 of operating gains versus the prior year. This was offset by a combination of losses on some small divestitures, unfavorable FX and asset impairments. Cadbury operating earnings contributed $0.15 to EPS, that's a little ahead of expectations mainly from the early delivery of cost synergies. Below the line, interest and shares were higher due to funding the Cadbury acquisition. This was offset in part from the proceeds from the pizza sale. Interest expense also came in higher due to cost related to the early retirement of debt. This is offset by the benefits of the lower than anticipated tax rate.
For the full year, I'd like to highlight two key points: First, improved vol/mix, productivity and overhead savings grew 22% of operating gains in our Kraft base business, and we did this while continuing to increase investment in our Power Brands across the portfolio; second, we delivered on our commitments to earn at least $2 of operating EPS this year, and we did so in a high quality manner. 
I'll take a few minutes after share highlights of our business results by geography.  In North America, we made good progress within a weak consumer environment. On a combined basis, organic net revenues grew 3.3%, up from 1% in the third quarter. In addition, top line growth was broad-based, with revenue increasing in all business units but one. In fact, we used share in more than half the businesses in Q4. 
We continue to invest behind our Power Brands, and they responded by growing 5%. There were many stars in the quarter. Here are just a view that single to double-digit: Oreo, Ritz , Wispa, Maxwell House, Planters and Macaroni and Cheese. In the Kraft base business, organic revenues grew 4.1%, which was the best top line performance in more than two years. Higher merchandising and the successful multibrand huddle to  fight Huddle to Fight Hunger campaign with the vol/mix gains at 2.4 percentage points. 
Pricing, net of promotion, grow an additional 1.7 points to the growth. Cadbury organic net revenues, however, were disappointing, declining 6.1% in the quarter. This reflected two headwinds: Difficult comparisons in Gum against major Trident and Stride product launches in the prior quarter, and tough comparisons with last year's strong shipments of Halls due to the H1N1 flu season. Both of these were anticipated in our plan. In addition, there was heavy promotional spending in major product launch by a Gum competitor in 2010.
Looking ahead, we expect the business to regain momentum in Q1, with the launch of Trident Vitality and Strides  Spark, as well as continued strong growth in Dentyne.
Next let's look at profitability. On a combined basis, our operating income margin in North America was 14.2%. Our Cadbury business posted strong operating income margin of 22.8%, driven by productivity gains and improved product mix. In our Kraft base business, IO margin declined to 13.5%. This was largely driven by timing. First, the increase in input cost outpaced pricing and productivity gains. And second, our merchandising and promotional program was significantly more skewed to the fourth quarter this year versus the prior year.
Looking forward, in the face of substantial input cost inflation, we're in the process of implementing another round of price increases in our North American portfolio. While this will pressure margins in the near term, we'll use the combination of pricing, productivity and overhead savings to improve margins for the full year.
In Europe, combined organic revenues increased 1.6%, fueled by our Power Brands, which collectively grew 6% across the region. In our Kraft base business, momentum mentioned continued as organic revenues grew 2.2% overall, driven by two points from vol/mix gains. Moreover, revenue growth was broad-based, with increases in each of our key categories. 
Chocolate grew low single digits, driven by strong in-store marketing activities, promotional programs and new products. Toblerone and Milka each delivered high single-digit growth. Our Biscuit business grew, driven by the strength of our Power Brands, including double-digit gains by both Oreo and Belvita. The strong momentum in the Chocobakery platform also drove vol/mix gains. 
Weak economic conditions, particularly in Benelux and Southern Europe, and lower pricing partially offset these gains. Coffee grew low single digits, driven by pricing in response to higher input costs. On-demand market expansion and more brewer sales drove midteens growth in Tassimo. Cheese grew high single digits, primarily reflecting a successful marketing campaign and new product launches of Philadelphia.
In our Cadbury business, organic net revenues were essentially flat, solid growth in the U.K. was offset by weak Gum and Candy markets in Southern Europe. Operating income margins in Europe rose to 11.1% on a combined basis. This reflected productivity, overhead savings and improved product mix. 
In our Kraft base business, IO margin improved by 160 basis points to 9.8%, while our Cadbury business also reported solid OI margin of 14.5% in the quarter. In Europe, as in North America, input costs are rising significantly and we're pricing accordingly. In fact, we've already implemented or announced price increases in the large majority of our European portfolio. That said, in the fourth quarter, the contribution from pricing trailed input cost inflation and we're  in the process of implementing another round of price increases.
Turning now to Developing Markets, combined organic net revenue increased 13.6%, fueled by 18% growth in our Power Brands. This was very strong growth even after adjusting for accounting calendar changes that added 3.7 percentage points. Increased market investments drove growth of 17.3% in the Kraft base business and strong share gains in priority markets in key categories. 
In Latin America, organic revenues rose by more than 20%, propelled by strong gains in Brazil and the Andean countries. Power Brands grew more than 25%, led by Oreo, Club Social, Lacta and Tang. 
In Asia Pacific, organic revenues grew 30% due to strong vol/mix gains in China, Indonesia and the Philippines. Power Brands, collectively, grew more than 50%, led by Oreo, Tiger Biskuat and Tang. And in CEEMA, key markets are improving, although market conditions remained weak. This region delivered organic revenue growth in the high single digits, led by gains in Ukraine, Russia and the Middle East. Power Brands collectively grew 8%, led by Tang and Toca. 
In our Cadbury business, organic revenues rose a solid 6.7%, including a negative impact of 1.4 percentage points from normalizing trade inventories. Growth came from gains across all categories. Our operating income margin in Developing Markets was 12.6%. In our Kraft base business, profit margins rose to 11.9%, while OI margins from our Cadbury business were also strong at 13.9%. Overall, overhead leverage and pricing offset sharply higher input costs.
Finally, I'd like to update you on our deleveraging plant, which is formerly on track. Over the past 12 months, our net debt has decreased by about $4  billion to $26.2 billion. A key enabler of this has been strong free cash flow from operations. Adjusting for the sale of the Pizza business, we generated about $3.3 million in free cash flow. This reflected solid progress in working capital efficiency and the Kraft base business and a significant reduction in working capital in the Cadbury business. As a result, we've been able to take several important actions this year to reduce debt. 
As we intended at the time of the deal, we paid back the acquisition bridge loan with proceeds from the sale of the North American Pizza business. We settled the $500 million August maturity with cash from operations, and we repurchased $1.5 billion in debt with cash from operations and short-term commercial paper. 
Looking forward, we're on tract to achieve a debt-to-EBITDA ratio approaching 3x within the next 12 months. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Irene, who will discuss our outlook for 2011."

As you've seen, we delivered solid financial results in 2010, and we entered 2011 with broad-based momentum for three key reasons: First, we're firmly committed to continuing to invest behind our Power Brands, our innovation pipeline and revenue synergies from the Cadbury integration. These investments are critical to put protecting our share and delivering long-term growth. In fact, we just began to scratch the surface on the approximately $1 billion in revenue synergies enabled by Cadbury. As expected, these synergies were modest in 2010, but they'll ramp up over the next three years old. 
Second, our Developing Markets business continues to generate strong double-digit growth, and as a result of the Cadbury acquisition, it's an even greater part of our portfolio. So we're well-positioned to continue to capitalize on our larger footprint in this fast growing region.
Third, we have strong cost savings programs. On our base business, productivity and overhead efficiencies will drive significant gains. These savings, along with the Cadbury synergies, will expand operating margin.
At the same time, the operating environment continues to be challenging. Unemployment rates remain high. Consumer confidence is weak, and government austerity programs are planned in some markets. In the face of this consumer weakness, input costs continued to rise, and that will require additional pricing. That said, we remain cautiously optimistic. Cautious about what we can't control, but optimistic about what we can. Cautious about the consumer environment, but highly optimistic about Kraft's market position and strong momentum. 
Specifically, in 2011, we expect to deliver organic net revenue growth of more than 5% or approximately 4%, excluding the year-over-year impact of calendar changes. However, we're taking a more measured deal at this time of the drivers of this growth, namely more pricing and less vol/mix.
On the bottom line, we're targeting operating EPS growth measured view of 11% to 13%. This guidance is higher than our long-term goal of 9% to 11%, but slightly less bullish than our previous target, reflecting our more conservative view of vol/mix. In some, our business fundamentals are strong, with share gains across most categories and most markets. 
Focused investments behind Power Brands in key categories are driving solid, sustainable growth. Cadbury is on track to be accretive in year 2. And in a challenging consumer environment, we are confident in our ability to deliver strong financial results in the top tier of our peer group. 
Now we'd be happy to take your questions."

So in that sense, I think we're in a much stronger position to be able to talk about pricing. That said, we're not blindly pricing. We are certainly looking to bridge the price value impact of the pricing actions that we're taking. We have programs that we described the Huddle up for Hunger, a program that really allowed us to get strong merchandising support and also consumer value for a very important cost. In that case, hunger. We're looking at packaging option on a number of our businesses that will help us to somewhat mitigate the impact of the pricing action.

With respect to our key customer, our business is certainly improving. We feel very good about the performance in general and versus our competition.

As an example, we're going to be running a Meal Solutions program in about two weeks that helps to drive traffic through their stores and enables them to merchandise a number of their center aisle items.

So there's typically about a quarter's worth of hedge position. Now that varies across geography because there are different dynamics to price. It also depends on the fair amount of the commodity category. For instance, there's not a very deep market in Cheese, and therefore, we tend to be a little less hedged than Cheese. Meats, we tend to be a little shorter on. Some of the problem that we had in the quarter as one of the key ones that have less hedged positions are ran up considerably in the quarter.

I feel particularly good about the composition of the revenue drivers. As we said, about 70% came from vol/mix, but 30% from pricing so we feel very good about that balance. And as we look at what the drivers of that work, it was again, I think, good management of our brands. And we talk a lot about our continued investment in the face of some of the economic challenges in a number of markets. We had a number of very strong programs, for example, in North America in the fourth quarter. We talked about the Huddle to Fight Hunger, we had the new advertising and on a number of our key franchises, Planters nuts , Chips Ahoy!, Mac and Cheese a number of our Power Brands that really served us very, very well. And we have a nice roster of new products that we started to introduce in the fourth quarter, things like Oscar Mayer Carving Board and we had some good new biscuit alternatives. So in general, we feel good about our ability, and that's really why I, as the answer I said to Andrew earlier, we feel good about our ability to take price in the face of some of these challenging economic conditions. As we think about Europe, I feel very good about the continued top line momentum again in the face of some of the challenging economic situation. And as you saw, we had some disproportionate results depending upon the various countries. But overall, we had a good balance of vol/mix and pricing, we've got broad-based business momentum in our Developing Markets I think the -- we feel very good about our ability to continue to grow our Power Brands with the investments and despite the inflation. And so overall, we feel quite good about the performance in the quarter, and we believe it bodes well for the momentum into 2011."

We will have lower interest expense from the retirement of our debt and we've got very strong cost savings program that began to kick in the fourth quarter that will continue into 2011 coming from both growth procurement and as well as overhead efficiency that will -- it should help us to drive the business.

There's no question that Gum was hurt disproportionately as I mentioned from the macroeconomic environment. It seems sort of a funny phenomenon because it's a little pack of Gum, but the facts are the main users a lot of our sales come in the convenience stores. And so it's really -- it was hurt us proportionately, in particular in markets like Southern Europe, it was a big factor in our results there. In addition, as you could imaging there's a fair amount of spending came out of the category in the last 18 months or so given some of the M&A activity. Cadbury is in the heat of battle, had pulled back. We talk a lot about that actually at the time. And so we've been in the process of restoring the spending, as well as ensuring that we have a strong innovation pipeline. And on both of those counts, I feel quite good about the program that we have in 2011. We basically have -- we've seen terrific results in a number of markets, even in Q4, as we've started to reinvest behind the business in markets like Japan, where we were up double digits in the first quarter; markets like Brazil, where we had very strong performance; and even markets like South Africa, that were up double digits; and even markets like Russia, where we were still down, we're able to change the trend as a result of the investments. I feel quite confident that our investment in the category, together with what is a stronger pipeline at the start of the year, we've got Trident vitality coming out, we've got Strides Spark going up and we've got continued strength in events like Dentyne in the U.S. and Clorets in Japan. And so that's the reason we feel quite optimistic about the prospect in 2011 and we continue to see strong, long-term potentially in the Gum and Candy categories."

As we get that half and Easter normalizes and we start to pick up a little margin, we expect probably to be on a cent per share basis, about similar to what it was in the first half. So Eric, we can kind of build on that. If you think about earning seasonality across the quarters, in 2010 was quite a bit different and that a large portion of our earnings and earnings growth was in the first half of the year as opposed to the second half of the year. As you roll forward, keep in mind, in Q1, not only do you have the Easter shift, but we're going to have the full impact of the interest and shares outstanding from the Cadbury deal impact Q1 as well.  So you can kind of put it all together, you'd probably see a much more normalized distribution of earnings across the quarters this year, but because the comparison you may see we'll be down a couple of cents in the first quarter, but then you build from there."

I'll then provide our 2011 outlook, and we'll take your questions.
Our Q4 results reflected a strong finish to 2010. From a total company perspective, we delivered high-quality top and bottom line results in a more difficult environment than any of us had anticipated. We delivered a good balance between volume/mix and pricing despite the significant pricing actions taken since August to offset input costs. In fact, in our base business, vol/mix growth more that 2/3 of our top line growth in both the fourth quarter and for the full year. At the same time, we continued to invest behind our Power Brands. 
Advertising and consumer spending in the quarter on our base business was in line with very strong levels in Q4 2009 and up double digit for the full year.  And finally, we realized significant benefits from productivity improvements and overhead cost savings.
Our Q4 momentum was broad-based, with contributions from every geography. In Developing Markets, we once again delivered double-digit revenue growth. Asia Pacific and Latin America led the region, while the trend in our CEEMA business improved with high single-digit growth. In Europe, we delivered another quarter of solid revenue gains with growth in each of our key categories. In addition, despite sharply higher input costs, Europe continued to expand operating margin.
We were especially pleased that North America had a strong finish to the year, with revenue improving sequentially. In fact, top line growth was the strongest we have seen in some time. This was driven by significantly better volumes versus the prior year, as we stepped up merchandising activity and introduced several new marketing campaigns. 
Of course, one of our key goals in 2010 was the integration of Cadbury, and I'm pleased to report that it's progressing well. In fact, it's running ahead of our investment case. That said, in the fourth quarter and for the full year, Cadbury revenue growth was somewhat below our expectations. 
In addition to the inventory destocking we told you about several months ago, the Gum and Candy categories were disproportionally hurt by the weak consumer environment in a number of major markets. Chocolate, however, was ahead of plan, fueled by increased marketing support.
Looking ahead, the inventory destocking is behind us. We'll build on our strong market shares, and we're investing in marketing and innovation to reinvigorate growth in the Gum and Candy categories. On the bottom line, the earnings dilution from the acquisition was $0.11, approximately $0.05 better than our expectations. This was driven by our combination of earlier delivery of cost synergies, as well as lower interest expense and share dilution. 
What's more, we significantly increased advertising and marketing support in key markets, which drove market share growth in all categories, including Gum and Candy. More importantly, we now expect the Cadbury acquisition will turn earnings accretive in 2011. That is accretive to operating EPS, not just to cash EPS, as we had previously guided.
In terms of the balance sheet, our focus on working capital has already begun to pay dividends. Cash generated from the Cadbury business more than doubled versus the 2010 plan and was well in excess of their historical levels. This was a key contributor to the lower leverage on our year-end balance sheet. The infusion of Cadbury talent into our organization is also going well. I'm really pleased with the retention of top talent. And as I've noted before, about a third of our top 400 executives came to us from Cadbury. I'm very proud of how well our people have come together as a team with a shared commitment to a performance-driven, values-led company.
Finally, a quick update on the Cadbury cost synergies. As I said earlier, we're running ahead of plan. In 2010, we realized about 25% of the $750 million in targeted cost synergies. That's better than our earlier estimate of 15%, and we remain on track to deliver about 70% of our synergies in 2011.
On the cost side, we've spent about 40% of the estimated $1.5 billion in integration program costs. That's somewhat lower than our prior estimate of 50%, but that's mainly due to timing. 
Let me now turn it over to Tim to discuss our fourth quarter results in more detail."

As I'll outline over the next few minutes, our results were in line with our expectations. We posted stronger operating gains from our base business, offset by rapidly rising input costs and a persistently weak consumer environment in many markets. Now let me provide some details, starting with our top line.
Organic net revenue for the combined business grew 5.7%, as focused investments drove continued strong growth in our Power Brands in every region. In fact, these brands collectively grew 8% in the fourth quarter. 
In the Kraft base business, organic revenues increased 6.5%, driven by 4.6 points from vol/mix and 1.9 points from pricing. The strong vol/mix gains are encouraging, as we raised prices in many categories to offset sharply higher input costs. 
In the Cadbury business, organic revenues rose 2.2%, which was clearly lower than we would expect on an ongoing basis. Growth was tempered again this quarter by our decision to normalize trade inventories in certain markets. This reduced Cadbury's overall top line growth by about 60 basis points. 
In addition, the Gum and Candy categories were soft. This was a result of economic conditions leading to weaker consumption by teens for the heaviest consumers. As Irene said, we have solid plans in place for 2011 to reinvigorate consumption in these important categories.
Turning to profit, our operating income margin, excluding acquisition and integration program costs, was 11.6%. In our Kraft base business, operating income margin fell slightly to 11.1%. There were several factors at work here. On the positive side, we posted strong gains from our productivity programs, and we have significantly lower overhead costs versus the prior year. 
Offsetting these, we continued to increase investment behind our brands, but the biggest factor in the fourth quarter was the rapid escalation of input costs. This tempered both gross margin and OI margins in every region during the quarter.
To give you some perspective, let's look at the trend in year-over-year changes for our Kraft base business. As you can see on Slide 8 in both the fourth quarter 2009 and first quarter 2010, these costs were favorable year-over-year. During these quarters, we benefited from the carryover effect of 2009 pricing actions. Pricing caught up with input cost levels, and hence, our gross margins were stronger in those quarters. In fact, our gross margins in Q4 2009 were the highest they have been since the first quarter of 2004. 
During the second quarter of 2010, the year-over-year effect of input costs was roughly flat, but the trend has continued to deteriorate since then. As we told you in our Q3 call, we had already started to take pricing across several categories. And we knew that margins would be under pressure in the near term. But even those actions were insufficient, as input costs continued to increase sharply during the fourth quarter. In fact, Q4 input costs in our base business were up nearly $0.5 billion, and our margins suffered accordingly. 
Our current expectation is that input costs will remain high throughout 2011. As a result, we're now in the process of implementing further pricing actions to reflect these higher input cost levels. We expect that pricing will continue to lag input costs in the first half of the year. This will pressure gross margins. However, they should recover in the back half of the year, as prices and costs become better aligned.
Turning to EPS, let me walk you through the bridge for the quarter. Let's start with Q4 of 2009 where we were in $0.48, $0.04 of that came from the divested Pizza business. We also spent $0.03 on Cadbury acquisition-related costs and financing fees. So from a year-ago base of $0.47, our operating EPS was essentially flat at $0.46 and in line with our expectations. 
Our Kraft base business had another strong quarter, delivering $0.06 of operating gains versus the prior year. This was offset by a combination of losses on some small divestitures, unfavorable FX and asset impairments. Cadbury operating earnings contributed $0.15 to EPS, that's a little ahead of expectations mainly from the early delivery of cost synergies. 
Below the line, interest and shares were higher due to funding the Cadbury acquisition. This was offset, in part, from the proceeds from the Pizza sale. Interest expense also came in higher, due to costs related to the early retirement of debt. This was offset by the benefits of a lower-than-anticipated tax rate.
For the full year, I'd like to highlight two key points. First, improved vol/mix, productivity and overhead savings drove 22% of operating gains in our Kraft base business, and we did this while continuing to increase investment in our Power Brands across the portfolio. Second, we delivered on our commitments to earn at least $2 of operating EPS this year, and we did so in a high quality manner. 
I'll take a few minutes now to share highlights of our business results by geography.  In North America, we made good progress within a weak consumer environment. On a combined basis, organic net revenues grew 3.3%, up from 1% in the third quarter. In addition, top line growth was broad-based, with revenue increasing in all business units but one. In fact, we used share in more than half the businesses in Q4. 
We continue to invest behind our Power Brands, and they responded by growing 5%. There were many stars in the quarter. Here are just a view that grew mid-single to low double digits: Oreo, Ritz , Wheat Thins, Maxwell House, Planters and Macaroni & Cheese. 
In the Kraft base business, organic revenues grew 4.1%, which was the best top line performance in more than two years. Higher merchandising and the successful multibrand Huddle to Fight Hunger campaign fueled vol/mix gains at 2.4 percentage points. 
Pricing, net of promotion, drove an additional 1.7 points in growth. Cadbury organic net revenues, however, were disappointing, declining 6.1% in the quarter. This reflected two headwinds: Difficult comparisons in Gum against major Trident and Stride product launches in the prior quarter, and tough comparisons with last year's strong shipments of Halls due to the H1N1 flu season. Both of these were anticipated in our plan. In addition, there was heavy promotional spending and a major new product launch by a gum competitor in 2010.
Looking ahead, we expect the business to regain momentum in Q1, with the launch of Trident Vitality and Strides SPARK, as well as continued strong growth in Dentyne.
Next let's look at profitability. On a combined basis, our operating income margin in North America was 14.2%. Our Cadbury business posted strong operating income margin of 22.8%, driven by productivity gains and an improved product mix. In our Kraft base business, OI margin declined to 13.5%. This was largely driven by timing. First, the increase in input costs outpaced pricing and productivity gains. And second, our merchandising and promotional program was significantly more skewed to the fourth quarter this year versus the prior year.
Looking forward, in the face of substantial input cost inflation, we're in the process of implementing another round of price increases in our North American portfolio. While this will pressure margins in the near term, we'll use a combination of pricing, productivity and overhead savings to improve margins for the full year.
In Europe, combined organic revenues increased 1.6%, fueled by our Power Brands, which collectively grew 6% across the region. In our Kraft base business, momentum continued as our organic revenues grew 2.2%, overall, driven by two points from vol/mix gains. Moreover, revenue growth was broad-based with increases in each of our key categories. 
Chocolate grew low-single digits, driven by strong in-store marketing activities, promotional programs and new products. Toblerone and Milka each delivered high single-digit growth. Our Biscuit business grew, driven by the strength of our Power Brands, including double-digit gains by both Oreo and Belvita. The strong momentum in the chocobakery platform also drove vol/mix gains. 
Weak economic conditions, particularly in Benelux and Southern Europe, and lower pricing partially offset these gains. Coffee grew low single digits, driven by pricing in response to higher input costs. On-demand market expansion and more brewer sales drove midteens growth in Tassimo. Cheese grew high single digits, primarily reflecting a successful marketing campaign and new product launches of Philadelphia.
In our Cadbury business, organic net revenues were essentially flat. Solid growth in the U.K. was offset by weak gum and candy markets in Southern Europe. Operating income margins in Europe rose to 11.1% on a combined basis. This reflected productivity, overhead savings and improved product mix. 
In our Kraft base business, OI margin improved by 160 basis points to 9.8%, while our Cadbury business also reported solid OI margin of 14.5% in the quarter. In Europe, as in North America, input costs are rising significantly, and we're pricing accordingly. In fact, we've already implemented or announced price increases in the large majority of our European portfolio. That said, in the fourth quarter, the contribution from pricing trailed input cost inflation, and we're  in the process of implementing another round of price increases.
Turning now to developing markets, combined organic net revenue increased 13.6%, fueled by 18% growth in our Power Brands. This was a very strong growth even after adjusting for accounting calendar changes that added 3.7 percentage points. Increased market investments drove growth of 17.3% in the Kraft base business and strong share gains in priority markets and key categories. 
In Latin America, organic revenues rose by more than 20%, propelled by strong gains in Brazil and the Andean countries. Power Brands grew more than 25%, led by Oreo, Club Social, Lacta and Tang. 
In Asia Pacific, organic revenues grew 30% due to strong vol/mix gains in China, Indonesia and the Philippines. Power Brands, collectively, grew more than 50%, led by Oreo, Tiger Biskuat and Tang. And in CEEMA, key markets are improving, although market conditions remained weak. This region delivered organic revenue growth in the high single digits, led by gains in Ukraine, Russia and the Middle East. Power Brands collectively grew 8%, led by Tang and Milka. 
In our Cadbury business, organic revenues rose a solid 6.7%, including a negative impact of 1.4 percentage points from normalizing trade inventories. Growth came from gains across all categories. Our operating income margin in developing markets was 12.6%. In our Kraft base business, profit margins rose to 11.9%, while OI margins in our Cadbury business were also strong at 13.9%. Overall, overhead leverage and pricing offset sharply higher input costs.
Finally, I'd like to update you on our deleveraging plant, which is firmly on track. Over the past 12 months, our net debt has decreased by about $4  billion to $26.2 billion. A key enabler of this has been a strong free cash flow from operations. Adjusting for the sale of the Pizza business, we generated about $3.3 billion in free cash flow. This reflected solid progress in working capital efficiency in the Kraft base business and a significant reduction in working capital in the Cadbury business. As a result, we've been able to take several important actions this year to reduce debt. 
As we intended at the time of the deal, we paid back the acquisition bridge loan with proceeds from the sale of the North American Pizza business. We settled the $500 million August maturity with cash from operations, and we repurchased $1.5 billion in debt with cash from operations and short-term commercial paper. 
Looking forward, we're on track to achieve a debt-to-EBITDA ratio approaching 3x within the next 12 months. With that, I would like to turn the call back to Irene, who will discuss our outlook for 2011."

As you've seen, we delivered solid financial results in 2010, and we entered 2011 with broad-based momentum for three key reasons. First, we're firmly committed to continuing to invest behind our Power Brands, our innovation pipeline and revenue synergies from the Cadbury integration.  These investments are critical to put protecting our share and delivering long-term growth. In fact, we've just begun to scratch the surface on the approximately $1 billion in revenue synergies enabled by Cadbury. As expected, these synergies were modest in 2010, but they'll ramp up over the next three years old. 
Second, our Developing Market business continues to generate strong double-digit growth, and as a result of the Cadbury acquisition, it's an even greater part of our portfolio. So we're well-positioned to continue to capitalize on our larger footprint in this fast growing region.
Third, we have strong cost savings programs. On our base business, productivity and overhead efficiencies will drive significant gains. These savings, along with the Cadbury synergies, will expand operating margin.
At the same time, the operating environment continues to be challenging. Unemployment rates remain high. Consumer confidence is weak, and government austerity programs are planned in some markets. In the face of this consumer weakness, input costs continued to rise, and that will require additional pricing. That said, we remain cautiously optimistic, cautious about what we can't control, but optimistic about what we can. Cautious about the consumer environment, but highly optimistic about Kraft's market position and strong momentum. 
Specifically, in 2011, we expect to deliver organic net revenue growth of more than 5% or approximately 4%, excluding the year-over-year impact of calendar changes. However, we're taking a more measured view at this time of the drivers of this growth, namely more pricing and less vol/mix.
On the bottom line, we're targeting operating EPS growth of 11% to 13%. This guidance is higher than our long-term goal of 9% to 11%, but slightly less bullish than our previous target, reflecting our more conservative view of vol/mix. In some, our business fundamentals are strong, with share gains across most categories and most markets. 
Focused investments behind Power Brands in key categories are driving solid, sustainable growth. Cadbury is on track to be accretive in year 2. And in a challenging consumer environment, we're confident in our ability to deliver strong financial results in the top tier of our peer group. 
Now we'd be happy to take your questions."

We have programs that we described, the Huddle up for Hunger (sic) [Huddle to Fight Hunger] program that really allowed us to get strong merchandising support and also consumer value for a very important cause, in that case, hunger.

And so, I think it's is coming back. We feel very good about the performance in the fourth quarter. We were up in the high single digits.

We were very pleased with our fourth quarter results for a whole bunch of reasons. The aggregate results, we felt very good about. I feel particularly good about the composition of the revenue drivers. As we said, about 70% came from vol/mix, about 30% from pricing, so we feel very good about that balance. And as we look at what's the drivers of that were, it was, again, I think, good management of our brands. And we talked a lot about our continued investment in the face of some of the economic challenges in a number of markets. We had a number of very strong programs, for example, in North America in the fourth quarter. We talked about this Huddle to Fight Hunger. We had the new advertising and on a number of our key franchises, Planters, Ritz, [ph] Chips Ahoy!, Mac & Cheese, a number of our Power Brands that really served us very, very well. And we have a nice roster of new products that we started to introduce in the fourth quarter, things like Oscar Mayer Carving Board, and we had some good new biscuit alternatives. So in general, we feel good about our ability, and that's really why I gave the answer I gave to Andrew earlier, we feel good about our ability to take price in the face of some of these challenging economic conditions. As we think about Europe, I feel very good about the continued top line momentum, again, in the face of some of the challenging economic situation. And as you saw, we had some disproportionate results depending upon the various countries. But overall, we had a good balance of vol/mix and pricing. We've got broad-based business momentum. And in our developing markets, we feel very good about our ability to continue to grow our Power Brands with the investments and despite the inflation. And so, overall, we feel quite good about the performance in the quarter, and we believe it bodes well for the momentum into 2011."

As I said, the impact of lesser contributions from vol/mix will have some impact on our earnings, but I feel quite confident that we have a number of levers that are going to enable us to deliver the guidance that we've laid out. We started off with the fact that Cadbury turns accretive in 2011. We will have lower interest expense from the retirement of our debt, and we've got very strong cost savings program that began to kick in, in the fourth quarter that will continue into 2011, coming from both procurement and as well as overhead efficiencies that should help us to drive the business.

It seems sort of a funny phenomenon, because it's a little pack of gum. But the facts are teenagers are the main users, and a lot of our sales come in the convenience stores. And so it was hurt disproportionately, and particularly in markets like Southern Europe. It was a big factor in our results there. In addition, as you could imagine, there's a fair amount of spending came out of the category in the last 18 months or so, given some of the M&A activity. Cadbury, in the heat of battle, had pulled back. We talked a lot about that actually at that time. And so, we've been in the process of restoring the spending as well as ensuring that we have a strong innovation pipeline. And on both of those counts, I feel quite good about the program that we have in 2011. We've seen terrific results in a number of markets, even in Q4, as we started to reinvest behind the business in markets like Japan, where we were up double digits in the fourth quarter; markets like Brazil, where we had very strong performance; and even markets like South Africa, that were up double digits; and even markets like Russia, where we were still down, we were able to change the trend as a result of the investments. I feel quite confident that our investment in the category, together with what is a stronger pipeline at the start of the year, we've got Trident Vitality coming out. We've got Strides SPARK coming out, as well as we've got continued strength on brands like Dentyne in the U.S. and Clorets in Japan. And so that's the reason we feel quite optimistic about the prospects in 2011, and we continue to see strong, long-term potentially in the Gum and Candy categories."

From a total company per",725,"Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon. Tim and I will start today with the highlights of our fourth quarter results. I'll then provide our 2011 outlook, and we'll take your questions.
Our Q4 results reflected a strong finish to 2010. From a total company perspective, we delivered high-quality top and bottom line results in a more difficult environment than any of us had anticipated. We delivered a good balance between volume/mix and pricing despite the significant pricing actions taken since August to offset input costs. In fact, in our base business, vol/mix drove more that 2/3 of our top line growth in both the fourth quarter and for the full year. At the same time, we continued to invest behind our Power Brands. 
Advertising and consumer spending in the quarter on our base business was in line with very strong levels in Q4 2009 and up double digit for the full year.  And finally, we realized significant benefits for productivity improvements and overhead cost savings.
Our Q4 momentum was broad-based, with contributions from every geography. In Developing Markets, we once again delivered double-digit revenue growth. Asia Pacific and Latin America led the region, while the trend in our CEEMA business improved with high single-digit growth. In Europe, we delivered another quarter of solid revenue gains with growth in each of our key categories. In addition, despite sharply higher input costs, Europe continued to expand operating margin.
We were especially pleased that North America had a strong finish to the year, with revenue improving sequentially. In fact, top line growth was the strongest we've seen in some time. This was driven by significantly better volumes versus the prior year, as we stepped up merchandising activity and introduced several new marketing campaigns. 
Of course, one of our key goals in 2010 was the integration of Cadbury, and I'm pleased to report that it's progressing well. In fact, it's running ahead of our investment case. That said, in the fourth quarter and for the full year, Cadbury revenue growth was somewhat below our expectations. 
In addition to the inventory destocking we told you about several months ago, the Gum and Candy categories were disproportionally hurt by the weak consumer environment in a number of major markets. Chocolate, however, was ahead of plan, fueled by increased marketing support.
Looking ahead, the inventory destocking is behind us. We'll build on our strong market shares, and we're investing in marketing and innovation to reinvigorate growth in the Gum and Candy categories. On the bottom line, the earnings dilution from the acquisition was $0.11, approximately $0.05 better than our expectations. This was driven by a combination of earlier delivery of cost synergies, as well as lower interest expense and share dilution. 
What's more, we significantly increased advertising and marketing support in key markets, which drove market share growth in all categories, including Gum and Candy. More importantly, we now expect the Cadbury acquisition will turn earnings accretive in 2011. That is accretive to operating EPS, not just to cash EPS, as we had previously guided.
In terms of the balance sheet, our focus on working capital has already begun to pay dividends. Cash generated from the Cadbury business more than doubled versus the 2010 plan and was well in excess of their historical levels. This was a key contributor to the lower leverage on our year-end balance sheet. The infusion of Cadbury talent into our organization is also going well. I'm really pleased with the retention of top talent. And as I've noted before, about a third of our top 400 executives came to us from Cadbury. I'm very proud of how well our people have come together as a team with a shared commitment to a performance-driven, values-led company.
Finally, a quick update on the Cadbury cost synergies. As I said earlier, we're running ahead of plan. In 2010, we realized about 25% of the $750 million in targeted cost synergies. That's better than our earlier estimate of 15%, and we remain on track to deliver about 70% of our synergies in 2011.
On the cost side, we've spent about 40% of the estimated $1.5 billion in integration program costs. That's somewhat lower than our prior estimate of 50%, but that's mainly due to timing. 
Let me now turn it over to Tim to discuss our fourth quarter results in more detail."

We posted stronger operating gains from our base business, offset by rapidly rising input costs and a persistently weak consumer environment in many markets. Now let me provide some details, starting with our top line.
Organic net revenue for the combined business grew 5.7%, as focused investments drove continued strong growth in our Power Brands in every region. In fact, these brands collectively grew 8% in the fourth quarter. 
In the Kraft base business, organic revenues increased 6.5%, driven by 4.6 points from vol/mix and 1.9 points from pricing. The strong vol/mix gains are encouraging, as we raised prices in many categories to offset sharply higher input costs. 
In the Cadbury business, organic revenues rose 2.2%, which was clearly lower than we would expect on an ongoing basis. Growth was tempered again this quarter by our decision to normalize trade inventories in certain markets. This reduced Cadbury's overall top line growth by about 60 basis points. 
In addition, the Gum and Candy categories were soft. This was a result of economic conditions leading to weaker consumption by teens who are the heaviest consumers. As Irene said, we have solid plans in place for 2011 to reinvigorate consumption in these important categories.
Turning to profit, our operating income margin, excluding acquisition and integration program costs, was 11.6%. In our Kraft base business, operating income margin fell slightly to 11.1%. There were several factors at work here. On the positive side, we posted strong gains from our productivity programs, and we have significantly lower overhead costs versus the prior year. 
Offsetting these, we continued to increase investment behind our brands, but the biggest factor in the fourth quarter was the rapid escalation of input costs. This tempered both gross margin and OI margins in every region during the quarter.
To give you some perspective, let's look at the trend in year-over-year changes for our Kraft base business. As you can see on Slide 8 in both the fourth quarter 2009 and first quarter 2010, these costs were favorable year-over-year. During these quarters, we benefited from the carryover effect of 2009 pricing actions. Pricing caught up with input cost levels, and hence, our gross margins were stronger in those quarters. In fact, our gross margins in Q4 2009 were the highest they have been since the first quarter of 2004. 
During the second quarter of 2010, the year-over-year effect of input costs was roughly flat, but the trend has continued to deteriorate since then. As we told you in our Q3 call, we had already started to take pricing across several categories. And we knew that margins would be under pressure in the near term. But even those actions were insufficient, as input costs continued to increase sharply during the fourth quarter. In fact, Q4 input costs in our base business were up nearly $0.5 billion, and our margin suffered accordingly. 
Our current expectation is that input costs will remain high throughout 2011. As a result, we're now in the process of implementing further pricing actions to reflect these higher input cost levels. We expect that pricing will continue to lag input costs in the first half of the year. This will pressure gross margins. However, they should recover in the back half of the year, as prices and costs become better aligned.
Turning to EPS, let me walk you through the bridge for the quarter. Let's start with Q4 of 2009 when we earned $0.48, $0.04 of that came from the divested Pizza business. We also spent $0.03 on Cadbury acquisition-related costs and financing fees. So from a year-ago base of $0.47, our operating EPS was essentially flat at $0.46 and in line with our expectations. 
Our Kraft base business had another strong quarter, delivering $0.06 of operating gain versus the prior year. This was offset by a combination of losses on some small divestitures, unfavorable FX and asset impairments. Cadbury operating earnings contributed $0.15 to EPS, that's a little ahead of expectations mainly from the early delivery of cost synergies. 
Below the line, interest in shares were higher due to funding the Cadbury acquisition. This was offset, in part, from the proceeds from the Pizza sale. Interest expense also came in higher, due to costs related to the early retirement of debt. This was offset by the benefits of a lower-than-anticipated tax rate.
For the full year, I'd like to highlight two key points. First, improved vol/mix, productivity and overhead savings drove $.22 of operating gains in our Kraft base business, and we did this while continuing to increase investments in our Power Brands across the portfolio. Second, we delivered on our commitments to earn at least $2 of operating EPS this year, and we did so in a high quality manner. 
I'll take a few minutes now to share highlights of our business results by geography.  In North America, we made good progress within a weak consumer environment. On a combined basis, organic net revenues grew 3.3%, up from 1% in the third quarter. In addition, top line growth was broad-based, with revenue increasing in all business units but one. In fact, we grew share in more than half the businesses in Q4. 
We continued to invest behind our Power Brands, and they responded by growing 5%. There were many stars in the quarter. Here are just a view that grew mid-single to low double digits: Oreo, Ritz , Wheat Thins, Maxwell House, Planters and Macaroni & Cheese. 
In the Kraft base business, organic revenues grew 4.1%, which was the best top line performance in more than two years. Higher merchandising and the successful multibrand Huddle to Fight Hunger campaign fueled vol/mix gains of 2.4 percentage points. 
Pricing, net of promotion, drove an additional 1.7 points of growth. Cadbury organic net revenues, however, were disappointing, declining 6.1% in the quarter. This reflected two headwinds: Difficult comparisons in Gum against major Trident and Stride product launches in the prior year quarter, and tough comparisons with last year's strong shipments of Halls due to the H1N1 flu season. Both of these were anticipated in our plan. In addition, there was heavy promotional spending and a major new product launch by a gum competitor in 2010.
Looking ahead, we expect the business to regain momentum in Q1, with the launch of Trident Vitality and Strides SPARK, as well as continued strong growth in Dentyne.
Now let's look at profitability. On a combined basis, our operating income margin in North America was 14.2%. Our Cadbury business posted strong operating income margin of 22.8%, driven by productivity gains and improved product mix. In our Kraft base business, OI margin declined to 13.5%. This was largely driven by timing. First, the increase in input costs outpaced pricing and productivity gains. And second, our merchandising and promotional programming was significantly more skewed to the fourth quarter this year versus the prior year.
Looking forward, in the face of substantial input cost inflation, we're in the process of implementing another round of price increases in our North American portfolio. While this will pressure margins in the near term, we'll use a combination of pricing, productivity and overhead savings to improve margins for the full year.
In Europe, combined organic revenues increased 1.6%, fueled by our Power Brands, which collectively grew 6% across the region. In our Kraft base business, momentum continued as organic revenues grew 2.2%, overall, driven by two points from vol/mix gains. Moreover, revenue growth was broad-based with increases in each of our key categories. 
Chocolate grew low-single digits, driven by strong in-store marketing activities, promotional programs and new products. Toblerone and Milka each delivered high single-digit growth. Our Biscuit business grew, driven by the strength of our Power Brands, including double-digit gains by both Oreo and Belvita. Strong momentum in the chocobakery platform also drove vol/mix gains. 
Weak economic conditions, particularly in Benelux and Southern Europe, and lower pricing partially offset these gains. Coffee grew low single digits, driven by pricing in response to higher input costs. On-demand market expansion and more brewer sales drove mid-teens growth in Tassimo. Cheese grew high single digits, primarily reflecting a successful marketing campaign and new product launches of Philadelphia.
In our Cadbury business, organic net revenues were essentially flat. Solid growth in the U.K. was offset by weak gum and candy markets in Southern Europe. Operating income margins in Europe rose to 11.1% on a combined basis. This reflected productivity, overhead savings and improved product mix. 
In our Kraft base business, OI margin improved by 160 basis points to 9.8%, while our Cadbury business also reported solid OI margin of 14.5% in the quarter. In Europe, as in North America, input costs are rising significantly, and we're pricing accordingly. In fact, we've already implemented or announced price increases in the large majority of our European portfolio. That said, in the fourth quarter, the contribution from pricing trailed input cost inflation, and we're in the process of implementing another round of price increases.
Turning now to developing markets, combined organic net revenue increased 13.6%, fueled by 18% growth in our Power Brands. This was very strong growth even after adjusting for accounting calendar changes that added 3.7 percentage points. Increased market investments drove growth of 17.3% in the Kraft base business and strong share gains in priority markets and key categories. 
In Latin America, organic revenues rose by more than 20%, propelled by strong gains in Brazil and the Andean countries. Power Brands grew more than 25%, led by Oreo, Club Social, Lacta and Tang. 
In Asia Pacific, organic revenues grew 30% due to strong vol/mix gains in China, Indonesia and the Philippines. Power Brands, collectively, grew more than 50%, led by Oreo, Tiger Biskuat and Tang. And in CEEMA, key markets are improving, although market conditions remain weak. This region delivered organic revenue growth in the high single digits, led by gains in Ukraine, Russia and the Middle East. Power Brands collectively grew 8%, led by Tang and Milka. 
In our Cadbury business, organic revenues rose a solid 6.7%, including a negative impact of 1.4 percentage points from normalizing trade inventories. Growth came from gains across all categories. Our operating income margin in developing markets was 12.6%. In our Kraft base business, profit margins rose to 11.9%, while OI margins in our Cadbury business were also strong at 13.9%. Overall, overhead leverage and pricing offset sharply higher input costs.
Finally, I'd like to update you on our deleveraging plan, which is firmly on track. Over the past 12 months, our net debt has decreased by about $4  billion to $26.2 billion. A key enabler of this has been strong free cash flow from operations. Adjusting for the sale of the Pizza business, we generated about $3.3 billion in free cash flow. This reflected solid progress in working capital efficiency in the Kraft base business and a significant reduction in working capital in the Cadbury business. As a result, we've been able to take several important actions this year to reduce debt. 
As we intended at the time of the deal, we paid back the acquisition bridge loan with proceeds from the sale of the North American Pizza business. We settled the $500 million August maturity with cash from operations, and we repurchased $1.5 billion in debt with cash from operations and short-term commercial paper. 
Looking forward, we're on track to achieve a debt-to-EBITDA ratio approaching 3x within the next 12 months. With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Irene, who will discuss our outlook for 2011."
739693,118172519,101937,"Kraft Foods Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2011",2011-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Mondelez International, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tim. As you've seen, we delivered solid financial results in 2010, and we entered 2011 with broad-based momentum for three key reasons.

As you've seen, we delivered solid financial results in 2010, and we entered 2011 with broad-based momentum for three key reasons. First, we're firmly committed to continuing to invest behind our Power Brands, our innovation pipeline and revenue synergies from the Cadbury integration.  These investments are critical to protecting our share and delivering long-term growth. In fact, we've just begun to scratch the surface on the approximately $1 billion in revenue synergies enabled by Cadbury. As expected, these synergies were modest in 2010, but they'll ramp up over the next three years. 
Second, our Developing Market business continues to generate strong double-digit growth, and as a result of the Cadbury acquisition, it's an even greater part of our portfolio. So we're well-positioned to continue to capitalize on our larger footprint in this fast growing region.
Third, we have strong cost savings programs. On our base business, productivity and overhead efficiencies will drive significant gains. These savings, along with the Cadbury synergies, will expand operating margin.
At the same time, the operating environment continues to be challenging. Unemployment rates remain high. Consumer confidence is weak, and government austerity programs are planned in some markets. In the face of this consumer weakness, input costs continue to rise, and that will require additional pricing. That said, we remain cautiously optimistic, cautious about what we can't control, but optimistic about what we can. Cautious about the consumer environment, but highly optimistic about Kraft's market position and strong momentum. 
Specifically, in 2011, we expect to deliver organic net revenue growth of more than 5% or approximately 4%, excluding the year-over-year impact of calendar changes. However, we're taking a more measured view at this time of the drivers of this growth, namely more pricing and less vol/mix.
On the bottom line, we're targeting operating EPS growth of 11% to 13%. This guidance is higher than our long-term goal of 9% to 11%, but slightly less bullish than our previous target, reflecting our more conservative view of vol/mix. In sum, our business fundamentals are strong, with share gains across most categories and most markets. 
Focused investments behind Power Brands in key categories are driving solid, sustainable growth. Cadbury is on track to be accretive in year 2. And in a challenging consumer environment, we're confident in our ability to deliver strong financial results in the top tier of our peer group. 
Now we'd be happy to take your questions."

So in that sense, I think we're in a much stronger position to be able to talk about pricing. That said, we're not blindly pricing. We are certainly looking to bridge the price value impact of the pricing actions that we're taking. We have programs like we described, the Huddle up for Hunger (sic) [Huddle to Fight Hunger] program that really allowed us to get strong merchandising support and offer consumer value for a very important cause, in that case, hunger. We're looking at packaging options on a number of our businesses that will help us to somewhat mitigate the impact of the pricing action.

And so, I think it's coming back. We feel very good about the performance in the fourth quarter. We were up in the high single digits.

We had new advertising on a number of our key franchises, Planters, Ritz, Triscuit, Chips Ahoy!, Mac & Cheese, a number of our Power Brands that really served us very, very well. And we have a nice roster of new products that we started to introduce in the fourth quarter, things like Oscar Mayer Carving Board, and we had some good new biscuit alternatives.

As we think about Europe, I feel very good about the continued top line momentum, again, in the face of some of the challenging economic situation.

I mean, there are a lot of food companies who are saying this. I'm just curious, do you think that you may have any type of additional competitive advantage just because of the level of marketing that you expect to put behind your products in 2011 relative to competition?"

But I think the opportunity for us, because we have a broad portfolio, we have very, very strong iconic brands for the consumer. It gives us the opportunity to have discussions with them about snacking solutions, about meal solutions, about Huddle for Hunger programs and those sorts of things, and I feel very good about continuing to leverage capabilities in the U.S. Our sales capabilities like wall-to-wall, which enable us then to merchandise a number of those products in stores.

It seems sort of a funny phenomenon, because it's a little pack of gum. But the facts are teenagers are the main users, and a lot of our sales come in convenience stores. And so it was hurt disproportionately, and particularly in markets like Southern Europe. It was a big factor in our results there. In addition, as you could imagine, there's a fair amount of spending came out of the category in the last 18 months or so, given some of the M&A activity. Cadbury, in the heat of battle, had pulled back. We talked a lot about that actually at that time. And so, we've been in the process of restoring the spending as well as ensuring that we have a strong innovation pipeline. And on both of those counts, I feel quite good about the program that we have in 2011. We've seen terrific results in a number of markets, even in Q4, as we started to reinvest behind the business in markets like Japan, where we were up double digits in the fourth quarter; markets like Brazil, where we had very strong performance; and even markets like South Africa, that were up double digits; and even markets like Russia, where we were still down, we were able to change the trend as a result of the investments. I feel quite confident that our investment in the category, together with what is a stronger pipeline at the start of the year, we've got Trident Vitality coming out. We've got Strides SPARK coming out, as well as we've got continued strength on brands like Dentyne in the U.S. and Clorets in Japan. So that's the reason we feel quite optimistic about the prospects in 2011, and we continue to see strong, long-term potential in the Gum and Candy categories."

I'm very pleased that we got off to a strong start in 2011. On the top line, organic revenues grew more than 4.5% despite the Easter shift into the second quarter. And on the bottom line, our operating EPS increased more tha",468,"Thanks, Chris. Good afternoon. I'm very pleased that we got off to a strong start in 2011. On the top line, organic revenues grew more than 4.5% despite the Easter shift into the second quarter. And on the bottom line, our operating EPS increased more than 6% despite a number of headwinds. These included the continuing rise in commodity cost, the Easter shift and the additional interest in higher share count from financing the Cadbury deal. These headline numbers are very encouraging, and as we look to the balance of the year, there are 3 reasons that give me great confidence that we're on track to deliver top-tier results.
First, it's clear that our continuing investment in marketing and innovation are delivering good returns. Around the world, higher levels of brand support are enabling us to take pricing to offset rising input costs. In the face of these price increases, I'm especially pleased that our strong brand equity have enabled us to maintain solid market share. 
Second, the End-to-End Cost Management initiatives that Dave laid out at CAGNY are driving significant improvements in productivity and overheads. Underlying operating income margin rose by 60 basis points, reaching 13.9%. Margins improved despite the fact that our commodity costs were up about 7% to 8% over last year. In addition, we increased our investments in advertising and consumer support by more than 14% on a like-for-like basis. 
Third, we're seeing early benefits from executing as 1 company, following last year's Cadbury acquisition. This is most pronounced in our Developing Markets.
Put it well when we reviewed his first quarter results last week. He said we saw the power of the $50 billion gorilla at work. Indeed, we saw it play out in our ability to deliver our results in the wake of the tragedy in Japan. Despite numerous obstacles, we leveraged our diverse supply chain to get our products to market. As a result, our sales in Japan were up 11% in the first quarter.
And in India, our recent launch of Oreo provide a great example of what we can now accomplish by leveraging our extensive sales footprint. In March, we launched the world's favorite cookie through our chocolate sales network, and I can tell you Oreo is off to a very good start. In less than a month, we've reached more than 300,000 sales outlets across the country. In fact, Oreo's performance is on fire across our entire developing markets region. In the first quarter, sales of Oreo were up 56% versus prior year. This year, we expect Oreo to be a $700 million business in Developing Markets alone. That's up from about $175 million in 2006, more than a threefold increase. 
Now let me turn it over to Tim to provide more detail on our first quarter results."

Overall, we were quite encouraged by our first quarter performance. Actually, it was even stronger than we had anticipated. As Irene noted, our continuing investment in marketing and innovation are strengthening our brands. This has enabled us to take necessary pricing actions to help offset higher input costs in all of our geographies. As a result, we delivered strong top line growth of 4.6% in the quarter. Our Power brands led the way, up 7%. 
We also delivered positive vol/mix despite higher pricing. This is proof of the power of our portfolio. In fact, vol/mix was positive even with the Easter shift, which tempered growth by about 1.5 in the quarter. We're also pleased that vol/mix held up so well even though many of our competitors have not raised prices.
Please note that we've simplified our definition of organic revenue growth to exclude Starbucks, as well as the favorable impact of accounting calendar changes. We've done this to provide a clean comparison on a like-for-like basis.
Turning to margins, we continue to make progress. Our underlying operating income margin increased 60 basis points to 13.9%. Our pricing actions are catching up to higher input costs. And End-to-End cost management is making important contributions in procurement, in customer service and logistics and in manufacturing, we have been Six Sigma. These cost savings in turn funded a significant increase in A&C. This is our virtuous cycle in action, driving top-tier revenue growth to investments in marketing and innovation, while End-to-End Cost Management expand margins and generate savings to reinvest for future growth.
Turning to EPS, as we outlined in February, we thought operating EPS would be down a few pennies from last year, but actually, EPS grew from $0.49 to $0.52. This was driven by stronger operating earnings and from the timing of mark-to-market gains. 
Let me walk you through the specifics. Gains from operations added $0.03, while the impact of an extra month of profits from Cadbury added $0.04. The year over change in mark-to-market of our commodity hedge positions added $0.04. But that favorability will reverse in the coming quarters. And finally, interest expense and the impact of more shares outstanding were $0.07 higher due to the Cadbury acquisition.  Bottom line, we've posted a solid increase in operating EPS, and we did so in a high quality manner. This is despite the Easter shift and the negative $0.02 to $0.03 impact from Cadbury. 
All regions contributed to the strong performance in the quarter. Here are the breakdown: North America's first quarter showed the virtuous cycle taking hold. Organic net revenues were up 2.2%. As expected, pricing was the key driver, representing 3.3 percentage points for growth. What's more, we priced earlier than most of our competitors. But despite this, vol/mix declined only modestly. In fact, absent of 1.5 point impact from the Easter shift, vol/mix would've been positive. 
As Tony Burdett outlined in CAGNY, we're continuing to invest in our Power brands and new products in North America, and they're responding well. Power brands were up nearly 4% lead by double-digit growth by Chips Ahoy!, Kraft Macaroni and Cheese and Halls. Several of our innovations also contributed. Our new Mio Liquid Beverages mix and Oscar Mayer Carbon Cold Cuts are trending well in terms of consumption, velocity and consumer feedback. 
As I we mentioned earlier, we're encouraged by our brands ability to maintain market share in an inflationary environment. Early results indicate that our prior estimate around price elasticity of demand might have been a bit conservative. Nevertheless, we remain cautious. That's because the impact of our pricing is not likely to be fully reflected on store shelves until midyear. Now let's take a look at profitability.
Operating income margins have increased slightly in a difficult environment. As we said last quarter, in the face of substantial input cost inflation, we've implemented a series of price increases across our North American portfolio. Today, pricing is catching up to higher input costs, and so further actions are likely in a number of categories. But we're confident that the combination of pricing, productivity and overhead savings will enable us to increase in A&C and deliver solid margin performance for the full year.
Our European business remains on solid footing. In fact, Mike Hart and his team posted their fifth consecutive quarter of both top and bottom line growth, that's despite sharp increases in commodities and a still fragile economy most notably in Southern Europe. Organic revenues were 4.4% in the quarter, led by more than 6% growth in our Power brands. Growth was balanced, with nearly equal contributions from pricing and vol/mix. We're encouraged that our marketing and innovation investments are paying off here as well, with stronger brand equity just a few years ago, we're now pricing to offset higher input costs. And despite these increases, our market share remains solid across the region. 
We've implemented a first round of pricing. Out of our current cost levels, further pricing may be necessary later in the year. I would also point out that Europe's solid vol/mix performance came despite the Easter shift, which negatively impacted by about 2.5 percentage points, the bulk of that is in chocolate. Top line growth was broad-based, with Coffee, Biscuits and Cheese leading the way. Coffee was up double digits, with pricing as the key factor. We've also realized significant gains in vol/mix driven by Tassimo growth of almost 30%. In addition, our new Kenco Milli Econo is off to a strong start in the U.K. Consumer feedback to this whole bean instant coffee has been very good. We expect more than 75% distribution by the end of the second quarter as we step up our marketing support. 
This mid-single digits behind our focus on growth platforms like chocobakery. Milka Biscuits continue to perform well in Germany as did Cote d'Or in France and Benelux. We also realized robust double-digit growth in whitespace markets, with Oreo launches in France and Germany, and the Velveeta Breakfast Biscuits in the U.K. This help drive overall Oreo growth of nearly 40%, while the Belvita nearly doubled. 
Our Cheese business delivered solid growth as well. Philadelphia grew double digits behind the versatility strategy to encourage it as a cooking ingredient. This has been so successful that we've now imported it to the U.S. as well. In addition, the launch in Germany of Philadelphia with Milka, a lower fat alternative to Natela, exceeded our expectations. In fact, we reached our full year target in the first quarter. 
Operating income margins in Europe rose 30 basis points to 11.9%. Lower overheads drove the margin expansion. As I mentioned earlier, input costs have increased significantly. Our European business is pricing accordingly, but hasn't yet caught up. As we look in the balance of the year, we're confident at the combination of pricing, productivity and overhead savings will deliver another year of strong profit performance.
In Developing Markets, solid execution of our 5-10-10 strategies are focused on 5 key categories, 10 priority markets and 10 Power brands continues to deliver quality growth. Organic revenues grew 9.6%, with a good balance between pricing and vol/mix. In fact, except for the Easter shift, this region would've posted another quarter of double-digit gains. 
Power brands grew 16%, lead by 56% growth of Oreo in the quarter. Several other Power brands also performed well. 2 and Club Social crackers grew more than 25%, while Tang and Cadbury Dairy Milk each rose 10%. Within the region, Asia Pacific and Latin America continued to grow double digits. CEEMA revenues rose in the mid-single digits despite weak economic conditions and the Easter shift. 
Several markets stood out in the quarter. In India, our business grew more than 40%, and with our recent launches of both Oreo and Tang in this market, we're confident that robust growth will continue. China and Indonesia each grew more than 20%. Brazil continued to drive growth in Latin America, with revenues up midteens. And Ukraine was up double digits, leading the way in CEEMA. 
Operating income margin in Developing Markets declined to 12.2%, largely due to a substantial increase in A&C. Pricing, End-to-End cost management savings and favorable vol/mix more than offset higher input costs. As in Europe, pricing has not yet caught up the input cost, but we expect a better alignment of prices, price versus cost as the year unfolds.
Now before I turn it over to Dave, I'd like to take a moment to say how much I've enjoyed working with everyone here at Kraft over the past 3 and a half years, including our analyst and shareholders. I have great respect for the Board, Irene and the rest of the leadership team. Together, I believe we put Kraft in a solid path to deliver consistent, top-tier performance. And I'll turn it over to CFO who is a great colleague and a good friend, you'll be very good hands. With that, I'll turn it over to Dave for an update upgrade on our guidance."

For those of you who've met him in person, I know you'll understand when I say I'll have very big shoes to fill in more ways than 1. But I look forward to building on his progress and the company's excellent financial foundation.
Turning to our guidance, on the top line, we're confident we'll deliver organic net revenue growth of at least 4% in 2011. That excludes the impact of the loss of the Starbucks CPG business and the favorable impact of accounting calendar changes. As you've seen, we've started the year strong and we remain cautiously optimistic with regard to the balance of the year. We're realizing better alignment between pricing and input cost and volumes to date have held up well. But we're cautious on near term demand, as the impact of inflation on the consumer has not yet fully played through in the marketplace. At the same time, we believe we're well-positioned as we continue to fuel the virtuous cycle we outlined at CAGNY. Our End-to-End cost management will drive productivity and overhead savings, and we'll continue to increase investments in marketing, innovation and other brand building investments to drive top-tier growth.
On the bottom line, we now expect operating EPS of at least $2.20 this year. We've adjusted our numbers to reflect a $0.05 to $0.07 impact from recent changes in our U.S. Premium Coffee segment. These include the loss of the Starbucks CPG business, some related traffic overhead costs and the launch of Gevalia Premium Coffees coming in August. Most important, our overall business momentum remains strong. Excluding the changes in U.S. premium coffee, our earnings outlook for the balance of our business remains consistent with the prior guidance of 11% to 13% growth. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Irene for some concluding remarks."

Tim was also instrumental in several important transactions that have transformed our portfolio, especially the acquisition of Cadbury. We will certainly miss Tim's perspective and commitment, but we're fortunate to have an experienced and knowledgeable leader like Dave ready to step in and seamlessly assumed the role.

We also feel very good about overall how the business is performing. As you are aware, it's exceeding our financial expectations. It's going to be EPS accretive this year, and our cash flow more than doubled last year, and we see further opportunities. So in aggregate, we feel quite good about it. And certainly the Chocolate business in general is performing quite well. We had some short-term impact in the first quarter as we discussed due to the Easter affect, but we feel quite good about our Chocolate business, and especially in some of our Developing Markets, we saw our Cadbury dairy milk grow almost 30% versus historical growth in the rate of 7%. We feel quite good overall about chocolate. Gum continues to be a challenge. It is very much an attractive category. We feel very confident that it has good long-term growth prospects. But we are seeing too very specific problems in the short-term: Certainly, the category is not as robust as it has been historically. In large measure as we discussed, we believe that due to microeconomic conditions, and the other pieces that our U.S. business is not performing as well as we'd like. Both of the key competitors in the category are have been investing to stimulate category growth. I think we're beginning to see a macroeconomic recovery in of markets around the world, and I feel the category will come back over time. In the U.S. though, our challenge is really first innovations have not lived up to our expectations. We launched Trident Vitality. It's been a solid single, but Trident Layers last year was a home run. So it's a little bit below our expectations, but it's up against a tough comp. Or on the case and I'm quite confident that we will see recovery in the back half of the year. I'd also say that elsewhere in the world, we're seeing some very strong growth in the Gum category. Markets like Russia, Turkey, South Africa, all up solidly over 30%. Japan, up 20%. So net-net, the overall business is doing well. Chocolate is on track, Gum continues to be a bit of a challenge particularly in the U.S., but I'm quite confidence confident that it will recover as the year progress."

With respect to Tassimo, we continue to see very strong performance particularly in our international markets. It's up over 30%, 35% globally. And North America business is up over 50%. It is true that we cut back on our math market support of Tassimo simply because we discovered that it made more sense to target it's offering to people that were coffee lovers, and so we continue to support the brand quite actively and we feel very good about its performance in North America. In Canada, we're doubling the size of the business. We've got a strong #1 share in the U.S. The business, as I said, continuous to grow. And in fact, even our business ex the Starbucks, a healthy over 20%. So we feel good about the performance of Tassimo and we are continuing to support it.

So I feel very good about the launch of Gevalia. We've got a very robust plan to introduce it, and that's part of the investment in coffee that Dave alluded to, the $0.05 to $0.07 that we talked about.

So we were assembling inventories for the Easter selling season that theres a lot that's out there in the end of the first quarter. The year and kind of runoff and FX and as the balance sheet was translated to U.S. dollars, also pushed it up a little bit. And further, the higher input costs reflected higher inventories. So consequently, yes, the working capital was higher, which ultimately resulted in lower cash flows and that's about, I think little over $1 billion higher than we'd anticipated. Also note that we made a $500 million pension contribution in January this year. So the combination of higher working capital to net pension contribution are in the net debt levels.

We've made great progress since I first laid out the rewiring strategy at CAGNY in 2007. We've got a nice pipeline for most of our key positions, and it enabled us to make some very quick announcements in the wake of the departure in Snacks at Jim Chambers departure. For example, we've got Marc cloud stepping into run our Snacks business. Marc was the status architect of our global biscuit strategy and is well prepared to lead that important business. In turn, we backfilled Marc as the leader of our global biscuit category, with Lorna Davis, who is the General Manager of our China business. She actually came from the LU business initially. And she was the first as our team grew our China business from $50 million to over $500 million business over the last couple of years. So I feel very good Loren's experience in biscuit and her capability to add value in leading our global biscuit team.

And on the bottom line, our operating EPS increased more tha",472,"Thanks, Chris. Good afternoon. I'm very pleased that we got off to a strong start in 2011. On the top line, organic revenues grew more than 4.5% despite the Easter shift into the second quarter. And on the bottom line, our operating EPS increased more than 6% despite a number of headwinds. These included the continuing rise in commodity cost, the Easter shift and the additional interest in higher share count from financing the Cadbury deal. These headline numbers are very encouraging, and as we look to the balance of the year, there are 3 reasons that give me great confidence that we're on track to deliver top tier results.
First, it's clear that our continuing investment in marketing and innovation are delivering good returns. Around the world, higher levels of brand support are enabling us to take pricing to offset rising input costs. In the face of these price increases, I'm especially pleased that our strong brand equities have enabled us to maintain solid market shares. 
Second, the End-to-End Cost Management initiatives that Dave Brearton laid out at CAGNY are driving significant improvements in productivity and overheads. Underlying operating income margin rose by 60 basis points, reaching 13.9%. Margins improved despite the fact that our commodity costs were up about 7% to 8% over last year. In addition, we increased our investments in advertising and consumer support by more than 14% on a like-for-like basis. 
Third, we're seeing early benefits from executing as 1 company, following last year's Cadbury acquisition. This is most pronounced in our Developing Markets.
[indiscernible] (30:02) put it well when we reviewed his first quarter results last week. He said, ""We saw the power of the $50 billion gorilla at work."" Indeed, we saw it play out in our ability to deliver our results in the wake of the tragedy in Japan. Despite numerous obstacles, we leveraged our diverse supply chain to get our products to market. As a result, our sales in Japan were up 11% in the first quarter.
And in India, our recent launch of Oreo provides a great example of what we can now accomplish by leveraging our extensive sales footprint. In March, we launched the world's favorite cookie through our chocolate sales network, and I can tell you Oreo is off to a very good start. In less than a month, we've reached more than 300,000 sales outlets across the country. In fact, Oreo's performance is on fire across our entire Developing Markets region. In the first quarter, sales of Oreo were up 56% versus prior year. This year, we expect Oreo to be a $700 million business in Developing Markets alone. That's up from about $175 million in 2006, more than a threefold increase. 
Now let me turn it over to Tim to provide more detail on our first quarter results."
739693,129585281,123275,"Kraft Foods Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 05, 2011",2011-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Mondelez International, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Irene, and good afternoon. Overall, we were quite encouraged by our first quarter performance. Actually, it was even stronger than we had anticipated.

Overall, we were quite encouraged by our first quarter performance. Actually, it was even stronger than we had anticipated. As Irene noted, our continued investments in marketing and innovation are strengthening our brands. This has enabled us to take necessary pricing actions to help offset higher input costs in all of our geographies. As a result, we delivered strong top line growth of 4.6% in the quarter. Our Power brands led the way, up 7%. 
We also delivered positive vol/mix despite higher pricing. This is proof of the power of our portfolio. In fact, vol/mix was positive even with the Easter shift, which tempered growth by about 1.5 points in the quarter. We're also pleased that vol/mix held up so well even though many of our competitors have not raised prices.
Please note that we've simplified our definition of organic revenue growth to exclude Starbucks, as well as the favorable impact of accounting calendar changes. We've done this to provide a clean comparison on a like-for-like basis.
Turning to margins, we continue to make progress. Our underlying operating income margin increased 60 basis points to 13.9%. Our pricing actions are catching up to higher input costs. And End-to-End cost management is making important contributions in procurement, in customer service and logistics and in manufacturing with Lean Six Sigma. These cost savings in turn funded a significant increase in A&C. This is our virtuous cycle in action, driving top-tier revenue growth through investments in marketing and innovation, while End-to-End Cost Management expands margins and generate savings to reinvest for future growth.
Turning to EPS, as we outlined in February, we thought operating EPS would be down a few pennies from last year, but actually EPS grew from $0.49 to $0.52. This was driven by stronger operating earnings and from the timing of mark-to-market gains. 
Let me walk you through the specifics. Gains from operations added $0.03, while the impact of an extra month of profits from Cadbury added $0.04. The year over change in mark-to-market of our commodity hedge positions added $0.04. But that favorability will reverse in coming quarters. And finally, interest expense and the impact of more shares outstanding were $0.07 higher due to the Cadbury acquisition.  Bottom line, we've posted a solid increase in operating EPS, and we did so in a high quality manner. This is despite the Easter shift and the negative $0.02 to $0.03 impact from Cadbury. 
All the regions contributed to the strong performance in the quarter. Here are the breakdown: North America's first quarter showed the virtuous cycle is taking hold. Organic net revenues were up 2.2%. As expected, pricing was the key driver, representing 3.3 percentage points of the growth. What's more, we priced earlier than many of our competitors. But despite this, vol/mix declined only modestly. In fact, absent of 1.5 point impact from the Easter shift, vol/mix would've been positive. 
As Tony Vernon outlined in CAGNY, we're continuing to invest in other Power brands and new products in North America, and they're responding well. Power brands were up nearly 4% led by double-digit growth with Chips Ahoy!, Kraft Macaroni and Cheese and Halls. Several of our innovations also contributed. Our new MiO liquid beverages mix and Oscar Mayer Carving Board cold cuts are trending well in terms of consumption, velocity and consumer feedback. 
As Irene mentioned earlier, we're encouraged by our brands' ability to maintain market share in an inflationary environment. Early results indicate that our prior estimates around price elasticity of demand might have been a bit conservative. Nevertheless, we remain cautious. That's because the impact of our pricing is not likely to be fully reflected on store shelves until mid-year. Now let's take a look at profitability.
Operating income margins have increased slightly in a difficult environment. As we said last quarter, in the face of substantial input cost inflation, we've implemented a series of price increases across our North American portfolio. Today, pricing is catching up to higher input costs, and so further actions are likely in a number of categories. But we're confident that the combination of pricing, productivity and overhead savings will enable us to increase A&C and deliver solid margin performance for the full year.
Our European business remains on solid footing. In fact, Mike Clarke and his team posted their fifth consecutive quarter of both top and bottom line growth. That's despite sharp increases in commodities and a still fragile economy, most notably in Southern Europe. 
Organic revenues were 4.4% in the quarter, led by more than 6% growth in our Power brands. Growth was balanced, with nearly equal contributions from pricing and vol/mix. We're encouraged that our marketing and innovation investments are paying off here as well. With stronger brand equities in just a few years ago, we're now pricing to offset higher input costs. And despite these increases, our market share remains solid across the region. 
We've implemented a first round of pricing. Out of our current cost levels, further pricing may be necessary later in the year. I would also point out that Europe's solid vol/mix performance came despite the Easter shift, which negatively affected it by about 2.5 percentage points; the bulk of that was in chocolate. Top line growth was broad-based, with Coffee, Biscuits and Cheese leading the way. Coffee was up double digits, with pricing as the key factor. But we also realized significant gains in vol/mix driven by Tassimo growth of almost 30%. In addition, our new Kenco Millicano is off to a strong start in the U.K. Consumer feedback to this wholebean instant coffee has been very good. We expect more than 75% distribution by the end of the second quarter as we step up our marketing support. 
This gets to mid-single digits behind our focus on growth platforms like chocobakery. Milka Biscuits continue to perform well in Germany as did Cote d'Or in France and Benelux. We also realized robust double-digit growth in whitespace markets, with Oreo launches in France and Germany, and the Velveeta Breakfast Biscuits in the U.K. This helped drive overall Oreo growth of nearly 40%, while Velveeta nearly doubled. 
Our Cheese business delivered solid growth as well. Philadelphia grew double digits behind the versatility strategy to encourage it as a cooking ingredient. This has been so successful that we've now imported it to the U.S. as well. In addition, the launch in Germany of Philadelphia with Milka, a lower fat alternative to Nutella, exceeded our expectations. In fact, we reached our full year target in the first quarter. 
Operating income margins in Europe rose 30 basis points to 11.9%. Lower overheads drove the margin expansion. As I mentioned earlier, input costs have increased significantly. Our European business is pricing accordingly, but hasn't yet caught up. As we look in the balance of the year, we're confident that the combination of pricing, productivity and overhead savings will deliver another year of strong profit performance.
In Developing Markets, solid execution of our 5-10-10 strategy are focused on 5 key categories, 10 priority markets and 10 Power brands continues to deliver quality growth. Organic revenues grew 9.6%, with a good balance between pricing and vol/mix. In fact, except for the Easter shift, this region would've posted another quarter of double-digit gains. 
Power brands grew 16%, lead by 56% growth of Oreo in the quarter. Several other Power brands also performed well. Toot [ph] (41:16) and Club Social crackers grew more than 25%, while Tang and Cadbury Dairy Milk each rose nearly 10%. Within the region, Asia Pacific and Latin America continued to grow double digits. CEEMA revenues rose in the mid-single digits despite weak economic conditions and the Easter shift. 
Several markets stood out in the quarter. In India, our business grew more than 40%. And with our recent launches of both Oreo and Tang in this market, we're confident that robust growth will continue. China and Indonesia each grew more than 20%. Brazil continued to drive growth in Latin America, with revenues up mid-teens. And Ukraine was up double digits, leading the way in CEEMA. 
Operating income margin in Developing Markets declined to 12.2%, largely due to a substantial increase in A&C. Pricing, end-to-end cost management savings and favorable vol/mix more than offset higher input costs. As in Europe, pricing has not yet caught up the input cost, but we expect a better alignment of prices, price versus cost, as the year unfolds.
Now before I turn it over to Dave, I'd like to take a moment to say how much I've enjoyed working with everyone here at Kraft Foods over the past 3 and a half years, including our analyst and share owners. I have great respect for the board, Irene and the rest of the leadership team. Together, I believe we've put Kraft in a solid path to deliver consistent, top-tier performance. And turning over the CFO reins to a great colleague and a good friend, you'll be in very good hands. With that, I'll turn it over to Dave for an update on our guidance."

For those of you who've met Tim in person, I know you'll understand when I say I'll have very big shoes to fill; in more ways than one. But I look forward to building on his progress and the company's excellent financial foundation.
Turning to our guidance. On the top line, we're confident we'll deliver organic net revenue growth of at least 4% in 2011. That excludes the impact of the loss of the Starbucks CPG business and the favorable impact of accounting calendar changes. As you've seen, we started the year strong and we remain cautiously optimistic with regard to the balance of the year. We're realizing better alignment between pricing and input cost and volumes to date have held up well. But we're cautious on near-term demand, as the impact of inflation on the consumer has not yet fully played through in the marketplace. At the same time, we believe we're well positioned as we continue to fuel the virtuous cycle we outlined at CAGNY. Our end-to-end cost management will drive productivity and overhead savings, and we'll continue to increase investments in marketing, innovation and other brand-building investments to drive top-tier growth.
On the bottom line, we now expect operating EPS of at least $2.20 this year. We've adjusted our numbers to reflect a $0.05 to $0.07 impact from recent changes in our U.S. Premium Coffee segment. These include the loss of the Starbucks CPG business, some related traffic overhead costs and the launch of Gevalia Premium Coffee coming in August. Most important, our overall business momentum remains strong. Excluding the changes in U.S. Premium Coffee, our earnings outlook for the balance of our business remains consistent with the prior guidance of 11% to 13% growth. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Irene for some concluding remarks."

Tim was also instrumental in several important transactions that have transformed our portfolio, especially the acquisition of Cadbury. We will certainly miss Tim's perspective and commitment, but we're fortunate to have an experienced and knowledgeable leader like Dave, ready to step in and seamlessly assume the role.

And it's certainly playing out in our results. We also feel very good about overall how the business is performing. As you are aware, it's exceeding our financial expectations. It's going to be EPS accretive this year, and our cash flow more than doubled last year, and we see further opportunities. So in aggregate, we feel quite good about it. And certainly, the Chocolate business in general is performing quite well. We had some short-term impact in the first quarter as we discussed due to the Easter effect, but we feel quite good about our Chocolate business. And especially in some of our Developing Markets, we saw our Cadbury Dairy Milk grow almost 20% versus historical growth of in the range of 7%. We feel quite good overall about Chocolate. Gum continues to be a challenge. It is very much an attractive category. We feel very confident that it has good long-term growth prospects. But we are seeing 2 very specific problems in the short-term. Certainly, the category is not as robust as it has been historically. In large measure, as we discussed, we believe that's due to microeconomic conditions. And the other piece is that our U.S. business is not performing as well as we'd like. Both of the key competitors in the category have been investing to stimulate category growth. I think we're beginning to see macroeconomic recovery in a number of markets around the world, and I feel the category will come back over time. In the U.S., though, our challenge is really that our first half innovations have not lived up to our expectations. We launched Trident Vitality. It's been a solid single, but Trident Layers last year was a home run. So it's a little bit below our expectations, but it's up against a tough comp. That's it. We're on the case, and I'm quite confident that we will see recovery in the back half of the year. I'd also say that elsewhere in the world, we're seeing some very strong growth in the Gum category. Markets like Russia, Turkey, South Africa, all up solidly over 30%. Japan, up 20%. So net-net, the overall business is doing well. Chocolate is on track; Gum continues to be a bit of a challenge particularly in the U.S., but I'm quite confidence confident that it will recover as the year progress."

We built a very solid business together, and we do expect to be compensated for that. But exactly what time and what the magnitude would be is uncertain at this point so we did not factor that in. With respect to Tassimo, we continue to see very strong performance particularly in our international markets. It's up about over 30%, about 35% globally. And North America business is up over 50%. It is true that we cut back on our mass market support of Tassimo simply because we discovered that it made more sense to target this offering to people that were coffee lovers. And so we continue to support the brand quite actively, and we feel very good about its performance in North America. In Canada, we're doubling the size of the business. We've got a strong #1 share in the U.S. The business, as I said, continues to grow. And in fact even our business, x the Starbucks bit, was up a healthy over 20%. So we feel good about the performance of Tassimo, and we are continuing to support it. With respect to Gevalia, we've given it a nice launch. It's a very important part of our premium strategy, which we shared with you. And it's a strong business. It's a very good coffee. It's a leading brand in Europe, and what you might you may not realize is it's actually already over $200 million business in the U.S. that consumers already know, and we've got some very good brand awareness to be tapping into. So I feel very good about the launch of Gevalia. We've got a very robust plan to introduce it, and that's part of the investment in Coffee that Dave alluded to, the $0.05 to $0.07 that we talked about.

If you looked at it historically, you'll see that our cash position in the first quarter usually is negative seasonally. This quarter, that was exacerbated a little bit with the Easter shift. So we were assembling inventories for the Easter selling season that sat there. A lot it sat there at the end of the first quarter. The year end kind of runoff in FX and as the balance sheet was translated to U.S. dollars also pushed it up a little bit. And further, the higher input costs reflected higher inventories. So consequently, yes, the working capital was higher, which ultimately resulted in lower cash flows, and that's about, I think, it was a little over $1 billion higher than we would've anticipated. Also note that we made a $500 million pension contribution in January this year. So the combination of higher working capital to net pension contribution are in the net debt levels. But we do anticipate getting back on track or staying or remaining on track and bring the debt levels down to the levels we have identified consistent with our ratings targets by the year end."

We've made great progress since I first laid out the rewiring strategy at CAGNY in 2007. We've got a nice pipeline for most of our key positions, and it enabled us to make some very quick announcements in the wake of the departure in Snacks, Jim Chambers' departure. For example, we've got Mark Clouse stepping in to run our Snacks business. Mark was the status architect of our global biscuit strategy, and he is well prepared to lead that important business. In turn, we backfilled Mark as the leader of our global biscuit category, with Lorna Davis, who is the General Manager of our China business. She actually came from the LU business initially. And she was the first, with our team, who grew our China business from $50 million to over at $500 million business over the last couple of years. So I feel very good about Lorna's experience in biscuit and her capability to add value in leading our global biscuit team. And then in turn, we backfilled Lorna Davis with Shawn Warren, who has been the architect in our Asia Pacific region of the Oreo growth that I alluded to in my remarks. And so we feel very good about the pipeline, and I think you see it playing out in these most recent announcements."

But on the EPS side, I think Tim said in our last earnings call that we would have more normal seasonality of our EPS this year. Last year was a bit of an anomaly. Sort of if you look back over time, we've traditionally delivered a little less than half of our earnings in the first half, around 48% and about 52% from the back half, just because of the seasonality of some of our products. This year, we would expect to be in line with that historical trend. Whereas last year, for a lot of reasons, it was the reverse. We actually had a higher profit delivery in the first half last year than we did this year. So in terms of comparisons, our comparisons are going to be tougher in the first half than the back half.

And as well we're going to see a mark-to-market reverse out.

And on the bottom line, our operating EPS increased more tha",472,"Thanks, Chris. Good afternoon. I'm very pleased that we got off to a strong start in 2011. On the top line, organic revenues grew more than 4.5% despite the Easter shift into the second quarter. And on the bottom line, our operating EPS increased more than 6% despite a number of headwinds. These included the continuing rise in commodity cost, the Easter shift and the additional interest in higher share count from financing the Cadbury deal. These headline numbers are very encouraging, and as we look to the balance of the year, there are 3 reasons that give me great confidence that we're on track to deliver top tier results.
First, it's clear that our continuing investments in marketing and innovation are delivering good returns. Around the world, higher levels of brand support are enabling us to take pricing to offset rising input costs. In the face of these price increases, I'm especially pleased that our strong brand equities have enabled us to maintain solid market shares. 
Second, the end-to-end cost management initiatives that Dave Brearton laid out at CAGNY are driving significant improvements in productivity and overheads. Underlying operating income margin rose by 60 basis points, reaching 13.9%. Margins improved despite the fact that our commodity costs were up about 7% to 8% over last year. In addition, we increased our investments in advertising and consumer support by more than 14% on a like-for-like basis. 
Third, we're seeing early benefits from executing as 1 company, following last year's Cadbury acquisition. This is most pronounced in our Developing Markets.
Sanjay Khosla put it well when we reviewed his first quarter results last week. He said, ""We saw the power of the $50 billion gorilla at work."" Indeed, we saw it play out in our ability to deliver our results in the wake of the tragedy in Japan. Despite numerous obstacles, we leveraged our diverse supply chain to get our products to market. As a result, our sales in Japan were up 11% in the first quarter.
And in India, our recent launch of Oreo provides a great example of what we can now accomplish by leveraging our extensive sales footprint. In March, we launched the world's favorite cookie through our chocolate sales network, and I can tell you Oreo is off to a very good start. In less than a month, we've reached more than 300,000 sales outlets across the country. In fact, Oreo's performance is on fire across our entire Developing Markets region. In the first quarter, sales of Oreo were up 56% versus prior year. This year, we expect Oreo to be a $700 million business in Developing Markets alone. That's up from about $175 million in 2006, more than a threefold increase. 
Now let me turn it over to Tim to provide more detail on our first quarter results."

Overall, we were quite encouraged by our first quarter performance. Actually, it was even stronger than we had anticipated. As Irene noted, our continued investments in marketing and innovation are strengthening our bran",1510,"Thanks, Irene, and good afternoon. Overall, we were quite encouraged by our first quarter performance. Actually, it was even stronger than we had anticipated. As Irene noted, our continued investments in marketing and innovation are strengthening our brands. This has enabled us to take necessary pricing actions to help offset higher input costs in all of our geographies. As a result, we delivered strong top line growth of 4.6% in the quarter. Our Power brands led the way, up 7%. 
We also delivered positive vol/mix despite higher pricing. This is proof of the power of our portfolio. In fact, vol/mix was positive even with the Easter shift, which tempered growth by about 1.5 points in the quarter. We're also pleased that vol/mix held up so well even though many of our competitors have not raised prices.
Please note that we've simplified our definition of organic revenue growth to exclude Starbucks, as well as the favorable impact of accounting calendar changes. We've done this to provide a clean comparison on a like-for-like basis.
Turning to margins, we continue to make progress. Our underlying operating income margin increased 60 basis points to 13.9%. Our pricing actions are catching up to higher input costs. And end-to-end cost management is making important contributions in procurement, in customer service and logistics and in manufacturing with Lean Six Sigma. These cost savings in turn funded a significant increase in A&C. This is our virtuous cycle in action, driving top-tier revenue growth through investments in marketing and innovation, while end-to-end cost management expands margins and generate savings to reinvest for future growth.
Turning to EPS, as we outlined in February, we thought operating EPS would be down a few pennies from last year, but actually EPS grew from $0.49 to $0.52. This was driven by stronger operating earnings and from the timing of mark-to-market gains. 
Let me walk you through the specifics. Gains from operations added $0.03, while the impact of an extra month of profits from Cadbury added $0.04. The year over change in mark-to-market of our commodity hedge positions added $0.04. But that favorability will reverse in coming quarters. And finally, interest expense and the impact of more shares outstanding were $0.07 higher due to the Cadbury acquisition.  Bottom line, we've posted a solid increase in operating EPS, and we did so in a high quality manner. This is despite the Easter shift and the negative $0.02 to $0.03 impact from Cadbury. 
All the regions contributed to the strong performance in the quarter. Here is the breakdown: North America's first quarter showed the virtuous cycle is taking hold. Organic net revenues were up 2.2%. As expected, pricing was the key driver, representing 3.3 percentage points of the growth. What's more, we priced earlier than many of our competitors. But despite this, vol/mix declined only modestly. In fact, absent of 1.5 point impact from the Easter shift, vol/mix would've been positive. 
As Tony Vernon outlined in CAGNY, we're continuing to invest behind our Power brands and new products in North America, and they're responding well. Power brands were up nearly 4% led by double-digit growth with Chips Ahoy!, Kraft Macaroni and Cheese and Halls. Several of our innovations also contributed. Our new MiO liquid beverages mix and Oscar Mayer Carving Board cold cuts are trending well in terms of consumption, velocity and consumer feedback. 
As Irene mentioned earlier, we're encouraged by our brands' ability to maintain market share in an inflationary environment. Early results indicate that our prior estimates around price elasticity of demand might have been a bit conservative. Nevertheless, we remain cautious. That's because the impact of our pricing is not likely to be fully reflected on store shelves until mid-year. Now let's take a look at profitability.
Operating income margins have increased slightly in a difficult environment. As we said last quarter, in the face of substantial input cost inflation, we've implemented a series of price increases across our North American portfolio. Today, pricing is catching up to higher input costs, and so further actions are likely in a number of categories. But we're confident that the combination of pricing, productivity and overhead savings will enable us to increase A&C and deliver solid margin performance for the full year.
Our European business remains on solid footing. In fact, Mike Clarke and his team posted their fifth consecutive quarter of both top and bottom line growth. That's despite sharp increases in commodities and a still fragile economy, most notably in Southern Europe. 
Organic revenues were 4.4% in the quarter, led by more than 6% growth in our Power brands. Growth was balanced, with nearly equal contributions from pricing and vol/mix. We're encouraged that our marketing and innovation investments are paying off here as well. With stronger brand equities than just a few years ago, we're now pricing to offset higher input costs. And despite these increases, our market share remains solid across the region. 
We've implemented a first round of pricing. Out of our current cost levels, further pricing may be necessary later in the year. I would also point out that Europe's solid vol/mix performance came despite the Easter shift, which negatively affected it by about 2.5 percentage points; the bulk of that was in chocolate. Top line growth was broad-based, with Coffee, Biscuits and Cheese leading the way. Coffee was up double digits, with pricing as the key factor. But we also realized significant gains in vol/mix driven by Tassimo growth of almost 30%. In addition, our new Kenco Millicano is off to a strong start in the U.K. Consumer feedback to this whole bean instant coffee has been very good. We expect more than 75% distribution by the end of the second quarter as we step up our marketing support. 
Biscuits in single digits behind our focus on growth platforms like Chocobakery. Milka Biscuits continue to perform well in Germany as did Cote d'Or in France and Benelux. We also realized robust double-digit growth in whitespace markets, with Oreo launches in France and Germany, and the Velveeta Breakfast Biscuits in the U.K. This helped drive overall Oreo growth of nearly 40%, while Velveeta nearly doubled. 
Our Cheese business delivered solid growth as well. Philadelphia grew double digits behind the versatility strategy to encourage it as a cooking ingredient. This has been so successful that we've now imported it to the U.S. as well. In addition, the launch in Germany of Philadelphia with Milka, a lower fat alternative to Nutella, exceeded our expectations. In fact, we reached our full year target in the first quarter. 
Operating income margins in Europe rose 30 basis points to 11.9%. Lower overheads drove the margin expansion. As I mentioned earlier, input costs have increased significantly. Our European business is pricing accordingly, but hasn't yet caught up. As we look at the balance of the year, we're confident that the combination of pricing, productivity and overhead savings will deliver another year of strong profit performance.
In Developing Markets, solid execution of our 5-10-10 strategy are focused on 5 key categories, 10 priority markets and 10 Power brands continues to deliver quality growth. Organic revenues grew 9.6%, with a good balance between pricing and vol/mix. In fact, except for the Easter shift, this region would've posted another quarter of double-digit gains. 
Power brands grew 16%, lead by 56% growth of Oreo in the quarter. Several other Power brands also performed well. Toot and Club Social crackers grew more than 25%, while Tang and Cadbury Dairy Milk each rose nearly 20%. Within the region, Asia Pacific and Latin America continued to grow double digits. CEEMA revenues rose in the mid-single digits despite weak economic conditions and the Easter shift. 
Several markets stood out in the quarter. In India, our business grew more than 40%. And with our recent launches of both Oreo and Tang in this market, we're confident that robust growth will continue. China and Indonesia each grew more than 20%. Brazil continued to drive growth in Latin America, with revenues up mid-teens. And Ukraine was up double digits, leading the way in CEEMA. 
Operating income margin in Developing Markets declined to 12.2%, largely due to a substantial increase in A&C. Pricing, end-to-end cost management savings and favorable vol/mix more than offset higher input costs. As in Europe, pricing has not yet caught up to input cost, but we expect a better alignment of prices, price versus cost, as the year unfolds.
Now before I turn it over to Dave, I'd like to take a moment to say how much I've enjoyed working with everyone here at Kraft Foods over the past 3 and a half years, including our analyst and share owners. I have great respect for the board, Irene and the rest of the leadership team. Together, I believe we've put Kraft in a solid path to deliver consistent, top-tier performance. And I’m turning over the CFO reins to a great colleague and a good friend, you'll be in very good hands. With that, I'll turn it over to Dave for an update on our guidance."

For those of you who've met Tim in person, I know you'll understand when I say I'll have very big shoes to fill; in more ways than one. But I look forward to building on his progress and the company's excellent financial foundation.
Turning to our guidance. On the top line, we're confident we'll deliver organic net revenue growth of at least 4% in 2011. That excludes the impact of the loss of the Starbucks CPG business and the favorable impact of accounting calendar changes. As you've seen, we started the year strong and we remain cautiously optimistic with regard to the balance of the year. We're realizing better alignment between pricing and input cost and volumes to date have held up well. But we're cautious on near-term demand, as the impact of inflation on the consumer has not yet fully played through in the marketplace. At the same time, we believe we're well positioned as we continue to fuel the virtuous cycle we outlined at CAGNY. Our end-to-end cost management will drive productivity and overhead savings, and we'll continue to increase investments in marketing, innovation and other brand-building investments to drive top-tier growth.
On the bottom line, we now expect operating EPS of at least $2.20 this year. We've adjusted our numbers to reflect a $0.05 to $0.07 impact from recent changes in our U.S. Premium Coffee segment. These include the loss of the Starbucks CPG business, some related traffic overhead costs and the launch of Gevalia Premium Coffee coming in August. Most important, our overall business momentum remains strong. Excluding the changes in U.S. Premium Coffee, our earnings outlook for the balance of our business remains consistent with the prior guidance of 11% to 13% growth. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Irene for some concluding remarks."

We went from an operating division of Altria to a standalone public company, and now a leader in the food and beverage sector. Tim was also instrumental in several important transactions that have transformed our portfolio, especially the acquisition of Cadbury. We will certainly miss Tim's perspective and commitment, but we're fortunate to have an experienced and knowledgeable leader like Dave, ready to step in and seamlessly assume the role.

And it's certainly playing out in our results. We also feel very good about overall how the business is performing. As you are aware, it's exceeding our financial expectations. It's going to be EPS accretive this year, and our cash flow more than doubled last year, and we see further opportunities. So in aggregate, we feel quite good about it. And certainly, the Chocolate business in general is performing quite well. We had some short-term impact in the first quarter as we discussed due to the Easter effect, but we feel quite good about our Chocolate business. And especially in some of our Developing Markets, we saw our Cadbury Dairy Milk grow almost 20% versus historical growth of in the range of 7%. We feel quite good overall about Chocolate. 
Gum continues to be a challenge. It is very much an attractive category. We feel very confident that it has good long-term growth prospects. But we are seeing 2 very specific problems in the short-term. Certainly, the category is not as robust as it has been historically. In large measure, as we discussed, we believe that's due to macroeconomic conditions. And the other piece is that our U.S. business is not performing as well as we'd like. Both of the key competitors in the category have been investing to stimulate category growth. I think we're beginning to see macroeconomic recovery in a number of markets around the world, and I feel the category will come back over time. In the U.S., though, our challenge is really that our first half innovations have not lived up to our expectations. We launched Trident Vitality. It's been a solid single, but Trident Layers last year was a homerun. So it's a little bit below our expectations, but it's up against a tough comp. That's it. We're on the case, and I'm quite confident that we will see recovery in the back half of the year. I'd also say that elsewhere in the world, we're seeing some very strong growth in the Gum category. Markets like Russia, Turkey, South Africa, all up solidly over 30%. Japan, up 20%. So net-net, the overall business is doing well. Chocolate is on track; Gum continues to be a bit of a challenge particularly in the U.S., but I'm quite confidence confident that it will recover as the year progress."

We built a very solid business together, and we do expect to be compensated for that. But exactly what time and what the magnitude would be is uncertain at this point so we did not factor that in. With respect to Tassimo, we continue to see very strong performance particularly in our international markets. It's up about over 30%, about 35% globally. And North America business is up over 50%. It is true that we cut back on our mass market support of Tassimo simply because we discovered that it made more sense to target this offering to people that were coffee lovers. And so we continue to support the brand quite actively, and we feel very good about its performance in North America. In Canada, we're doubling the size of the business. We've got a strong #1 share in the U.S. The business, as I said, continues to grow. 
And in fact even our business, ex the Starbucks tick, was up a healthy over 20%. So we feel good about the performance of Tassimo, and we are continuing to support it. With respect to Gevalia, we've given it a nice launch. It's a very important part of our premium strategy, which we shared with you. And it's a strong business. It's a very good coffee. It's a leading brand in Europe, and what you might you may not realize is it's actually already over $200 million business in the U.S. that consumers already know, and we've got some very good brand awareness to be tapping into. So I feel very good about the launch of Gevalia. We've got a very robust plan to introduce it, and that's part of the investment in Coffee that Dave alluded to, the $0.05 to $0.07 that we talked about. And we're quite confident that we've got a very robust pipeline in our European business that we will be able to bring over to the U.S. now that we don't have the constraints of the contract."

If you looked at it historically, you'll see that our cash position in the first quarter usually is negative seasonally. This quarter, that was exacerbated a little bit with the Easter shift. So we were assembling inventories for the Easter selling season that sat there. A lot it sat there at the end of the first quarter. The year-end kind of runoff in FX and as the balance sheet was translated to U.S. dollars also pushed it up a little bit. And further, the higher input costs reflected higher inventories. So consequently, yes, the working capital was higher, which ultimately resulted in lower cash flows, and that's about, I think, it was a little over $1 billion higher than we would've anticipated. Also note that we made a $500 million pension contribution in January this year. So the combination of higher working capital and that pension contribution are in the net debt levels. But we do anticipate getting back on track or staying or remaining on track and bring the debt levels down to the levels we have identified consistent with our ratings targets by the year end."

But we feel pretty good about the way our volumes have held up so far. We've got good programming in place. We've used a number of promotional tactics to try to leverage our scale. So for example, the Delicious Difference days that we run in France with Carrefour has been a nice way of us helping to bridge the consumer as we've raised prices in a number of our core categories. But we feel pretty confident that we will be able to protect our margins. Not actually -- assuming our dollar margins, but there'll be a bit of a denominator effect as we significantly increase prices.

We've got a nice pipeline for most of our key positions, and it enabled us to make some very quick announcements in the wake of the departure in Snacks, Jim Chambers' departure. For example, we've got Mark Clouse stepping in to run our Snacks business. Mark was the status architect of our global biscuit strategy, and he is well prepared to lead that important business. In turn, we backfilled Mark as the leader of our global biscuit category, with Lorna Davis, who is the General Manager of our China business. She actually came from the LU business initially. And she was the person, with our team, who grew our China business from $50 million to over at $500 million business over the last couple of years. So I feel very good about Lorna's experience in biscuit and her capability to add value in leading our global biscuit team.

This year, we would expect to be in line with that historical trend. Whereas last year, for a lot of reasons, it was the reverse. We actually had a higher profit delivery in the first half last year than we did this year. So in terms of comparisons, our comparisons are going to be tougher in the first half than the back half.

We said about half a point of our growth in 2011 would come from our revenue synergies. But I think there's a whole host of examples. Certainly, India is one good example where we've been able to put both Oreo and Tang through the chocolate distribution network to terrific results. In Brazil, we're currently expanding our base legacy Kraft products into almost 700,000 outlets, up from less than 300,000. So we're seeing some -- and that's been an important contributor to our high double-digit growth in Brazil. Mexico, I talked about the fact that we've been able to put Oreo that was only in about the 100,000 outlets into Cadbury's 380,000 outlets that they had with the Gum business. Russia, we're seeing some opportunities to be able to put the total portfolio together, and even just some simple merchandising ideas. There was some small retail refrigerators that Cadbury used in India for their Chocolate business that we've now been able to take to use in Cheese in markets like Indonesia and for chocolate in markets like Brazil. So there's a whole host of examples, but as we shared with you most of the $1 billion of revenue synergies will come in 2012, 2013."

Tim mentioned the products in Europe. In the U.K., our Millicano coffee product, we have great hopes for that one, and it's off to a good start. Our chocolate Philadelphia with Milka is off to a very good start. We're actually selling more than we can make. So I think if we go around the world, we feel very good about the pipeline, and we do feel very good about the marketing support behind the pipeline. But I'll tell you, when I look at businesses like Tang, it took us 50 years to build Tang to a $500 million business, and in the last 3 years, we've essentially doubled that. And Tang is almost $1 billion brand in Developing Markets. So we've talked about brands like Oreo that are quite mature that are growing like teenagers.

As you've now seen, we made 2 very significant announcements today. First, we reported terrific second quarter earnings. Concurrently, we announced our intention to create 2 independent publicly traded companies by the end of 2012 as the next step in the transformation of Kraft Foods. 
We'll begin today with a review of our quarterly results. Then, we'll spend the balance of our time on the strategic rationale and benefits of our plan. So let's get started.
In the second quarter, we delivered strong top and bottom line results, continuing our positive momentum through the first half of the year. This steps the stage for strong growth in the second half and positions us well for next phase of our transformation. 
We talked a lot in the first quarter about the challenges facing us due to higher input cost. We said we would manage them, and we have. I'm pleased to say as we exit the first half with strong results and good momentum that we're over the hump and we're quite confident about the balance of the year. 
There are 3 reasons why. First, an input cost increase we quickly priced to offset them. Across our categories, we've announced about 85% of the pricing that we currently expect to take. More than 80% of these increases are already reflected on store shelves. In most cases, we took action earlier than others and in certain categories, we priced quite a bit more aggressively than our key competitors. The fact that we responded quickly to these higher than anticipated costs has put us in a much more favorable position in the marketplace. 
The second reason I'm confident about the balance of the year is that we're winning with our consumers. We've been able to post solid market shares, while pricing aggressively. This is due to our ongoing investments in innovations and marketing. Revenue gains for innovation are up in each region. We're  continuing to improve the quality of our advertising, and we're supporting these efforts by increasing our investments in advertising and consumer marketing support, which are up strongly year-to-date.
Of course, as we raise prices, we have experienced some near-term dislocation in certain categories. But overall, we're seeing solid market share performance across our 4 categories in each of our 3 geographic regions. And it's important to note that private label's market share is essentially flat in our 4 categories. 
What also gives me confidence in our business momentum is that despite the substantial increases in input cost, we're growing profit dollars through a combination of pricing and End-to-End Cost Management. 
In fact, despite the loss of the Starbucks CPG business and tough comparisons against peak margins in the second quarter last year, we grew profit dollars year-on-year. Cost savings are enabling us to continue to fund significant increases in A&C. That in turn is fueling our virtuous growth cycle.
I'd especially like to highlight the progress we're  making in our Global Snack category. Many of you have asked if the Cadbury acquisition is driving the growth we thought it would. The answer is unqualified yes. Last fall, at our Investor Day, we laid out a long-term growth target of mid-to high single digits for Global Snacks. 
As you can see, the 6% growth we've delivered year-to-date is right in line with that target, and we've only just begun to realize revenue synergies. 
Let's look at the key contributors to that growth.
Global Biscuits is up 7% on a constant currency basis, led by strong double-digit growth in developing markets. 
Let's look at some numbers. Oreo, a $1.5 billion brand grown 22%. Chips Ahoy!, a brand sold primarily in developed markets is up 18% and Food Social, our leading cracker brand in Latin America is up 35%. 
Our Global Chocolate Category is growing even faster than Biscuits. It's up about 9%, including gains of low to mid-teens in developing markets. 
Our $1 billion Cadbury dairy milk brand first introduced in 1905 and now sold in 30 countries around the world has grown 13%. Just for perspective as the best growth in many years. 
Lacta, a $700 million brand in Latin America is up 18% and Cadbury Flake, a leading brand in many hot weather market is up 13%.
Even Gum and Candy, which had experienced significant challenges has grown 2% year-to-date, including a high single-digit gain in developing markets. 
As we've said before, the key challenge for Gum and Candy is in developed markets. Revenues are down double digits in North America and are flat in Europe. While we're certainly not satisfied with our Gum results, we expected a slow first half due to 2 factors. First, sluggishness in the instant consumption channel as a result of the challenging macro economy. Specifically the decline in pocket money among teens, our biggest Consumer segment. And second, our new product this year were simply not as robust as we had hoped or as strong as last year's innovations. We understand the issues and we're in the process of fixing them with additional innovation and smaller capsizes to hit lower price points. We expect to see better results as the year progresses.
That said, Gum and Candy remains an attractive category with excellent long-term growth prospects consistent with our Global Snack's goals. 
Let me now turn it over to Dave who will provide more detail on our second quarter results."
739693,137102578,152728,"Kraft Foods Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2011",2011-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Mondelez International, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Irene. In a nutshell, we've seen terrific results on both the top and bottom line through the first half of the year. We're seeing paying off from our focused investments behind our power brands, big bets and innovation and improved marketing. A",1377,"Thanks, Irene. In a nutshell, we've seen terrific results on both the top and bottom line through the first half of the year. We're seeing paying off from our focused investments behind our power brands, big bets and innovation and improved marketing. 
As a result, we built good volume mix, share and revenue momentum in the face of aggressive price increases. 
In the second quarter, organic revenues were more than 7%, including Power Brand growth of about 9%. Of course, the second quarter benefited from Easter, but looking at the first half, which normalizes for the Easter shift, organic revenue was still up nearly 6% with very solid contribution from vol/mix of 1.3. points. This was despite substantial pricing of 4.6 points. 
What can we expect going forward? For the full year, we now believe input cost will be up in the low teens versus last year. That's up from the high single digit increase that we forecast on our call 3 months ago. 
As a result, we do anticipate additional pricing actions to offset this higher cost, but as Irene mentioned, we've already announced or implemented about 85% of the pricing actions we expect to take for the year so we're confident in our outlook.
Turning to profits. We continued to gain momentum. Pricing and productivity gains essentially offset higher raw material costs on $1 basis. At the same time, continued improvements in overheads and other cost savings under the strong increase in A&C. 
To put it another way, we protected operating profit dollars in the quarter even though our OI margins declined compared to peak levels a year ago. But this was essentially due to the impact of pricing under denominator of the margin calculation.
Despite this, our underlying operating income margin improved sequentially from the first quarter and for the second half, we expect to see increases in year-over-year margins.
Turning to EPS. As we outlined in our last earnings call, we expect second quarter operating EPS to be down versus the May of $0.60 last year. We know we were up against difficult comparisons with peak margins in Q2 2010, as well as the reversal of mark-to-market gains in Q1 this year. But clearly, we did better than our initial expectations. 
Mark-to-market gains did reverse and a $0.05, they were a bit more than we expected. As for the upside, partly due from favorable currency and somewhat due to a lower than anticipated tax rate, the rest came from operating needs. 
On a year-to-date basis, we're encouraged to have delivered $0.06 of operating gains year-over-year despite the fact that we were up against some very difficult margin comparisons to the prior year.
All of our geographies contributed to the strong performance in the quarter. In North America, despite a very difficult operating environment, our virtuous cycle continues to build momentum. Organic revenues were up 4% for the quarter and 3.1% for the first half. As expected, pricing was the key driver. As we said, we priced to offset higher cost earlier than most of our competitors. As a result, all mixed decline as we thought from near-term dislocation in certain categories. 
Despite the significant pricing, however, we were pleased overall with the limited volume elasticity. It was consistent with our expectations and further evidenced of the improved strength of our brand equities.
While our Power Brands grew in above the same rate as our broader portfolio, several of our innovations made significant contributions. Our new MiO liquid beverage mix continue to generate revenues well ahead of plan. Auster Myer Carving Board Tool cuts, New Improved Thin Cookies and Philadelphia Cooking Cream also performed well. 
As a result, through the first half of the year, our market shares in North America remain volatile. More than half the business is holding or gaining share on $1 basis.
And we're even more encouraged by the fact that to date, we've announced roughly 85% of the pricing we believe we need to take this year. Almost all of that pricing is already reflected on store shelves. 
Now let's take a look at profitability. North America did a good job on pricing to offset higher raw material cost on $1 basis. The region also continue to benefit from lower overheads. Nevertheless, operating income margins declined for peak levels a year ago due to changes in the U.S. premium Coffee business and the denominator effect of higher pricing on the margin calculation. Looking ahead, we expect year-on-year margin improvement in the second half.
On the other side of the, our European recorded its sixth consecutive quarter of top and bottom line growth. Organic revenues grew 6.4% in the quarter while in the first half they rose 5.4%. 
As expected, pricing drove the majority of this growth. As we successfully implemented actions across all categories. As we look ahead, price increases for the third quarter have been announced in Coffee. With that, we've now announced all the pricing we expect to take in Europe and this year and about 80% of our pricing is not reflected at retail.
Power Brands rose 8%, including 17% of Oreo fueled by launches in Germany and Austria leveraging our global play book. Tax amount grew 19% for Tang or Coffee increased 24%. 
In addition, Philadelphia continued to grow strongly up 18%. And, while retail sales are slowing across the region, we are continuing to drive growth for our brands and for our categories. 
On a pan-European basis, year-to-date, we're  increasing share of biscuits and cheese and shares are holding up well in Chocolate Gum and Coffee. 
There's also good news at the profit line. Despite a difficult environment, Europe delivered another strong quarter. On $1 basis, pricing and productivity offset the significant increase in raw material costs. While the denominator effects of pricing were a significant headwind to margin performance on a percentage basis, our continued focus on lowering overhead enabled us to post a modest increase in OI margins.
Turning to Developing Markets. We generated double-digit growth and a good balance of all mixed and pricing. Organic revenues grew 13.5% for the quarter and in the first half, revenues were up 11.6%. 
Power Brands rose 20% in the quarter led by 62% growth of Oreo. Tiger Biskuat crackers grew more than 40%. Block Chocolate was up 23% and Halls rose 16%. 
Within this segment, Asia-Pacific and Latin America continue to grow double-digit. And FEMA was up nearly 10% as economic conditions begin to recover in many parts of the region.
Operating income margin in the quarter rose to 14.2%, driven by overhead leverage and vol/mix gains. OI margins increased even as we continue to invest in our brands, including a strong double-digit increase in A&C. 
So what does this mean for the full year? Based on our solid results through the first half, and our outlook for the balance of the year, we're raising our full year 2011 guidance. On the top line, we've increased our organic net revenue guidance to at least 5% from at least 4% previously. This is mainly due to the impact of additional pricing.
On the bottom line, we're raising our operating EPS guidance to at least $2.25 from at least $2.20 previously. Our guidance reflects process optimism for the balance of the year through the first half, we delivered strong operating gains and currency has been favorable. As a result, we're dropping the year-to-date currency benefit to the bottom line.
We remain cautious with the number of uncertainties in the environment, but our End-to-End Cost Management initiative and strong revenue growth give us confidence that we will continue to deliver high-quality, sustainable growth for the balance of the year.
As our performance over the past several quarters have demonstrated our virtuous cycle is working well around the world. A key focus on Power Brands, categories and markets is that driving top-tier growth in each regions. We're successfully managing unprecedented input cost through renewed pricing power and improving productivity. And our End-to-End Cost Management is generated the savings necessary to expand profits and reinvest in further brand building and innovation.
As a result, Kraft Foods is now positioned to deliver reliable, top-tier growth on both the top and bottom line. 
Now, I'll turn the call back to Irene."

Our operating momentum continues to improve and we're confident in our outlook for the balance of the year. Clearly, our strategy is working. And it would be easy to leave it at that, but we believe there is a significant next step that we can now take that will put our business on an even higher trajectory. 
Over the past 4 years, we reinvigorated our iconic brands around the world, and we've successfully transformed our portfolio. We build a Global Snacks powerhouse and we've strengthened our presence in fast-growing developing markets through several strategic acquisitions, including New Biscuits and Cadbury. 
In addition, we divested certain slower growth, slower margin businesses. A combination of these actions has fundamentally changed the face and the footprint of our company. 
As we look to take our performance to the next level, we recognize that there are very different opportunities to enhance shareholder value between our Global Snacks business and the balance of the portfolio in North America. 
Outside of North America, there's no question that our strong Snack portfolio is well positioned to grow. We see tremendous opportunities ahead as we continue to leverage our global product platforms, our scale in Developing Markets and our route to market capabilities.  We also have ample opportunities to grow in whitespace markets and in instant consumption channels. 
With the addition of the Cadbury business, the North American Snacks portfolio now have the opportunity to pursue many of the same growth drivers and to become a truly ubiquitous snacking powerhouse. 
Specifically, we'll leverage our global innovation platforms in Biscuits, Chocolate, Gum and Candy, and we'll also deliver significant growth from investments in direct-store-delivery and in instant consumption channels.
Now that we've rejuvenated to grow 3 brands within our North American portfolio, it can fulfill its promise of becoming a lean mean center of the store machine. It will leverage its category leading market position and continue to deploy its capabilities in innovation and and marketing, while focusing on warehouse sales and distribution efficiency. But it will require very different investments and resource allocation. 
Simply put, we've now reached a stage in our development with the global Snacks and Grocery businesses in North America with each benefit from standing on their own, and focusing on their unique drivers of success. 
Today's announcement to create 2 independent companies will enable us to do just that. So how will it work? The Global Snacks business will consist of the current Kraft Foods Europe and Kraft Foods Developing Unit, as well as the North American Snacks and Concessionary brands. As an independent company, it will have estimated revenues of approximately $32 billion and a strong growth profile in the top tier of its global peer group. 
Approximately 3/4 quarters of revenues will be from Snacks and more than 40% will come from a diversified footprint in highly attractive developing markets.
The business will also have a strong presence in fast-growing and high-margin instant consumption channels. The non-snacks portion of the portfolio will consist primarily of powdered Beverages and coffee, which have strong growth in margin profile in Developing Markets in Europe. 
Key brands will include Oreo and New Biscuits. Cadbury and Milka chocolates, Trident Gum, Jacko's Coffee and Tang Powdered Beverages. 
Strategically, Global Snacks will focus on industry-leading growth by extending its global product platforms leveraging the significant scale in Developing Markets, expanding in instant consumption channels and aggressively entering whitespace markets. 
Global Snacks with leverage its cost structure through volume growth and improved product mix with discipline investments in sales, distribution and manufacturing.
So what about the North America Grocery business? It will consist of a current U.S. Beverages, Cheese, Convenient Meals and Grocery segment, plus the non-Snack categories in Canada and Foodservice. 
With approximately $16 billion in revenue, this business will continue to be one of the largest and most admired food companies in North America. Its portfolio will include many of the most popular brands on the company with the #1 branded position in 12 of its top 15 categories. 
Just look at these key brands. Kraft Macaroni & Cheese, Auster Meyer Meats, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, Nashwa Health Coffee, Capri Sun Beverages, Jell-O desserts and Miracle Whip salad dressing. 
And as an independent company, the North America Grocery business will continue to leverage great marketing, innovation and leading market shares to deliver reliable revenue growth in line with its categories.
This company will concentrate on capital efficiency by focusing on 3 things: Low cost, enhancing margins and delivering reliable cash flow. It will use a variety of tools, including optimizing trade spending, Lean Six Sigma manufacturing and negative overhead growth. Its primary use of free cash flow will be to provide a highly competitive dividend payout. We manage in line with these objectives, we believe each of these portfolio will provide unique investment opportunities and attractive returns. 
Creating 2 independent companies offers a number of benefits. Each business would focus on its distinct strategic priorities with financial targets that best sets its own market and unique opportunities. Each would be able to allocate resources and deploy capital in a manner consistent with it s strategic priorities in order to optimize total returns to shareholders. And investors would be able to value between companies based on their respective operational and financial characteristics such as growth and yields and thus, to invest accordingly. 
We successfully build 2 strong portfolios. As a result, we are now in a position to see the opportunity to create 2 great companies. Each will have the leadership, resources and mandate to realize its full potential.
I believe this is the best way to stage our businesses for long-term success. The best way for shareholders to value each business and the best way to assure a bright future for our people around the world. 
So to summarize today's news.  We reported terrific results for the second quarter, continuing our strong business momentum. We're raising our outlook for the year and remain confident that we will deliver top tier performance for the full year. 
Our virtuous cycle is working well in every region around the globe, so we're in a strong position to take the next logical step in our evolution, the creation of 2 highly attractive independent public companies designed to increase shareholder value. I'm sure you'll have many questions and as you can understand, we won't hide all the answers today, but, of course, we'll provide further update as appropriate in the coming months.

The rationale for separating these 2 businesses really comes from 2 places, primarily it's about operational benefits. Strategically as we think about the very significant difference in the strategic priority, the focus of the Grocery business on low-cost efficiency, particularly within a warehouse distribution system versus the profile of the Global Snack business, which is about high-growth and essentially the leverage that comes from volume and mix growth, if you think about resource allocation, rather than having these 2 entities competing to run incremental dollars investment and now the opportunity to be able to use $1 with any of those companies to better achieve their objectives. I think from our customer standpoint, they have very different go-to-market strategies as I described a few minutes ago. The difference between a much more stable off-the-shelf management kind of approach to our Grocery businesses as this thing from top-selling and recognizing impulse purchasing of our Snacking business is, I think for investors, I think better understanding the growth drivers and the priorities for the use of cash I think we have never been able to get credit for the tremendous snacking portfolio that we have within the company I think the opportunity as we separate these 2 businesses for that to be much more visible and for investors to see the incredible profile that our billable Snack business has in aggregate and certainly relative to peers I think will serve as well. So ultimately, I believe that separation from operational standpoint allows us to perform better and then, of course, there are of fully some financial benefits that we believe will come just as a consequence of the better clarity in the investment thesis between the 2 entities."

And thanks to all of you for getting up so early for our news. As you've now seen, we made 2 very significant announcements today. First, we reported terrific second quarter earnings. Concurrently, we announced our intenti",918,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning. And thanks to all of you for getting up so early for our news. As you've now seen, we made 2 very significant announcements today. First, we reported terrific second quarter earnings. Concurrently, we announced our intention to create 2 independent publicly traded companies by the end of 2012, as the next step in the transformation of Kraft Foods. 
We'll begin today with a review of our quarterly results. Then, we'll spend the balance of our time on a strategic rationale and benefits of our plan. So let's get started.
In the second quarter, we delivered strong top and bottom line results, continuing our positive momentum through the first half of the year. This sets the stage for strong growth in the second half and positions us well for the next phase of our transformation. 
We talked a lot in the first quarter about the challenges facing us due to higher input cost. We said we would manage them, and we have. I'm pleased to say as we exit the first half, with strong results and good momentum, that we're over the hump and we're quite confident about the balance of the year. 
There are 3 reasons why. First, an input cost increase we quickly priced to offset them. Across our categories, we've announced about 85% of the pricing that we currently expect to take. More than 80% of these increases are already reflected on store shelves. In most cases, we took action earlier than others and in certain categories, we priced quite a bit more aggressively than our key competitors. The fact that we responded quickly to these higher than anticipated costs has put us in a much more favorable position in the marketplace. 
The second reason I'm confident about the balance of the year is that we're winning with our consumers. We've been able to post solid market shares, while pricing aggressively. This is due to our ongoing investments in innovations and marketing. Revenue gains for innovation are up in each region. We're  continuing to improve the quality of our advertising, and we're supporting these efforts by increasing our investments in advertising and consumer marketing support, which are up strongly year-to-date.
Of course, as we raise prices, we have experienced some near-term dislocation in certain categories. But overall, we're seeing solid market share performance across our 4 categories in each of our 3 geographic regions. And it's important to note that Private Label's market share is essentially flat in our 4 categories. 
What also gives me confidence in our business momentum is that despite the substantial increases in input cost, we're growing profit dollars through a combination of pricing and End-to-End Cost Management. 
In fact, despite the loss of the Starbucks CPG business and tough comparisons against peak margins in the second quarter last year, we grew profit dollars year-on-year. Cost savings are enabling us to continue to fund significant increases in A&C. That in turn is fueling our virtuous growth cycle.
I'd especially like to highlight the progress we're  making in our Global Snack category. Many of you have asked if the Cadbury acquisition is driving the growth we thought it would. The answer is an unqualified yes. Last fall, at our Investor Day, we laid out a long-term growth target of mid- to high-single digits for Global Snacks. 
As you can see, the 6% growth we've delivered year-to-date is right in line with that target, and we've only just begun to realize revenue synergies. 
Let's look at the key contributors to that growth.
Global Biscuits is up 7% on a constant currency basis, led by strong double-digit growth in developing markets. 
Let's look at some numbers. Oreo, a $1.5 billion brand has grown 22%. Chips Ahoy!, a brand sold primarily in developed markets is up 18% and Club Social, our leading cracker brand in Latin America, is up 35%. 
Our Global Chocolate Category is growing even faster than Biscuits. It's up about 9%, including gains of low to mid-teens in developing markets. 
Our $1 billion Cadbury Dairy Milk brand, first introduced in 1905 and now sold in 30 countries around the world, has grown 13%, gives some perspective as the best growth in many years. 
Lacta, a $700 million brand in Latin America is up 18%, and Cadbury Flake, a leading brand in many hot weather market is up 13%.
Even Gum & Candy, which had experienced significant challenges, has grown 2% year-to-date, including a high single-digit gain in developing markets. 
As we've said before, the key challenge for Gum & Candy is in developed markets. Revenues are down double digits in North America and are flat in Europe. While we're certainly not satisfied with our Gum results, we expected a slow first half due to 2 factors. First, sluggishness in the instant consumption channel as a result of the challenging macro economy. Specifically the decline in pocket money among teens, our biggest consumer segment. And second, our new product this year were simply not as robust as we had hoped or as strong as last year's innovations. We understand the issues and we're in the process of fixing them with additional innovation and smaller-packed sizes to hit lower price points. We expect to see better results as the year progresses.
That said, Gum & Candy remains an attractive category with excellent long-term growth prospects consistent with our Global Snacking goals. 
Let me now turn it over to Dave, who will provide more detail on our second quarter results."
739693,137102578,152906,"Kraft Foods Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2011",2011-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Mondelez International, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Irene. In a nutshell, we've seen terrific results in both the top and bottom line through the first half of the year. We're seeing pick up from our focused investments behind our power brands, big bets on in innovation and improved marketing. As a",1383,"Thanks, Irene. In a nutshell, we've seen terrific results in both the top and bottom line through the first half of the year. We're seeing pick up from our focused investments behind our power brands, big bets on in innovation and improved marketing. As a result, we built good volume mix, share and revenue momentum in the face of aggressive price increases. 
In the second quarter, organic revenues were more than 7%, including Power Brand growth of about 9%. Of course, the second quarter benefited from Easter, but looking at the first half, which normalizes for the Easter shift, organic revenue was still up nearly 6% with very solid contribution from vol/mix of 1.3. points. This was despite substantial pricing of 4.6 points. 
What can we expect going forward? For the full year, we now believe input cost will be up in the low teens versus last year. That's up from the high single digit increase that we forecast on our call 3 months ago. 
As a result, we do anticipate additional pricing actions to offset this higher cost, but as Irene mentioned, we've already announced or implemented about 85% of the pricing actions we expect to take for the year so we're confident in our outlook.
Turning to profits. We continue to gain momentum. Pricing and productivity gains essentially offset higher raw material costs on a $1 basis. At the same time, continued improvements in overheads and other cost savings under the strong increase in A&C. 
To put it another way, we protected operating profit dollars in the quarter, even though our OI margins declined compared to peak levels a year ago. But this was essentially due to the impact of pricing under denominator of the margin calculation.
Despite this, our underlying operating income margin improved sequentially from the first quarter and for the second half, we expect to see increases in year-over-year margins.
Turning to EPS. As we outlined in our last earnings call, we expect second quarter operating EPS to be down versus the May [ph] of $0.60 last year. We knew we were up against difficult comparisons with peak margins in Q2 2010, as well as the reversal of mark-to-market gains in Q1 this year. But clearly, we did better than our initial expectations. 
Mark-to-market gains did reverse and at $0.05, they were a bit more than we expected. As for the upside, partly due from favorable currency and somewhat due to a lower than anticipated tax rate, the rest came from operating gains. 
On a year-to-date basis, we're encouraged to have delivered $0.06 of operating gains year-over-year despite the fact that we were up against some very difficult margin comparisons to the prior year.
All of our geographies contributed to the strong performance in the quarter. In North America, despite a very difficult operating environment, our virtuous cycle continues to build momentum. Organic revenues were up 4% for the quarter and 3.1% for the first half. As expected, pricing was the key driver. As we said, we priced to offset higher cost earlier than most of our competitors. As a result, all mixed declined as we thought from near-term dislocations in certain categories. 
Despite the significant pricing, however, we were pleased overall with the limited volume elasticity. It was consistent with our expectations and further evidence of the improved strength of our brand equity.
While our Power Brands grew at above the same rate as our broader portfolio, several of our innovations made significant contributions. Our new MiO liquid beverage mix continue to generate revenues well ahead of plan. Oscar Mayer Carving Board cold cuts, Newtons Fruit Thins cookies and Philadelphia Cooking Creme, also performed well. 
As a result, through the first half of the year, our market shares in North America remain solid. More than half the business is holding or gaining share on a $1 basis.
And we're even more encouraged by the fact that to date, we've announced roughly 85% of the pricing we believe we need to take this year. Almost all of that pricing is already reflected on store shelves. 
Now let's take a look at profitability. North America did a good job on pricing to offset higher raw material cost on a $1 basis. The region also continue to benefit from lower overheads. Nevertheless, operating income margins declined for peak levels a year ago due to changes in the U.S. Premium Coffee business and the denominator effect of higher pricing on the margin calculation. Looking ahead, we expect year-on-year margin improvement in the second half.
On the other side of the Atlantic, our European team recorded a sixth consecutive quarter of top and bottom line growth. Organic revenues grew 6.4% in the quarter, while in the first half they rose 5.4%. 
As expected, pricing drove the majority of this growth, as we successfully implemented actions across all categories. As we look ahead, price increases for the third quarter have been announced in Coffee. With that, we've now announced all the pricing we expect to take in Europe this year and about 80% of our pricing is now reflected at retail.
Power Brands rose 8%, including 17% of Oreo fueled by launches in Germany and Austria, leveraging our global play book. Tassimo grew 19% while [indiscernible] Coffee increased 24%. 
In addition, Philadelphia continue to grow strongly up 18%. And while retail sales are slowing across the region, we are continuing to drive growth for our brands and for our categories. 
On a Pan-European basis, year-to-date, we're  increasing share of biscuits and cheese and shares are holding up well in Chocolate, Gum and Coffee. 
There's also good news at the profit line. Despite a difficult environment, Europe delivered another strong quarter. On a $1 basis, pricing and productivity offset the significant increase in raw material costs. While the denominator effects of pricing were a significant headwind to margin performance on a percentage basis, our continued focus on lowering overhead enabled us to post a modest increase in OI margins.
Turning to Developing Markets. We generated double-digit growth and a good balance of all mix and pricing. Organic revenues grew 13.5% for the quarter and in the first half, revenues were up 11.6%. 
Power Brands rose 20% in the quarter led by 62% growth of Oreo. [indiscernible] Club Social crackers grew more than 40%. Lacta Chocolate was up 23% and Halls rose 16%. 
Within this segment, Asia-Pacific and Latin America continue to grow double-digits. And CEEMA was up nearly 10% as economic conditions begin to recover in many parts of the region.
Operating income margin in the quarter rose to 14.2%, driven by overhead leverage and vol/mix gains. OI margins increased even as we continue to invest in our brands, including a strong double-digit increase in A&C. 
So what does this mean for the full year? Based on our solid results through the first half, and our outlook for the balance of the year, we're raising our full year 2011 guidance. On the top line, we've increased our organic net revenue guidance to at least 5% from at least 4% previously. This is mainly due to the impact of additional pricing.
On the bottom line, we're raising our operating EPS guidance to at least $2.25 from at least $2.20 previously. Our guidance reflects process optimism for the balance of the year. Through the first half, we delivered strong operating gains and currency has been favorable. As a result, we're dropping the year-to-date currency benefits to the bottom line.
We remain cautious with the number of uncertainties in the environment, but our End-to-End Cost Management initiatives and strong revenue growth give us confidence that we will continue to deliver high quality, sustainable growth for the balance of the year.
As our performance over the past several quarters have demonstrated, our virtuous cycle is working well around the world. A key focus on Power Brands, categories and markets is driving top-tier growth in each regions. We're successfully managing unprecedented input cost through renewed pricing power and improving productivity. And our End-to-End Cost Management has generated the savings necessary to expand profits and reinvest in further brand building and innovation.
As a result, Kraft Foods is now positioned to deliver reliable, top-tier growth on both the top and bottom line. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Irene."

As you can see, our year-to-date results are strong. Our operating momentum continues to improve and we're confident in our outlook for the balance of the year. Clearly, our strategy is working. And it would be easy to leave it at that, but",1094,"Thanks, Dave. As you can see, our year-to-date results are strong. Our operating momentum continues to improve and we're confident in our outlook for the balance of the year. Clearly, our strategy is working. And it would be easy to leave it at that, but we believe there is a significant next step that we can now take that will put our business on an even higher trajectory. 
Over the past 4 years, we reinvigorated our iconic brands around the world, and we've successfully transformed our portfolio. We build a Global Snacks powerhouse and we've strengthened our presence in fast-growing developing markets through several strategic acquisitions, including New Biscuits and Cadbury. 
In addition, we divested certain slower growth, slower margin businesses. A combination of these actions has fundamentally changed the face and the footprint of our company. 
As we look to take our performance to the next level, we recognize that there are very different opportunities to enhance shareholder value between our Global Snacks business and the balance of the portfolio in North America. 
Outside of North America, there's no question that our strong Snacking portfolio is well positioned to grow. We see tremendous opportunities ahead as we continue to leverage our global product platforms, our scale in Developing Markets and our route to market capabilities.  We also have ample opportunities to grow in whitespace markets and in instant consumption channels. 
With the addition of the Cadbury business, the North American Snacks portfolio now have the opportunity to pursue many of the same growth drivers and to become a truly ubiquitous snacking powerhouse. 
Specifically, we'll leverage our global innovation platforms in Biscuits, Chocolate, Gum and Candy, and we'll also deliver significant growth from investments in direct-store-delivery and in instant consumption channels.
Now that we've rejuvenated to grow 3 brands within our North American portfolio, it can fulfill its promise of becoming a lean, mean center-of-the-store machine. It will leverage its category leading market position and continue to deploy its capabilities in innovation and marketing, while focusing on warehouse sales and distribution efficiency, but it will require very different investments and resource allocation. 
Simply put, we've now reached a stage in our development with the global Snacks and Grocery businesses in North America with each benefit from standing on their own, and focusing on their unique drivers of success. 
Today's announcement to create 2 independent companies will enable us to do just that. So how will it work? The Global Snacks business will consist of the current Kraft Foods Europe and Kraft Foods Developing Market Units, as well as the North American Snacks and Confectionery brands. As an independent company, it will have estimated revenues of approximately $32 billion and a strong growth profile in the top tier of its global peer group. 
Approximately 3/4 quarters of revenues will be from Snacks and more than 40% will come from a diversified footprint in highly attractive developing markets.
The business will also have a strong presence in fast-growing and high-margin instant consumption channels. The non-snacks portion of the portfolio will consist primarily of powdered beverages and coffee, which have strong growth in margin profile in developing markets in Europe. 
Key brands will include Oreo and LU Biscuits. Cadbury and Milka chocolates, Trident Gum, Jacobs Coffee and Tang Powdered Beverages. 
Strategically, Global Snacks will focus on industry-leading growth by extending its global product platforms, leveraging the significant scale in developing markets, expanding in instant consumption channels and aggressively entering whitespace markets. 
Global Snacks will leverage its cost structure through volume growth and improved product mix with disciplined investments in sales, distribution and manufacturing.
So what about the North America Grocery business? It will consist of a current U.S. Beverages, Cheese, Convenient Meals and Grocery segments, plus the non-Snack categories in Canada and Foodservice. 
With approximately $16 billion in revenue, this business will continue to be one of the largest and most admired food companies in North America. Its portfolio will include many of the most popular brands on the continent, with the #1 branded position in 12 of its top 15 categories. 
Just look at these key brands. Kraft Macaroni & Cheese, Oscar Mayer meats, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, Maxwell House Coffee, Capri Sun Beverages, Jell-O desserts and Miracle Whip salad dressing. 
And as an independent company, the North America Grocery business will continue to leverage great marketing, innovation and leading market shares to deliver reliable revenue growth in line with its categories.
This company will concentrate on capital efficiency by focusing on 3 things: Low cost, enhancing margins and delivering reliable cash flow. It will use a variety of tools, including optimizing trade spending, Lean Six Sigma manufacturing and negative overhead growth. Its primary use of free cash flow will be to provide a highly competitive dividend payout. We managed in line with these objectives, we believe each of these portfolio will provide unique investment opportunities and attractive returns. 
Creating 2 independent companies offers a number of benefits. Each business would focus on its distinct strategic priorities with financial targets that best sets its own market and unique opportunities. Each would be able to allocate resources and deploy capital in a manner consistent with its strategic priorities in order to optimize total returns to shareholders. And investors would be able to value the 2 companies based on their respective operational and financial characteristics, such as growth and yields and thus, to invest accordingly. 
We successfully build 2 strong portfolios. As a result, we are now in a position to see the opportunity to create 2 great companies. Each will have the leadership, resources and mandate to realize its full potential.
I believe this is the best way to stage our businesses for long-term success, the best way for shareholders to value each business and the best way to ensure a bright future for our people around the world. 
So to summarize today's news.  We reported terrific results for the second quarter, continuing our strong business momentum. We're raising our outlook for the year and remain confident that we will deliver top tier performance for the full year. 
Our virtuous cycle is working well in every region around the globe, so we're in a strong position to take the next logical step in our evolution, the creation of 2 highly attractive independent public companies designed to increase shareholder value. I'm sure you'll have many questions and as you can understand, we won't have all the answers today, but, of course, we'll provide further update as appropriate in the coming months.

So net-net, the long-term growth rate target and aggregate will not change. We would expect to see underneath that some rebalancing. But as I said to Andrew, we're not in a position today to begin to give guidance for 2012 and beyond. In answer to the question about Tim, I'm quite thrilled that Tim has agreed to postpone his departure from Kraft.

But the focus of our grocery business needs to be on a low-cost warehouse selling system for center of the store products. It's very much focused on shelf management as distinct from a DSD system, which is highly focused on front of the store, impulse merchandising and immediate consumption channels. And so the differences of those businesses, we believe, allows us to create 2  various effective selling capabilities that will optimize the performance of both parts."

The",330,"Yes, so I think for starters, Eric, we do expect that there will be the opportunity for GroceryCo to return more cash to investors, and for SnackCo to better capitalize on its growth by having a much more focused approach to managing those businesses. The rationale for separating these 2 businesses really comes from 2 places. Primarily, it's about operational benefits. Strategically, as we think about the very significant difference in the strategic priority, the focus of the grocery business on low-cost efficiency, particularly within a warehouse distribution system versus the profile of the global snack business, which is about high growth and essentially the leverage that comes from volume and mix growth, if you think about resource allocation, rather than having these 2 entities competing for an incremental dollar investment, we now have the opportunity to be able to use $1 within each of those companies to better achieve their objectives. I think from our customer standpoint, they have very different go-to-market strategies, as I described a few minutes ago. The difference between a much more stable off-the-shelf management kind of approach to our grocery businesses as distinct from top zone, end-aisle merchandising, impulse purchasing of our snacking businesses, I think for investors, I think better understanding the growth drivers and the priorities for the use of cash, I think we have never been able to get credit for the tremendous snacking portfolio that we have within the company. I think the opportunity as we separate these 2 businesses for that to be much more visible and for investors to see the incredible profile that our billable snack business has in aggregate and certainly relative to peers, I think, will serve as well. So ultimately, I believe the separation from an operational standpoint allows us to perform better. And then of course, there are clearly some financial benefits that we believe will come just as a consequence of the better clarity in the investment thesis between the 2 entities."

And thanks to all of you for getting up so early for our news. As you've now seen, we made 2 very significant announcements today. First, we reported terrific second quarter earnings. Concurrently, we announced our intenti",918,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning. And thanks to all of you for getting up so early for our news. As you've now seen, we made 2 very significant announcements today. First, we reported terrific second quarter earnings. Concurrently, we announced our intention to create 2 independent publicly traded companies by the end of 2012, as the next step in the transformation of Kraft Foods. 
We'll begin today with a review of our quarterly results. Then, we'll spend the balance of our time on the strategic rationale and benefits of our plan. So let's get started.
In the second quarter, we delivered strong top and bottom line results, continuing our positive momentum through the first half of the year. This sets the stage for strong growth in the second half and positions us well for the next phase of our transformation. 
We talked a lot in the first quarter about the challenges facing us due to higher input cost. We said we would manage them, and we have. I'm pleased to say as we exit the first half, with strong results and good momentum, that we're over the hump and we're quite confident about the balance of the year. 
Here are 3 reasons why: First, an input cost increase we quickly priced to offset them. Across our categories, we've announced about 85% of the pricing that we currently expect to take. More than 80% of these increases are already reflected on store shelves. In most cases, we took action earlier than others and in certain categories, we priced quite a bit more aggressively than our key competitors. The fact that we responded quickly to these higher than anticipated costs has put us in a much more favorable position in the marketplace. 
The second reason I'm confident about the balance of the year is that we're winning with our consumers. We've been able to post solid market shares, while pricing aggressively. This is due to our ongoing investments in innovations and marketing. Revenue gains for innovation are up in each region. We're  continuing to improve the quality of our advertising, and we're supporting these efforts by increasing our investments in advertising and consumer marketing support, which are up strongly year-to-date.
Of course, as we raise prices, we have experienced some near-term dislocation in certain categories. But overall, we're seeing solid market share performance across our 4 categories in each of our 3 geographic regions. And it's important to note that Private Label's market share is essentially flat in our 4 categories. 
What also gives me confidence in our business momentum is that despite the substantial increases in input cost, we're growing profit dollars through a combination of pricing and End-to-End Cost Management. 
In fact, despite the loss of the Starbucks CPG business and tough comparisons against peak margins in the second quarter last year, we grew profit dollars year-on-year. Cost savings are enabling us to continue to fund significant increases in A&C. That in turn is fueling our virtuous growth cycle.
I'd especially like to highlight the progress we're  making in our Global Snack category. Many of you have asked if the Cadbury acquisition is driving the growth we thought it would. The answer is an unqualified yes. Last fall, at our Investor Day, we laid out a long-term growth target of mid- to high-single digits for Global Snacks. 
As you can see, the 6% growth we've delivered year-to-date is right in line with that target, and we've only just begun to realize revenue synergies. 
Let's look at the key contributors to that growth.
Global Biscuits is up 7% on a constant currency basis, led by strong double-digit growth in developing markets. 
Let's look at some numbers. Oreo, a $1.5 billion brand has grown 22%. Chips Ahoy!, a brand sold primarily in developed markets is up 18% and Club Social, our leading cracker brand in Latin America, is up 35%. 
Our Global Chocolate Category is growing even faster than Biscuits. It's up about 9%, including gains of low to mid-teens in developing markets. 
Our $1 billion Cadbury Dairy Milk brand, first introduced in 1905 and now sold in 30 countries around the world, has grown 13%, gives some perspective that's the best growth in many years. 
Lacta, a $700 million brand in Latin America is up 18%, and Cadbury Flake, a leading brand in many hot weather markets is up 13%.
Even Gum & Candy, which has experienced significant challenges, has grown 2% year-to-date, including a high single-digit gain in developing markets. 
As we've said before, the key challenge for Gum & Candy is in developed markets. Revenues are down double digits in North America and are flat in Europe. While we're certainly not satisfied with our Gum results, we expected a slow first half due to 2 factors. First, sluggishness in the instant consumption channel as a result of the challenging macro economy. Specifically the decline in pocket money among teens, our biggest consumer segment. And second, our new products this year were simply not as robust as we had hoped or as strong as last year's innovations. We understand the issues and we're in the process of fixing them with additional innovation and smaller-pack sizes to hit lower price points. We expect to see better results as the year progresses.
That said, Gum & Candy remains an attractive category with excellent long-term growth prospects consistent with our Global Snacking goals. 
Let me now turn it over to Dave, who will provide more detail on our second quarter results."

In a nutshell, we've seen terrific results on both the top and bottom lines through the first half of the year. We're seeing pick up from our focused investments behind our power brands, big bets on in innovation and improved marketing. As",1382,"Thanks, Irene. In a nutshell, we've seen terrific results on both the top and bottom lines through the first half of the year. We're seeing pick up from our focused investments behind our power brands, big bets on in innovation and improved marketing. As a result, we built good volume mix, share and revenue momentum in the face of aggressive price increases. 
In the second quarter, organic revenues were more than 7%, including Power Brand growth of about 9%. Of course, the second quarter benefited from Easter, but looking at the first half, which normalizes for the Easter shift, organic revenue was still up nearly 6% with very solid contribution from vol/mix of 1.3 points. This was despite substantial pricing of 4.6 points. 
What can we expect going forward? For the full year, we now believe input cost will be up in the low teens versus last year. That's up from the high single digit increase that we forecast on our call 3 months ago. 
As a result, we do anticipate additional pricing actions to offset this higher costs, but as Irene mentioned, we've already announced or implemented about 85% of the pricing actions we expect to take for the year so we're confident in our outlook.
Turning to profits. We continue to gain momentum. Pricing and productivity gains essentially offset higher raw material costs on a $1 basis. At the same time, continued improvements in overheads and other cost savings under the strong increase in A&C. 
To put it another way, we protected operating profit dollars in the quarter, even though our OI margins declined compared to peak levels a year ago. But this was essentially due to the impact of pricing under denominator of the margin calculation.
Despite this, our underlying operating income margin improved sequentially from the first quarter and for the second half, we expect to see increases in year-over-year margins.
Turning to EPS. As we outlined in our last earnings call, we expect second quarter operating EPS to be down versus the base of $0.60 last year. We knew we were up against difficult comparisons with peak margins in Q2 2010, as well as the reversal of mark-to-market gains in Q1 this year. But clearly, we did better than our initial expectations. 
Mark-to-market gains did reverse and at $0.05, they were a bit more than we expected. As for the upside, partly due from favorable currency and somewhat due to a lower than anticipated tax rate, the rest came from operating gains. 
On a year-to-date basis, we're encouraged that we delivered $0.06 of operating gains year-over-year despite the fact that we were up against some very difficult margin comparisons to the prior year.
All of our geographies contributed to the strong performance in the quarter. In North America, despite a very difficult operating environment, our virtuous cycle continues to build momentum. Organic revenues were up 4% for the quarter and 3.1% for the first half. As expected, pricing was the key driver. As we said, we priced to offset higher cost earlier than most of our competitors. As a result, all mix declined as we thought from near-term dislocations in certain categories. 
Despite the significant pricing, however, we were pleased overall with the limited volume elasticity. It was consistent with our expectations and further evidence of the improved strength of our brand equity.
While our Power Brands grew at above the same rate as our broader portfolio, several of our innovations made significant contributions. Our new MiO liquid beverage mix continue to generate revenues well ahead of plan. Oscar Mayer Carving Board cold cuts, Newtons Fruit Thins cookies and Philadelphia Cooking Creme, also performed well. 
As a result, through the first half of the year, our market shares in North America remain solid. More than half the business is holding or gaining share on a $1 basis.
And we're even more encouraged by the fact that to date, we've announced roughly 85% of the pricing we believe we need to take this year. Almost all of that pricing is already reflected on store shelves. 
Now let's take a look at profitability. North America did a good job of pricing to offset higher raw material costs on a $1 basis. The region also continued to benefit from lower overheads. Nevertheless, operating income margins declined for peak levels a year ago due to changes in the U.S. Premium Coffee business and the denominator effect of higher pricing on the margin calculation. Looking ahead, we expect year-on-year margin improvement in the second half.
On the other side of the Atlantic, our European team recorded a sixth consecutive quarter of top and bottom line growth. Organic revenues grew 6.4% in the quarter, while in the first half they rose 5.4%. 
As expected, pricing drove the majority of this growth, as we successfully implemented actions across all categories. As we look ahead, price increases for the third quarter have been announced in Coffee. With that, we've now announced all the pricing we expect to take in Europe this year and about 80% of our pricing is now reflected at retail.
Power Brands rose 8%, including 17% of Oreo fueled by launches in Germany and Austria, leveraging our global play book. Tassimo grew 19% while [indiscernible] Coffee increased 24%. 
In addition, Philadelphia continue to grow strongly up 18%. And while retail sales are slowing across the region, we are continuing to drive growth for our brands and for our categories. 
On a Pan-European basis, year-to-date, we're  increasing share of biscuits and cheese and shares are holding up well in Chocolate, Gum and Coffee. 
There's also good news at the profit line. Despite a difficult environment, Europe delivered another strong quarter. On a $1 basis, pricing and productivity offset the significant increase in raw material costs. While the denominator effects of pricing were a significant headwind to margin performance on a percentage basis, our continued focus on lowering overhead enabled us to post a modest increase in OI margins.
Turning to Developing Markets. We generated double-digit growth and a good balance of all mix and pricing. Organic revenues grew 13.5% for the quarter and in the first half, revenues were up 11.6%. 
Power Brands rose 20% in the quarter led by 62% growth of Oreo. [indiscernible] Club Social crackers grew more than 40%. Lacta Chocolate was up 23% and Halls rose 16%. 
Within this segment, Asia-Pacific and Latin America continue to grow double-digits. And CEEMA was up nearly 10% as economic conditions begin to recover in many parts of the region.
Operating income margin in the quarter rose to 14.2%, driven by overhead leverage and vol/mix gains. OI margins increased even as we continued to invest in our brands, including a strong double-digit increase in A&C. 
So what does this mean for the full year? Based on our solid results through the first half, and our outlook for the balance of the year, we're raising our full year 2011 guidance. On the top line, we've increased our organic net revenue guidance to at least 5% from at least 4% previously. This is mainly due to the impact of additional pricing.
On the bottom line, we're raising our operating EPS guidance to at least $2.25 from at least $2.20 previously. Our guidance reflects process optimism for the balance of the year. Through the first half, we delivered strong operating gains and currency has been favorable. As a result, we're dropping the year-to-date currency benefits to the bottom line.
We remain cautious with the number of uncertainties in the environment, but our End-to-End Cost Management initiatives and strong revenue growth give us confidence that we will continue to deliver high quality, sustainable growth for the balance of the year.
As our performance over the past several quarters has demonstrated, our virtuous cycle is working well around the world. A key focus on Power Brands, categories and markets is driving top-tier growth in each region. We're successfully managing unprecedented input cost through renewed pricing power and improving productivity. And our End-to-End Cost Management has generated the savings necessary to expand profits and reinvest in further brand building and innovation.
As a result, Kraft Foods is now positioned to deliver reliable, top-tier growth on both the top and bottom line. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Irene."

And it would be easy to leave it at that, but we believe there is a significant next step that we can now take that will put our business on an even higher trajectory. 
Over the past 4 years, we reinvigorated our iconic brands around the world, and we've successfully transformed our portfolio. We built a Global Snacks powerhouse and we've strengthened our presence in fast-growing developing markets through several strategic acquisitions, including New Biscuits and Cadbury. 
In addition, we divested certain slower growth, slower margin businesses. The combination of these actions has fundamentally changed the face and the footprint of our company. 
As we look to take our performance to the next level, we recognize that there are very different opportunities to enhance shareholder value between our Global Snacks business and the balance of the portfolio in North America. 
Outside of North America, there's no question that our strong Snacking portfolio is well positioned to grow. We see tremendous opportunities ahead as we continue to leverage our global product platforms, our scale in Developing Markets and our route to market capabilities.  We also have ample opportunities to grow in whitespace markets and in instant consumption channels. 
With the addition of the Cadbury business, the North American Snacks portfolio now has the opportunity to pursue many of the same growth drivers and to become a truly ubiquitous snacking powerhouse. 
Specifically, we'll leverage our global innovation platforms in Biscuits, Chocolate, Gum and Candy, and we'll also deliver significant growth from investments in direct-store-delivery and in instant consumption channels.
Now that we've rejuvenated the grocery brands within our North American portfolio, it can fulfill its promise of becoming a lean, mean center-of-the-store machine. It will leverage its category leading market position and continue to deploy its capabilities in innovation and marketing, while focusing on warehouse sales and distribution efficiency, but it will require very different investments and resource allocation. 
Simply put, we've now reached a stage in our development where the global Snacks and Grocery businesses in North America would each benefit from standing on their own, and focusing on their unique drivers of success. 
Today's announcement to create 2 independent companies will enable us to do just that. So how will it work? The Global Snacks business will consist of the current Kraft Foods Europe and Kraft Foods Developing Market Units, as well as the North American Snacks and Confectionery brands. As an independent company, it will have estimated revenues of approximately $32 billion and a strong growth profile in the top tier of its global peer group. 
Approximately 3/4 quarters of revenues will be from Snacks and more than 40% will come from a diversified footprint in highly attractive developing markets.
The business will also have a strong presence in fast-growing and high-margin instant consumption channels. The non-snacks portion of the portfolio will consist primarily of powdered beverages and coffee, which have strong growth in margin profile in developing markets in Europe. 
Key brands will include Oreo and LU Biscuits. Cadbury and Milka chocolates, Trident Gum, Jacobs Coffee and Tang Powdered Beverages. 
Strategically, Global Snacks will focus on industry-leading growth by extending its global product platforms, leveraging the significant scale in developing markets, expanding in instant consumption channels and aggressively entering whitespace markets. 
Global Snacks will leverage its cost structure through volume growth and improved product mix with disciplined investments in sales, distribution and manufacturing.
So what about the North America Grocery business? It will consist of a current U.S. Beverages, Cheese, Convenient Meals and Grocery segments, plus the non-Snack categories in Canada and Foodservice. 
With approximately $16 billion in revenue, this business will continue to be one of the largest and most admired food companies in North America. Its portfolio will include many of the most popular brands on the continent, with the #1 branded position in 12 of its top 15 categories. 
Just look at these key brands. Kraft Macaroni & Cheese, Oscar Mayer meats, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, Maxwell House Coffee, Capri Sun Beverages, Jell-O desserts and Miracle Whip salad dressing. 
And as an independent company, the North America Grocery business will continue to leverage great marketing, innovation and leading market shares to deliver reliable revenue growth in line with its categories.
This company will concentrate on capital efficiency by focusing on 3 things: Low cost, enhancing margins and delivering reliable cash flow. It will use a variety of tools, including optimizing trade spending, Lean Six Sigma manufacturing and negative overhead growth. Its primary use of free cash flow will be to provide a highly competitive dividend payout. When managed in line with these objectives, we believe each of these portfolios will provide unique investment opportunities and attractive returns. 
Creating 2 independent companies offers a number of benefits. Each business would focus on its distinct strategic priorities with financial targets that best fit its own markets and unique opportunities. Each would be able to allocate resources and deploy capital in a manner consistent with its strategic priorities in order to optimize total returns to shareholders. And investors would be able to value the 2 companies based on their respective operational and financial characteristics, such as growth and yields and thus, to invest accordingly. 
We've successfully built 2 strong portfolios. As a result, we are now in a position to see the opportunity to create 2 great companies. Each will have the leadership, resources and mandate to realize its full potential.
I believe this is the best way to stage our businesses for long-term success, the best way for shareholders to value each business and the best way to ensure a bright future for our people around the world. 
So to summarize today's news.  We reported terrific results for the second quarter, continuing our strong business momentum. We're raising our outlook for the year and remain confident that we will deliver top tier performance for the full year. 
Our virtuous cycle is working well in every region around the globe, so we're in a strong position to take the next logical step in our evolution, the creation of 2 highly attractive independent public companies designed to increase shareholder value. I'm sure you'll have many questions and as you can understand, we won't have all the answers today, but, of course, we'll provide further updates as appropriate in the coming months. 
Operator, let's now open it up for questions."

And as we made, once we made this decision, every decision that we make going forward has some implications for the future state. And so it just made the most sense to just make it public and to begin to implement some of those actions as we move forward here. So it will take some time to actually separate the 2 businesses, but in the meantime, we can have our International businesses focus on completing the Cadbury integration, the bulk of the separation activity, of course, impacts our North American business and we can begin to make the decisions that are consistent with their future role and the future metrics that will be used to evaluate that business."

But the reality is as we look at the economic developments around the world, we would expect that there is likely to be some rebalancing in the profiles of the different regions. But as a consequence of being more targeted and more focused in defining the mandates of these 2 different businesses, we would expect better bottom line performance. So net-net, the long-term growth rate target in aggregates will not change. We would expect to see underneath that some rebalancing. But as I said to Andrew, we're not in a position today to begin to give guidance for 2012 and beyond. In answer to the question about Tim, I'm quite thrilled that Tim has agreed to postpone his departure from Kraft. He will actually lead the steering team that will oversee the creation of this 2 world-class companies, and we're delighted to have somebody with his background, his knowledge of Kraft and of the financial market to really bring some objective and transformational thinking to the creation of these 2 companies. Tim will be in the role until both companies are launched."

And so the differences of those businesses, we believe, allows us to create 2  various effective selling capabilities that will optimize the performance of both parts."

The",330,"Yes, so I think for starters, Eric, we do expect that there will be the opportunity for GroceryCo to return more cash to investors, and for SnackCo to better capitalize on its growth by having a much more focused approach to managing those businesses. The rationale for separating these 2 businesses really comes from 2 places. Primarily, it's about operational benefits. Strategically, as we think about the very significant difference in the strategic priority, the focus of the grocery business on low-cost efficiency, particularly within a warehouse distribution system versus the profile of the global snack business, which is about high growth and essentially the leverage that comes from volume and mix growth, if you think about resource allocation, rather than having these 2 entities competing for an incremental dollar investment, we now have the opportunity to be able to use $1 within each of those companies to better achieve their objectives. I think from our customers' standpoint, they have very different go-to-market strategies, as I described a few minutes ago. The difference between a much more stable off-the-shelf management kind of approach to our grocery businesses as distinct from top zone, end-aisle merchandising, impulse purchasing of our snacking businesses, I think for investors, I think better understanding the growth drivers and the priorities for the use of cash, I think we have never been able to get credit for the tremendous snacking portfolio that we have within the company. I think the opportunity as we separate these 2 businesses for that to be much more visible and for investors to see the incredible profile that our global snack business has in aggregate and certainly relative to peers, I think, will serve as well. So ultimately, I believe the separation from an operational standpoint allows us to perform better. And then of course, there are clearly some financial benefits that we believe will come just as a consequence of the better clarity in the investment thesis between the 2 entities."

So biscuits did well. Nuts was up about 6% with a nutrition platform. Candy was up about 9%. So the U.S. snacks business this quarter is really a gum story. And as Irene mentioned earlier, gum in the U.S. is down about double digits. We have some plans in place to get that back on track, and we expect a significant rebound in the back half. But that's really about the story this quarter. Ongoing, clearly, the idea that we can focus the U.S. snacks business on a DSD route to market, the impulse channel, the hot zone and leave the grocery business to be the center of the store machine, that is something that we would expect to have operational benefits going forward, but that's not in and of itself a reason to drive this bigger transaction. That is one of the benefits we would expect though."

We continue to have good momentum in all geographies on both the top and bottom line. On the top line, consumers are responding favorably to our investments in new products and in better, more effective advertising. This has been a very powerful combination. It's enabled us to take the necessary pricing to offset unprecedented increases in raw material costs, while delivering solid volume/mix and market shares. 
On the bottom line, we grew our underlying operating income at a double-digit rate, both in the third quarter and through 9 months. We did this by effectively managing our input cost through pricing and productivity, while leveraging overheads and driving integration savings. 
Our profit growth is broad-based. We're delivering higher profits in every geography. This reflects the virtuous cycle across the portfolio. We're also growing operating EPS double digits. And we're doing this even as we increased investments to drive future growth. But what gives me even greater confidence as we look ahead is the excellent momentum on each of the businesses that will comprise the new North American Grocery and Global Snacks companies. Let's start with North American Grocery. 
These businesses are delivering strong revenue and profit growth. In fact, the fundamentals are better than ever. Tony Vernon and his team are driving growth through great marketing and a solid pipeline of new products. Through the first 9 months, we've increased our advertising and consumer investments on key brands. Our big bet Grocery innovation have added more than $350 million in net revenues. This step up innovation, together with increased brand support, has enabled us to offset significantly higher input cost through pricing. 
And finally, we're continuing to make tangible progress in End-to-End Cost Management. We're leveraging our lean Six Sigma efforts and driving negative overhead growth to cut costs, while at the same time improving effectiveness.
Turning to our Global Snacks portfolio, it's already delivering strong growth, and we've only begun begin to tap into its potential. Most important, all parts of the Snacks portfolio are growing. Global Biscuits is up 9% year-to-date on a constant-currency basis. Developing Markets are up more than 20%. China and Russia are leading the way, with Biscuits in each country growing more than 40%. This strong performance is driven in part by a combination of revenue synergies from the LU Biscuits acquisition and the beginning of synergies from Cadbury.
Global Chocolate is up 8%. This includes low teens growth across our Developing Markets. India increased nearly 50%, and we also delivered strong growth in Brazil, Argentina, Russia and Ukraine. Gum & Candy is up about 2%. As I discussed last quarter, we continue to see success in our Developing Markets, with growth of nearly 9%. Candy is up double digits, led by Halls and Eclairs. Performance was exceptional especially strong in India, China and Turkey.
Turning to Gum, in Brazil, Trident has achieved record market share and revenue is up more than 15%. In Japan, Gum has grown double digits, led by strong performance of Clorets and Stride. What's more, we've expanded market share by more than 3.5 points. So Gum & Candy is on a roll in Developing Markets. The challenge remains in Europe and North America, where the Gum category is down in multiple most markets. 
The short and long-term fixes for Gum in developed markets that we outlined on our call last quarter are on track. Our market shares are beginning to stabilize. In fact, our U.S. Gum share was essentially flat versus last quarter. While that's not where we want to be, we are making progress.
3 months ago, we discussed the importance of innovation and the need to hit lower price points in the Gum category. In the third quarter, we introduced several new flavors of Base Trident and Trident Layers, as well as new Stride White Mint, featuring Olympic snowboarder, Sean White. And later this month in North America, we're rolling out smaller, $0.50 of Trident and Stride. Together, these actions are helping our Gum business and the category get back on track. As we move forward, we remain confident that we'll see continued improvement.
In terms of Cadbury integration synergies, we're fully on track with our targets. We're on plan to capture 70% of the cost synergies by year end. These savings are already showing up as overhead leverage in a number of businesses. Revenue synergies are also on track, and we expect them to contribute about 50 basis points to our top line growth in 2011. In short, we're quite pleased with our strong performance this quarter. 
So now, let me turn it over to David to provide more details on our results."
739693,141545577,183412,"Kraft Foods Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2011",2011-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Mondelez International, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Irene, and good afternoon.

Before we dive into the numbers, I'd like to offer some perspective on the quality of our results. There's no question that the consumer environment remains difficult and input costs remain high for everybody. Neither is likely to change anytime in the near future. Despite that, we're encouraged by the operating momentum we're seeing across our company. That gives us great confidence as we develop our plans for 2012. Specifically, we're confident that our strategies are the only in answer this tough time. They include continued investments in our brands, with big bets on new products, on key countries, on key categories as well as relentless cost management. We're seeing that play out in our quarter 3 top line performance, where we delivered strong organic growth of 8.4%.
Stepped up pricing was a primary driver of growth. However, vol/mix continue to provide a steady contribution, once again demonstrating the strength of our brands. Our Power Brands have another strong quarter, up 10% globally. 
We also generated significant gains from innovation. For example, across Continental Europe, we're successfully expanding into bite-size chocolates. This is a result of our ability to [indiscernible] to that Cadbury bites to our Milka franchise. 
In Biscuits, we're generating good revenue growth from various whitespace opportunities. Examples include the introduction of Oreo in India, as well as Breakfast Biscuits, including Belvita in the U.K. and jubilee in Russia. And our New To The World innovations such as Liquid Beverage Mix in the U.S. and Philadelphia with Milka in Europe continue to perform quite well.
Turning to profits, underlying operating income rose 12% in the quarter. We delivered growth in every geography. North America rose 4% despite a 3 point headwind from the exit of the Starbucks business. Europe was up 18% and Developing Markets grew 45%. Overall, currency added just over 4 points of growth and vol/mix was favorable as well. But the key driver of operating income growth was effectively managing input cost inflation through pricing and productivity. In fact, we've offset nearly $1.7 billion in higher raw material cost year-to-date. But despite some recent moves in spot prices, costs will continue to decline and remain volatile. So we must, and we'll, remain vigilant on pricing and productivity.
For the full year, we expect input costs to increase in the low teens versus 2010. That means, we'll have another meaningful increase in costs in the fourth quarter. And as we look into 2012, costs will likely be up again, at least through the first half of the year.
In terms of margin, despite the strong increase in operating income, our underlying O/I margin was up only 10 basis points to 13.7%. The reason is simple. The impact of the higher revenue base due to significant pricing, negatively weighed on the margin calculation by about 1 percentage point. This solid contributions from overhead leverage and the timing of ANZ spending versus the prior year.
Turning to earnings per share, operating EPS rose to $0.58 in the third quarter. That's up more than 23% from $0.47 in the year-ago quarter. And through the first 9 months, operating EPS is up more than 10% to $1.72 from $1.56. Favorable foreign currency and a lower tax rate have contributed some of the upside. But for both the quarter and year-to-date, operations drove the majority of our earnings gains.
And as I mentioned earlier, it's most encouraging that all geographies are making a solid contributions to our earnings. Let's start with a look at North America. 
Despite a very difficult operating environment, our virtuous cycle continues to gain momentum. Every North American business segment delivered strong growth. Organic net revenues were up 5.9%. As expected, pricing was the key driver, representing 6.8 percentage points of the growth. Despite this, vol/mix declined only modestly, and was slightly better than the first half trend. We're continuing to invest behind our key brands and new products in North America, and they're responding well. Not promoted volume have been strong, and several of our brands grew revenue double digits in the quarter. They were led by , Belvita Shells and Cheese, Wheat Thins, and Oreo. 
In addition, several of our new product successes are truly redefining our categories. They include our new MiO liquid beverage mixes, which are on track to reach the $100 million mark in their first year; Oscar Mayer Lunchables with Fruit, which are driving record sales of our Lunchables franchise; and Belvita skillets, which are expanding our dinners business by taking share in adjacent categories. 
Our overall vol/mix result was affected by price elasticity. This continues to ramp consumption on a few categories like Cheese. In these categories, we're dealing with some of the highest input costs in history, and a number of competitors have lagged the pricing across psychological rights thresholds on a few market granted SKUs. However, our market share performance remains solid for the portfolio as a whole. This reflects our strong investment in marketing and innovation.
Now let's take a look at profitability. Here, underlying operating income grew 4% in the quarter. We delivered that growth despite the negative impact of about 3 points from changes in the Starbucks CPG business. O/I growth was broad-based, with gains in every business segment. In particular, the North America team has done an outstanding job managing input cost through pricing. They offset more than $800 million in higher commodity costs this year. 
Despite productivity gains and lower SMG&A however, O/I margins declined slightly this quarter. This is due to the negative impact of roughly 1 percentage point from the higher revenue base, driven by significant pricing.
In Europe, operating results remain very strong. The team here delivered its seventh consecutive quarter on both top and bottom line growth. Organic revenues were up 5.2%; pricing contributed 4 points to growth, led by double-digit pricing in Coffee; our European Power Brands rose 13%. Here are some highlights.: Oreo, up 35%; Tassimo, up 30%; Milka, Belvita and Philadelphia were all up about 20%. 
Growth benefited from the timing of some shipments between the second and third quarters, but even after adjusting for this impact, our Power Brands  growth was still in the high single digits. Top line growth also reflected benefits from revenue synergies in Chocolates and Biscuits from both the LU and Cadbury acquisitions. These helped fuel nearly 70% growth in our chocobakery platform. And despite significant pricing, market shares were strong across the board.
Now let's turn to profit. Underlying operating income rose 18%, including a positive 11 percentage point impact from currency. The increase in both operating income and margin was driven by vol/mix gains, lower overhead and improve productivity. Margin increased despite the negative impact of the higher revenue base on the calculation of about 1.5 percentage points. 
Even with significant pricing this year, net price realization continue to lag price inflation. We've announced additional pricing actions in certain categories, and we expect to see these fully implemented in the coming months.
In Developing Markets, we delivered another quarter of very strong growth. The virtuous cycle continues to pay off, and the benefits of integration are beginning to take hold. Organic revenues grew 15.3%, with a good balance between pricing and vol/mix. Growth benefited somewhat from the normalization of trade inventory of last year. In addition, at the end of the third quarter, we did observe some customers buying ahead of announced price increases. This may soften growth in the fourth quarter, but we still expect solid double-digit growth for the full year. 
Within the region, Asia Pacific, led by India and China, and Latin America, led by Brazil, continue their double-digit growth rates. But CEEMA also grew double digits, reflecting a significant turnaround in a region that's been hard-hit economically. Ukraine continues to stand out, delivering growth of more than 35%, and Russia was up sharply due to gains in Chocolates and Biscuits. Power Brands grew more than 17%, led by growth of nearly 50% for Oreo, TUC and Club Social Biscuits. 
Underlying operating income margin increased significantly in the quarter to 15.3%. Underlying operating income grew 45%. This improvement reflected effective management of input cost and vol/mix gains. As with revenue, the  year-on-year comparison also benefited from the normalization of trade inventories a year ago. 
We continue to support growth in Developing Markets. We have made significant investments in sales capabilities to leverage opportunity from the combination of Kraft and Cadbury. We're funding these investments through end-to-end cost savings and integration synergies.
Turning to our guidance, we began to increase both our top and bottom line guidance for the year. This is due to our strong operational performance and business momentum in each region through the first 9 months. On the top line, we're raising our outlook for organic net revenue growth to at least 6%. That's up from at least 5% previously. And on the bottom line, we've increased our operating EPS guidance to at least $2.27, up from at least $2.25. This reflects several things: Strong operating gains year-to-date; our continued increases in investments to accelerate future growth opportunities and cost savings; and the currency benefits we've realized through the first 9 months. 
I should note that given the recent volatility and in exchange rates, our operating EPS guidance excludes any potential impact from currency in the fourth quarter. We will, however, flow the currency impact, positive or negative, through to EPS in the fourth quarter. 
Now I'll turn it back to Irene."

Let me update you on the process of preparing for the launch of our 2 new companies. Over the past 3 months, we've made great progress. Since our last presentation at the back-to-school conference in September, we've defined the strategic foundations for each. This work included the detailed brand splits and licensing structures between the 2 companies. The most significant of these was about our Planters brand. Specifically, we decided that Planters would fit best within the North American Grocery company. Why? Because Planters is a U.S.-only business, most of it sales are in supermarkets, and its route to market and supply chain aligns much better with the warehouse network rather than with the direct store delivery system used for cookies and crackers. Until the separation is completed though, the business will continue to be managed and reported as a part of U.S. Snacks.
We've also decided on the name for the North American Grocery company when it launches next year. It will be Kraft Foods. This company will keep the Kraft name because it has very strong consumer recognition and brand equity in the U.S. and Canada. We're still working on the name for the Global Snacks company, which will be put to a shareholder vote in May. 
In addition, the tax filings in the U.S. and Canada are on track with the Canadian filing recently submitted. And we filed our initial Form 10 [ph] during the second quarter next year. 
We are well underway in designing the frameworks for each organization, transition teams across the company are developing detailed plans to prepare for this stint. Finally, we expect to renounce the leadership for each company by the end of the year.
So to summarize, our momentum remains strong across our businesses Q3 and around the world. We've raised our outlook for 2011, and we remain confident that we'll perform in the top tier of our peer group for the full year. We're on track to take the next logical step in our transformation: The creation of 2 highly attractive, independent public companies, each with a clear mandate, and each with the ability to deliver attractive returns to shareholders.

And then we kept in primarily Coffee and powdered Beverages in selected geographies for scale and purposes. Brands like Philly are very strong contributors to the portfolios like in Europe. I mean, in fact it was up around 19% in the third quarter as it was elsewhere in the world. So the reality is these are businesses that are a part, particularly in any given country, they are an important part of the overall portfolio that we take to market in a particular country. It does not significantly impact the overall profile of the snacking company. And in fact, the simplicity of North American Grocery in terms of being concentrated in the U.S. and Canada is part of what allows us to do some things differently than we would be able to do otherwise in terms of systems support, in terms of sales support and a lot of the infrastructure. And that's really the basis for our ability to simplify that business and drive down the cost structure considerably. So it was a consideration, a practical consideration of how best to execute this in a way that would allow the business to continue to perform. But it was also part of the rationale for the North American Grocery business is to make it a much more focused, homogeneous business, and in that sense, we felt that this is the right way to execute it."

So traditionally, quarter 4 is a low quarter in terms of margins. I think last year, in particular, it was lower because we made a decision to invest more for growth in the back half.

So, for example, in markets like Brazil, we've now got Kraft products that are being sold in twice as many outlets going from about 300,000 outlets to almost 700,000 outlets. I've talked about the investments that we've made in India that has -- and basically, we're distributing our Oreo product through the chocolate distributors in India.

We continue to have good momentum in all geographies on both the top and bottom lines. On the top line, consumers are responding favorably to our investments in new products and in better and more effective advertising. This has been a powerful combination. It's enabled us to take the necessary pricing to offset unprecedented increases in raw material costs, while delivering solid volume mix and market shares. 
On the bottom line, we grew our underlying operating income at a double-digit rate, both in the third quarter and through 9 months. We did this by effectively managing our input costs through pricing and productivity while leveraging overheads and driving integration savings. 
Our profit growth is broad-based. We're delivering higher profits in every geography. This reflects the virtuous cycle across the portfolio. We're also growing operating EPS double digits. And we're doing this even as we increase investments to drive future growth. But what gives me even greater confidence as we look ahead is the excellent momentum on each of the businesses that will comprise the new North American Grocery and Global Snacks companies. Let's start with North American Grocery. 
These businesses are delivering strong revenue and profit growth. In fact, the fundamentals are better than ever. Tony Vernon and his team are driving growth through great marketing and a solid pipeline of new products. Through the first 9 months, we've increased our advertising and consumer investments on key brands. Our big bet grocery innovations have added more than $350 million in net revenues. This stepped up innovation, together with increased brand support, has enabled us to offset significantly higher input costs through pricing. 
And finally, we're continuing to make tangible progress in End-to-End Cost Management. We're leveraging our Lean Six Sigma efforts and driving negative overhead growth to cut costs while at the same time improving effectiveness.
Turning to our Global Snacks portfolio. It's already delivering strong growth, and we've only begun to tap its potential. Most important, all parts of the Snacks portfolio are growing. Global Biscuits is up 9% year-to-date on a constant-currency basis. Developing Markets are up more than 20%. China and Russia are leading the way with Biscuits in each country growing more than 40%. This strong performance is driven in part by a combination of revenue synergies from the LU Biscuit acquisition and the beginning of synergies from Cadbury.
Global Chocolate is up 8%. This includes low teens growth across our Developing Markets. India increased nearly 50%, and we also delivered strong growth in Brazil, Argentina, Russia and Ukraine. Gum & Candy is up about 2%. As I discussed last quarter, we continue to see success in our Developing Markets with growth of nearly 9%. Candy is up double digits led by Halls and Eclairs. Performance was especially strong in India, China and Turkey.
Turning to Gum. In Brazil, Trident has achieved record market share and revenue is up more than 15%. In Japan, Gum has grown double digits led by strong performance of Clorets and Stride. What's more, we've expanded market share by more than 3.5 points. So Gum & Candy is on a roll in Developing Markets. The challenge remains in Europe and North America where the Gum category is down in most markets. 
The short- and long-term fixes for Gum in developed markets that we outlined on our call last quarter are on track. Our market shares are beginning to stabilize. In fact, our U.S. Gum share was essentially flat versus last quarter. While that's not where we want to be, we are making progress.
Three months ago, we discussed the importance of innovation and the need to hit lower price points in the Gum category. In the third quarter, we introduced several new flavors of Base Trident and Trident Layers as well as new Stride Whitemint, featuring Olympic snowboarder, Shaun White. And later this month in North America, we're rolling out smaller $0.50 packs of Trident and Stride. Together, these actions are helping our Gum business and the category get back on track. As we move forward, we remain confident that we'll see continued improvement.
In terms of Cadbury integration synergies, we're fully on track with our targets. We're on plan to capture 70% of the cost synergies by year end. These savings are already showing up as overhead leverage in a number of businesses. Revenue synergies are also on track, and we expect them to contribute about 50 basis points to our top line growth in 2011. In short, we're quite pleased with our strong performance this quarter. 
So now let me turn it over to Dave to provide more details on our results."
739693,141545577,183621,"Kraft Foods Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2011",2011-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Mondelez International, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Irene, and good afternoon.

Before we dive into the numbers, I'd like to offer some perspective on the quality of our results. There's no question that the consumer environment remains difficult and input costs remain high for everybody. Neither is likely to change anytime in the near future. Despite that, we're encouraged by the operating momentum we're seeing across our company. That gives us great confidence as we develop our plans for 2012. Specifically, we're confident that our strategies are the only answer in these tough times. They include continued investments in our brands with big bets on new products, on key countries, on key categories as well as relentless cost management. We're seeing that play out in our quarter 3 top line performance where we delivered strong organic growth of 8.4%.
Stepped up pricing was the primary driver of growth. However, vol/mix continue to provide a steady contribution, once again demonstrating the strength from our brands. Our Power Brand had another strong quarter, up 10% globally. 
We also generated significant gains from innovation. For example, across Continental Europe, we're successfully expanding into bite-sized chocolates. This is a result of our ability to factor that Cadbury Bytes to our Milka franchise. 
In Biscuits, we're generating good revenue growth from various whitespace opportunities. Examples include the introduction of Oreo in India, as well as breakfast biscuits, including Belvita in the U.K. and Jubilee in Russia. And our new to the world innovations, such as MiO liquid beverage mixes in the U.S. and Philadelphia with Milka in Europe continue to perform quite well.
Turning to profits. Underlying operating income rose 12% in the quarter. We delivered growth in every geography. North America rose 4% despite a 3-point headwind from the exit of the Starbucks business. Europe was up 18% and Developing Markets grew 45%. Overall, currency added just over 4 points of growth and vol/mix was favorable as well. But the key driver of operating income growth was effectively managing input cost inflation through pricing and productivity. In fact, we've offset roughly $1.7 billion in higher raw material costs year-to-date. But despite some recent moves in spot prices, costs will continue to decline and remain volatile. So we must and we'll remain vigilant on pricing and productivity.
For the full year, we expect input costs to increase in the low teens versus 2010. That means we'll have another meaningful increase in costs in the fourth quarter. And as we look into 2012, costs will likely be up again at least through the first half of the year.
In terms of margin, despite the strong increase in operating income, our underlying OI margin was up only 10 basis points to 13.7%. The reason is simple. The impact of a higher revenue base due to significant pricing negatively weighed on the margin calculation by about 1 percentage point. This massed solid contributions from overhead leverage and the timing of A&C spending versus the prior year.
Turning to earnings per share. Operating EPS rose to $0.58 in the third quarter. That's up more than 23% from $0.47 in the year ago quarter. And through the first 9 months, operating EPS is up more than 10% to $1.72 from $1.56. Favorable foreign currency and a lower tax rate have contributed some of the upside. But for both the quarter and year-to-date, operations drove the majority of our earnings gains.
And as I mentioned earlier, it's most encouraging that all geographies are making a solid contribution to our earnings. Let's start with a look at North America. 
Despite a very difficult operating environment, our virtuous cycle continues to gain momentum. Every North American business segment delivered strong growth. Organic net revenues were up 5.9%. As expected, pricing was the key driver, representing 6.8 percentage points of the growth. Despite this, vol/mix declined only modestly and was slightly better than the first half trend. We're continuing to invest behind our key brands and new products in North America, and they're responding well. Nonpromoted volume have been strong, and several of our brands grew revenue double digits in the quarter. They were led by Newtons, Velveeta Shells & Cheese, Wheat Thins and Oreo. 
In addition, several of our new product successes are truly redefining our categories. They include our new MiO liquid beverage mixes, which are on track to reach the $100 million mark in their first year; Oscar Mayer Lunchables with Fruit, which are driving record sales of our Lunchables franchise; and Velveeta Skillets, which are expanding our Dinners business by taking share in adjacent categories. 
Our overall vol/mix result was affected by price elasticity. This continues to ramp consumption in a few categories like Cheese. In these categories, we're dealing with some of the highest input costs in history, and a number of competitors have lagged our pricing as we cross psychological price thresholds on a few market brands and SKUs. However, our market share performance remained solid for the portfolio as a whole. This reflects our strong investment in marketing and innovation.
Now let's take a look at profitability. Here, underlying operating income grew 4% in the quarter. We delivered that growth despite the negative impact of about 3 points from changes in the Starbucks CPG business. OI growth was broad-based with gains in every business segment. In particular, the North America team has done an outstanding job managing input costs through pricing. They offset more than $800 million in higher commodity costs this year. 
Despite productivity gains and lower SMG&A, however, OI margin declined slightly this quarter. This is due to the negative impact of roughly 1 percentage point from the higher revenue base driven by significant pricing.
In Europe, operating results remained very strong. The team here delivered its seventh consecutive quarter on both top and bottom line growth. Organic revenues were up 5.2%. Pricing contributed 4 points to growth led by double-digit pricing in Coffee. Our European Power Brands rose 13%. Here are some highlights: Oreo, up 35%; Tassimo, up 30%; Milka, Belvita and Philadelphia were all up about 20%. 
Growth benefited from the timing of some shipments between the second and third quarters, but even after adjusting for this impact, Power Brand  growth was still in the high single digits. Top line growth also reflected benefits from revenue synergies in Chocolate and Biscuits from both the LU and Cadbury acquisitions. This helped fuel nearly 70% growth of our chocobakery platform. And despite significant pricing, market shares were strong across the board.
Now let's turn to profit. Underlying operating income rose 18%, including a positive 11 percentage point impact from currency. The increase in both operating income and margin was driven by vol/mix gains, lower overheads and improved productivity. Margin increased despite the negative impact of a higher revenue base on the calculation of about 1.5 percentage points. 
Even with significant pricing this year, net price realization continues to lag cost inflation. We've announced additional pricing actions in certain categories, and we expect to see these fully implemented in the coming months.
In Developing Markets, we delivered another quarter of very strong growth. The virtuous cycle continues to pay off, and the benefits of integration are beginning to take hold. Organic revenues grew 15.3% with a good balance between pricing and vol/mix. Growth benefited somewhat from the normalization of trade inventory of last year. In addition, at the end of the third quarter, we did observe some customers buying ahead of announced price increases. This may soften growth in the fourth quarter, but we still expect solid double-digit growth for the full year. 
Within the region, Asia Pacific led by India and China and Latin America led by Brazil continued their double-digit growth rates. But CEEMA also grew double digits, reflecting a significant turnaround in a region that's been hard-hit economically. Ukraine continues to stand out, delivering growth of more than 35%, and Russia was up sharply due to gains in Chocolate and Biscuits. Power Brand grew more than 17% led by growth of nearly 50% for Oreo, Tuc and Club Social biscuits. 
Underlying operating income margin increased significantly in the quarter to 15.3%. Underlying operating income grew 45%. This improvement reflected effective management of input costs and vol/mix gains. As with revenue, the year-on-year comparison also benefited from the normalization of trade inventories a year ago. 
We continue to support growth in Developing Markets. We have made significant investments in sales capabilities to leverage opportunities from the combination of Kraft and Cadbury. We're funding these investments from end-to-end cost savings and integration synergies.
Turning to our guidance. We began to increase both our top and bottom line guidance for the year. This is due to our strong operating performance and business momentum in each region through the first 9 months. On the top line, we're raising our outlook for organic net revenue growth to at least 6%. That's up from at least 5% previously. And on the bottom line, we've increased our operating EPS guidance to at least $2.27, up from at least $2.25. This reflects several things: strong operating gains year-to-date, our continued increases in investments to accelerate future growth opportunities and cost savings and the currency benefits we've realized through the first 9 months. 
I should note that given the recent volatility in exchange rates, our operating EPS guidance excludes any potential impact from currency in the fourth quarter. We will, however, flow the currency impact, positive or negative, through to EPS in the fourth quarter. 
Now I'll turn it back to Irene."

Let me update you on the process of preparing for the launch of our 2 new companies. Over the past 3 months, we've made great progress. Since our last presentation at the back-to-school conference in September, we've defined the strategic foundations for each. This work included the detailed brand splits and licensing structures between the 2 companies. The most significant of these was about the Planters brand. 
Specifically, we decided that Planters would fit best within the North American Grocery company. Why? Because Planters is a U.S.-only business. Most of its sales are in supermarkets, and its route to market and supply chain aligns much better with a warehouse network rather than with the direct store delivery systems used for cookies and crackers. Until the separation is completed though, the business will continue to be managed and reported as part of U.S. Snacks.
We've also decided on the name for the North American Grocery company when it launches next year. It will be Kraft Foods. This company will keep the Kraft name because it has very strong consumer recognition and brand equity in the U.S. and Canada. We're still working on the name for the Global Snacks company, which will be put to a shareholder vote in May. 
In addition, the tax filings in the U.S. and Canada are on track with the Canadian filing recently submitted. And we'll file our initial Form-10 during the second quarter next year. 
We're well underway in designing the frameworks for each organization. Transition teams across the company are developing detailed plans to prepare for this stint. Finally, we expect to renounce the leadership for each company by the end of the year.
So to summarize, our momentum remains strong across our businesses and around the world. We've raised our outlook for 2011, and we remain confident that we'll perform in the top tier of our peer group for the full year. We're on track to take the next logical step in our transformation: The creation of 2 highly attractive, independent public companies, each with a clear mandate and each with the ability to deliver attractive returns to shareholders.

As we sit here today, we would still see costs up again next year. Nowhere near the impact we've had this year, that could obviously change positive or negative, but certainly not like this year. But I think most important, our intention would be to price away the input cost inflation the same as we had this year and to drive our brand equity investments through continued overhead and productivity drive focus.

I think the combination of the investments that we've made in our brand, the big bets that we've made on new products, as well as the relentless focus that [indiscernible] and the team has placed on cost management, have all been the factors that enabled us to essentially win in this very challenging environment."

But we believe that the key to success is to have strong brands that are well supported with a strong innovation pipeline, and that's been the key to our performance. I would say the -- one of the lessons that was learned in 2008 was that when a lot of our retail partners supported private label to the exclusion of the strong brand, the categories did not perform well. And I think it was a really important lesson that was learned, and it's making the response this time around quite different. And at the end of the day, our obligation and our ability to compete is to drive traffic to their stores. And again, as long as we have strong brands that are well supported and a strong innovation pipeline, that's what gives us the ability to be able to take the pricing."

First of all, what I would tell you is, as we contemplated the best way to do the split, we try to get the right balance of understanding the different business characteristics as well as making sure it was simple to execute. And so we chose to keep our International business essentially intact because it's primarily a Snacking business. 85% of the revenue in the International business is in Snacks. And then we kept in primarily coffee and powdered beverages in selected geographies for scale purposes. Brands like Philly are very strong contributors to portfolios like in Europe. I mean, in fact, it was up about 19% in the third quarter as it was elsewhere in the world. So the reality is these are businesses that are a part -- particularly in a given country, they are an important part of the overall portfolio that we take to market in a particular country. It does not significantly impact the overall profile of the snacking company. And in fact, the simplicity of North American Grocery in terms of being concentrated in the U.S. and Canada is part of what allows us to do some things differently than we would be able to do otherwise in terms of systems support, in terms of sales support and a lot of the infrastructure. And that's really the basis for our ability to simplify that business and drive down the cost structure considerably. So it was a consideration, a practical consideration of how best to execute this in a way that would allow the business to continue to perform. But it was also part of the rationale for the North American Grocery business is to make it a much more focused homogeneous business, and in that sense, we felt that this is the right way to execute it."

I think in your comments, you said that fourth quarter, some customers have pulled forward volume, I think, in Developing Markets in advance of price increases. What do you think just quantitatively that would mean to our modeling for fourth quarter?

And in Developing Markets, in particular, I think the reason we made those comments is just quarter 3 was so darn good. At 15%, we would want people to think we're going to run at that rate going forward. We did have a couple of one-offs that helped us get that number. But Developing Markets is a double-digit growth business, and we would expect to see double-digit growth on the year. And we would expect to be 6% or higher on total KFT on the year. So I think on the revenue, that explains that. In terms of quarter 4 and the margin trends, we have a seasonal business. We sell different things as we go through the year. So traditionally, quarter 4 is a lower quarter in terms of margins. I think last year, in particular, it was lower because we made a decision to invest more for growth in the back half. So both quarter 3 and quarter 4 were a little bit lower than typical. And this year, frankly, I think it's a little more normal pacing of our operating income. So I think last year was a bit of an anomaly. But, yes, most years, you would see quarter 4 a bit lower than the other quarters. It just won't be as dramatic as it happened last year."

So, for example, in markets like Brazil, we've now got Kraft products that are being sold in twice as many outlets, going from about 300,000 outlets to almost 700,000 outlets. I've talked about the investments that we've made in India that have -- and basically, we're distributing our Oreo product through the chocolate distributors in India. In Mexico, we're combining the 380,000 outlets that Cadbury had together with the outlets that Kraft biscuits were distributed in.

We continue to have good momentum in all geographies on both the top and bottom lines. On the top line, consumers are responding favorably to our investments in new products and in better and more effective advertising. This has been a powerful combination. It's enabled us to take the necessary pricing to offset unprecedented increases in raw material costs, while delivering solid volume mix and market shares. 
On the bottom line, we grew our underlying operating income at a double-digit rate, both in the third quarter and through 9 months. We did this by effectively managing our input costs through pricing and productivity while leveraging overheads and driving integration savings. 
Our profit growth is broad-based. We're delivering higher profits in every geography. This reflects the virtuous cycle across the portfolio. We're also growing operating EPS double digits. And we're doing this even as we increase investments to drive future growth. But what gives me even greater confidence as we look ahead is the excellent momentum on each of the businesses that will comprise the new North American Grocery and Global Snacks companies. Let's start with North American Grocery. 
These businesses are delivering strong revenue and profit growth. In fact, the fundamentals are better than ever. Tony Vernon and his team are driving growth through great marketing and a solid pipeline of new products. Through the first 9 months, we've increased our advertising and consumer investments on key brands. Our big bet grocery innovations have added more than $350 million in net revenues. This stepped up innovation, together with increased brand support, has enabled us to offset significantly higher input costs through pricing. 
And finally, we're continuing to make tangible progress in End-to-End Cost Management. We're leveraging our Lean Six Sigma efforts and driving negative overhead growth to cut costs while at the same time improving effectiveness.
Turning to our Global Snacks portfolio. It's already delivering strong growth, and we've only begun to tap its potential. Most important, all parts of the Snacks portfolio are growing. Global Biscuits is up 9% year-to-date on a constant-currency basis. Developing Markets are up more than 20%. China and Russia are leading the way with Biscuits in each country growing more than 40%. This strong performance is driven in part by a combination of revenue synergies from the LU Biscuit acquisition and the beginning of synergies from Cadbury.
Global Chocolate is up 8%. This includes low teens growth across our Developing Markets. India increased nearly 50%, and we also delivered strong growth in Brazil, Argentina, Russia and Ukraine. Gum & Candy is up about 2%. As I discussed last quarter, we continue to see success in our Developing Markets with growth of nearly 9%. Candy is up double digits led by Halls and Eclairs. Performance was especially strong in India, China and Turkey.
Turning to Gum. In Brazil, Trident has achieved record market share and revenue is up more than 15%. In Japan, Gum has grown double digits led by strong performance of Clorets and Stride. What's more, we've expanded market share by more than 3.5 points. So Gum & Candy is on a roll in Developing Markets. The challenge remains in Europe and North America where the Gum category is down in most markets. 
The short- and long-term fixes for Gum in developed markets that we outlined on our call last quarter are on track. Our market shares are beginning to stabilize. In fact, our U.S. Gum share was essentially flat versus last quarter. While that's not where we want to be, we are making progress.
Three months ago, we discussed the importance of innovation and the need to hit lower price points in the Gum category. In the third quarter, we introduced several new flavors of Base Trident and Trident Layers as well as new Stride Whitemint, featuring Olympic snowboarder, Shaun White. And later this month in North America, we're rolling out smaller $0.50 packs of Trident and Stride. Together, these actions are helping our Gum business and the category get back on track. As we move forward, we remain confident that we'll see continued improvement.
In terms of Cadbury integration synergies, we're fully on track with our targets. We're on plan to capture 70% of the cost synergies by year end. These savings are already showing up as overhead leverage in a number of businesses. Revenue synergies are also on track, and we expect them to contribute about 50 basis points to our top line growth in 2011. In short, we're quite pleased with our strong performance this quarter. 
So now let me turn it over to Dave to provide more details on our results."
739693,141545577,183679,"Kraft Foods Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2011",2011-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Mondelez International, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Irene, and good afternoon. Before we dive into the numbers, I'd like to offer some perspective on the quality of our results. There's no question that the consumer environment remains difficult and input costs remain high for everybody. Neither is",1583,"Thanks, Irene, and good afternoon. Before we dive into the numbers, I'd like to offer some perspective on the quality of our results. There's no question that the consumer environment remains difficult and input costs remain high for everybody. Neither is likely to change anytime in the near future. Despite that, we're encouraged by the operating momentum we're seeing across our company. That gives us great confidence as we develop our plans for 2012. Specifically, we're confident that our strategies are the only answer in these tough times. They include continued investments in our brands with big bets on new products, on key countries, on key categories as well as relentless cost management. We're seeing that play out in our quarter 3 top line performance where we delivered strong organic growth of 8.4%.
Stepped up pricing was the primary driver of growth. However, vol/mix continue to provide a steady contribution, once again demonstrating the strength from our brands. Our Power Brand had another strong quarter, up 10% globally. 
We also generated significant gains from innovation. For example, across Continental Europe, we're successfully expanding into bite-sized chocolates. This is a result of our ability to factor that Cadbury Bytes to our Milka franchise. 
In Biscuits, we're generating good revenue growth from various whitespace opportunities. Examples include the introduction of Oreo in India, as well as breakfast biscuits, including Belvita in the U.K. and Jubilee in Russia. And our new to the world innovations, such as MiO liquid beverage mixes in the U.S. and Philadelphia with Milka in Europe continue to perform quite well.
Turning to profits. Underlying operating income rose 12% in the quarter. We delivered growth in every geography. North America rose 4% despite a 3-point headwind from the exit of the Starbucks business. Europe was up 18% and Developing Markets grew 45%. Overall, currency added just over 4 points of growth and vol/mix was favorable as well. But the key driver of operating income growth was effectively managing input cost inflation through pricing and productivity. In fact, we've offset roughly $1.7 billion in higher raw material costs year-to-date. But despite some recent moves in spot prices, costs will continue to decline and remain volatile. So we must and we'll remain vigilant on pricing and productivity.
For the full year, we expect input costs to increase in the low teens versus 2010. That means we'll have another meaningful increase in costs in the fourth quarter. And as we look into 2012, costs will likely be up again at least through the first half of the year.
In terms of margin, despite the strong increase in operating income, our underlying OI margin was up only 10 basis points to 13.7%. The reason is simple. The impact of a higher revenue base due to significant pricing negatively weighed on the margin calculation by about 1 percentage point. This masked solid contributions from overhead leverage and the timing of A&C spending versus the prior year.
Turning to earnings per share. Operating EPS rose to $0.58 in the third quarter. That's up more than 23% from $0.47 in the year ago quarter. And through the first 9 months, operating EPS is up more than 10% to $1.72 from $1.56. Favorable foreign currency and a lower tax rate have contributed some of the upside. But for both the quarter and year-to-date, operations drove the majority of our earnings gains.
And as I mentioned earlier, it's most encouraging that all geographies are making a solid contribution to our earnings. Let's start with a look at North America. 
Despite a very difficult operating environment, our virtuous cycle continues to gain momentum. Every North American business segment delivered strong growth. Organic net revenues were up 5.9%. As expected, pricing was the key driver, representing 6.8 percentage points of the growth. Despite this, vol/mix declined only modestly and was slightly better than the first half trend. We're continuing to invest behind our key brands and new products in North America, and they're responding well. Nonpromoted volume have been strong, and several of our brands grew revenue double digits in the quarter. They were led by Newtons, Velveeta Shells & Cheese, Wheat Thins and Oreo. 
In addition, several of our new product successes are truly redefining our categories. They include our new MiO liquid beverage mixes, which are on track to reach the $100 million mark in their first year; Oscar Mayer Lunchables with Fruit, which are driving record sales of our Lunchables franchise; and Velveeta Skillets, which are expanding our Dinners business by taking share in adjacent categories. 
Our overall vol/mix result was affected by price elasticity. This continues to ramp consumption in a few categories like Cheese. In these categories, we're dealing with some of the highest input costs in history, and a number of competitors have lagged our pricing as we cross psychological price thresholds on a few market brands and SKUs. However, our market share performance remained solid for the portfolio as a whole. This reflects our strong investment in marketing and innovation.
Now let's take a look at profitability. Here, underlying operating income grew 4% in the quarter. We delivered that growth despite the negative impact of about 3 points from changes in the Starbucks CPG business. OI growth was broad-based with gains in every business segment. In particular, the North America team has done an outstanding job managing input costs through pricing. They offset more than $800 million in higher commodity costs this year. 
Despite productivity gains and lower SMG&A, however, OI margin declined slightly this quarter. This is due to the negative impact of roughly 1 percentage point from the higher revenue base driven by significant pricing.
In Europe, operating results remained very strong. The team here delivered its seventh consecutive quarter on both top and bottom line growth. Organic revenues were up 5.2%. Pricing contributed 4 points to growth led by double-digit pricing in Coffee. Our European Power Brands rose 13%. Here are some highlights: Oreo, up 35%; Tassimo, up 30%; Milka, Belvita and Philadelphia were all up about 20%. 
Growth benefited from the timing of some shipments between the second and third quarters, but even after adjusting for this impact, Power Brand growth was still in the high single digits. Top line growth also reflected benefits from revenue synergies in Chocolate and Biscuits from both the LU and Cadbury acquisitions. This helped fuel nearly 70% growth of our chocobakery platform. And despite significant pricing, market shares were strong across the board.
Now let's turn to profit. Underlying operating income rose 18%, including a positive 11 percentage point impact from currency. The increase in both operating income and margin was driven by vol/mix gains, lower overheads and improved productivity. Margin increased despite the negative impact of a higher revenue base on the calculation of about 1.5 percentage points. 
Even with significant pricing this year, net price realization continues to lag cost inflation. We've announced additional pricing actions in certain categories, and we expect to see these fully implemented in the coming months.
In Developing Markets, we delivered another quarter of very strong growth. The virtuous cycle continues to pay off, and the benefits of integration are beginning to take hold. Organic revenues grew 15.3% with a good balance between pricing and vol/mix. Growth benefited somewhat from the normalization of trade inventory of last year. In addition, at the end of the third quarter, we did observe some customers buying ahead of announced price increases. This may soften growth in the fourth quarter, but we still expect solid double-digit growth for the full year. 
Within the region, Asia Pacific led by India and China and Latin America led by Brazil continued their double-digit growth rates. But CEEMA also grew double digits, reflecting a significant turnaround in a region that's been hard-hit economically. Ukraine continues to stand out, delivering growth of more than 35%, and Russia was up sharply due to gains in Chocolate and Biscuits. Power Brand grew more than 17% led by growth of nearly 50% for Oreo, Tuc and Club Social biscuits. 
Underlying operating income margin increased significantly in the quarter to 15.3%. Underlying operating income grew 45%. This improvement reflected effective management of input costs and vol/mix gains. As with revenue, the year-on-year comparison also benefited from the normalization of trade inventories a year ago. 
We continue to support growth in Developing Markets. We have made significant investments in sales capabilities to leverage opportunities from the combination of Kraft and Cadbury. We're funding these investments from end-to-end cost savings and integration synergies.
Turning to our guidance. We began increase both our top and bottom line guidance for the year. This is due to our strong operating performance and business momentum in each region through the first 9 months. On the top line, we're raising our outlook for organic net revenue growth to at least 6%. That's up from at least 5% previously. And on the bottom line, we've increased our operating EPS guidance to at least $2.27, up from at least $2.25. This reflects several things: strong operating gains year-to-date, our continued increases in investments to accelerate future growth opportunities and cost savings, and the currency benefits we've realized through the first 9 months. 
I should note that given the recent volatility in exchange rates, our operating EPS guidance excludes any potential impact from currency in the fourth quarter. We will, however, flow the currency impact, positive or negative, through to EPS in the fourth quarter. 
Now I'll turn it back to Irene."

Let me update you on the process of preparing for the launch of our 2 new companies. Over the past 3 months, we've made great progress. Since our last presentation at the back-to-school conference in September, we've defined the strategic foundations for each. This work included the detailed brand splits and licensing structures between the 2 companies. The most significant of these was about the Planters brand. 
Specifically, we decided that Planters would fit best within the North American Grocery company. Why? Because Planters is a U.S.-only business. Most of its sales are in supermarkets, and its route to market and supply chain aligns much better with a warehouse network rather than with the direct store delivery systems used for cookies and crackers. Until the separation is completed though, the business will continue to be managed and reported as part of U.S. Snacks.
We've also decided on the name for the North American Grocery company when it launches next year. It will be Kraft Foods. This company will keep the Kraft name because it has very strong consumer recognition and brand equity in the U.S. and Canada. We're still working on the name for the Global Snacks company, which will be put to a shareholder vote in May. 
In addition, the tax filings in the U.S. and Canada are on track with the Canadian filing recently submitted. And we'll file our initial Form-10 during the second quarter next year. 
We're well underway in designing the frameworks for each organization. Transition teams across the company are developing detailed plans to prepare for this stint. Finally, we expect to renounce the leadership for each company by the end of the year.
So to summarize, our momentum remains strong across our businesses and around the world. We've raised our outlook for 2011, and we remain confident that we'll perform in the top tier of our peer group for the full year. We're on track to take the next logical step in our transformation: The creation of 2 highly attractive, independent public companies, each with a clear mandate and each with the ability to deliver attractive returns to shareholders. 
With that, let me open it up for your questions."

But I think most important, our intention would be to price away the input cost inflation the same as we had this year and to drive our brand equity investments through continued overhead and productivity drive focus.

First of all, what I would tell you is, as we contemplated the best way to do the split, we try to get the right balance of understanding the different business characteristics as well as making sure it was simple to execute. And so we chose to keep our International business essentially intact because it's primarily a Snacking business. 85% of the revenue in the International business is in Snacks. And then we kept in primarily coffee and powdered beverages in selected geographies for scale purposes. Brands like Philly are very strong contributors to portfolios like in Europe. I mean, in fact, it was up about 19% in the third quarter as it was elsewhere in the world. So the reality is these are businesses that are a part -- particularly in a given country, they are an important part of the overall portfolio that we take to market in a particular country. It does not significantly impact the overall profile of the snacking company. And in fact, the simplicity of North American Grocery in terms of being concentrated in the U.S. and Canada is part of what allows us to do some things differently than we would be able to do otherwise in terms of systems support, in terms of sales support and a lot of the infrastructure. And that's really the basis for our ability to simplify that business and drive down the cost structure considerably. So it was a consideration, a practical consideration of how best to execute this in a way that would allow the business to continue to perform. But it was also part of the rationale for the North American Grocery business is to make it a much more focused homogeneous business, and in that sense, we felt that this is the right way to execute it."

And in Developing Markets, in particular, I think the reason we made those comments is quarter 3 was so darn good. At 15%, we wouldn’t want people to think we're going to run at that rate going forward. We did have a couple of one-offs that helped us get that number. But Developing Markets is a double-digit growth business, and we would expect to see double-digit growth on the year. And we would expect to be 6% or higher on total KFT on the year. So I think on the revenue, that explains that. In terms of quarter 4 and the margin trends, we have a seasonal business. We sell different things as we go through the year. So traditionally, quarter 4 is a lower quarter in terms of margins. I think last year, in particular, it was lower because we made a decision to invest more for growth in the back half. So both quarter 3 and quarter 4 were a little bit lower than typical. And this year, frankly, I think it's a little more normal pacing of our operating income. So I think last year was a bit of an anomaly. But, yet, most years, you would see quarter 4 a bit lower than the other quarters. It just won't be as dramatic as it happened last year."

That said, we certainly are beginning to see some of the Cadbury synergies play through in a number of markets, primarily on the distribution side. So, for example, in markets like Brazil, we've now got Kraft products that are being sold in twice as many outlets, going from about 300,000 outlets to almost 700,000 outlets. I've talked about the investments that we've made in India that have -- and basically, we're distributing our Oreo product through the chocolate distributors in India. In Mexico, we're combining the 380,000 outlets that Cadbury had together with the outlets that Kraft biscuits were distributed in.
