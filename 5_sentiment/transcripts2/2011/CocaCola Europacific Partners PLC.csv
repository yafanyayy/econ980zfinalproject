Before we begin I would like to remind you all of our cautionary statement.  This call will contain forward-looking management comments and other statements reflecting our outlook for future periods.
These comments should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary language contained in this morning’s earnings release as well as the detailed cautionary statement found in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.  A copy of this information is available on our Web site at www.cokecce.com.  Please also note that today’s results include both (non-GAAP and pro forma) numbers.
Our reported results represent our GAAP consolidated financial statements which include an allocation of corporate expenses from legacy CCE to the first two quarters of 2010 and actual corporate expenses from the fourth quarter as well as contributions of the Norway and Sweden bottling operations from the date we acquired them on October 2, 2010.  Our pro forma results are for informational purposes only and represent what our business may have looked like had the transaction occurred at the beginning of the year.
These non-GAAP pro forma numbers include assumptions believed to be reasonable and should be read in conjunction with the historical financial information contained in CCE’s registration statements on Form S4 declared effective on August 25, 2010.  Now this morning’s prepared remarks will be made by John Brock, our CEO, and Bill Douglas, our CFO. Hubert Patricot, President of our European Group is also with us on this call this morning.
Following prepared remarks we will open the call for your questions.  In order to give as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions, please limit yourself to one question and we will take follow up questions as time permits.  Now I’ll turn the call over to John Brock.

Today’s release concludes a remarkable year for our company, our employees and very importantly, our shareholders.  During 2010 everyone associated with this company had an important role of delivering extraordinary value for each stakeholder while positioning CCE for sustained value building growth.
Thanks to the work of many very dedicated people we concluded our transaction with the Coca-Cola Company and at the same time delivered record earnings.  These are exceptional accomplishments and every member of the new CCE team and the team at Coca-Cola Refreshments should be proud of their work.
Now as you have seen in our release this morning, we finished the year with earnings per share of $1.78 on a comparable and pro forma basis.  This is at the upper end of our prior guidance and includes fourth quarter comparable earnings per share of 28 cents, which was achieved despite difficult December weather conditions and ongoing soft macroeconomic conditions.
Looking at full year results for legacy CCE European territories, revenue growth was 4% and comparative operating income growth was 11-1/2% both on a currency income basis.  These are solid results in line with or exceeding our long-term growth targets.  The strength of these results is demonstrated by the fact that CCE generated about 45% of the total value growth within the nonalcoholic ready to drink category in our legacy territories last year.
Importantly our core Coca-Cola trademark brands were at the very heart of these results growing more than 3% and delivering more than half of our total volume growth for the year.  Improvement in sparkling flavors and energy led by Monster and increases in stills, which were driven primarily by Capri Sun and Ocean Spray, created the remaining growth.  Now let’s take a look at the fourth quarter.
The legacy CCE territories and that’s Belgium, Great Britain, Continental France, Luxembourg, Monaco and the Netherlands, fourth quarter grew 4%.  Volume growth was relative balanced with 3-1/2% growth in Great Britain and 5% growth in the continent.  In all territories Coca-Cola trademark brands including Coca-Cola Zero were a key element of the growth and in fact Coca-Cola Zero was up more than 25% overall including growth of more than 25% in Great Britain.
This is really positive news for Coke Zero in GB.  Continental growth volume was driven by a combination of growth in Coca-Cola trademark brands as well as stills including Capri Sun and Ocean Spray.  These brands have proven highly popular with both customers and consumers and will continue to be a source of growth for us going forward.  Looking at pricing, our consolidated legacy CCE pricing purchase growth was 1% for the quarter.
This reflects additional planned promotional activity during Christmas, which of course is a key selling opportunity in Europe.  Cost of goods increased 2-1/2% principally driven by a combination of the timing of hedges, commodities and profit mix.  It’s important to note that for the third year our pricing covered costs and long term we remain committed to either maintaining or expanding our margins.
Allow me to quickly comment on the performance in Norway and Sweden in the fourth quarter.  Overall performance was in line with expectations but most importantly we know that is progress towards finalizing the integration of these territories into CCE.  Each of these territories carries unique operating characteristics such as a heavier mix of direct store deliver, unique brands and units of returnable packaging in Norway.
We recognize these differences and we believe the CCE way, which is a combination of our operating experience and our approach to the marketplace, will enable us to improve the performance of these territories by seizing opportunities for growth and enhancing operating strategies.  One example here is the recent addition of the Monster brand portfolio in Sweden.  This will complement our existing brands and help build our position in the energy category.
Overall we are encouraged by these results and of the growth and success that we achieved throughout 2010 even as we completed our transaction with the Coca-Cola Company.  In fact and importantly, this was the fifth consecutive year of growth for legacy CCE territories with a compound annual growth rate of 3-1/2% per volume and nearly 9% of operating income since 2006.
This is a solid record of success and our territories have excellent growth history as well as significant growth potential.  We’re confident that our 2011 business plans will build on this foundation, creating value for our customers while also creating long-term value for our shareholders.  As you know, our full year 2011 outlook includes earnings per share growth above our long-term objectives driven by solid operating income growth and the execution of our planned share repurchase program.
Even as we face an increasingly challenging marketplace and evolving customer environment and ongoing soft economic conditions, we have confidence in our ability to deliver our full year outlook.  Our 2011 operating plan is built around three key elements.  First, growing brands and our brand portfolio with a focus on our core trademark brands and high value categories.  Second, continuing to improve customer service while at the same time tightly managing costs and expenses.
And third, helping provide the training and tools for our highly motivated team of employees to win every day in the marketplace.  As we look at our brand efforts, our core Coca-Cola trademark brands, a significant component of our 2011 growth plan, will benefit from a solid marketing calendar filled with promotions for the 125th anniversary of the Coca-Cola brand, next year’s London Olympics as well as Coke (Zero).
We also are expanding large bottle CCE contour packaging in France and we are focusing on the increased activation for our zero-calorie brands, which are Diet Coke, Coke Light and Coke Zero.  Beyond our core sparkling brands we will work to further develop sparkling flavors including Fanta and further develop our presence in the growing energy category with Burn, Monster, Melee and Relentless.
In stills we will build on the solid success we have achieved this year with the expansion of both Capri Sun and Ocean Spray and continue the development of the VitaminWater portfolio throughout Europe.  While focusing on our brands we will also work to drive higher levels of service and ultimately create sustainable growth and category value for our customers.  For example, we look at specific channels to ensure we’re using the most effective means to get our products into stores.
And in some cases this may mean an increase in direct store delivery while in others it may mean an improved group production to a customer warehouse.  As always, our business plans for 2011 are centered on one ultimate goal and that is creating enhanced value for our shareholders through consistent value building growth.  Our share repurchase program is a testament to that commitment and we have completed the purchase of $200 million of our shares in the fourth quarter.
We remain on track to repurchase a total of $1 billion of our shares by the end of the first quarter of 2012.  So in closing, we are confident that we have the initiatives and plans that will drive growth and create value.  A component of this confidence comes from our relationship with the Coca-Cola Company, which shares our passion for building brands, improving service to customers and creating value for our shareholders.
It also comes from the talent and dedication of our employees.  As demonstrated by our five consecutive years of growth, this team led by a skilled, experienced management group, is committed to winning and brings remarkable skill and dedication to the marketplace every day.  Thank you for your continued interest in our company and for your participation today.  Now I’d like to turn it over to Bill.

I’m very pleased to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2010 results.  This has been an incredible year given the completion of our transaction with the Coca-Cola Company and our business delivering outstanding results.
On a reported basis our full year diluted earnings per common share were $1.83 and on a pro forma and comparable basis full year diluted earnings per common share were $1.78.  Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share were 28 cents both on a reported as well as a pro forma and comparable basis.  Pro forma revenue was $7.4 billion and pro forma operating income was $908 million.
As John mentioned, our legacy CCE territories achieved their fifth consecutive year of growth with currency neutral revenues up 4% and comparable and currency neutral operating income increasing 11-1/2%.  As expected, we closed 2010 with total gross debt of approximately 2.3 billion and just over 300 million in cash.  As a result, our net debt was slightly less than 2 billion at year end.
For 2010 reported capital expenditures totaled 291 million.  Now to get a pro forma capital spend we would need to add in and adjust for Norway, Sweden and corporate spending, which would result in a pro forma capital spend of approximately 5% of net revenue.  Clearly the business performed at the higher end of our expectations for the year.  In addition, we moved forward with our program of returning additional cash to shareholders through our share repurchase program, completing purchases of $200 million in the fourth quarter.
We will continue this program in keeping with our goal of a total of $1 billion in repurchases by the end of the first quarter 2012.  Our currently quarterly dividend is 12 cents per common share, a more than 30% increase above legacy CCE’s prior dividend level.  In 2011 we expect to achieve a total annual dividend of 50 cents per share subject to board approval.
Now let’s look at our long-term growth objectives and our guidance for 2011, which we again affirmed in our release this morning.  As we have previously discussed, for the long term we expect revenue growth of 4-6%, operating income growth of 6-8% with high single digit earnings per share growth.  These results will be driven by a balance of volume and pricing growth combined with disciplined operating efficiency and cost containment.
Our guidance for 2011 includes results at or above these long-term levels.  We continue to expect revenue growth in a mid single digit range and comparable operating income should grow in the mid to high single digit range.  We expect comparable and currency neutral diluted earnings per common share of $1.95-2.00 reflecting solid operating growth and the benefits of a reduction in shares outstanding.
What I’d like to note as you plan for the quarterly sequencing of the year, please remember that we will have one selling day less in the first quarter as well as for the full year.  In addition, the Easter holiday will move more fully into the second quarter in 2011.  Now I’d like to add a note on commodities.  On our last call we said we expected our commodity outlook to be in the low single digit range.
Since then we have seen some modest upward pressure in our intangible commodity costs, notably PET.  Despite this rise in commodities, at this time we still continue to expect low single digit increases in our cost of goods sold.  I’d like to point out two factors that are helping us here.  First, as we talked about before, the nature of our cost of goods in Europe is somewhat different than in the US with respect to both the sweetener component and the diversity of our packaging portfolios.
Second, we are hedged on approximately 3/4 of our commodity input costs.  The main item that we have remained unhedged is PET and as you know, that’s a challenging commodity to hedge.  Further, as stated before, we remain focused on maintaining our European margins over the long term and we have a solid track record of doing so in our European business.  We have been in the market with our price increases and we believe we will have the pricing in place in all markets in the first quarter.
Our plan is based on maintaining our margin structure and we feel confident about achieving this result.  For the full year weighted average cost of debt is expected to be approximately 3% including new debt issuances, capital leases as well as the impact of currency swaps.  The effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 26-28%.  We are anticipated free cash flow of approximately $425 million in 2011 with capital expenditures of approximately $400 million.
Let me take just a moment to explain the timing difference between cash tax rates and the effective tax rates that many affect free cash flow over the near term.  Given current plans the company expects a higher cash tax rate will negatively impact free cash flow by approximately $250 million over the next three years, i.e. 2011-2013.  After this a lower cash tax rate will benefit free cash flow by a similar amount in the subsequent years.
Again, this is purely a matter of timing and long term the effective tax rate and the cash tax rate should reach relative equilibrium.  Our free cash flow balance for 2011 includes the impact of these higher cash tax rates but importantly this tax rate will not affect our plans for either capital expenditures or our ongoing share repurchase program.  Overall, we are encouraged by the results for 2010, especially the quality of these results with a balance of volume, price and operating leverage.
We are moving forward from the transaction with a clear focus on meeting our new higher long-term growth targets by taking full advantage of the growth opportunities ahead through established CCE practices and principles.  We have a stronger balance sheet, a flexible capital structure and strong free cash flow and we look forward to using these tools to create even more value for our shareholders.
Again, thanks for joining us today and now John, Hubert and I will be happy to open the all up for your questions.

I was hoping you’d give us an update on the health of the consumer in some of your larger markets.  I guess earlier this week Coke Lenox was rather cautious with respect to trends and saying that consumers are actually weakening in a number of their markets.  I know your markets are somewhat different so I was just curious to hear about trends there, if you’re seeing things firm up a bit, expectations with respect to just consumer trends and purchasing behavior.  Thanks.

I think it’s really important to recognize that over the past 2-1/2 years challenging economic conditions throughout Europe with obviously some variances between markets.  But the fact is we have had some very challenging macroeconomic situations much of which has been driven by lack of consumer confidence.
And in spite of all of that as you hear me say in my opening piece, we have continued to drive our business forward, volume growth, revenue growth, profit growth has been maintained throughout all of those times, ups and downs.  And frankly we think it will be the same thing in 2011 and in the future.  So we do recognize macroeconomic issues.  We do get concerned about what consumer expectations are.  But we also think we have a business which is capable of weathering these kinds of challenges.  So Hubert, do you have any other commentary?

I think intellectually the commodities have moved up within that range so whether it’s towards the higher end of the low single digits, that could be a little bit more specific.  You’re not making any predictions that oil is going to move down significantly from the current prices.
With respect to the first part of your question, clearly when we set a pricing plan in place we look at it on an annualized basis.  So we knew that we were going to have some commodity cost of goods inflation as we moved into the back half of the year and the third quarter in particular.  So that was the vision in our overall plan.  And if you look at the price per case and cost per case margin expansion then imagine that on a full year basis.
More specifically what you saw was as anticipated, some escalation of commodity prices in the fourth quarter particularly around the advent of the results of the oil impact.  I would also say that we had a couple of minor one offs that were included in the fourth quarter that probably added somewhere between half a point or 1% of inflation in that cost number.  And again given our level of headwind for 2011 as well as all of our other commodity inputs, we stand by the low single digit increase on cost of goods for 2011, arguably at the high end of that range as you highlighted.

But it is actually a higher conversion level to use your term than the US business.  The level of capital intensity overall is not as high in Europe as it is in the US.
And again you’ve got to remember the majority of our capital investment in Europe is growth capital because of the good volume growth there whereas in the US there is a significant amount of maintenance capital because of the US fleet and their infrastructure to support that.  I would also caution you on the comparability of the capital number.  Our capital on a pro forma basis in 2010 is approximately 5% of net revenue.
And our capital spend in 2011 again is going to be approximately 5% of net revenue.  So there is not a meaningful step up in our capital spend ratio between ’11 and ’10.  There is as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the step up from the cash tax rate and that is we get a three-year cycle, approximately $250 million in those three years.  Then that will reverse in the following years and that’s ostensibly the result of the large repatriation to support the share repurchase program.
So there is nothing structurally different or concerning about our cap regeneration or conversion and working capital is in a good place and we don’t see that being a meaningful driver going forward either up or down.

As you saw in our news release this morning, we achieved positive financial results in the q",1262,"Thank you, Thor, and we welcome each of you as we discuss our performance in the first quarter of 2011 and then review our outlook for the remainder of this year. As you saw in our news release this morning, we achieved positive financial results in the quarter with excellent revenue and volume growth. While the first quarter is our smallest, we believe this demonstrates solid progress in reaching our operating and financial goals for the year, goals that will meet or exceed our long-term operating and financial targets.
In the first quarter we achieved comparable earnings per share of $0.33, including a slight currency benefit. Revenue increased 7% over pro forma 2010 results to $1.84 billion. Comparable operating income totaled $173 million, up 7.5% versus 2010 pro forma results on a comparable basis. Given these results and our expectations for continued growth for the remainder of the year, we now expect earnings per diluted common share in a range of $2.10 to $2.15. This range includes a full-year currency benefit of about $0.15 at recent rates and is consistent with our prior currency-neutral guidance. Bill will provide more details on this in a moment.
Now let’s look at some of the details of our first quarter operating results. We achieved balanced margins with net pricing per case growth of 1.5% and a cost of sales per case increase of 1.5%. As we have often stated, we remain committed to maintaining or expanding our margins over the long-term, although quarterly variations are possible.
A volume increase of 5% reflects a balance of growth between our sparkling and still brand portfolios. Sparkling brands grew about 4%, driven by a 3% increase in Coca-Cola trademark brands. Coca-Cola Zero grew 25% in the quarter with 6.5% growth in sparkling flavors through strong results from Fanta, Sprite and Dr. Pepper. We also achieved outstanding results in energy drinks, which were up about 35%.
Still brands grew approximately 15% as we continued to refine and expand distribution of both Capri Sun and Ocean Spray and continued to grow our sports drink and water portfolios. Although it is still early, these volume results create an encouraging start to the year, and we continue to believe that we have the right brand plans in place to meet our operating and financial goals. Our programs are built around the 125th anniversary of brand Coca-Cola, summer music promotions, Coke with food, the expansion of the contour bottle in France and initiatives that build on our role in the 2012 London Olympics.
The Olympics continue to generate increasing levels of customer, media and consumer interest with less than 500 days until the start of the games. We have been able to use this event to expand our relationships with customers and to initiate three -year joint business plans. We are working closely with all key entities, including the Coca-Cola Company, local government and Olympic committees to ensure that we make these Olympics an outstanding event for our customers and consumers as we maximize the benefit of the games for our company and our share owners.
Now, let me discuss one additional key factor in our ability to meet our financial goals this year and beyond. And that is improving service to our customers even as we control cost. CCE’s ongoing success depends on our ability to continually improved service through our customers and, in turn, to provide outstanding marketplace execution. We continue to develop new ways to execute at the highest levels and provide enhanced service.
For example, our local segmented outlet execution is tailored store-by-store to match products and displays to customer and consumer needs. We also have the flexibility to adapt routes to market to optimize distribution for both our customers and us.
Our logistics team is an excellent example of this flexibility. Working with select customers, we have reduced lead times substantially on many customer orders, enabling them to lower inventory levels and, in turn, improve their working capital. We introduced these improvements with leading supermarket chains and have begun introducing this new process to other customers.
We constantly strive for this type of improvement and remain dedicated to providing the highest levels of service possible and maximizing customer relationships. This type of planning, effort and dedication represents the CCE way, and it’s encouraging to see continuing progress towards this goal.
As we’ve often discussed, the benefits of our work to build our brands and strengthen relationships with our customers is all centered on one ultimate goal, creating enhanced value for our share owners through consistent value building growth. We’re making continued progress toward that goal through a combination of our results, our ongoing $1 billion share repurchase program and increased dividends.
During the first quarter we completed the purchase of an additional $200 million of our shares. This brings the value of shares purchased under this program to $400 million, and we are on track to repurchase the remaining $600 million in shares by the end of this year or, at the latest, in the first quarter of 2012.
In addition, as you saw in our news release earlier this week, our Board of Directors has accelerated a planned increase in our dividend. The dividend will rise to $0.13 from $0.12 beginning in the second quarter rather than the third quarter, as previously planned.
Another way we are serving our share owners is our plan to obtain a secondary listing on the Euronext Stock Exchange in Paris. This step, which we announced in the first quarter, will complement our primary listing on the New York Stock Exchange and increase awareness about CCE among European investors and key stakeholders. We are very pleased with the initial reaction to this move, and we plan to begin trading in Paris before the end of the second quarter, pending regulatory approvals.
We also continue to integrate corporate responsibility and sustainability, or CRS, into everything we do. As we strive to be the CRS leader in the beverage industry. CRS is a pillar of our operating framework and is embedded in every function of our business. Not only do our customers, consumers and communities expect this of us, but it makes good business sense.
This summer we will launch plant bottle packages in most of our territories. Plant bottle is made from at least 30% plant-based materials, including sugarcane and molasses, which is turned into a key component for PET bottles. The plant bottle packages can also be processed through existing recycling infrastructure.
In closing, let me share some key thoughts. First, we’re building on a consistent track record of solid growth in Europe and have confidence in our ability to deliver another year of excellent results. Second, we have challenging, but achievable objectives for 2011 that meet or exceed our long-term goals. We realize that doing this consistently is essential in creating long-term gains and share owner value. Third, we have outstanding brands, an expanding portfolio and impressive brand and marketing plans that will enable us to seize growth opportunities ahead. These plans are created in conjunction with the Coca-Cola Company, which shares our commitment to our customers, to our brands and to refreshing consumers every day.
Finally, we have a talented, skilled team that understands how to win in the marketplace. They are dedicated and are a tremendous asset for our company. This team is a vital element in reaching our most important goal, driving increasing levels of shareowner value. Thank you for your continued interest in our Company and your participation today. Now, I will turn it over to Bill.

I’d just like to say we appreciate everyone joining us this morning; we realize it’s a busy day for many of you.

I’d just like to say we appreciate everyone joining us this morning; we realize it’s a busy day for many of you. We are pleased to discuss our first quarter results, which represent a solid start to the year. On a reported basis our first quarter diluted earnings per common share were $0.31, and on a comparable basis earnings per share were $0.33. Revenue was $1.84 billion, up 7%. Comparable operating income was $173 million, up 7.5%. Currency translation contributed just under 2% to both revenue and operating income growth for the quarter. Net revenue per case increased 1.5% while cost of sales per case also increased 1.5%. Both of these per case numbers are comparable and currency neutral.
I would like to note that we recorded restructuring charges totaling $14 million during the first quarter to streamline our plant operations and cooler services business. These are initiatives that were well underway in legacy CCE. This quarter’s charge represents a significant majority of the expected full year 2011 one-time expenses for these initiatives, and we do expect to be substantially complete with these restructuring activities by the end of this year.
Now, during the first quarter we also continued to move forward with our share repurchase program, as John mentioned, completing purchases of $200 million. We will continue this program in keeping with our goal of a total repurchase of $1 billion by the end of this year or, at the latest, in the first quarter of 2012.
We now have purchased a total of $400 million under this program. We have also demonstrated our commitment to increasing returns to share owners by accelerating our planned increase in our dividend from the third to the second quarter. This will result in a 2011 payout of $0.51 per share.
Turning to our guidance for 2011, we reaffirmed our underlying currency neutral guidance in our release this morning. This guidance includes results at or above our long-term financial objectives. We continue to expect comparable and currency neutral revenue growth in a mid single-digit range and operating income growth in a mid to high-single-digit range. Diluted earnings per common share are expected in a range of $2.10 to $2.15 and now include a positive currency impact of approximately $0.15 at recent rates. These earnings reflect solid operating growth and the benefit of a reduction in shares outstanding.
Essential to this outlook is our ability to maintain our margin structure. We continue to expect full year 2011 cost of sales per case to increase approximately 3%. We are now hedged on approximately 85% of our input commodity cost. Cost pressures and volatility have continued on commodities that essentially cannot be hedged, and for us this is primarily PET. We continue to benefit from the diversity of our cost of goods and our overall approach to procurement.
We do have our 2011 pricing increases in place and believe we are in a good position to maintain our margin structure for the full year. However, there could be some quarterly variations. Over the long-term, we remain committed to maintain or expand both gross and operating margins, and we have a strong track record of achieving this in our European operations.
Benefiting in part from recent currency rates, we now expect free cash flow will total approximately 475 to $500 million for the year. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million. For the full year, weighted average cost of debt will be approximately 3%, including debt issuances, capital leases as well as the impact of currency swaps. The effective tax rate continues to be expected in a range of 26% to 28%.
Now let me take just a moment to explain a change in our segment reporting that impacted our corporate expense line. Historically, our support functions such as finance and HR had two expense components, those that were reported in the operating business and those that were reported centrally at corporate. The exception to this was information technology. All IT expenses were previously reported as corporate, regardless of where the expenses were incurred.
Beginning in 2011, we will reflect a segment measurement change and report expenses incurred in Europe including IT expenses in the European segment of the business. The net impact is a shift of approximately $12 million in the first quarter from corporate to Europe. Details of this are in the release and will be in our 10-Q and an 8-K that we will file. Please note that this has no impact on the overall bottom line.
So, in summary, we are encouraged by our first quarter results. Even though this is our smallest quarter, the positive trends we have seen will reinforce our confidence in our full-year outlook. Success in the summer selling season remains essential, but we are optimistic about the opportunities and plans we have in place.
So thanks again for joining us. And now John, Hubert and I will be happy to open the floor up for questions.

Hello, Judy, this first quarter was a good combination and the balanced growth between all the BUs and all our brands in our portfolio. And we are pleased to report that despite the difficult economic environment, consumers continue to favor our category and we are outperforming the market both in volume and in value. Our growth was driven mostly by our core business, My Coke.
I will highlight Coke Zero, which was up 25% and up in all our BUs including GB, with a strong growth of 25% also in GB. This is driven by a strong discipline in in-store execution and multiple weeks of displays and increased distribution in away from home channel and increased media support to Coke Zero, too. You mentioned it. We had also a good benefit from the expansion and the traction we are getting with Ocean Spray and Capri Sun in the still and in juice drink category. So again, quite a good balance of growth plus, at the same time, we have put our pricing in place in the market. Talking about GB, we had a very solid Q1 in GB, up 6.5% growth.
And we have outpaced the market both in volume and in value, the NARTD and the stocking markets. So it’s a good performance this quarter.

It’s combining both future consumption, immediate consumption with the placement on coolers and again, the growth is driven mostly by the large players in the market, which captured most of the traffic of the consumer.

But our business model in Europe is really one that’s based on growth, first and foremost. And obviously, that’s what we are planning to achieve. So it’s not a low-growth, grow margins kind of strategy. It’s grown the business and maintain and occasionally expand margins. And as I said earlier, all channels in Europe, which is so important, are profitable. So we, again, can play that game in a very different fashion than is the case in some markets around the world.

As you can see from the news release this morning, we achieved solid revenue and operating income growth in the second quarter, with revenue up 8% and operating income up 6.5%, both on a comparable and currency neutral basis.
Comparable earnings per common say totaled $0.76 for quarter. This growth is encouraging and reflects both the benefit of our operating strategies and the skill and commitment of our employees. These two factors help drive positive quarterly operating results, including 4.5% volume growth and solid pricing growth of 3%. This combination of volume and pricing growth demonstrates excellent overall execution at every level of our business.
Cost of sales per case increased 4.5% during the quarter. While this increase created a 1.5 gap between the pricing per case growth and cost of goods per case growth, our operating income margin was flat compared to prior year.
Our commitment to maintain or expand margins over time remains unchanged. We will accomplish this through operating leverage and by maximizing the value of our brands. While recognizing the shifts in business conditions may create year-over-year fluctuations. Bill will discuss this and our outlook with you in more detail in just a minute.
Now, let’s look for closely at the factors that created our second quarter results. First, and most importantly, we continued to see growing consumer demand for our sparkling brands, including the core Coca-Cola trademark brands, sparkling flavors and energy.
Our core Coca-Cola trademark portfolio grew 4.5% in the quarter, with brand Coca-Cola up over 4% and Coca-Cola Zero up more than 15%. Sparkling flavors, including energy, grew 8% in the quarter. Fanta volume increased 7%. Sprite grew 5.5%, and Dr. Pepper increased more than 15%. We continue to make important end roads in the fast-growing, high margin, energy category, with our energy portfolio up more than 50% in the quarter.
This was achieved through growth of existing brands, including Monster, Nalu, Relentless and Burn, and with the instruction of Powerade Energy in Great Britain. Powerade Energy, which is characterized as the first dual energy beverage, providing fast energy and sustained performance, has excellent potential. It will be a solid addition to our portfolio.
Second, we realized significant benefits from execution and support of Coca-Cola’s 125th anniversary. This exceptionally successful initiative build volume and is fostering consumer loyalty for the Coca-Cola brand. I’m proud of the role our company and its people had in working with the Coca-Cola Company to make this anniversary a solid success throughout our territories. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our system and the ability to work together to build our brands and to create increasing value.
And, third, we realize additional benefit from the combination of a shift of the Easter holiday which fell entirely in the second quarter this year, and favorable weather early in the quarter.
Going forward, we have solid summer promotions already in place, with initiatives tied to music and a variety of summer activities. In addition, we are already working to maximize our sponsorship of the 2012 London Olympics, which continues to generate increasing levels of customer, media and consumer interest.
For example, we are currently determining the participants of the torch relay, engaging both customers and consumers. We also continue to work with our customers to create business plans that generate shared opportunities, and to fully launch our Olympic programs in all countries. In fact, the Olympics are a primary component of our main summer program in Great Britain and customer interest is increasing steadily as we get closer to the games now, only one year away.
We have clear goals for our work with the Olympic, including providing the highest possible levels of service. Most importantly, however, we will maximize the value of this investment, both for our customers and our share owners.
Success against these goals will require the highest levels of execution from our employees and I am confident in their ability to deliver. In fact, we recently received several outstanding customer service awards that recognize the high levels of service we provide. As an example, in Great Britain, we were named ‘Branded Supplier of the Year’ by the Grocer magazine and in Benelux won to sales team award from Sales Check magazine.
The most important takeaway from these awards is that they demonstrate the dedication and the skill of our people. It’s the same type of dedication that enabled our plans and friends to successfully begin production of 1.5 liter contour bottles this quarter, a package initiative that is showing early signs of success in the marketplace.
In many of our territories, we are introducing plant bottled packaging to our core brand Coca-Cola portfolio. Up to 50% of the PET in each plant bottle comes from a combination of plant material and recycled plastic. We will expand production to nearly all of our territories by the end of this year.
We also just published our latest corporate responsibility and sustainability report. This documents our commitment ‘2020’, which includes standards for water and energy conservation, recycling, community involvement, active healthy living, our workplace, and our portfolio. I would encourage you to take a look at this report, as CRS is an increasingly vital element of our company.
Now, let’s take a look at the full year. As I stated earlier, we are encouraged by our growth to date. We have confirmed our full year EPS guidance in a range of $2.10 to $2.15. This includes a $0.15 benefit from currency based on recent rates. Bill will discuss this outlook with you in more detail in a minute.
We also continue to return cash to our shareholders through our ongoing share repurchase program. During the second quarter we repurchased an additional $200 million of our shares and we remain on track to achieve repurchases of $1 billion of our shares by the end of the year or in early 2012. To date, we have repurchased $600 million in our shares since this program began in the fourth quarter of 2010. We expect to provide more details on capital structure and returning cash to share owners later this year.
We completed a meeting of our Board of Directors earlier this week in Stockholm, Sweden. I can assure you that we are intently focused in determining the most effective ways to continue to create increasing value. In addition, we continue to look for ways to better serve our shareholders.
In the second quarter we took a meaningful step through the listing of our shares on the NYSE Euronext in Paris. This additional listing increases our ability to reach European investors. The Euronext listing is a demonstration of our confidence in the ability of our company to create additional growth and enhanced value. Although we continue to face operating obstacle, including a soft macroeconomic environment and competitive marketplace and continued cost pressures, we believe we are well positioned to generate substantial, consistent, long-term growth.
A key element of our confidence comes as a result of this success of our global operating framework, which focuses our company on clear operating objectives. These objectives have helped create a proven record of growth and we will continue to execute against this framework. This focus will allow us to achieve consistent earnings growth in line with our long-term targets and enhance the value of our shareholders’ investment.
Before I close, I want to add a brief comment about the terrible tragedy in Norway. As a company, we’ve reached out in a number of ways to determine how we can best support official volunteer efforts and support our own employees. We believe it is imperative that we do what we can to help the local community in their recovery. Thankfully our employees are safe, and our business and facilities were not impacted, although the emotional impact to our associates in Norway has been substantial. Our thoughts are with the victim’s families and with everyone affected by this tragedy.
Now, I’ll turn the call over to Bill for more detail on our financial results, as well as our full year outlook.

And we appreciate each of you taking the time to be with us this morning to review our second quarter results. Overall, we achieved solid growth in the quarter with volume, revenue and operating income growth in line with expectations. On a reported basis, our second quarter diluted earnings per share rose $0.74 on a comparable basis, earnings per share were $0.76.
We saw a good revenue growth during the quarter as revenue totaled 2.4 billion, up 8% on a currency neutral basis over prior year pro forma results. Comparable operating income was 368 million, up 6.5% on a comparable and currency neutral basis from prior year pro forma results. Net pricing per case increased 3%, while cost of sales per case increased 4.5%. Both of these per case amounts are comparable in currency neutral and are in line with our plan.
Now, let’s look briefly at the increase in our cost of goods sold. As expected we have seen increasing pressure in certain areas, particularly PET. Our second quarter increase in cost of goods sold per case reflects this pressure, as well as the timing of commodity hedges and prior year hurdles. For the full year, we are approximately 9% hedged for our key commodities, and continue to believe that cost of goods sold per case for the full year will be up approximately 3%. This is consistent with the guidance that we previously provided.
Our pricing and customer plans are in place, and we continue to expect margins to be essentially flat for the full year, despite the second quarter gap between our pricing and cost of goods sold per case. Looking ahead, we anticipate significant improvement in the fourth quarter versus the second and third quarters, and I will have more on this in just a moment.
These types of price and cost fluctuations will occur from time to time. However, as John stated, we remain committed to maintaining our expanding gross margins over time, as well as growing our operating income margins, and we have a solid track record of this in our European business.
We also continue to make excellent progress with our share repurchase program in the quarter completing purchases of 200 million. We have now purchased 600 million worth of shares since the fourth quarter of 2010. We will continue this program in keeping with our goal of a total of 1 billion in purchases by the end of the year for early 2012. The success of this program, coupled with the increase in our dividend earlier this year, demonstrates our commitment to increasing the return of cash to our share owners. Given that we will reach the end of the share repurchase program relatively soon, we are evaluating our next steps, and look forward to sharing these with you later in the year.
Turning to our outlook for 2011, we reaffirmed our guidance in our release this morning. This guidance includes results at or above our long-term financial objectives. We continue to expect comparable and currency neutral revenue growth in a mid-single digit range, in operating income growth in a mid to high single digit range.
Diluted earnings per common share are expected in a range of $2.10 to $2.15, and include a positive currency impact of approximately $0.15 at recent rates. These earnings reflect solid operating growth, even as we continue to face cost pressures in a challenging macroeconomic environment. We also continue to believe free cash flow will total approximately 475 to 500 million in 2011, with capital expenditures of approximately $400 million. For the full year, weighted average cost of debt is expected to be approximately 3%, which includes debt issuances, capital leases and the impact of currency swaps. As previously guided effective tax rate for the full year will be in the range of 26 to 28%.
Now, let me add a bit of clarity regarding the sequencing of our results for the remainder of the year, particularly with regard to currency and operating income. First, on currency, year-to-date, we have had a benefit of approximately $0.10 per share compared to prior year. We continue to expect a full year benefit of approximately $0.15 at recent rates.
Looking at operating income, our prior year hurdles for the fourth quarter are lower than that for the third quarter. Coupled with expected fourth quarter margin improvement that we have discussed previously, we will likely see high single digit operating income growth in the third quarter, with accelerated operating income growth in the fourth quarter. Both of these include the expected currency impact.
So to summarize, we achieved solid second quarter results and despite increasing cost pressures, we have again affirmed our full year guidance. We believe we have strong operating plans in place at every level from sales and customer service to operations that will enable us to make 2011 another year of solid growth.

Well, I would say, Steve, if you look at the P&L and specifically the revenue number that you talked about you’ve got a lot of factors in that number and including currency. So if you look at the total quarter overall, I think we feel really good about it, and if you look at the SG&A line, it was up mid-single digits on a currency neutral basis; with volume, year-to-date being up 5% with the half point convention. Going to your question about fixed versus variable, I think the reality is a lot of our SG&A is head count.
So, given our business and the fact that we do have a growing business in Europe with volume growing in the last six years, that would be viewed as semi-fixed from an accountants perspective. We do have a lot of variable expenses and not as much transportation expense as you might think, because remember, in Europe we are circa 10% direct store delivery as compared to the U.S., very, very different there. So again overall, I think those are the comments I would make on the SG&A line.

As I said in my prepared remarks, we are approximately 9% hedged on key commodities for 2011 and we have given the full year guidance cost of goods sold per case up approximately 3%.
As we look out to 2012, we are well under way with our planning process looking at our total plan, including the commodities environment, total cost of goods sold, inflation, as well developing our customer plans and our pricing plans. Clearly, it is still early before we finalize all the pricing plans and all markets, but, if you were to look at the outlook presently, we are continuing to layer on commodity hedges for next year. I will give specific comment on that later in the year. But if you were to take spot rates today, the impact on our total cost of goods environment would probably be slightly more inflationary 0’12 versus 0’11, than the 3% that we talked about for 2011.
Having said that, our brand strength in Europe gives us a high degree of confidence that we will be able to take appropriate pricing in the marketplace and I think from a commodities management and hedging strategy, I feel very confident that we will be competitive in the marketplace as well. So may it be another challenging year? Probably so, but we are very cognizant of that environment and committed to managing our way through it.

We are now doing that with all our major customers in GB and also probably half of our customer on the continent. It doesn’t mean there won’t be price negotiation as part of that, but at least we have a joint strategy to put in place the right action being in supply chain, being with the customer, being with the picture, the shelf space allocation, new product development that will deliver on this value. And this is currently one of the benefits of our Olympics legacy.

What I said in the opening remarks, that operating income for the third quarter was going to be high single-digit with currency. And then you can extrapolate the remaining currency exposure, the 15 versus the 10. That’s not be dramatically different quarter-by-quarter. So if you back all that in, you are looking at a currency-neutral OI growth somewhere in the mid-single-digit range.

So there is a big mistake and the multi portfolio brand strategy for us is a right one. And in fact we are gaining value share in all our markets.

We do the plant tour with our board this week and frankly it was pretty clear that a number of activities in our facility there in Sweden are already taking place. Line utilization is going up significantly as a case in point.
Revenue growth management is an absolute hallmark characteristic of the way we manage our relationship with retailers. As Hubert has said, we view our categories as expandable. And one of the things we do is make sure the retailers know that we are the number one category for them and what we are going to do is work with them to drive the business. But as part of that, our revenue growth management approach is critically important.
And so, we are taking that kind of core competency very much to the table in both Sweden and Norway. Frankly, we had some challenges in Sweden as we put through our pricing strategy with a couple of retailers. And the good news is after a little bit of a hiccup, we were back on shelf and frankly, it was exactly the right thing to do. So that’s the way we’re going to manage the business going forward. So it’s retailer relationships, its supply chain, it’s the way we incentivize, motivate and grade our people; it’s the CCE way of doing everything.

As Thor said, we’re joined by Bill Douglas, our CFO; and Hubert Patricot, President of our European Group",1374,"Thank you, Thor, and thanks to each of you for joining us today, as we discuss our third quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of 2011. As Thor said, we’re joined by Bill Douglas, our CFO; and Hubert Patricot, President of our European Group. 
In our news release this morning, we reported comparable earnings of $0.72 per share as total revenue grew 3% on a currency neutral basis and comparable currency neutral operating income grew 3.5%. These results reflect our ability to work through difficult macroeconomic conditions and the impact of challenging weather early in the quarter. By continuing to focus on key operating strategies of outstanding execution, increasing effectiveness and cost control, we remain on track to deliver another successful year of growth. In fact, despite the challenges of the third quarter, we’ve increased our full-year earnings per share outlook to a range of $2.14 to $2.18. 
Now, let’s take a look at the results for the quarter. Our volume growth of 1% reflects solid executive, offset by the impact of challenging July weather as well as prior year hurdles. We achieved pricing per case growth of 2% with the cost of sales per case increased up 4%. This reflects the cost pressures we’ve faced in our commodities and the lapping of favorable prior year costs. This expected gross margin decrease does not undermine our commitment to maintain or expand margins over time. However, as we’ve discussed, shifts in business conditions such as those we experienced in the third quarter can create margin fluctuations. Bill will have a bit more on this in just a few minutes.
Looking at the key factors in our third quarter results, perhaps the most important aspect of our quarterly results was our ability to execute in the marketplace at a very high level. This is a result of the outstanding work of our employees to maximize our presence across all channels and categories within ARTD share growth in both volume and value. 
Another key element of our strategy remains outstanding customer service, with the goal of being our customer’s most valued supplier. Our success in this area is demonstrated by another recent significant recognition. For the first time, we are now rated the leading consumer goods company in each of our four legacy CCE territories as determined in an industry-wide independent survey of our customers. This survey ranks suppliers on a combination of factors, including category development, customer service and logistics. It’s important to note that this is the first time we’ve been ranked number one in France. Our team there has made exceptional progress and improvement, with a sharp in rankings from number five in 2008 to number two in 2010 and now number one in 2011. While this particular survey has not been used in neither Norway or Sweden, we’re working very hard to be our customer’s most valued supplier in these two territories also and to establish an appropriate and rigorous feedback process.
As we look at the performance of our brand portfolio, we again are encouraged by the results for our core Coca-Cola trademark brands, which grew 2.5% during the quarter. This was led by growth in Coca-Cola Zero, which grew more than 10%. Soft drink flavors including energy were essentially flat. Our energy category was up more than 35%, largely due to solid growth in Monster and the introduce of POWERADE Energy in Great Britain. This was offset by modest declines for sparkling flavors as we lapped strong growth hurdles from the prior year. Overall, sparkling drinks were up 2% for the quarter, while our still portfolio declined about 5%. This decline reflects challenges created by promotional timing, strong comparables to the same quarter a year-ago and soft demand across the still beverage segment, particularly juice drinks in Great Britain.
Going forward, we leave the depth that we’ve added to our still brand portfolio over the past few years remains an important asset and a potential source of significant growth. We’re confident of the strength of our plans in this category for the remainder of 2011 and for next year.
We look forward to highlighting our 2012 plans with you in December, when we will also discuss our work to maximize our sponsorship of the 2012 London Olympics. This work is underway and generating significant customer and consumer interest. In fact, we leveraged our Olympic involvement with targeted customer focus promotions in place with practically every major customer in Great Britain as well as customers in all of our territories. And as an example, so far, we have already activated more than 50,000 Olympic theme displays across Great Britain.
Now, let’s take a look at the full year. As I stated earlier, we’re encouraged by our growth to date and we have raised our full-year EPS guidance to a range of $2.14 to $2.18. This includes a $0.15 benefit from currency based on recent rates. Bill will discuss this outlook with you in more detail in a few minutes, but it reflects the success we had in achieving solid growth in 2011 and in our confidence in our ability to deliver a strong fourth quarter. Our confidence in the fourth quarter is due in part to the excellent marketing plans in place for the holidays. We will have more activation this Christmas than ever with expanded media, additional in-store displays and special packaging, all designed to maximize the benefit of our traditional Coca-Cola Christmas heritage.
Looking longer term, we remain well positioned to deliver sustained growth in line with our long-term objectives. This will allow us to achieve our primary goal, which is creating increasing value for our shareowners. As we announced in conjunction with our meeting with investors and analysts in September, we expect to complete our current $1 billion share repurchase program this year. We repurchased an additional $200 million in our shares during the third quarter. And in addition, we will begin a new $1 billion program in January 2012 with the target of at least $500 million in repurchases next year. These plans may change based on several factors, including financial results or acquisition opportunities, but we want to make clear our commitment to creating increasing value for our shareowners. This is the same commitment that we made just over a year-ago when we closed our transaction with the Coca-Cola Company to create today’s Coca-Cola Enterprises. In the year since, we have worked with a belief that creating value requires a strong consistent focus throughout our organization, coupled with individual employee skill and dedication. I believe that CCE is well positioned in both areas.
First, our operating framework provides clarity on the key elements of our business. And, second, our employees are extremely talented and dedicated and are committed to winning each day. I’ve spent significant time touring our markets most recently in Brussels, visiting production centers and meeting with employees at every level. I continue to be highly impressed by the skill and drive experienced on each visit.
Before closing, I want to share with you some important progress we’ve made toward becoming an increasingly socially responsible company. At the end of September, we launched our new sustainability plan, which is entitled, “Deliver for today / Inspire for tomorrow.” And this establishes a stronger set of targets for our CRS platform. Everyday CRS is more and more engrained in our working culture and we continue to make it a part of absolutely everything we do. This emphasis is creating positive results. 
I’m proud to note that in Newsweek Magazine’s Annual Green Rankings which were recently released, CCE ranks number one in the entire food and beverage industry for the third consecutive year, and importantly higher than any other US consumer goods company. This is an outstanding accomplishment for our people and this is where we want to be as the sustainability leader in our industry. We believe there is a strong business case for our CRS work. We see benefits in several areas including efficiency and innovation, employee engagement and advocacy, customer service, and bolstering our place in our communities.
Thanks for your time and interest. And now, I’ll turn the call over to Bill, for more detail on our financial results and our outlook.

Looking at our news release this morning, we delivered a combination of volume, revenue and operating income growth in line with our expectations for the quarter. Third quarter diluted earnings per commons share were $0.88 or $0.72 on a com",1021,"Thanks John. Looking at our news release this morning, we delivered a combination of volume, revenue and operating income growth in line with our expectations for the quarter. 
Third quarter diluted earnings per commons share were $0.88 or $0.72 on a comparable basis. Revenue grew to a total of $2.1 billion, up 3% over prior year pro forma results on a currency neutral basis. Comparable operating income was $335 million, up 12% on a comparable basis and up 3.5% on a comparable and currency neutral basis.
Net pricing per case increased 2%, while cost of sales per case increased 4%. Both of these per case numbers are comparable and currency neutral, and are in line with our expectations for the third quarter. This increase in cost reflects the ongoing pressure that we’ve seen in certain areas such as PET, as well as comparisons to the more benign cost environment at the third quarter last year when cost were essentially flat. 
Despite the downward gross margin pressure in the quarter, operating income margin increased slightly in part due to continued tight operating expense controls as well as the timing of certain expenses. I want to reiterate John’s message that we remain committed to margin enhancement over the long term. As we have mentioned before, fluctuations will occur as business conditions change, but we believe operating margin enhancement is essential to reaching our long-term financial objectives. 
For the fourth quarter, we continue to expect year-over-year margin improvement and accelerated operating income growth. This improvement is due in part to our prior year hurdles for the fourth quarter being easier than for the third quarter. For the full year, we now believe that cost of goods sold per case will increase between a range of 3% to 3.5%. We have also refined our EPS outlook for the full year, increasing our guidance to a range of $2.14 to $2.18. Several factors contribute to this increase, including the modestly improved outlook for operating income as well as a nominal decrease in our expected effective tax rate.
This guidance includes a full-year currency benefit of approximately $0.15 at recent rates with $0.05 of benefit being recognized during the third quarter. We now expect comparable and currency neutral revenue growth in a mid single-digit range and operating income growth in a high single-digit range. Free cash flow will now be at least $500 million for 2011 with capital expenditures between a range of $375 million to $400 million. For the full year, weighted average cost of debt is expected to be approximately 3%, includes debt issuances, capital leases, as well as the impact of currency swaps. Our effective tax rate is now expected to be in a range of 26% to 27% for the year.
Looking ahead to 2012, it’s still too early for full-year guidance. However, I would like to provide some comments on a couple of key topics. First, looking at the commodity environment, we continue to layer in hedges for 2012 and expect cost of goods sold per case increase of no more than 5%. This increase does not include the impact of the potential excise tax in France. If this were to occur, next year we would likely see a corresponding increase in net revenues and cost of goods related to this topic, which would result in a one-time step down in our margin percents. 
Continuing to discuss the tax situation in France, as macroeconomic trends continue to impact countries around the world, many are studying the implementation of austerity measures and tax increases. In France, there is currently a proposal to significantly increase the excise tax for beverages with added sugar or nonnutritive sweeteners. Clearly we are opposed to these concept discriminatory and regressive taxes. We do not believe that a tax that singles out one category of products is rational or effective. A tax increase of the magnitude proposed would result in a meaningful increase in the retail price of these commonly consumed products and would negatively impact the purchasing power of French consumers. 
As far as CCE is concerned, the current proposal would impact virtually all of our French product portfolio and would result in an additional 8% to 9% price increase just to cover the tax alone. We are working with industry groups to insure the impact of this tax is clearly understood and we are also working with our customers to keep them informed of the dynamic situation and working internally to include appropriate scenarios in our business plans to address this issue. This proposal is one part of an overall package that will continue to be debated in the coming weeks and will be finalized and voted on by December the 22nd and implemented January 1, 2012. We will include an update as appropriate on our December Business Outlook Call with respect to this matter. 
Now, let’s take a look at our progress in the year since new CCE came into being. Just over a year-ago we laid out ambitious long-term growth objectives and we are on track to meet or exceed those objectives this year. This level of performance achieved despite their challenges of the current macroeconomic environment demonstrates our ability to generate the sustained growth needed to create increasing value for our shareowners. Our share repurchase program is a good example of this progress. As John mentioned, we will complete our current $1 billion program by the end of this year and we will commence another $1 billion program in January of 2012, with a goal of no less than $500 million of repurchases during next year. 
So to review the quarter, we continued to achieve solid growth despite challenging weather conditions in July and ongoing macroeconomic pressures. We remain on track to deliver our full-year results that are in line with or above our long-term growth objectives. Going forward, we remain fully committed to these objectives and we look forward to sharing with you our plans for 2012 in our customary December Outlook Call. 
Thanks for joining us. And now, John, Hubert, and I, will be happy to open the line up for questions.

And I think it’s really exceptional to see that year-to-date our category is growing in all of country in value and we don’t see an inflection so far for the consumers. But it’s what we have shared - we have shared with you since the recession started in the fall of 2008. 
We will continue to build our growth, which means that looking forward, we continue to bet and build on our extremely strong marketing calendar looking forward. And, frankly, having the Olympics, having the Euro next year, it’s a very good reason to continue to believe in our growth story and value creation story. And you start also with the last quarter, because we’re going to have the best and strongest ever Christmas plan in all our countries. 
So again the environment remains unique, if anything is maybe even worse than last year same time, but we give ourselves and our retailer all the reasons to continue to grow and believe we can continue to win in our markets.

Then, clearly, we’re going to be focused on SG&A management that will allow us to hopefully get some accretion in our operating income margins. 
Going forward, as we go into 2013, then hopefully we would move to a more normalized commodities environment, where there maybe some opportunity to enhance the gross margins a little bit as well as grow operating income margins. But for ’12, it’s really going to be focused on protecting the gross margins and then getting some accretion in the operating income margin.

And I would say from a coverage perspective, given all the volatility that we've had in the commodities markets over the last three, four months, that's been very helpful to us in addressing the coverage levels for 2012.

As Thor said, we’re joined today by Bill Douglas, our CFO; and Hubert Patricot, President of our European Group. 
In our news release this morning, we reported comparable earnings of $0.72 per share as total revenue grew 3% on a currency neutral basis, and comparable currency neutral operating income grew 3.5%. These results reflect our ability to work through difficult macroeconomic conditions and the impact of challenging weather early in the quarter. By continuing to focus on key operating strategies of outstanding execution, increasing effectiveness and cost control, we remain on track to deliver another successful year of growth. In fact, despite the challenges of the third quarter, we’ve increased our full year earnings per share outlook to a range of $2.14 to $2.18. 
Now, let’s take a look at the results for the quarter. Our volume growth of 1% reflects solid execution, offset by the impact of challenging July weather as well as prior year hurdles. We achieved pricing per case growth of 2% with the cost of sales per case increased up 4%. This reflects the cost pressures we’ve faced in our commodities and the lapping of favorable prior year costs. This expected gross margin decrease does not undermine our commitment to maintain or expand margins over time. However, as we’ve discussed, shifts in business conditions, such as those we experienced in the third quarter can create margin fluctuations. Bill will have a bit more on this in just a few minutes.
Looking at the key factors in our third quarter results, perhaps the most important aspect of our quarterly results was our ability to execute in the marketplace at a very high level. This is a result of the outstanding work of our employees to maximize our presence across all channels and categories within NARTD share growth in both volume and value. 
Another key element of our strategy remains outstanding customer service, with the goal of being our customer’s most valued supplier. Our success in this area is demonstrated by another recent significant recognition. For the first time, we are now rated the leading consumer goods company in each of our 4 legacy CCE territories as determined in an industry-wide independent survey of our customers. This survey ranks suppliers on a combination of factors, including category development, customer service and logistics. 
It’s important to note that this is the first time we’ve been ranked #1 in France. Our team there has made exceptional progress and improvement, with a sharp rise in rankings from #5 in 2008 to #2 in 2010 and now #1 in 2011. While this particular survey has not been used in neither Norway or Sweden, we’re working very hard to be our customer’s most valued supplier in these 2 territories also and to establish an appropriate and rigorous feedback process.
As we look at the performance of our brand portfolio, we again are encouraged by the results for our core Coca-Cola trademark brands, which grew 2.5% during the quarter. This was led by growth in Coca-Cola Zero, which grew more than 10%. Soft drink flavors, including energy were essentially flat. Our energy category was up more than 35%, largely due to solid growth in Monster and the introduction of Powerade Energy in Great Britain. This was offset by modest declines for sparkling flavors as we lapped strong growth hurdles from the prior year. 
Overall, sparkling drinks were up 2% for the quarter, while our still portfolio declined about 5%. This decline reflects challenges created by promotional timing, strong comparables to the same quarter a year ago and soft demand across the still beverage segment, particularly juice drinks in Great Britain.
Going forward, we leave the depth that we’ve added to our still brand portfolio over the past few years remains an important asset and a potential source of significant growth. We’re confident of the strength of our plans in this category for the remainder of 2011 and for next year.
We look forward to highlighting our 2012 plans with you in December, when we will also discuss our work to maximize our sponsorship of the 2012 London Olympics. This work is underway and generating significant customer and consumer interest. In fact, we leveraged our Olympic involvement with targeted customer-focus promotions in place with practically every major customer in Great Britain as well as customers in all of our territories. And as an example, so far, we have already activated more than 50,000 Olympic-theme displays across Great Britain.
Now, let’s take a look at the full year. As I stated earlier, we’re encouraged by our growth to date and we have raised our full year EPS guidance to a range of $2.14 to $2.18. This includes a $0.15 benefit from currency based on recent rates. Bill will discuss this outlook with you in more detail in a few minutes, but it reflects the success we've had in achieving solid growth in 2011 and in our confidence and our ability to deliver a strong fourth quarter. 
Our confidence in the fourth quarter is due in part to the excellent marketing plans in place for the holidays. We will have more activation this Christmas than ever with expanded media, additional in-store displays and special packaging, all designed to maximize the benefit of our traditional Coca-Cola Christmas heritage.
Looking longer term, we remain well positioned to deliver sustained growth in line with our long-term objectives. This will allow us to achieve our primary goal, which is creating increasing value for our shareowners. 
As we announced in conjunction with our meeting with investors and analysts in September, we expect to complete our current $1 billion share repurchase program this year. We repurchased an additional $200 million in our shares during the third quarter. And in addition, we will begin a new $1 billion program in January 2012 with the target of at least $500 million in repurchases next year. These plans may change based on several factors, including financial results or acquisition opportunities. But we want to make clear our commitment to creating increasing value for our shareowners. 
This is the same commitment that we made just over a year ago when we closed our transaction with the Coca-Cola Company to create today’s Coca-Cola Enterprises. In the year since, we've worked with the belief that creating value requires a strong, consistent focus throughout our organization, coupled with individual employee skill and dedication. I believe that CCE is well positioned in both areas.
First, our operating framework provides clarity on the key elements of our business. And, second, our employees are extremely talented and dedicated and are committed to winning each day. I’ve spent significant time touring our markets most recently in Brussels, visiting production centers and meeting with employees at every level. I continue to be highly impressed by the skill and drive experienced on each visit.
Before closing, I want to share with you some important progress we have made toward becoming an increasingly socially responsible company. At the end of September, we launched our new sustainability plan, which is entitled, “Deliver for today, inspire for tomorrow.” And this establishes a stronger set of targets for our CRS platform. 
Everyday, CRS is more and more engrained in our working culture, and we continue to make it a part of absolutely everything we do. This emphasis is creating positive results. 
I’m proud to note that in Newsweek magazine’s Annual Green Rankings, which were recently released, CCE ranks #1 in the entire food and beverage industry for the third consecutive year, and importantly higher than any other US consumer goods company. This is an outstanding accomplishment for our people and this is where we want to be as the sustainability leader in our industry. 
We believe there's a strong business case for our CRS work. We see benefits in several areas, including efficiency and innovation, employee engagement and efficacy, customer service and bolstering our place in our communities.
Thanks for your time and interest. And now, I’ll turn the call over to Bill for more detail on our financial results and our outlook."

Looking at our news release this morning, we delivered a combination of volume, revenue and operating income growth in line with our expectations for the quarter. Third quarter diluted earnings per commons share were $0.88 or $0.72 on a co",1026,"Thanks, John. Looking at our news release this morning, we delivered a combination of volume, revenue and operating income growth in line with our expectations for the quarter. 
Third quarter diluted earnings per commons share were $0.88 or $0.72 on a comparable basis. Revenue grew to a total of $2.1 billion, up 3% over prior year pro forma results on a currency neutral basis. Comparable operating income was $335 million, up 12% on a comparable basis and up 3.5% on a comparable and currency neutral basis.
Net pricing per case increased 2%, while cost of sales per case increased 4%. Both of these per case numbers are comparable and currency neutral and are in line with our expectations for the third quarter. This increase in cost reflects the ongoing pressure that we’ve seen in certain areas, such as PET, as well as comparisons to the more benign cost environment at the third quarter last year when costs were essentially flat. 
Despite the downward gross margin pressure in the quarter, operating income margin increased slightly in part due to continued tight operating expense controls as well as the timing of certain expenses. I want to reiterate John’s message that we remain committed to margin enhancement over the long term. 
As we have mentioned before, fluctuations will occur as business conditions change, but we believe operating margin enhancement is essential to reaching our long-term financial objectives. 
For the fourth quarter, we continue to expect year-over-year margin improvement and accelerated operating income growth. This improvement is due in part to our prior year hurdles for the fourth quarter being easier than for the third quarter. For the full year, we now believe that cost of goods sold per case will increase between a range of 3% to 3.5%. 
We have also refined our EPS outlook for the full year, increasing our guidance to a range of $2.14 to $2.18. Several factors contribute to this increase, including the modestly improved outlook for operating income as well as a nominal decrease in our expected effective tax rate.
This guidance includes a full year currency benefit of approximately $0.15 at recent rates, with $0.05 of benefit being recognized during the third quarter. We now expect comparable and currency neutral revenue growth in a mid single-digit range and operating income growth in a high single-digit range. 
Free cash flow will now be at least $500 million for 2011 with capital expenditures between a range of $375 million to $400 million. For the full year, weighted average cost of debt is expected to be approximately 3%, which includes debt issuances, capital leases, as well as the impact of currency swaps. Our effective tax rate is now expected to be in a range of 26% to 27% for the year.
Looking ahead to 2012, it’s still too early for full year guidance. However, I would like to provide some comments on a couple of key topics. First, looking at the commodity environment, we continue to lay in -- layer in hedges for 2012 and expect cost of goods sold per case increase of no more than 5%. This increase does not include the impact of the potential excise tax in France. If this were to occur, next year, we would likely see a corresponding increase in net revenues and cost of goods related to this topic, which would result in a onetime step-down in our margin percents. 
Continuing to discuss the tax situation in France, as macroeconomic trends continue to impact countries around the world, many are studying the implementation of austerity measures and tax increases. In France, there's currently a proposal to significantly increase the excise tax for beverages with added sugar or nonnutritive sweeteners. Clearly, we are opposed to these concept of discriminatory and regressive taxes. We do not believe that a tax that singles out one category of products is rational or effective. A tax increase of the magnitude proposed would result in a meaningful increase in the retail price of these commonly consumed products and would negatively impact the purchasing power of French consumers. 
As far as CCE is concerned, the current proposal would impact virtually all of our French product portfolio and would result in an additional 8% to 9% price increase just to cover the tax alone. We are working with industry groups to ensure the impact of this tax is clearly understood, and we're also working with our customers to keep them informed of the dynamic situation and working internally to include appropriate scenarios in our business plans to address this issue. This proposal is one part of an overall package that will continue to be debated in the coming weeks and will be finalized and voted on by December the 22nd and implemented January 1, 2012. We will include an update as appropriate on our December business outlook call with respect to this matter. 
Now, let’s take a look at our progress in the year since new CCE came into being. Just over a year ago, we laid out ambitious long-term growth objectives and we are on track to meet or exceed those objectives this year. This level of performance achieved despite the challenges of the current macroeconomic environment demonstrates our ability to generate the sustained growth needed to create increasing value for our shareowners. 
Our share repurchase program is a good example of this progress. As John mentioned, we will complete our current $1 billion program by the end of this year, and we will commence another $1 billion program in January of 2012, with a goal of no less than $500 million of repurchases during next year. 
So to review the quarter, we continued to achieve solid growth despite challenging weather conditions in July and ongoing macroeconomic pressures. We remain on track to deliver full year results that are in line with or above our long-term growth objectives.

We’ve been very successful in the United States in defeating most of these tax proposals. And I think one of the reasons is we’ve had a very industry-wide approach, which has been very consistent and very clear in communicating to various governmental authorities around in Washington as well as in state and local governments, the inappropriateness of regressive and unfair taxes focusing on one particular item that it's not particularly a logical or effective way of raising revenues. And the good news is most of them have gotten that in the course of time. I think the situation in France is one where we continue the need to work together with the Coca-Cola Company and with the industry to do everything we possibly can to help them understand, help the officials understand that again it is unjust. It’s unfair, and it’s not the best way to proceed, and we’re going to work hard at doing that. Again, I don’t think there are any huge differences other than the fact that maybe we had a - we have a series of trade associations in the US, which were particularly effective. What you can assume is we’re working hard to make sure that our trade associations in Europe are going to be similarly effective going forward, and that we have success in winning most, if not all, of these battles."

As Thor said, we’re joined today by Bill Douglas, our CFO; and Hubert Patricot, President of our European",1372,"Thank you, Thor, and thanks to each of you for joining us today, as we discuss our third quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of 2011. As Thor said, we’re joined today by Bill Douglas, our CFO; and Hubert Patricot, President of our European Group. 
In our news release this morning, we reported comparable earnings of $0.72 per share as total revenue grew 3% on a currency neutral basis, and comparable currency neutral operating income grew 3.5%. These results reflect our ability to work through difficult macroeconomic conditions and the impact of challenging weather early in the quarter. By continuing to focus on key operating strategies of outstanding execution, increasing effectiveness and cost control, we remain on track to deliver another successful year of growth. In fact, despite the challenges of the third quarter, we’ve increased our full year earnings per share outlook to a range of $2.14 to $2.18. 
Now, let’s take a look at the results for the quarter. Our volume growth of 1% reflects solid execution, offset by the impact of challenging July weather as well as prior year hurdles. We achieved pricing per case growth of 2% with the cost of sales per case increased up 4%. This reflects the cost pressures we’ve faced in our commodities and the lapping of favorable prior year costs. This expected gross margin decrease does not undermine our commitment to maintain or expand margins over time. However, as we’ve discussed, shifts in business conditions, such as those we experienced in the third quarter can create margin fluctuations. Bill will have a bit more on this in just a few minutes.
Looking at the key factors in our third quarter results, perhaps the most important aspect of our quarterly results was our ability to execute in the marketplace at a very high level. This is a result of the outstanding work of our employees to maximize our presence across all channels and categories within NARTD share growth in both volume and value. 
Another key element of our strategy remains outstanding customer service, with the goal of being our customer’s most valued supplier. Our success in this area is demonstrated by another recent significant recognition. For the first time, we are now rated the leading consumer goods company in each of our 4 legacy CCE territories as determined in an industry-wide independent survey of our customers. This survey ranks suppliers on a combination of factors, including category development, customer service and logistics. 
It’s important to note that this is the first time we’ve been ranked #1 in France. Our team there has made exceptional progress and improvement, with a sharp rise in rankings from #5 in 2008 to #2 in 2010 and now #1 in 2011. While this particular survey has not been used in neither Norway or Sweden, we’re working very hard to be our customer’s most valued supplier in these 2 territories also and to establish an appropriate and rigorous feedback process.
As we look at the performance of our brand portfolio, we again are encouraged by the results for our core Coca-Cola trademark brands, which grew 2.5% during the quarter. This was led by growth in Coca-Cola Zero, which grew more than 10%. Soft drink flavors, including energy were essentially flat. Our energy category was up more than 35%, largely due to solid growth in Monster and the introduction of Powerade Energy in Great Britain. This was offset by modest declines for sparkling flavors as we lapped strong growth hurdles from the prior year. 
Overall, sparkling drinks were up 2% for the quarter, while our still portfolio declined about 5%. This decline reflects challenges created by promotional timing, strong comparables to the same quarter a year ago and soft demand across the still beverage segment, particularly juice drinks in Great Britain.
Going forward, we leave the depth that we’ve added to our still brand portfolio over the past few years remains an important asset and a potential source of significant growth. We’re confident of the strength of our plans in this category for the remainder of 2011 and for next year.
We look forward to highlighting our 2012 plans with you in December, when we will also discuss our work to maximize our sponsorship of the 2012 London Olympics. This work is underway and generating significant customer and consumer interest. In fact, we leveraged our Olympic involvement with targeted customer-focus promotions in place with practically every major customer in Great Britain as well as customers in all of our territories. And as an example, so far, we have already activated more than 50,000 Olympic-theme displays across Great Britain.
Now, let’s take a look at the full year. As I stated earlier, we’re encouraged by our growth to date and we have raised our full year EPS guidance to a range of $2.14 to $2.18. This includes a $0.15 benefit from currency based on recent rates. Bill will discuss this outlook with you in more detail in a few minutes, but it reflects the success we've had in achieving solid growth in 2011 and in our confidence and our ability to deliver a strong fourth quarter. 
Our confidence in the fourth quarter is due in part to the excellent marketing plans in place for the holidays. We will have more activation this Christmas than ever with expanded media, additional in-store displays and special packaging, all designed to maximize the benefit of our traditional Coca-Cola Christmas heritage.
Looking longer term, we remain well positioned to deliver sustained growth in line with our long-term objectives. This will allow us to achieve our primary goal, which is creating increasing value for our shareowners. 
As we announced in conjunction with our meeting with investors and analysts in September, we expect to complete our current $1 billion share repurchase program this year. We repurchased an additional $200 million in our shares during the third quarter. And in addition, we will begin a new $1 billion program in January 2012 with the target of at least $500 million in repurchases next year. These plans may change based on several factors, including financial results or acquisition opportunities. But we want to make clear our commitment to creating increasing value for our shareowners. 
This is the same commitment that we made just over a year ago when we closed our transaction with the Coca-Cola Company to create today’s Coca-Cola Enterprises. In the year since, we've worked with the belief that creating value requires a strong, consistent focus throughout our organization, coupled with individual employee skill and dedication. I believe that CCE is well positioned in both areas.
First, our operating framework provides clarity on the key elements of our business. And, second, our employees are extremely talented and dedicated and are committed to winning each day. I’ve spent significant time touring our markets most recently in Brussels, visiting production centers and meeting with employees at every level. I continue to be highly impressed by the skill and drive experienced on each visit.
Before closing, I want to share with you some important progress we have made toward becoming an increasingly socially responsible company. At the end of September, we launched our new sustainability plan, which is entitled, “Deliver for today, inspire for tomorrow.” And this establishes a stronger set of targets for our CRS platform. 
Every day, CRS is more and more engrained in our working culture, and we continue to make it a part of absolutely everything we do. This emphasis is creating positive results. 
I’m proud to note that in Newsweek magazine’s Annual Green Rankings, which were recently released, CCE ranks #1 in the entire food and beverage industry for the third consecutive year, and importantly higher than any other US consumer goods company. This is an outstanding accomplishment for our people and this is where we want to be as the sustainability leader in our industry. 
We believe there's a strong business case for our CRS work. We see benefits in several areas, including efficiency and innovation, employee engagement and efficacy, customer service and bolstering our place in our communities.
Thanks for your time and interest. And now, I’ll turn the call over to Bill for more detail on our financial results and our outlook."
109130811,141103551,279433,"Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2011",2011-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Coca-Cola Europacific Partners PLC","Executives","Thanks, John. Looking at our news release this morning, we delivered a combination of volume, revenue and operating income growth in line with our expectations for the quarter. Third quarter diluted earnings per commons share were $0.88 or $0.72 on a co",1026,"Thanks, John. Looking at our news release this morning, we delivered a combination of volume, revenue and operating income growth in line with our expectations for the quarter. 
Third quarter diluted earnings per commons share were $0.88 or $0.72 on a comparable basis. Revenue grew to a total of $2.1 billion, up 3% over prior year pro forma results on a currency neutral basis. Comparable operating income was $335 million, up 12% on a comparable basis and up 3.5% on a comparable and currency neutral basis.
Net pricing per case increased 2%, while cost of sales per case increased 4%. Both of these per case numbers are comparable and currency neutral and are in line with our expectations for the third quarter. This increase in cost reflects the ongoing pressure that we’ve seen in certain areas, such as PET, as well as comparisons to the more benign cost environment at the third quarter last year when costs were essentially flat. 
Despite the downward gross margin pressure in the quarter, operating income margin increased slightly in part due to continued tight operating expense controls as well as the timing of certain expenses. I want to reiterate John’s message that we remain committed to margin enhancement over the long term. 
As we have mentioned before, fluctuations will occur as business conditions change, but we believe operating margin enhancement is essential to reaching our long-term financial objectives. 
For the fourth quarter, we continue to expect year-over-year margin improvement and accelerated operating income growth. This improvement is due in part to our prior year hurdles for the fourth quarter being easier than for the third quarter. For the full year, we now believe that cost of goods sold per case will increase between a range of 3% to 3.5%. 
We have also refined our EPS outlook for the full year, increasing our guidance to a range of $2.14 to $2.18. Several factors contribute to this increase, including the modestly improved outlook for operating income as well as a nominal decrease in our expected effective tax rate.
This guidance includes a full year currency benefit of approximately $0.15 at recent rates, with $0.05 of benefit being recognized during the third quarter. We now expect comparable and currency neutral revenue growth in a mid single-digit range and operating income growth in a high single-digit range. 
Free cash flow will now be at least $500 million for 2011 with capital expenditures between a range of $375 million to $400 million. For the full year, weighted average cost of debt is expected to be approximately 3%, which includes debt issuances, capital leases, as well as the impact of currency swaps. Our effective tax rate is now expected to be in a range of 26% to 27% for the year.
Looking ahead to 2012, it’s still too early for full year guidance. However, I would like to provide some comments on a couple of key topics. First, looking at the commodity environment, we continue to lay in -- layer in hedges for 2012 and expect cost of goods sold per case increase of no more than 5%. This increase does not include the impact of the potential excise tax in France. If this were to occur, next year, we would likely see a corresponding increase in net revenues and cost of goods related to this topic, which would result in a onetime step-down in our margin percents. 
Continuing to discuss the tax situation in France, as macroeconomic trends continue to impact countries around the world, many are studying the implementation of austerity measures and tax increases. In France, there's currently a proposal to significantly increase the excise tax for beverages with added sugar or nonnutritive sweeteners. Clearly, we are opposed to these concept of discriminatory and regressive taxes. We do not believe that a tax that singles out one category of products is rational or effective. A tax increase of the magnitude proposed would result in a meaningful increase in the retail price of these commonly consumed products and would negatively impact the purchasing power of French consumers. 
As far as CCE is concerned, the current proposal would impact virtually all of our French product portfolio and would result in an additional 8% to 9% price increase just to cover the tax alone. We are working with industry groups to ensure the impact of this tax is clearly understood, and we're also working with our customers to keep them informed of the dynamic situation and working internally to include appropriate scenarios in our business plans to address this issue. This proposal is one part of an overall package that will continue to be debated in the coming weeks and will be finalized and voted on by December the 22nd and implemented January 1, 2012. We will include an update as appropriate on our December business outlook call with respect to this matter. 
Now, let’s take a look at our progress in the year since new CCE came into being. Just over a year ago, we laid out ambitious long-term growth objectives and we are on track to meet or exceed those objectives this year. This level of performance achieved despite the challenges of the current macroeconomic environment demonstrates our ability to generate the sustained growth needed to create increasing value for our shareowners. 
Our share repurchase program is a good example of this progress. As John mentioned, we will complete our current $1 billion program by the end of this year, and we will commence another $1 billion program in January of 2012, with a goal of no less than $500 million of repurchases during next year. 
So to review the quarter, we continued to achieve solid growth despite challenging weather conditions in July and ongoing macroeconomic pressures. We remain on track to deliver full year results that are in line with or above our long-term growth objectives. 
Going forward, we remain fully committed to these objectives, and we look forward to sharing with you our plans for 2012 in our customary December outlook call. 
Thanks for joining us. And now, John, Hubert, and I, will be happy to open the line up for questions."

I think the situation in France is one where we continue the need to work together with the Coca-Cola Company and with the industry to do everything we possibly can to help them understand, help the officials understand that again it is unjust.
