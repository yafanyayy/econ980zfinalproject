Today, we recorded earnings results that are marked by a number of historical records as we continue to execute and further advance JDSU's financial model. A good baseline for our financial results is our fiscal year 2006 when we further diversified our portfolio and became a player in the CommTest industry. Since that time, our financial results have never been stronger. 
In fiscal Q2, we reported record revenues of $477.2 million, record gross margin of 48.8% and record operating margin of 15.3%. Our book-to-bill was greater than one and our market outlook remains positive. These results reflect the strong market demand for our products as carriers continue to invest to meet the need for greater bandwidth worldwide. We're all familiar with the drivers by the bandwidth demand. Video and mobility. 
With the proliferation of tablets and smart phones, as well as Internet TV and HDTV, the outlook is robust. An industry leader reports that video will be over 90% of global consumer traffic by 2014. Infonetics forecast that the compounded annual growth rate of mobile broadband subscribers will be greater than 38% over five years to $1.8 billion by 2014 with the steepest projected growth coming from emerging markets. 
Through collaborative innovation, we are addressing our customers' requirements for network expansion and bandwidth growth, at the same time, meeting our needs to reduce costs and maintain quality of service. In doing so, we are securing leadership positions in fast-growing markets for products such as ROADMs, tunables, fiber-optic tests and LTE test. We're also using our technology to participate in non-telco markets such as Commercial Lasers, currency pigments, brand protection, gesture recognition, solar and 3D Cinema. This is an exciting time for JDSU. 
Market drivers are strong, our innovation engine pipeline for new products is robust and we continue to make progress in increasing our operating leverage. We're achieving our financial goals and progressing towards setting higher targets. 
Now let me hand the call over to Dave, who will take you through the details of our financial performance in Q2 and will discuss our outlook for Q3 comps"

Please note that all numbers are non-GAAP unless I state otherwise.

Please note that all numbers are non-GAAP unless I state otherwise. 
Second quarter revenue of $477.2 million was up 16% in the prior quarter and up 38.8% when compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2010. Revenue exceeded our previously stated guidance. CommTest budget flush is greater than expected at approximately $20 million. Optical revenues were stronger than our stated range as production increased more rapidly than forecast. 
Book-to-bill for the company was above one for the seventh straight quarter. Second quarter gross margin was 48.8% of revenue, up from the previous quarter's gross margin of 47.4% and up from second quarter of fiscal 2010 gross margin of 44.6%.  The second quarter gross margin sequential improvement is primarily due to higher CommTest revenue as a percentage of total revenue. 
Operating expenses for the second fiscal quarter of $159.8 million or 33.5% of revenue, a decline from the prior quarter's 36.6% of revenue and the lowest level as a percentage of revenue in the last five years. The increase in expenses from last quarter was within our stated range and primarily for variable selling costs, variable pay and R&D investment. 
For the fiscal second quarter operating margin for the company grew to a record 15.3%. Net income was $67 million or $0.29 per share, which compares to $44.8 million or $0.20 per share for the first fiscal quarter. The increase in operating income and net income was driven by higher gross profit and operating expense leverage. A detailed reconciliation of our non-GAAP results to our GAAP results is available in today's press release. 
Our second quarter non-GAAP operating results, exclude, among other items, amortization of acquired technology and other intangibles, up $22.1 million, a $10 million charge for stock-based compensation, an acquisition accounting adjustment to revenue of $3.7 million and restructuring and nonrecurring charges totaling $3.7 million. Including the noted items, the second quarter fiscal 2011 GAAP net income was $23.6 million or $0.10 per share, which compares to a prior year second quarter GAAP net loss of $19.5 million or a loss of $0.09 per share. 
Now looking at quarterly revenue by region. Americas revenue of $203.9 million or 51% of total revenue was up $37.4 million from the prior quarter, driven primarily by increased CommTest revenue from North American service providers, which included the year end budget flush and also, higher optical component demand from Network Equipment manufacturers. 
EMEA revenue of $121.5 million or 26% of total revenue was up $17.3 million compared to the prior quarter, due primarily to strength in our CommTest business. Asia-Pacific revenue was $111.8 million or 23% of total revenue, up $11.2 million from the prior quarter due to higher demand for Optical and CommTest products. 
Moving to the segments. In the CCOP segment, the breakout of the key metrics for Optical Communications and Lasers is as follows: Optical Communications revenue in fiscal Q2 was $168.4 million, up 17.8% when compared to the prior quarter's revenue and up 76.2% when compared to the prior year. We saw particular strength in ROADMs, circuit backs and Tunable XFPs. All of the geographic regions grew sequentially. 
Quarterly ASP decline was up below the midpoint of our historical quarterly range of 2% to 4%. Gross margin for the quarter was 32.9%, an increase of more than three percentage points from the prior quarter's gross margin of 29.5%. The sequential improvement was driven by product mix, better factory utilization and cost reduction activities. Despite increased production throughput, lead times stayed relatively flat from the prior quarter than most product lines. At the same time, with our increased capacity, we are able to implement BMI for one major customer for our Super Transport Blades. Even with the implementation of BMI, our book-to-bill is approximately one. 
For Optical Communications, our gross margin target continues to be 30% to 35%. In our Lasers business, second quarter revenue of $22.7 million was down 9.2% when compared to the prior quarter and up 35.9% when compared to the prior year. Revenues return to previous levels after coming off a particularly strong Q1 where we saw our customers replenish their inventories. 
Gross margins were 45.5%, unchanged from the prior quarter. Book-to-bill was greater than one. Total CCOP revenue was $191.1 million, up 13.8% from the prior quarter due to the strength in our Optical business. Gross margin was 34.4% and operating income was $34 million or 17.8% of revenue. Profitability in this segment continues to improve due to higher revenue levels and improved product mix and factory utilization. 
Given current revenue levels, our new target operating model for the CCOP segment is for operating margins of 16% to 20% when revenues are about $190 million. 
Now moving on to our CommTest segment. Second quarter revenue of $231.4 million was up 26.6% from the previous quarter and up 30.8% from the prior fiscal year. The sequential revenue increase was due to strength in fiber optics and broadband test, service insurance and seasonal budget flush of approximately $20 million. All geographies grew sequentially. Book-to-bill was approximately one. 
Fiscal Q2 gross margin for CommTest of 50.9% was at the high end of our targeted range of 57% to 61% and up slightly from the prior quarter. The gross margin improvement was driven by favorable product mix, which included higher revenues from the NSD business. 
CommTest operating profit was $44.8 million or 19.4% of revenue, which compares to 11.9% in the prior quarter and above our guided range. CommTest revenues tend to be seasonal with the June and December quarter end typically the strongest, and the March and September quarter ends being lower. As previously noted, our targeted CommTest operating market model is for operating margins of 20% to 23% when revenues are greater than $215 million. We are continuing to review the profitability of our product portfolio in CommTest. This review has resulted in improved gross margins and operating margin over the last two quarters. We will continue to focus on improving operating margins of CommTest while providing innovative products to our customers. 
With the Advanced Optical Technologies or AOT segment, fiscal Q2 revenue was $54.7 million, down 9.6% when compared to the prior quarter due to cyclical demand in the currency market. As previously noted, currency products will see demand fluctuate according to the level of bank note printing needs. The decline in currency revenues was partially offset by growth in our gesture Recognition business and our rebound in transaction card holograms. 
Book-to-bill was greater than one. Fiscal Q2 gross margin for our AOT business was 48%, down from 50.4% in the prior quarter due to product mix and lower revenue levels. Also annual customer contract negotiations have resulted in ASP pressure. 
AOT operating profit for the quarter was $17.7 million or 32.4% of revenue, down $4.4 million from the prior quarter due to lower revenue. Given the recent contract negotiations and increased investment in the AOT segment, the targeted operating margin range for the AOT segment is 32% to 35%. Today, we are revising up our total company operating margin targets. When revenues for the company are $460 million or greater and gross margins are 49% or higher, the operating margin for the company is now targeted at 14% to 17%. 
Moving to the balance sheet. For fiscal Q2 2011, the company generated $60.7 million of cash from operations. Capital expenditures totaled approximately $28.3 million. At the end of fiscal Q2, the company held over $655 million in total cash and short-term investments. 
Headcount as of January 1, 2011, was 4,902. 
Now to our Q3 guidance. First, some points to consider as you think about our financial performance over the coming quarters. CommTest revenue is historically seasonally lower in the March quarter as the December quarter revenue includes calendar year end budget flush spending from the carriers and carrier budgets are typically released in the second half of the March quarter. The December quarter budget price was approximately $20 million. Based on our current visibility, we expect CommTest revenues after adjusting down for the budget flush to decline by 6% to 12% sequentially. 
Based on our current visibility, we expect CCOP revenues to grow sequentially by 6% to 10%, and AOT revenues to grow by up to 3%. 
Optical Communications ASP declined as expected to be slightly above our quarterly sequential range of 2% to 4% due to the just completed annual pricing negotiation. Operating expenses are expected to increase up to $5 million sequentially. A portion of that increase reflects higher employer payroll taxes and increased R&D investments. 
CommTest operating margins are estimated to be between 13% and 16% due to lower revenue. AOT operating margins are expected to be between 29% and 32%. Taxes, interest and other income are expected to result in a net expense of $5 million to $7 million. 
Share count for calculating earnings per share is expected to be approximately 233 million shares. Capital equipment purchases will be between 6% and 7% of revenue as we invest in our Shezhou [ph] facility and in expanding our manufacturing test capacity for Optical Communications products. 
Taking into consideration the factors above and based on our current visibility, we expect third quarter revenue to be between $440 million and $460 million, and our non-GAAP operating margins to be between 11% and 13%. 
I will now turn the call back to Tom."

The strength in revenue is driven primarily by growth in ROADMs, tunables, circuit packs",1303,"Thanks, Dave. Now let me provide Q2 highlights from each of our individual business segments. I will start with our the CCOP segment. 
First, Optical Communications. The strength in revenue is driven primarily by growth in ROADMs, tunables, circuit packs, which includes our Super Transport Blade, and gesture recognition products. Our customers are clearly recognizing our technology leadership and we believe we are gaining share across the majority of our customer base. 
Revenue from products introduced within the last two years accounted for 60% of total revenue in fiscal Q2. We expect our new product revenue to continue to be 60% or more in the near term. Tunable XFPs grew over 70% sequentially and accounted for over 10% of total Optical Communications revenue. 
Our penetration across the customer base is strong, having shipped to 44 different customer application. Since its introduction, JDSU has delivered more than 21,000 Tunable XFPs and we believe demand will remain strong as customers continue to design the Tunable XFP into more applications within their optical network. 
Q2 was the first full quarter that we shipped our second-generation Tunable XFP that replaces the 310 transponders in net for our regional market. We are currently shipping qualification units to customers for replacement of 310 transponders for long-haul application and expect ramp production this quarter. 
Our Tunable XFP portfolio is the broadest in the market and we expect to continue to expand our Tunable XFP portfolio over the next 12 months. 
Our traction in gesture recognition continues to grow. As a reminder, we supply two key products for our current gaming platform, laser diodes from our Optical Communications business and optical filters from our AOT segment. 
Quarterly gesture recognition revenue grew sequentially but continuing to be less than 4% on total JDSU revenue. We are currently working with a number of partners to expand the applications in gesture recognition technology. 
ROADM revenue grew over 40% sequentially. And now, represents over 30% of total Optical revenue. We expect continued ROADM strength as carriers upgrade networks to address the increased demand for bandwidth. 
We've introduced and qualified our low port ROADMs to meet the cost requirements of our customers as they place ROADMs at the edge of the network. This greatly expands the total available market for our ROADMs and will add to our future ROADM growth. 
Our Super Transport Blade revenue grew over 75% sequentially as additional manufacturing capacity was deployed during the quarter. Given the strength across our ROADM portfolio, we believe we continue to gain market share. 
Through close collaboration with our customers, we are seeing strong demand for our 40- and 100-gigabit products. Our component to module roadmap is robust. And through partnerships with our key suppliers and customers, we believe we will continue to see good traction for both blind-side and client-side 40- and 100-gigabit solutions. 
Turning to our Lasers business within the CCOP segment. We saw a slight decline in lasers revenue. The North American semiconductor equipment manufacturers restock their inventory during fiscal Q1. Traction with our partner, Yamada, remains very strong. The release recently launched 4-kilowatt fiber laser incorporated into the Yamada laser cutting system for metal processing applications enables up to 3x higher processing speed on thick materials as compared to traditional CO2 laser technologies. 
We are shipping in low volumes and are on track to be in full production by our first fiscal quarter. We are also developing a new fiber base class of pulsed lasers. These new lasers will expand the capabilities of existing products that enable faster and more accurate micro machining material in cutting and marking applications. We expect first revenue from these new lasers to start in fiscal 2012. 
Moving on to the CommTest segment. The overall strong performance in CommTest this quarter is derived from continued strength in our addressable markets as video and mobility drive the need for bandwidth expansion and quality of service. As a result, we saw continued demand for LTE test solutions. 
According to the Global Mobile Suppliers Association, 22 LTE networks were in commercial service by the end of 2010 and at least 64 LTE networks are anticipated to be in service by the end of 2012. In 2011, we expect to see more operators moving from pre-deployment testing to launch of networks followed by Service Assurance. 
Our unique end-to-end LTE solutions puts us in a position of strength with our customers to capitalize on all three of these stages. During Q2, we reported revenue for LTE test in new and existing customers across all geographies. 
The LTE projects we currently are working with approximately 30 customers on protocol test, 25 customers on dry test and 10 customers for Service Assurance. While our customers' CapEx commitments are more weighted on wireless projects, we continue to realize revenue during the quarter for handheld wireline broadband test applications, especially from emerging markets. 
In North America, we shipped thousands of our broadband handheld test instruments during the quarter. Point Tropic, a broadband market researcher, sites emerging countries as having the biggest and fastest-growing share of broadband lines and will remain the main driver of broadband growth. This is supported by our significant deals for next-generation broadband test instruments in Latin America. 
Fiber-optic test revenue grew 27% year-over-year for field and lab applications led by particular strength in Asia and Latin America. Today, we announced that JDSU received the consultant in the global market share leadership award for the fiber-optic test market. JDSU was recognized as a leading supplier of fiber test solutions critical to the build-out of high-capacity fiber networks and the quality delivery on video and other high bandwidth services. 
The steep video and data growth, we are seeing strength in productions for 100 G Internet and 40 G Ethernet test. For the during the quarter, we maintained our leadership position in this segment, particularly in China where our growth exceeds 20% across several top network equipment manufacturers. 
As 40 G and 100 G migrates to the field, our presence in the labs positions us with a competitive advantage as earned revenue as these higher speed networks are deployed. Today, we shipped 35, 40 G and 100 G units to 14 unique customers. We shipped to three new 40 G, 100 G customers who bought seven units. 
The quarter delivered major CommTest wins across all regions, including a multimillion dollar deal for Ethernet testing solutions in North America at a Tier 1 service provider as well as continued DOCSIS 3.0 order from the cable providers. A major European service providers selected JDSU's test solutions for the deployment of emerging 100 G and LTE next-generation networks. 
In Asia-Pacific, we won our first LTE Service Assurance deal in Hong Kong and 100 G testing in multiple customers in China as I have noted earlier. JDSU's continued focus on collaborative innovation with our customers resulted in products and features introduced within the last two years accounting for over 40% of CommTest revenue in fiscal Q2. 
During the quarter, we also introduced the Streets first 16 Gig Fibre Channel tests solution, leading the way for high-speed, high-capacity storage area networks. Finally, we introduced new network timing and frequency synchronization features for the T-Bird MTS 600A to help reduce operating expenses and accelerate deployment for LTE and IP video projects. Each of these examples is the outcome of close collaboration with customers. 
Our remaining segment is Advanced Optical Technologies or AOT. Revenues for the quarter include a continued recovery in the transaction card market as economic recovery expands as well as growth in our optical filters for gesture recognition. Currency revenues in Q2 were down as a result of cyclicality. In the near term, we expect the normal run rate for the U.S. $100 bill as there is no current updates including the new $100 bill.

Today, we reported earning results that are marked by a number of historical records, as we continue to execute and further advance JDSU's financial model. A good baseline for our financial results is our fiscal year 2006, when we further diversified our portfolio and became a player in the CommTest industry. Since that time, our financial results have never been stronger. 
In fiscal Q2, we reported record revenues of $477.2 million, record gross margin of 48.8% and record operating margin of 15.3%. Our book-to-bill was greater than 1, and our market outlook remains positive. These results reflect the strong market demand for our products, as carriers continue to invest to meet the needs for greater bandwidth worldwide. We're all familiar with the drivers by the bandwidth demand, video and mobility 
With the proliferation of tablets and smartphones, as well as Internet TV and HDTV, the outlook is robust. An industry leader reports that video will be over 90% of global consumer traffic by 2014. Infonetics forecast that the compounded annual growth rate of mobile broadband subscribers will be greater than 38% over five years to $1.8 billion by 2014, with the steepest projected growth coming from emerging markets. 
Through collaborative innovation, we are addressing our customers' requirements for network expansion and bandwidth growth, at the same time, meeting our needs to reduce costs and maintain quality of service. In doing so, we are securing leadership positions in fast-growing markets for products such as ROADMs, tunables, fiber-optic tests and LTE tests. We are also using our technology to participate in non-telco markets, such as commercial lasers, currency pigments, brand protection, gesture recognition, solar and 3D cinema. This is an exciting time for JDSU. 
Market drivers are strong, our innovation engine and pipeline for new products is robust, and we continue to make progress in increasing our operating leverage. We are achieving our financial goals and progressing towards setting higher targets. 
Now let me hand the call over to Dave, who will take you through the details of our financial performance in Q2, and we'll discuss our outlook for Q3."

Before I start, please note that all numbers are non-GAAP unless I state otherwise. Second quarter revenue of $477.2 million was up 16% from the prior quarter and up 38.8% when compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2010. Revenue excee",1565,"Thank you, Tom. Before I start, please note that all numbers are non-GAAP unless I state otherwise. 
Second quarter revenue of $477.2 million was up 16% from the prior quarter and up 38.8% when compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2010. Revenue exceeded our previously stated guidance. CommTest budget flush is greater than expected at approximately $20 million. Optical revenues were stronger than our stated range, as production increased more rapidly than forecast. 
Book-to-bill for the company was above 1 for the seventh straight quarter. Second quarter gross margin was 48.8% of revenue, up from the previous quarter's gross margin of 47.4% and up from second quarter of fiscal 2010 gross margin of 44.6%.  The second quarter gross margin sequential improvement is primarily due to higher CommTest revenue as a percentage of total revenue. 
Operating expenses for the second fiscal quarter of $159.8 million or 33.5% of revenue, a decline from the prior quarter's 36.6% of revenue and the lowest level as a percentage of revenue in the last five years. The increase in expenses from last quarter was within our stated range and primarily for variable selling costs, variable pay and R&D investment. 
The fiscal second quarter operating margin for the company grew to a record 15.3%. Net income was $67 million or $0.29 per share, which compares to $44.8 million or $0.20 per share for the first fiscal quarter. The increase in operating income and net income was driven by higher gross profit and operating expense leverage. A detailed reconciliation of our non-GAAP results to our GAAP results is available in today's press release. 
Our second quarter non-GAAP operating results, exclude, among other items, amortization of acquired technology and other intangibles, up $22.1 million, a $10 million charge for stock-based compensation, an acquisition-accounting adjustment to revenue of $3.7 million and restructuring and nonrecurring charges totaling $3.7 million. Including the noted items, the second quarter fiscal 2011 GAAP net income was $23.6 million or $0.10 per share, which compares to a prior-year second quarter GAAP net loss of $19.5 million or a loss of $0.09 per share. 
Now looking at quarterly revenue by region. Americas revenue of $243.9 million or 51% of total revenue was up $37.4 million from the prior quarter, driven primarily by increased CommTest revenue from North American service providers, which included the year-end budget flush and, also, higher optical component demand from network equipment manufacturers. 
EMEA revenue of $121.5 million or 26% of total revenue was up $17.3 million compared to the prior quarter, due primarily to strength in our CommTest business. Asia-Pacific revenue was $111.8 million or 23% of total revenue, up $11.2 million from the prior quarter due to higher demand for Optical and CommTest products. 
Moving to the segments. In the CCOP [Communications and Commercial Optical Products] segment, the breakout of the key metrics for Optical Communications and Lasers is as follows: Optical Communications revenue in fiscal Q2 was $168.4 million, up 17.8%, when compared to the prior quarter's revenue, and up 76.2%, when compared to the prior year. We saw a particular strength in ROADMs, circuit backs and tunable XFPs. All of the geographic regions grew sequentially. 
Quarterly ASP decline was below the midpoint of our historical quarterly range of 2% to 4%. Gross margin for the quarter was 32.9%, an increase of more than three percentage points from the prior quarter's gross margin of 29.5%. The sequential improvement was driven by product mix, better factory utilization and cost reduction activities. Despite increased production throughput, lead times stayed relatively flat from the prior quarter for most product lines. At the same time, with our increased capacity, we are able to implement VMI for one major customer for our Super Transport Blades. Even with the implementation of VMI, our book-to-bill was approximately 1. 
For Optical Communications, our gross margin target continues to be 30% to 35%. In our Lasers business, second quarter revenue of $22.7 million was down 9.2% when compared to the prior quarter and up 35.9% when compared to the prior year. Revenues return to previous levels after coming off a particularly strong Q1, where we saw our customers replenish their inventories. 
Gross margins were 45.5%, unchanged from the prior quarter. Book-to-bill was greater than 1. Total CCOP revenue was $191.1 million, up 13.8% from the prior quarter due to the strength in our Optical business. Gross margin was 34.4% and operating income was $34 million or 17.8% of revenue. Profitability in this segment continues to improve due to higher revenue levels and improved product mix and factory utilization. 
Given current revenue levels, our new target operating model for the CCOP segment is for operating margins of 16% to 20%, when revenues are above $190 million. 
Now moving on to our CommTest segment. Second quarter revenue of $231.4 million was up 26.6% from the previous quarter and up 30.8% from the prior fiscal year. The sequential revenue increase was due to strength in fiber optics and broadband tests, service insurance and seasonal budget flush of approximately $20 million. All geographies grew sequentially. Book-to-bill was approximately 1. 
Fiscal Q2 gross margin for CommTest of 60.9% was at the high end of our targeted range of 57% to 61% and up slightly from the prior quarter. The gross margin improvement was driven by a favorable product mix, which included higher revenues from the NSD business. 
CommTest operating profit was $44.8 million or 19.4% of revenue, which compares to 11.9% in the prior quarter and above our guided range. CommTest revenues tend to be seasonal, with the June and December quarter end typically the strongest and the March and September quarter ends being lower. As previously noted, our targeted CommTest operating market model is for operating margins of 20% to 23%, when revenues are greater than $215 million. We are continuing to review the profitability of our product portfolio in CommTest. This review has resulted in improved gross margins and operating margins over the last two quarters. We will continue to focus on improving the operating margins of CommTest, while providing innovative products for our customers. 
With the Advanced Optical Technologies or AOT segment, fiscal Q2 revenue was $54.7 million, down 9.6% when compared to the prior quarter due to cyclical demand in the currency market. As previously noted, currency products will see demand fluctuate according to the level of bank note printing needs. The decline in currency revenues was partially offset by growth in our Gesture Recognition business and a rebound in transaction card holograms. 
Book-to-bill was greater than 1. Fiscal Q2 gross margin for our AOT business was 48%, down from 50.4% in the prior quarter due to product mix and lower revenue levels. Also, annual customer contract negotiations have resulted in ASP pressure. 
AOT operating profit for the quarter was $17.7 million or 32.4% of revenue, down $4.4 million from the prior quarter due to lower revenue. Given the recent contract negotiations and increased investment in the AOT segment, the targeted operating margin range for the AOT segment is 32% to 35%. 
Today, we are revising up our total company operating margin targets. When revenues for the company are $460 million or greater and gross margins are 49% or higher, the operating margin for the company is now targeted at 14% to 17%. 
Moving to the balance sheet. For fiscal Q2 2011, the company generated $60.7 million of cash from operations. Capital expenditures totaled approximately $28.3 million. At the end of fiscal Q2, the company held over $655 million in total cash and short-term investments. 
Headcount as of January 1, 2011, was 4,902. 
Now to our Q3 guidance. First, some points to consider as you think about our financial performance over the coming quarters. CommTest revenue is historically seasonally lower in the March quarter, as the December quarter revenue includes calendar year-end budget flush spending from the carriers and carrier budgets are typically released in the second half of the March quarter. The December quarter budget flush was approximately $20 million. Based on our current visibility, we expect CommTest revenues, after adjusting down for the budget flush, to decline by 6% to 12% sequentially. 
Based on our current visibility, we expect CCOP revenues to grow sequentially by 6% to 10%, and AOT revenues to grow by up to 3%. 
Optical Communications ASP declined as expected to be slightly above our quarterly sequential range of 2% to 4% due to the just completed annual pricing negotiations. Operating expenses are expected to increase up to $5 million sequentially. A portion of that increase reflects higher employer payroll taxes and increased R&D investments. 
CommTest operating margins are estimated to be between 13% and 16% due to lower revenue. AOT operating margins are expected to be between 29% and 32%. Taxes, interest and other income are expected to result in a net expense of $5 million to $7 million. 
Share count for calculating earnings per share is expected to be approximately 233 million shares. Capital equipment purchases will be between 6% and 7% of revenue, as we invest in our Suzhou facility and in expanding our manufacturing test capacity for Optical Communications products. 
Taking into consideration the factors above and based on our current visibility, we expect third quarter revenue to be between $440 million and $460 million, and our non-GAAP operating margins to be between 11% and 13%. 
I will now turn the call back to Tom."

Now let me provide Q2 highlights from each of our individual business segments. I will start with our the CCOP segment, first, Optical Communications. The strength in revenue is driven primarily by growth in ROADMs, tunables, circuit packs,",1296,"Thanks, Dave. Now let me provide Q2 highlights from each of our individual business segments. I will start with our the CCOP segment, first, Optical Communications. The strength in revenue is driven primarily by growth in ROADMs, tunables, circuit packs, which includes our Super Transport Blade, and gesture recognition products. Our customers are clearly recognizing our technology leadership, and we believe we are gaining share across the majority of our customer base. 
Revenue from products introduced within the last two years accounted for 60% of total revenue in fiscal Q2. We expect our new product revenue to continue to be 60% or more in the near term. Tunable XFPs grew over 70% sequentially and accounted for over 10% of total Optical Communications revenue. 
Our penetration across the customer base is strong, having shipped to 44 different customer applications. Since its introduction, JDSU has delivered more than 21,000 tunable XFPs, and we believe demand will remain strong as customers continue to design their tunable XFP into more applications within their optical network. 
Q2 was the first full quarter that we shipped our second-generation tunable XFP that replaces the 310 transponders in the metro-regional market. We are currently shipping qualification units to customers for replacement of 310 transponders for long-haul application and expect ramp production this quarter. 
Our Tunable XFP portfolio is the broadest in the market and we expect to continue to expand our Tunable XFP portfolio over the next 12 months. 
Our traction in Gesture Recognitions continues to grow. As a reminder, we supply two key products for our current gaming platform, laser diodes from our Optical Communications business and optical filters from our AOT segment. 
Quarterly Gesture Recognition revenue grew sequentially, but continues to be less than 4% of total JDSU revenue. We are currently working with a number of partners to expand the applications of gesture recognition technology. 
ROADM revenue grew over 40% sequentially and now represents over 30% of total Optical revenue. We expect continued ROADM strength, as carriers upgrade networks to address the increased demand for bandwidth. We've introduced and qualified our low port-count ROADMs to meet the cost requirements of our customers, as they place ROADMs at the edge of the network. This greatly expands the total available market for our ROADMs and will add to our future ROADM growth. 
Our Super Transport Blade revenue grew over 75% sequentially, as additional manufacturing capacity was deployed during the quarter. Given the strength across our ROADM portfolio, we believe we continue to gain market share. 
Through close collaboration with our customers, we are seeing strong demand for our 40- and 100-gigabit products. Our component and module roadmap is robust. And through partnerships with our key suppliers and customers, we believe we will continue to see good traction for both line side and client side 40- and 100-gigabit solutions. 
Turning to our Lasers business within the CCOP segment. We saw a slight decline in Lasers revenue, as North American semiconductor equipment manufacturers restock their inventory during fiscal Q1. Traction with our partner, Amada, remains very strong. We recently launched 4-kilowatt fiber laser incorporated into the Amada Laser Cutting System for metal processing applications that enables up to 3x higher processing speed on thick materials as compared to traditional CO2 laser technologies. 
We are shipping in low volume and are on track to be in full production by our first fiscal quarter. We are also developing a new fiber-based class of pulsed lasers. These new lasers will expand the capabilities of existing products that enable faster and more accurate micromachining materials in cutting and marking applications. We expect the first revenue from these new lasers to start in fiscal 2012. 
Moving on to the CommTest segment. The overall strong performance in CommTest this quarter is derived from continued strength in our addressable markets, as video and mobility drive the need for bandwidth expansion and quality of service. As a result, we saw continued demand for LTE test solutions. 
According to the Global mobile Suppliers Association, 22 LTE networks were in commercial service by the end of 2010 and at least 64 LTE networks are anticipated to be in service by the end of 2012. In 2011, we expect to see more operators moving from pre-deployment testing to launching networks followed by Service Assurance. 
Our unique end-to-end LTE solutions puts us in a position of strength with our customers to capitalize on all three of these stages. During Q2, we reported revenue for LTE Test in new and existing customers across all geographies. 
For LTE projects, we currently are working with approximately 30 customers on protocol test, 25 customers on dry test and 10 customers for Service Assurance. While our customers' CapEx commitments are more weighted on wireless projects, we continue to realize revenue during the quarter for handheld wireline broadband test applications, especially from emerging markets. 
In North America, we shipped thousands of broadband handheld test instruments during the quarter. Point Topic, a broadband market researcher, cite emerging countries as having the biggest and fastest-growing share of broadband lines and will remain the main driver of broadband growth. This is supported by our significant deals for next-generation broadband test instruments in Latin America. 
Fiber Optic Test revenue grew 27% year-over-year for field and lab applications, led by particular strength in Asia and Latin America. Today, we announced that JDSU received the Frost & Sullivan Global Market Share Leadership Award for the fiber optic test market. JDSU was recognized as the leading supplier of fiber test solutions critical to the buildout of high-capacity fiber networks and the quality delivery of video and other high-bandwidth services. 
The steep video and data growth we are seeing strength in lab and production for 100G Ethernet and 40G Ethernet test. For the during the quarter, we maintained our leadership position in this segment, particularly in China where our growth exceeds 20% across several top network equipment manufacturers. 
As 40G and 100G migrate to the field, our presence in the labs positions us with a competitive advantage to earn revenue as these higher-speed networks are deployed. To date, we shipped 35, 40G and 100G units to 14 unique customers. We shipped to three new 40G, 100G customers in the quarter, who bought seven units. 
The quarter delivered major CommTest wins across all regions, including a multimillion dollar deal for Ethernet testing solutions in North America at a Tier 1 service provider, as well as continued DOCSIS 3.0 order from the cable providers. A major European service provider selected JDSU's test solutions for the deployment of emerging 100G and LTE next-generation networks. 
In Asia-Pacific, we won our first LTE Service Assurance deal in Hong Kong and a 100G testing in multiple customers in China, as I have noted earlier. JDSU's continued focus on collaborative innovation with our customers resulted in products and features introduced within the last two years, accounting for over 40% of CommTest revenue in fiscal Q2. 
During the quarter, we also introduced the industry's first 16G Fibre Channel test solutions, leading the way for high-speed, high-capacity storage area networks. Finally, we introduced new network timing and frequency synchronization features for the T-BERD MTS 6000A to help reduce operating expenses and accelerate deployment for LTE and IP video projects. Each of these examples was the outcome of close collaboration with customers. 
Our remaining segment is Advanced Optical Technologies or AOT. Revenues for the quarter included continued recovery in the transaction card market, as economic recovery expands as well as growth in our optical filters for gesture recognition. Currency revenues in Q2 were down as a result of cyclicality. In the near term, we expect the normal run rate for the U.S. $100 bill, as there is no current update in printing the new $100 bill.

Today we reported earnings results that are marked by a number of historical records as we continue to execute and further advance JDSU’s financial model. A good baseline for our financial results is our fiscal year 2006 when we further diversified our portfolio and became a player in the contest industry. Since that time our financial results have never been stronger. In fiscal Q2 we reported record revenues of $477.2 million dollars, record gross margin of 48.8% and record operating margin of 15.3%. Our book to bill was greater than one and our market outlook remains positive.
These results reflect a strong market demand for our products that carriers continue to invest to meet the needs for greater bandwidth worldwide. We are all familiar with the drivers behind the bandwidth demand; video and mobility.
With the proliferation of Tablets and SmartPhones as well as internet TV and HDTV, the outlook is robust. An industry leader reports that video will be over 90% of global consumer traffic by 2014. Infoetics forecasted the compound annual growth rate of mobile broadband subscribers will be greater than 38% over five years, to $1.8 billion by 2014 with the steepest projected growth coming from emerging markets.
Through collaborative innovation we are addressing our customers’ requirements for network expansion and bandwidth growth and at the same time meeting their needs to reduce costs to maintain quality of service. In doing so, we are securing leadership positions in fast growing markets for products such as ROADM, tunables, fiber optic tests and LTE tests.
We are also using our technology to participate in non-telco markets such as commercial lasers, currency pigments, brand protection, jester recognition and solar and 3-D cinema.
This is an exciting time for JDSU. Market drivers are strong. Our innovation, engine and pipeline for new products is robust. We continue to make progress in increasing our operating leverage. We are achieving our financial goals and progressing towards setting higher targets.
Now let me hand the call over to Dave who will take you through the details of our financial performance in Q2 and will discuss our outlook for Q3.

Before I start, please note that all numbers are non-GAAP unless I state otherwise.Q2 revenue of $477.2 million dollars was up 16% from the prior quarter and up 38.8% when compared to Q2 of fiscal 2010. Revenue exceeded our previously sta",1587,"Thank you Tom. Before I start, please note that all numbers are non-GAAP unless I state otherwise.
Q2 revenue of $477.2 million dollars was up 16% from the prior quarter and up 38.8% when compared to Q2 of fiscal 2010. Revenue exceeded our previously stated guidance.
CommTest budget flush was greater than expected at approximately $20 million dollars. Optical revenues were stronger than our stated range as production increased more rapidly than forecast. Book to bill for the company was above one for the seventh straight quarter.
Q2 gross margin was 48.8% of revenue, up from the previous quarter’s gross margin of 47.4% and up from Q2 fiscal 2010 gross margin of 44.6%. The Q2 gross margin’s sequential improvement is primarily due to higher contest revenue as a percentage of total revenue.
Operating expenses for Q2 of $159.8 million dollars were 33.5% of revenue. It declined from the prior quarters 36.6% of revenue in the lowest level as a percentage of revenue in the last five years. The increase in expenses for last quarter is within our stated range and primarily for variable selling costs, variable pay and R&D investment.
The Q2 operating margin for the company grew to a record 15.3%. Net income was $67 million dollars or $.29 per share which compares to $44.8 million dollars or $.20 per share for Q1.
The increase in operating income and net income was driven by higher gross profit and operating expense leverage. A detailed reconciliation of our non-GAAP results to our GAAP results is available in today’s press release. Our Q2 non-GAAP operating results exclude, among other items, amortization of acquired technology and other intangibles of $22.1 million dollars. A $10 million dollar charge for stock-based compensation. An acquisition accounting adjustment to revenue of $3.7 million dollars and restructuring and nonrecurring charges totaling $3.7 million dollars including the noted items, the Q2 fiscal 2011 GAAP net income was $23.6 million dollars or $.10 per share which compares to a prior year Q2 GAAP net loss of $19.5 million dollars or a loss of $.09 per share.
Now looking at quarterly revenue by region. America’s revenue up $243.9 million dollars or 51% of total revenue was up $37.4 million dollars from the prior quarter driven primarily by increased contest revenue from North American service providers which included the year-end budget flush and also higher optical component demand from network equipment manufacturers.
EMEA revenue of $121.5 million dollars or 26% of total revenue was up $17.3 million dollars compared to the prior quarter due primarily to strengths in our contest business.
Asia Pacific revenue was $111.8 million dollars or 23% of total revenue, up $11.2 million dollars from the prior quarter due to higher demand for optical and contest products.
Moving to the segments. In the CCOP segment the breakout of the key metrics for optical communications and lasers is as follows. Optical communications revenue in fiscal Q2 was $168.4 million dollars, up 17.8% when compared to the prior quarter’s revenue and up 76.2% when we compare to the prior year. We saw particular strength in ROADMs, Circuit backs and tunable XFPs. All of the geographic regions grew sequentially. Quarterly ASP decline was below the midpoint of our historical quarterly range of 2% to 4%.
Gross margin for the quarter was 32.9%, an increase of more than 3 percentage points from the prior quarter’s gross margin of 29.5%. The sequential improvement was driven by product mix, better factory utilization and cost reduction activities. Despite increased production throughput, lead-time stayed relatively flat from the prior quarter for most product lines. At the same time, with our increased capacity, we are able to implement VMI for one major customer for our super transport blades. Even with the implementation of VMI, our book to bill was approximately one. For optical communications our gross margin target continues to be 30% to 35%.
In our lasers business, Q2 revenue of $22.7 million dollars was down 9.2% when compared to the prior quarter and up 35.9% when compared to the prior year. Revenues returned to previous levels after coming off a particularly strong Q1 where we saw our customers replenish their inventories. Gross margins were 45.5%, unchanged from the prior quarter. Book to bill was greater than one.
Total CCOP revenue was $191.1 million dollars, up 13.8% from the prior quarter due to strength in our optical business. Gross margin was 34.4% and operating income was $34 million dollars or 17.8% of revenue. Profitability in this segment continues to improve due to higher revenue levels and improved product mix and factor utilization.
Given current revenue levels, our new target operating model for the CCOP segment is for operating margins of 16% to 20% when revenues are above $190 million dollars.
Now moving on to our CommTest segment. Q2 revenue of $231.4 million dollars was up 26.6% from the previous quarter and up 30.8% from the prior fiscal year. The sequential revenue increase was due to strength in fiber optic and broadband test, service assurance and seasonal budget flush of approximately $20 million dollars. All geographies grew sequentially. Book to bill was approximately one. Fiscal Q2 gross margin for CommTest of 60.9% was at the high end of our targeted range of 57% to 61% and up slightly from the prior quarter. The gross margin improvement was driven by a favorable product mix which included higher revenues from the NSZ business.
CommTest operating profit was $44.8 million or 19.4% of revenue, which compares to 11.9% in the prior quarter and above our guided range. CommTest revenues tend to be seasonal with the June and December quarter end typically the strongest and the March and September quarter ends being lower.
As previously noted our target CommTest operating model is for operating margins of 20% to 23% when revenues are greater than $215 million dollars. We are continuing to review the profitability of our product portfolio in CommTest. This review has resulted in improved gross margins and operating margins over the last two quarters. We will continue to focus on improving the operating margins of CommTest while providing innovative products for our customers.
With the advanced optical technologies, or AOT segment, fiscal Q2 revenue was $54.7 million dollars, down 9.6% when compared to the prior quarter due to cyclicality demand in the currency market. As previously noted, currency products will see demand fluctuate according to the level of bank note printing needs. The decline in currency revenue was partially offset by growth in our gesture recognition business and a rebound in transaction card holograms. Book to bill was greater than one.
Fiscal Q2 gross margin for our AOT business was 48%, down from 50.4% in the prior quarter due to product mix and lower revenue levels. Also annual customer contract negotiations have resulted in ASP pressure. AOT operating profit for the quarter was $17.7 million dollars or 32.4% of revenue, down $4.4 million dollars from the prior quarter due to lower revenue.
Given the recent contract negotiations and increased investment in the AOT segment, the targeted operating margin range for the AOT segment is 32% to 35%. Today we are revising up our total company operating margin target. When revenues for the company are $460 million dollars or greater and gross margins are 49% or higher, the operating margin for the company is now targeted at 14% to 17%.
Moving to the balance sheet. For fiscal Q2 2011 the company generated $60.7 million dollars of cash from operations. Capital expenditures totaled approximately $28.3 million dollars. At the end of fiscal Q2 the company held over $655 million dollars in total cash and short-term investments. Head count as of January 1, 2011 was 4,902.
Now to our Q3 guidance. First some points to consider as you think about our financial performance over the coming quarters. CommTest revenue is historically seasonally lower in the March quarter as the December quarter revenue includes calendar year end budget flush spending from the carriers and carrier budgets are typically released in the second half of the March quarter. The December quarter budget flush was approximately $20 million dollars. Based on our current visibility, we expect CommTest revenues, after adjusting down for the budget flush, to decline by 6% to 12% sequentially.
Based on our current visibility we expect CCOP revenues to grow sequentially by 6% to 10% and AOT revenues to grow by up to 3%. Optical communications ASP decline is expected to be slightly above our quarterly sequential range of 2% to 4% due to just completed annual pricing negotiations. Operating expenses are expected to increase up to $5 million dollars sequentially. A portion of that increase reflects higher employer payroll taxes and increased R&D investment.
CommTest operating margins are estimated to be between 13% and 16% due to lower revenue. AOT operating margins are expected to be between 29% and 32%. Taxes, interest and other income are expected to result in a net expense of $5 million to $7 million dollars.
Share count for calculating earnings per share is expected to be approximately 233 million shares. Capital equipment purchases will be between 6% and 7% of revenue as we invest in our Suzhou facility and in expanding our manufacturing and test capacity for optical communications products.
Taking into consideration the factors above and based on our current visibility, we expect Q3 revenue to be between $440 million and $460 million dollars and our non-GAAP operating margin to be between 11% and 13.
I will now turn the call back to Tom.

I will start with the CCOP segment first optical communications. The strength in revenue is driven primarily by growth in ROADM, tunables, circuit packs which include their super transport blade and gesture recognition products. Our customers are clearly recognizing our technology leadership and we believe we are gaining share across the majority of our customer base.
Revenue from products introduced within the last two years accounted for 60% of total revenue in fiscal Q2. We expect our new product revenue to continue to be 60% or more in the near term.
Tunable XFPs grew over 70% sequentially and accounted for over 10% of total optical communications revenue. Our penetration across the customer base is strong having shipped to 44 different customer applications. Since its introduction, JDSU has delivered more than 21,000 tunable XFPs and we believe demand will remain strong as customers continue to design the tunable XFP into more applications within their optical network.
Q2 is the first full quarter that we shipped our second generation tunable XFP that replaces 300 pin transponders in the metro regional market. We are currently shipping qualification unites to customers for replacement of 300 pin transponders for long-haul applications and expect to ramp production this quarter. Our tunable XFP portfolio is the broadest in the market and we expect to continue to expand our tunable XFP portfolio over the next 12 months.
Our traction in gesture recognition continues to grow. As a reminder, we supply two key products for a current gaining platform, laser diodes from our optical communications business and optical filters from our AOT segment. Quarterly gesture recognition revenue grew sequentially but continues to be less than 4% of total JDSU revenue.
We are currently working with a number of partners to expand the applications of gesture recognition technology. ROADM revenue grew over 40% sequentially and now represented over 30% of total optical revenue. We expect continued ROADM strength as carriers upgrade networks to address the increased demand for bandwidth.
We introduced and qualified our low port count ROADMs to meet the cost requirements of our customers as they place ROADMs at the edge of the network. This greatly expands the total available market for our ROADMs and will add to our future ROADM growth.
Our super transport grade revenue grew over 75% sequentially as additional manufacturing capacity was deployed during the quarter. Given the strength across the ROADM portfolio we continue to gain market share. Through close collaboration with our customers we are seeing strong demand for our 40-gigabit and 100-gigabit products. Our component and module road map is robust and through partnerships with our key suppliers and customers, we believe we will continue to see good traction for both line side and client side 40-gigabit and 100-gigabit solutions.
Turning to our lasers business within the CCOP segment we saw a slight decline in lasers revenue but North American semiconductor equipment manufacturers restocked their inventory during fiscal Q1.
Traction with our partners remains very strong. The recently launched 4 kilowatt fiber laser incorporated into the pulse laser cutting system for metal processing applications enables up to three times higher processing speed of thick materials as compared to traditional CO2 laser technologies. We are shipping in low volumes and are on track to be in full production by our first fiscal quarter.
We are also developing a new fiber based class of pulse lasers. These new lasers will expand the capabilities of existing product to enable faster and more accurate micro-machining materials in cutting and marking applications. We expect first revenue from these new lasers to start in fiscal 2012.
Moving onto the CommTest segment. The overall strong performance in CommTest this quarter is derived from continued strength in our addressable markets and video and mobility drive the need for bandwidth expansion and quality of service. As a result we saw continued demand for LT test solutions. According to the global mobile suppliers association, 22 LT networks were in commercial service by the end of 2010 and at least 64 LT networks are anticipated to be in service by the end of 2012. In 2011 we expect to see more operators moving from free deployment testing to launching networks followed by service assurance. Our unique end-to-end LT solution puts us in a position of strength with our customers to capitalize on all three of these stages.
During Q2 we reported revenue for LT projects with both the new and existing customers across all geographies. For LT projects we currently are working with approximately 30 customers on protocol tests, 25 customers on drive tests and 10 customers for service assurance. While our customers CAPEX commitments are more weighted on wireless projects, we continue to realize revenue during the quarter for handheld wire line broadband test applications especially from emerging markets.
In North America we shipped thousands of broadband handheld test instruments during the quarter. Many broadband market researchers cite the merging countries as having the biggest and fastest growing share of broadband lines and will remain the main driver of broadband growth. This is supported by our significant deals for next generation broadband test instruments in Latin America.
Fiber optic test revenue grew 27% year-over-year for field and lab applications led by particular strength in Asia and Latin America. Today we announced that JDSU received the Frost & Sullivan Global Market Share Leadership Award for the fiber optic test margin. JDSU was recognized as the leading supplier of fiber test solutions critical to the build out of high capacity fiber networks and the quality delivery of video and other high bandwidth services.
With steep video and data growth, we are seeing strength in lab and production for 100 g Ethernet and 40g ether net tests. During the quarter we maintained our leadership position in this segment particularly in China where our growth exceeds 20% across several top network equipment manufactures. As 40g and 100g migrate to the field, our presence in labs positions us with a competitive advantage to earn revenue as these higher speed networks are deployed. To date we shipped 35 40g and 100g units to 14 unique customers. We shipped to 3 new 40g, 100g customers in the quarter who bought seven units.
The quarter delivered major contest wins across all regions including a multimillion dollar deal for Ethernet testing solutions in North America at a tier one service provider as well as continued (inaudible) 3.0 orders from the cable providers.
The major European service providers selected JDSU’s test solutions for the deployment of emerging 100g and LT next generation networks.
In Asia Pacific we won our first LT service assurance deal in Hong Kong and 100g testing at multiple customers in China as I had noted earlier. JDSU’s continued focus on collaborative innovation with our customers resulted in products and features introduced within the last two years accounting for over 40% of CommTest revenue in fiscal Q2.
During the quarter we also introduced the industry’s first 16-gig fiber channel test solution leading the way for high speed, high capacity storage area networks. Finally we introduced new network timing and frequency synchronization features for the T-BERD MTS 6000A that helped reduce operating expenses and accelerate deployment for LTE and IP video projects. Each of these examples was the outcome of close collaboration with customers.
Our remaining segment is Advanced Optical Technologies or AOT. Revenues for the quarter included continued recovery in the transaction card market as economic recovery expands as well as growth in our optical filters for gesture recognition. Currency revenues in Q2 were down as a result of cyclicality. In the near term we expect a normal run rate for the US 100 dollar bill as there is no current update in printing the new 100 dollar bill.
Operator we’ll now take questions.

Today, we reported earning results that are marked by a number of historical records, as we continue to execute and further advance JDSU's financial model. A good baseline for our financial results is our fiscal year 2006, when we further diversified our portfolio and became a player in the CommTest industry. Since that time, our financial results have never been stronger. 
In fiscal Q2, we reported record revenues of $477.2 million, record gross margin of 48.8% and record operating margin of 15.3%. Our book-to-bill was greater than 1, and our market outlook remains positive. These results reflect the strong market demand for our products, as carriers continue to invest to meet the needs for greater bandwidth worldwide. We're all familiar with the drivers behind the bandwidth demands, video and mobility. 
With the proliferation of tablets and smartphones, as well as Internet TV and HDTV, the outlook is robust. An industry leader reports that video will be over 90% of global consumer traffic by 2014. Infonetics forecasts that the compounded annual growth rate of mobile broadband subscribers will be greater than 38% over five years to 1.8 billion by 2014, with the steepest projected growth coming from emerging markets. 
Through collaborative innovation, we are addressing our customers' requirements for network expansion and bandwidth growth, at the same time, meeting their needs to reduce costs and maintain quality of service. In doing so, we are securing leadership positions in fast-growing markets for products such as ROADMs, Tunables, fiber-optic tests and LTE tests. We are also using our technology to participate in non-telco markets, such as commercial lasers, currency pigments, brand protection, gesture recognition, solar and 3D cinema. This is an exciting time for JDSU. 
Market drivers are strong, our innovation engine and pipeline for new products is robust, and we continue to make progress in increasing our operating leverage. We are achieving our financial goals and progressing towards setting higher targets. 
Now let me hand the call over to Dave, who will take you through the details of our financial performance in Q2, and will discuss our outlook for Q3."

Before I start, please note that all numbers are non-GAAP unless I state otherwise.

Before I start, please note that all numbers are non-GAAP unless I state otherwise. 
Second quarter revenue of $477.2 million was up 16% from the prior quarter and up 38.8% when compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2010. Revenue exceeded our previously stated guidance. CommTest budget flush was greater than expected at approximately $20 million. Optical revenues were stronger than our stated range, as production increased more rapidly than forecast. 
Book-to-bill for the company was above 1 for the seventh straight quarter. Second quarter gross margin was 48.8% of revenue, up from the previous quarter's gross margin of 47.4% and up from second quarter of fiscal 2010’s gross margin of 44.6%.  The second quarter gross margin sequential improvement is primarily due to higher CommTest revenue as a percentage of total revenue. 
Operating expenses for the second fiscal quarter of $159.8 million or 33.5% of revenue, a decline from the prior quarter's 36.6% of revenue and the lowest level as a percentage of revenue in the last five years. The increase in expenses from last quarter was within our stated range and primarily for variable selling costs, variable pay and R&D investment. 
The fiscal second quarter operating margin for the company grew to a record 15.3%. Net income was $67 million or $0.29 per share, which compares to $44.8 million or $0.20 per share for the first fiscal quarter. The increase in operating income and net income was driven by higher gross profit and operating expense leverage. A detailed reconciliation of our non-GAAP results to our GAAP results is available in today's press release. 
Our second quarter non-GAAP operating results, exclude, among other items, amortization of acquired technology and other intangibles, up $22.1 million, a $10 million charge for stock-based compensation, an acquisition-accounting adjustment to revenue of $3.7 million and restructuring and nonrecurring charges totaling $3.7 million. Including the noted items, the second quarter fiscal 2011 GAAP net income was $23.6 million or $0.10 per share, which compares to a prior-year second quarter GAAP net loss of $19.5 million or a loss of $0.09 per share. 
Now looking at quarterly revenue by region. America’s revenue of $243.9 million or 51% of total revenue was up $37.4 million from the prior quarter, driven primarily by increased CommTest revenue from North American service providers, which included the year-end budget flush and, also, higher optical component demand from network equipment manufacturers. 
EMEA revenue of $121.5 million or 26% of total revenue was up $17.3 million compared to the prior quarter, due primarily to strength in our CommTest business. Asia-Pacific revenue was $111.8 million or 23% of total revenue, up $11.2 million from the prior quarter due to higher demand for Optical and CommTest products. 
Moving to the segments. In the CCOP [Communications and Commercial Optical Products] segment, the breakout of the key metrics for Optical Communications and Lasers is as follows: Optical Communications revenue in fiscal Q2 was $168.4 million, up 17.8%, when compared to the prior quarter's revenue, and up 76.2%, when compared to the prior year. We saw particular strength in ROADMs, circuit backs and Tunable XFPs. All of the geographic regions grew sequentially. 
Quarterly ASP decline was below the midpoint of our historical quarterly range of 2% to 4%. Gross margin for the quarter was 32.9%, an increase of more than three percentage points from the prior quarter's gross margin of 29.5%. The sequential improvement was driven by product mix, better factory utilization and cost reduction activities. Despite increased production throughput, lead times stayed relatively flat from the prior quarter for most product lines. At the same time, with our increased capacity, we are able to implement VMI for one major customer for our Super Transport Blades. Even with the implementation of VMI, our book-to-bill was approximately 1. 
For Optical Communications, our gross margin target continues to be 30% to 35%. In our Lasers business, second quarter revenue of $22.7 million was down 9.2% when compared to the prior quarter and up 35.9% when compared to the prior year. Revenues returned to previous levels after coming off a particularly strong Q1, where we saw our customers replenish their inventories. 
Gross margins were 45.5%, unchanged from the prior quarter. Book-to-bill was greater than 1. Total CCOP revenue was $191.1 million, up 13.8% from the prior quarter due to the strength in our Optical business. Gross margin was 34.4% and operating income was $34 million or 17.8% of revenue. Profitability in this segment continues to improve due to higher revenue levels and improved product mix and factory utilization. 
Given current revenue levels, our new target operating model for the CCOP segment is for operating margins of 16% to 20%, when revenues are above $190 million. 
Now moving on to our CommTest segment. Second quarter revenue of $231.4 million was up 26.6% from the previous quarter and up 30.8% from the prior fiscal year. The sequential revenue increase was due to strength in fiber optic and broadband tests, service assurance and seasonal budget flush of approximately $20 million. All geographies grew sequentially. Book-to-bill was approximately 1. 
Fiscal Q2 gross margin for CommTest of 60.9% was at the high end of our targeted range of 57% to 61% and up slightly from the prior quarter. The gross margin improvement was driven by a favorable product mix, which included higher revenues from the NSD business. 
CommTest operating profit was $44.8 million or 19.4% of revenue, which compares to 11.9% in the prior quarter and above our guided range. CommTest revenues tend to be seasonal, with the June and December quarter ends typically the strongest and the March and September quarter ends being lower. As previously noted, our targeted CommTest operating market model is for operating margins of 20% to 23%, when revenues are greater than $215 million. We are continuing to review the profitability of our product portfolio in CommTest. This review has resulted in improved gross margins and operating margins over the last two quarters. We will continue to focus on improving the operating margins of CommTest, while providing innovative products to our customers. 
With the Advanced Optical Technologies or AOT segment, fiscal Q2 revenue was $54.7 million, down 9.6% when compared to the prior quarter due to cyclical demand in the currency market. As previously noted, currency products will see demand fluctuate according to the level of bank note printing needs. The decline in currency revenues was partially offset by growth in our Gesture Recognition business and a rebound in transaction card holograms. 
Book-to-bill was greater than 1. Fiscal Q2 gross margin for our AOT business was 48%, down from 50.4% in the prior quarter due to product mix and lower revenue levels. Also, annual customer contract negotiations have resulted in ASP pressure. 
AOT operating profit for the quarter was $17.7 million or 32.4% of revenue, down $4.4 million from the prior quarter due to lower revenue. Given the recent contract negotiations and increased investment in the AOT segment, the targeted operating margin range for the AOT segment is 32% to 35%. 
Today, we are revising up our total company operating margin targets. When revenues for the company are $460 million or greater and gross margins are 49% or higher, the operating margin for the company is now targeted at 14% to 17%. 
Moving to the balance sheet. For fiscal Q2 2011, the company generated $60.7 million of cash from operations. Capital expenditures totaled approximately $28.3 million. At the end of fiscal Q2, the company held over $655 million in total cash and short-term investments. 
Headcount as of January 1, 2011, was 4,902. 
Now to our Q3 guidance. First, some points to consider as you think about our financial performance over the coming quarters. CommTest revenue is historically seasonally lower in the March quarter, as the December quarter revenue includes calendar year-end budget flush spending from the carriers and carrier budgets are typically released in the second half of the March quarter. The December quarter budget flush was approximately $20 million. Based on our current visibility, we expect CommTest revenues, after adjusting down for the budget flush, to decline by 6% to 12% sequentially. 
Based on our current visibility, we expect CCOP revenues to grow sequentially by 6% to 10%, and AOT revenues to grow by up to 3%. 
Optical Communications ASPs declined as expected to be slightly above our quarterly sequential range of 2% to 4% due to just-completed annual pricing negotiations. Operating expenses are expected to increase up to $5 million sequentially. A portion of that increase reflects higher employer payroll taxes and increased R&D investments. 
CommTest operating margins are estimated to be between 13% and 16% due to lower revenue. AOT operating margins are expected to be between 29% and 32%. Taxes, interest and other income are expected to result in a net expense of $5 million to $7 million. 
Share count for calculating earnings per share is expected to be approximately 233 million shares. Capital equipment purchases will be between 6% and 7% of revenue, as we invest in our Suzhou facility and in expanding our manufacturing test capacity for Optical Communications products. 
Taking into consideration the factors above and based on our current visibility, we expect third quarter revenue to be between $440 million and $460 million, and our non-GAAP operating margin to be between 11% and 13%. 
I will now turn the call back to Tom."

I will start with the CCOP segment first, Optical Communications. The strength in revenue is driven primarily by growth in ROADMs, Tunables, circuit packs, which includes our Super Transport Blade, and gesture recognition products. Our customers are clearly recognizing our technology leadership, and we believe we are gaining share across the majority of our customer base. 
Revenue from products introduced within the last two years accounted for 60% of total revenue in fiscal Q2. We expect our new product revenue to continue to be 60% or more in the near term. Tunable XFPs grew over 70% sequentially and accounted for over 10% of total Optical Communications revenue. 
Our penetration across the customer base is strong, having shipped to 44 different customer applications. Since its introduction, JDSU has delivered more than 21,000 Tunable XFPs, and we believe demand will remain strong as customers continue to design the Tunable XFP into more applications within their optical network. 
Q2 was the first full quarter that we shipped our second-generation Tunable XFP that replaces the 300-pin transponders in the metro-regional market. We are currently shipping qualification units to customers for replacement of 300-pin transponders for long-haul applications and expect to ramp production this quarter. 
Our Tunable XFP portfolio is the broadest in the market and we expect to continue to expand our Tunable XFP portfolio over the next 12 months. 
Our traction in Gesture Recognitions continues to grow. As a reminder, we supply two key products for our current gaming platform: laser diodes from our Optical Communications business and optical filters from our AOT segment. 
Quarterly Gesture Recognition revenue grew sequentially, but continues to be less than 4% of total JDSU revenue. We are currently working with a number of partners to expand the applications of gesture recognition technology. 
ROADM revenue grew over 40% sequentially and now represents over 30% of total Optical revenue. We expect continued ROADM strength, as carriers upgrade networks to address the increased demand for bandwidth. We introduced and qualified our low port-count ROADMs to meet the cost requirements of our customers as they place ROADMs at the edge of the network. This greatly expands the total available market for our ROADMs and will add to our future ROADM growth. 
Our Super Transport Blade revenue grew over 75% sequentially, as additional manufacturing capacity was deployed during the quarter. Given the strength across our ROADM portfolio, we believe we continue to gain market share. 
Through close collaboration with our customers, we are seeing strong demand for our 40- and 100-gigabit products. Our component and module roadmap is robust. And through partnerships with our key suppliers and customers, we believe we will continue to see good traction for both line side and client side 40- and 100-gigabit solutions. 
Turning to our Lasers business within the CCOP segment. We saw a slight decline in Lasers revenue, as North American semiconductor equipment manufacturers restocked their inventory during fiscal Q1. Traction with our partner, Amada, remains very strong. We recently launched 4-kilowatt fiber laser incorporated into the Amada Laser Cutting System for metal processing applications that enables up to 3x higher processing speed on thick materials as compared to traditional CO2 laser technologies. 
We are shipping in low volumes and are on track to be in full production by our first fiscal quarter. We are also developing a new fiber-based class of pulse lasers. These new lasers will expand the capabilities of existing products that enable faster and more accurate micromachining materials in cutting and marking applications. We expect first revenue from these new lasers to start in fiscal 2012. 
Moving on to the CommTest segment. The overall strong performance in CommTest this quarter is derived from continued strength in our addressable markets, as video and mobility drive the need for bandwidth expansion and quality of service. As a result, we saw continued demand for LTE test solutions. 
According to the Global mobile Suppliers Association, 22 LTE networks were in commercial service by the end of 2010 and at least 64 LTE networks are anticipated to be in service by the end of 2012. In 2011, we expect to see more operators moving from pre-deployment testing to launching networks followed by Service Assurance. 
Our unique end-to-end LTE solutions puts us in a position of strength with our customers to capitalize on all three of these stages. During Q2, we reported revenue for LTE Test in new and existing customers across all geographies. 
For LTE projects, we currently are working with approximately 30 customers on protocol test, 25 customers on drive test and 10 customers for Service Assurance. While our customers' CapEx commitments are more weighted on wireless projects, we continued to realize revenue during the quarter for handheld wireline broadband test applications, especially from emerging markets. 
In North America, we shipped thousands of broadband handheld test instruments during the quarter. Point Topic, a broadband market researcher, cites emerging countries as having the biggest and fastest-growing share of broadband lines and will remain the main driver of broadband growth. This is supported by our significant deals for next-generation broadband test instruments in Latin America. 
Fiber Optic Test revenue grew 27% year-over-year for field and lab applications, led by particular strength in Asia and Latin America. Today, we announced that JDSU received the Frost & Sullivan Global Market Share Leadership Award for the fiber optic test market. JDSU was recognized as the leading supplier of fiber test solutions critical to the build-out of high-capacity fiber networks and the quality delivery of video and other high bandwidth services. 
With steep video and data growth we are seeing strength in lab and production for 100G Ethernet and 40G Ethernet test. During the quarter, we maintained our leadership position in this segment, particularly in China where our growth exceeds 20% across several top network equipment manufacturers. 
As 40G and 100G migrate to the field, our presence in the labs positions us with a competitive advantage to earn revenue as these higher-speed networks are deployed. To date, we shipped 35, 40G and 100G units to 14 unique customers. We shipped to three new 40G, 100G customers in the quarter, who bought seven units. 
The quarter delivered major CommTest wins across all regions, including a multimillion dollar deal for Ethernet testing solutions in North America at a Tier 1 service provider, as well as continued DOCSIS 3.0 orders from the cable providers. A major European service provider selected JDSU's test solutions for the deployment of emerging 100G and LTE next-generation networks. 
In Asia-Pacific, we won our first LTE Service Assurance deal in Hong Kong and a 100G testing at multiple customers in China, as I had noted earlier. JDSU's continued focus on collaborative innovation with our customers resulted in products and features introduced within the last two years, accounting for over 40% of CommTest revenue in fiscal Q2. 
During the quarter, we also introduced the industry's first 16G Fibre Channel test solution, leading the way for high-speed, high-capacity storage area networks. Finally, we introduced new network timing and frequency synchronization features for the T-BERD MTS 6000A that help reduce operating expenses and accelerate deployment for LTE and IP video projects. Each of these examples was the outcome of close collaboration with customers. 
Our remaining segment is Advanced Optical Technologies or AOT. Revenues for the quarter included continued recovery in the transaction card market, as economic recovery expands as well as growth in our optical filters for gesture recognition. Currency revenues in Q2 were down as a result of cyclicality. In the near term, we expect a normal run rate for the U.S. $100 bill, as there is no current update in printing the new $100 bill.

First, I am extremely pleased with our performance in fiscal Q2, as we exceeded our previously stated guidance and set records in revenue, gross margin and operating margin. We have successfully transformed our operating model, and we're looking towards setting higher financial targets. Second, our drivers remain strong. Broadband infrastructure growth continues based on steep demand from bandwidth-intensive applications. We also continue to innovate and use our technology to participate in non-telco markets such as commercial lasers, currency pigments, brand protection, gesture recognition, solar and 3D cinema. I am bullish on the long-term growth opportunities for JDSU. 
None of this would be possible without the hard work and dedication of our employees. I would like to thank them for their continued focus, commitment and contribution.

JDSU delivered strong third quarter results with solid financial performance and market share gains. Overall, the end markets for our products remained strong and our collaborative innovation continued to gain momentum with new product introductions. In fiscal Q3, we recorded revenues of $455.4 million, gross margins of 47.6% and margin of 12.1%. If we compare the same period a year ago, revenues grew nearly 37%, gross margins grew by 350 basis points and operating income grew by nearly 150%. This is tremendous progress as we continued to execute against our strategy and advanced our overall financial model. Our success lies in part with our strategy operating as a diversified technology company, which allows JDSU as a whole the ability to navigate fluctuations that may occur in any one business segment.
I will now address 3 recent events in the market. First, the events in Japan are tragic and have affected the lives of many people. We are thankful that all of our employees in Japan are safe. JDSU and its employees have contributed to the relief effort and we are committed to helping the people of Japan recover from this unfortunate event. While our business saw very limited impact from the events in Japan during the March quarter, we will continue to monitor the situation closely and will work with our suppliers in order to fulfill our customer requirements.
Second, with respect to the consolidations we are seeing in our service provider customers, we do not believe we will see any impact in near-term demand as a result of recent announcements in the sector. We will continue to work closely with our customers and continue to build out 2G and 3G network and with the rollout of 4G and LTE. And finally, recent announcements have cause some uncertainty in the optical communications market. We do agree that there's a current slowdown in sequential quarterly demand and some customers there's an effort to reduce inventory levels. At the same time, we believe market drivers remain strong. Our optical communications business grew nearly 10% quarter-over-quarter and over 68% year-over-year. Our strategic focus on integrated, differentiated products is working. We are both increasing our customer penetration and taking market share. For example, our ROADM and tunable access fee revenue each grew over 20% sequentially and now represent over 45% of total optical communication revenue. We are not immune to volatility in this market but our portfolio of broadly accepted innovative products is separating us from our competition.
Now let me hand the call over to Dave, who will take you through the details of our financial performance in Q3 and will discuss our outlook for Q4. Following Dave's remarks, I will provide more details on our results, the trends we are seeing and our strategy moving forward."

Revenues incre",1573,"Thank you, Tom. Before I start please note that all numbers are non-GAAP unless I state otherwise.
Third quarter revenue of $455.4 million was down 4.6% from the prior quarter and up 36.8% when compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Revenues increased sequentially in our CCOP and AOT segments and declined, as expected, in our Comcast segment due to March quarter seasonality. Book-to-bill for Comcast, Lasers and AOT were each above 1 while our optical communication's book-to-bill was below 1. Book-to-bill for the total company was also below 1. Third quarter gross margin was 47.6% of revenue, down from the previous quarter's gross margin of 48.8% and up from third quarter fiscal 2010's gross margin of 44.1%. The third quarter sequential decline in gross margin was primarily due to segment mix. The year-over-year improvement in gross margin was due to improved margins in CCOP and in Comcast. 
Operating expenses for the third fiscal quarter of $161.9 million were 35.6% of revenue, up slightly from the prior quarter's $159.8 million. The increase in expenses from last quarter was within our stated range and primarily for higher employer payroll taxes and the impact of the weaker dollar on operating expenses.
The fiscal third quarter operating margin for the company was 12.1%, up from 6.6% for the year ago period, primarily due to higher revenues and gross margins. Net income was $51 million or $0.22 per share, which compares to $67 million or $0.29 per share for the second fiscal quarter and $23.2 million or $0.10 per share for the year ago period. A detailed reconciliation of our non-GAAP results to our GAAP results is available in today's press release. Our third quarter non-GAAP results exclude, among other items, amortization of acquired technology and other intangibles of $22.3 million, a $10.9 million charge for stock-based compensation and acquisition accounting adjustment to revenue of $1.4 million, restructuring and nonrecurring charges totaling $7.6 million and a $34.9 million tax benefit from the release of a deferred tax valuation allowance for a foreign jurisdiction. 
Including the noted items, the third quarter fiscal 2011 GAAP net income was $38.6 million or $0.16 per share, which compares to a prior year third quarter GAAP net loss of $11.9 million or a loss of $0.05 per share. 
Now looking at quarterly revenue by region. Americas revenue of $208.8 million or 46% of total revenue was down $35.1 million from the prior quarter. The decrease was in test and measurement and was due primarily to approximately $20 million of service provided budget flush that was realized in the December quarter in seasonally lower service provided demand. EMEA revenue of $127.2 million or 28% of total revenue was up $5.7 million compared to the prior quarter due primarily to strength in our optical communications business and in our AOT segment. Asia-Pacific revenue was $119.4 million or 26% of total revenue, up $7.6 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to higher demand for optical communications products.
Moving to the segments. In the CCOP segment, the breakout of key metrics for optical communications and lasers is as follows: optical communications revenue in fiscal Q3 was $184.7 million, up 9.7% when compared to the prior quarter's revenue of 68.1% when compared to the prior year. We saw particular strength in ROADMs, circuit packs and tunable XFPs. All of the geographic regions grew sequentially. Quarterly ASP decline was 3.9%, which was below our expectations. Gross margin for the quarter was 32.9%, flat with the prior quarter and within our target range of 30% to 35%. 
During the quarter, we continued to increase our test capacity for a number of our products which allowed us to expand our VMI portfolio for two major customers and reduce our product lead times. In our lasers business, third quarter revenue of $24.7 million was up 8.8% when compared to the prior quarter and up 31.9% compared to the prior year due to the demand for our solid-state lasers used in semiconductor, LED and micromachining applications. Gross margins were 46.8%, up from the prior quarter. Total CCOP revenues was $209.4 million, up 9.6% from the prior quarter. Gross margin was 34.6% and operating income was $39.6 million or 18.9% of revenue. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to higher revenue. Our sustainable targeted CCOP operating model and operating margins of 16% to 20% on revenues are above $190 million on a quarterly basis.
Now moving on to our contest segment. As a reminder, the March quarter revenue is typically seasonally lower than the December quarter. As expected March quarter revenue of $189.2 million was down 10.5% from December quarter's revenue, after adjusting the December quarter revenue for $20 million of calendar year end customer budget flush. On a year-over-year basis, third quarter revenue was up 29.9% from the prior fiscal year. Q3 organic revenue growth, which excludes revenue from the NSD products and from third party complementary products, was up 15% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, Asia-Pacific revenues grew modestly while EMEA and the Americas revenues declined primarily due to seasonality.
Fiscal Q3 gross margin for Comcast of 61.9% exceeded our targeted range of 57% to 61% and increased by 700 basis points from the prior year's Q3 gross margin of 54.9%. The gross margin improvement was driven by revenue from the NSD acquisition, which was completed after fiscal Q3 last year and from favorable product mix as 45% of Comcast revenue came from products introduced in the last 2 years. As a result of the higher gross margin, Comcast operating profit was $22.6 million or 11.9% of revenue, which compares to $11.5 million or 7.9% of revenue in the prior year. The operating profit is below our targeted range due to seasonal revenue levels and our current investment levels in R&D and selling costs.
Comcast revenues tend to be seasonal, with the June and December quarter ends typically the strongest and the March and September quarter ends being lower. As previously noted, our targeted Comcast operating model is for operating margins of 20% to 23% when quarterly revenues are greater than $215 million. Our operating expenses for the Comcast segment are currently above the targeted range as a percentage of revenue as we continue to invest in products for mobile, video and ethernet backhaul. We are expanding our sales presence in high-growth markets also such as Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia.
As part of this investment focus, we have started transitioning investment away from certain products that are not hitting our profitability targets. This transition will be completed over the next several quarters that resulted in a restructuring charge of $6.8 million in the fiscal third quarter.
For the advanced optical technologies or AOT segment, fiscal Q3 revenue was $56.8 million, up 3.8% when compared to the prior quarter. We saw revenue increases in our currency, transaction card and thin film businesses. As previously noted, currency products will see demand fluctuate according to the levels of bank note printing needs. Fiscal Q3 gross margin for our AOT business was 48.3%, up slightly from 48% in the prior quarter due to product mix. AOT operating profit for the quarter was $17.9 million or 31.5% of revenue, slightly below our operating profit target range of 32% to 35%.
As a reminder, JDSU's total company targeted operating margin range is 14% to 17% when quarterly revenues are $460 million or greater and gross margins are 49% or higher. Also, JDSU's revenues are impacted by seasonal buying patterns of our customers. The March and September quarter revenues tend to be lower than the December and June quarter revenues.
Carrier buying patterns impact the December and March quarter, while EMEA customer buying patterns impact the September quarter.
Moving to the balance sheet. For fiscal Q3 2011, the company generated $52.9 million of cash from operations. Capital expenditures totaled approximately $34.2 million. At the end of fiscal Q3, the company held over $700 million in total cash and short-term investments. Headcount as of April 2, 2011, was 5,028. 
Now to our Q4 guidance. First, some points to consider as you think about our financial performance over the coming quarter. Based on our current visibility, we expect Comcast revenues to grow sequentially between 6% and 13%, AOT revenues to be down sequentially 2% to 4% and CCOP revenues to be down 2% to 4% sequentially. Operating expenses are expected to increase up to $4 million to $5 million sequentially, primarily to increase investment in R&D and selling costs. Comcast operating margins are estimated to be between 14% and 17% due to higher revenue. AOT operating margins are expected to be between 28% and 30% due to lower revenue and CCOP operating margins are expected to decline by approximately 1 percentage point due to increased R&D investment. Taxes, interest and other income are expected to result in a net expense of $6 million to $7 million. Share count for calculating earnings per share is expected to be approximately 237 million shares. Capital equipment purchases will be between 4% and 5% of revenue, as we continue to invest in expanding our manufacturing and test capacity for AOT and optical communications products.
Taking into consideration the factors above and based on our current visibility, we expect fourth quarter revenue to be between $455 million and $475 million and our non-GAAP operating margin to be between 11.5% and 13.5%. I will now turn the call back to Tom."

I will start with the CCOP segment, first optical communications. The strength in revenue was driven primarily by growth in ROADMs, tunables, circuit packs, which includes our Super Transport Blade, pluggables, as well as gesture recognition products. Our customers are clearly recognizing our technology leadership and we believe we are gaining market share across the majority of our customer base.
Revenue from products introduced within the last 2 years accounted for 65% of total revenue in fiscal Q3. We expect our new product revenue to continue to grow in the near term. Tunable XFPs grew by over 35% sequentially and accounted for over 13% of total optical communications revenue. Our penetration across the customer base is strong, having shipped to 37 customers, many with multiple applications. We believe demand will remain strong as customers continue to design the tunable XFP into more applications within their optical network. We continue to ship our second-generation tunable XFPs, replacing 300 pin transponders in the regional and long-haul market. This quarter, we began revenue shipments into the new application to 4 major customers. Our tunable XFP portfolio is the broadest in the market and we expect to continue to expand on it.
ROADM revenue grew over 20% sequentially, represents 35% of total optical revenue. Our Super Transport Blade revenue grew over 37% sequentially. Given the strength across our ROADM portfolio, we believe we continue to gain market share. We expect that the demand for ROADM products will continue to grow over the long term. We may see some ebb and flow on a quarterly basis depending on specific network build-outs over the next view quarters.
This longer-term growth is expected in the core of the network as dynamic bandwidth requirements drive the need for flexibility and then low ROADM to address the steady demand for applications in metro were few reports are required. We also expect to see growth in ROADM's moving out to the edge of the network, although full-scale adoption is likely to be 1 to 2 years out. Through close collaboration with our customers, we are seeing strong demand for our were 40 and 100 gigabit products. This quarter, we announced the release of new 40G and 100G optical components. Our ability to leverage in-house fabrication capability in India and phosphide, gallium arsenide DSPs and lithium materials enables high-performance and cost comparative across these various data formats and data rates. This, in turn, allows the service providers to deploy 40G and 100G optical links in a cost-effective manner wherever increased bandwidth is required in the network. 
We continue to gain traction in gesture recognition. The total revenue in the company continues to be less than 4% of JDSU revenue. We are currently working with over 5 customers to expand the application of gesture recognition technology. The market is still in its infancy but the potential new markets include further gaming applications, multimedia living room applications and portable applications such as gesture recognition on notebooks.
We have confidence in the optical market as drivers remain strong but as noted by our guidance, current demand from our customers is choppy in the short term as lead times decline and network equipment manufacturing inventories are being renewed to align with the end customer demand. We still see strong growth in the optical market but in the near term, we expect some slowdown in growth.
Now turning to our lasers business within the CCOP segment. We saw an 8.8% increase in lasers revenue due to strength in our Q series, solid-state laser for LED, semiconductor and micromachining applications. Traction with our partner, Amada, remains very strong. The recently launched fiber laser incorporated into the Amada laser cutting system for material processing applications enables up to 3 times faster processing speed on thick as materials as compared to traditional CO2 laser technologies. We are shipping in low volumes and are on track to be in full production by September quarter, if not sooner. 
In March, we announced our plans to develop a second-generation suite of kilowatt fiber lasers with Amada. We are also developing a new fiber-based class of pulsed lasers that enable faster and more accurate micromachining materials and cutting and marketing applications. We expect first revenue for these new lasers to start during the second half of fiscal 2012.
Now moving onto the Comcast segment. The overall solid performance in Comcast demonstrates our global market leadership and reflects our alignment with our customers as they look to improve the quality of service and reduce operating expenses in their increasingly complex and higher speed networks, especially in the fast-growing areas of video and mobility. I will discuss these 2 areas in more detail.
Mobile traffic continues to grow on 2G and 3G networks and we see growth in LTE, although we believe that we are still in the early stages for this market. According to the Global Mobile Suppliers Association, there are 140 LTE commitments across 56 countries with 17 LTE networks currently deployed. Our products for drive test, protocol test and realtime session rates are being utilized for early deployment hand in the lab and in the field.
This calendar year we expect to see more operators moving from 3 predeployment testing to larger networks service assurance. A unique end-to-end LTE solution puts us in a position of strength with our customers to capitalize in all 3 of these stages. During Q3, we reported revenue for LTE Test and new and existing customers across all geographies. For LTE projects, we currently are working with approximately 42 customers on protocol test, 25 customers on drive test and 12 customers for service assurance.
In Q3, we also announced that CFL, Hong Kong's largest mobile communications operator, selected JDSU's access LTE service assurance solutions to support their LTE network deployment. JDSU is being recognized in the industry for our LTE product. We earned the Internet Telephony Product of the Year for our signaling analyzer realtime or SART LTE test solution. SART Improves performance monitoring and helps ensure network quality.
Video continues to dominate network traffic and according to third-party it is expected to be 90% of consumer traffic by 2014. Our revenue is driven by this dramatic increase both wireline and wireless as our customers need to manage quality of service and reduce costs. As a result, T1 carriers worldwide are taking advantage of our end-to-end video product portfolio. For example, our FastTrak product, which texts trouble to the street address level grew revenue 33% year-on-year. Our Home Performance management product, which extends quality of services visibility into the home, has helped the European carrier gain a 2.5x better than expected improvement in operating costs. Our HSD or handheld services testers saw significant revenue growth as we experienced strong demand for copper test, as carriers seek higher speed from copper.
In our test growth was up 24% year-on-year. And finally as previously announced, we were recognized by Frost and Sullivan as the Global Fiber Optic Test Market Leader. The proliferation of tablets, smartphones and other devices, along with rapidly growing video demand is requiring higher speeds in the network. 100G is showing increasing deployment with service providers globally. Our Q3 revenue from 100 G saw 114% growth year-on-year. As 40G and 100G migrate to the field, our presence in the labs positions us with a competitive advantage to earn revenue as these higher speed networks are deployed.
These strong drivers are compelling carriers to spend in order to meet customer demand and manage network growth and complexity. As I mentioned earlier, we don't expect global carrier consolidations to have any short-term impact on our outlook. This quarter we booked 18 deals greater than $1 million each across the globe, including a double-digit multi-million dollar North American deal for NFP services that spans a three-year period. In addition, we are penetrating new accounts, especially in Asia, which includes sales of LTE testing, 100G and drive tests sales for 3G networks. We continue to see a poll from our customers for more intelligent software support system to collect, analyze, predict and recommend actions to address the unprecedented mix of complicated traffic on the network. For example, in Q3 we booked 8 optical network management system deals, illustrating our strength in creating software solutions to provide centralized visibility into fiber networks. 
JDSU's continued focus on collaborative innovation with our customers result in products and features introduced within the last 2 years accounting for over 45% of Comcast's revenue in fiscal Q3. Through collaborative innovation, we released a number of new products as well as product and software upgrade including the following: JDSU's fiber complete test solution for the T bird MTS 4000, which combines the capability of 10 instruments into 1, lowering CapEx and minimizing testing times by 40%. The LNT 600 multi-test port module for the development of next-generation high-capacity network elements, it's a low-cost solution delivering carrier ethernet, optical transport networks and 100G services ensuring the rapid design and verification of network elements. We announced advanced features for our ethernet assurance test solutions that will reduce the turn up for ethernet and mobile backlog networks period by greater than 50%. And the new JDSU FI 60 live fiber identifier, which easily detects the users optical signal without disconnecting fiber or disrupting network traffic.
Our innovation engine is gaining momentum, and we will continue to invest in R&D in order to ensure we continue our leadership position in key market segments. Our remaining segment is advanced optical technologies or AOT. Revenues for the quarter included growth in currencies sales and continued recovery in the transaction market due to an expanding economic recovery. Our new Xuzhou facility which provides a strategic platform for JDSU to grow our optical business is now operational staff and meeting expected financial targets. Operator, we'll now take questions."

I think it does depend on the rollout specific timing of rollout of systems so we also saw our VMI go up to approximately 25% of our total revenue in the quarter, up from about 20% so we are seeing more VMI activity, which gives us better visibility into the market. I think on the guidance with the down 2% to 4%, probably the softest part there would be the ROADMS area, as that's probably the area that has the most inventory potential buildup, less so in tunable XFP and super transport blades as we have a unique position there. I'd say that also China, which has been a strong area for us and we actually did, see growth quarter-on-quarter. In China, they are probably having less specificity around their deployments and a lot closer than they did in previous quarters."

JDSU delivered strong third quarter results with solid financial performance and market share gains. Overall, the end markets for our products remained strong and our collaborative innovation continued to gain momentum with new product introductions. 
In fiscal Q3, we reported revenues of $455.4 million, gross margins of 47.6% and a margin of 12.1%. If we compare the same period a year ago, revenues grew nearly 37%, gross margins grew by 350 basis points and operating income grew by nearly 150%. This is tremendous progress as we continued to execute against our strategy and advanced our overall financial model. 
Our success lies in part with our strategy to operate as a diversified technology company, which allows JDSU, as a whole, the ability to navigate fluctuations that may occur in any one business segment.
I will now address 3 recent events in the market. First, the events in Japan are tragic and have affected the lives of many people. We are thankful that all of our employees in Japan are safe. JDSU  and its employees have contributed to the relief effort and we are committed to helping the people of Japan recover from this unfortunate event. 
While our business saw a very limited impact from the events in Japan during the March quarter, we will continue to monitor the situation closely and we'll work with our suppliers in order to fulfill our customer requirements.
Second, with respect to the consolidations we are seeing in our service provider customers, we do not believe we will see any impact in near-term demand as a result of recent announcements in the sector. We will continue to work closely with our customers and they continue to build out 2G and 3G networks and with the rollouts of 4G and LTE. 
And finally, recent announcements have caused some uncertainty in the Optical Communications market. We do agree that there's a current slowdown in sequential quarterly demand and at some customers, there's an effort to reduce inventory levels. At the same time, we believe market drivers remain strong. 
Our Optical Communications business grew nearly 10% quarter-over-quarter and over 68% year-over-year. Our strategic focus on integrated, differentiated products is working. We are both increasing our customer penetration and taking market share. For example, our ROADM and tunable access fee revenue each grew over 20% sequentially and now represent over 45% of total optical communication revenue. We are not immune to volatility in this market, but our portfolio of broadly accepted innovative products is separating us from our competition.
Now let me hand the call over to Dave, who will take you through the details of our financial performance in Q3 and will discuss our outlook for Q4. Following Dave's remarks, I will provide more details on our results, the trends we are seeing and our strategy moving forward."

Third quarter revenue of $455.4 million was down 4.6% from the prior quarter and up 36.8% when compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Revenues increased sequentially in our CCOP and AOT segments and declined, as expected, in our Comm Test segment due to March quarter seasonality. Book-to-bill for Comm Test, Lasers and AOT were each above 1, while our Optical Communication's book-to-bill was below 1. Book-to-bill for the total company was also below 1. 
Third quarter gross margin was 47.6% of revenue, down from the previous quarter's gross margin of 48.8% and up from third quarter fiscal 2010's gross margin of 44.1%. The third quarter sequential decline in gross margin was primarily due to segment mix. The year-over-year improvement in gross margin was due to improved margins in CCOP and in Comm Test. 
Operating expenses for the third fiscal quarter of $161.9 million were 35.6% of revenue, up slightly from the prior quarter's $159.8 million. The increase in expenses from last quarter was within our stated range and primarily for higher employer payroll taxes and the impact of the weaker dollar on operating expenses.
The fiscal third quarter operating margin for the company was 12.1%, up from 6.6% for the year ago period, primarily due to higher revenues and gross margins. Net income was $51 million or $0.22 per share, which compares to $67 million or $0.29 per share for the second fiscal quarter and $23.2 million or $0.10 per share for the year ago period. 
A detailed reconciliation of our non-GAAP results to our GAAP results is available in today's press release. Our third quarter non-GAAP results exclude, among other items, amortization of acquired technology and other intangibles of $22.3 million, a $10.9 million charge for stock-based compensation and acquisition accounting adjustment to revenue of $1.4 million, restructuring and nonrecurring charges totaling $7.6 million and a $34.9 million tax benefit from the release of a deferred tax valuation allowance for a foreign jurisdiction. 
Including the noted items, the third quarter fiscal 2011 GAAP net income was $38.6 million or $0.16 per share, which compares to a prior year third quarter GAAP net loss of $11.9 million or a loss of $0.05 per share. 
Now looking at quarterly revenue by region. Americas revenue of $208.8 million or 46% of total revenue was down $35.1 million from the prior quarter. The decrease was in Test and Measurement and was due primarily to approximately $20 million of service provided budget flush that was realized in the December quarter in seasonally lower service provided demand. EMEA revenue of $127.2 million or 28% of total revenue was up $5.7 million compared to the prior quarter due primarily to strength in our Optical Communications business and in our AOT segment. Asia-Pacific revenue was $119.4 million or 26% of total revenue, up $7.6 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to higher demand for Optical Communications products.
Moving to the segments. In the CCOP segment, the breakout of key metrics for Optical Communications and Lasers is as follows: Optical Communications revenue in fiscal Q3 was $184.7 million, up 9.7% when compared to the prior quarter's revenue of 68.1% when compared to the prior year. We saw particular strength in ROADMs, circuit packs and tunable XFPs. All of the geographic regions grew sequentially. Quarterly ASP decline was 3.9%, which was below our expectations. Gross margin for the quarter was 32.9%, flat with the prior quarter and within our target range of 30% to 35%. 
During the quarter, we continued to increase our test capacity for a number of our products which allowed us to expand our VMI portfolio for 2 major customers and reduce our product lead times. In our Lasers business, third quarter revenue of $24.7 million was up 8.8% when compared to the prior quarter and up 31.9% compared to the prior year due to the demand for our solid-state lasers used in semiconductor, LED and micromachining applications. Gross margins were 46.8%, up from the prior quarter. 
Total CCOP revenue was $209.4 million, up 9.6% from the prior quarter. Gross margin was 34.6% and operating income was $39.6 million or 18.9% of revenue. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to higher revenue. Our sustainable targeted CCOP operating model as operating margins of 16% to 20% on revenues are above $190 million on a quarterly basis.
Now moving on to our Comm Test segment. As a reminder, the March quarter revenue is typically seasonally lower than the December quarter. As expected, the March quarter revenue of $189.2 million was down 10.5% from December quarter's revenue, after adjusting the December quarter revenue for $20 million of calendar year end customer budget flush. 
On a year-over-year basis, third quarter revenue was up 29.9% from the prior fiscal year. Q3 organic revenue growth, which excludes revenue from the NSD products and from third party complementary products, was up 15% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, Asia-Pacific revenues grew modestly while EMEA and the Americas revenues declined primarily due to seasonality.
Fiscal Q3 gross margin for Comm Test of 61.9% exceeded our targeted range of 57% to 61% and increased by 700 basis points from the prior year's Q3 gross margin of 54.9%. The gross margin improvement was driven by revenue from the NSD acquisition, which was completed after fiscal Q3 last year and from favorable product mix as 45% of Comm Test revenue came from products introduced in the last 2 years. 
As a result of the higher gross margin, Comm Test operating profit was $22.6 million or 11.9% of revenue, which compares to $11.5 million or 7.9% of revenue in the prior year. The operating profit is below our targeted range due to seasonal revenue levels and our current investment levels in R&D and selling costs.
Comm Test revenues tend to be seasonal, with the June and December quarter-ends typically the strongest and the March and September quarter-ends being lower. As previously noted, our targeted Comm Test operating model is for operating margins of 20% to 23% when quarterly revenues are greater than $215 million. 
Our operating expenses for the Comm Test segment are currently above the targeted range, as a percentage of revenue, as we continue to invest in products for mobile, video and ethernet backhaul. We are expanding our sales presence in high-growth markets also such as Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia.
As part of this investment focus, we have started transitioning investment away from certain products that are not hitting our profitability targets. This transition will be completed over the next several quarters and resulted in a restructuring charge of $6.8 million in the fiscal third quarter.
For the Advanced Optical Technologies or AOT segment, fiscal Q3 revenue was $56.8 million, up 3.8% when compared to the prior quarter. We saw revenue increases in our Transaction Card and Thin Film businesses. As previously noted, currency products will see demand fluctuate according to the level of bank note printing needs. 
Fiscal Q3 gross margin for our AOT business was 48.3%, up slightly from 48% in the prior quarter due to product mix. AOT operating profit for the quarter was $17.9 million or 31.5% of revenue, slightly below our operating profit target range of 32% to 35%.
As a reminder, JDSU's total company targeted operating margin range is 14% to 17% when quarterly revenues are $460 million or greater, and gross margins are 49% or higher. Also, JDSU's revenues are impacted by seasonal buying patterns of our customers. The March and September quarter revenues tend to be lower than the December and June quarter revenues.
Carrier buying patterns impact the December and March quarters, while EMEA customer buying patterns impact the September quarter.
Moving to the balance sheet. For fiscal Q3 2011, the company generated $52.9 million of cash from operations. Capital expenditures totaled approximately $34.2 million. At the end of fiscal Q3, the company held over $700 million in total cash and short-term investments. Headcount as of April 2, 2011, was 5,028. 
Now to our Q4 guidance. First, some points to consider as you think about our financial performance over the coming quarter. Based on our current visibility, we expect Comm Test revenues to grow sequentially between 6% and 13%, AOT revenues to be down sequentially 2% to 4% and CCOP revenues to be down 2% to 4% sequentially. 
Operating expenses are expected to increase up to $4 million to $5 million sequentially, primarily for increased investment in R&D and selling costs. Comm Test operating margins are estimated to be between 14% and 17% due to higher revenue. AOT operating margins are expected to be between 28% and 30% due to lower revenue and CCOP operating margins are expected to decline by approximately 1 percentage point due to increased R&D investment. 
Taxes, interests and other income are expected to result in a net expense of $6 million to $7 million. Share count for calculating earnings per share is expected to be approximately 237 million shares. Capital equipment purchases will be between 4% and 5% of revenue, as we continue to invest in expanding our manufacturing and test capacity for AOT and Optical Communications products.
Taking into consideration the factors above and based on our current visibility, we expect fourth quarter revenue to be between $455 million and $475 million and our non-GAAP operating margin to be between 11.5% and 13.5%. 
I will now turn the call back to Tom."

I will start with the CCOP segment. First, Optical Communications. The strength in revenue was driven primarily by growth in ROADMs, tunables, circuit packs, which includes our Super Transport Blade, pluggables, as well as gesture recognition products. Our customers are clearly recognizing our technology leadership, and we believe we are gaining market share across the majority of our customer base.
Revenue from products introduced within the last 2 years accounted for 65% of total revenue in fiscal Q3. We expect our new product revenue to continue to grow in the near term. Tunable XFPs grew by over 35% sequentially and accounted for over 13% of total Optical Communications revenue. Our penetration across the customer base is strong, having shipped to 37 customers, many with multiple applications. We believe demand will remain strong as customers continue to design the tunable XFP into more applications within their optical network. 
We continue to ship our second generation tunable XFPs, replacing 300 pin transponders in the regional and long-haul markets. This quarter, we began revenue shipments into the new application at 4 major customers. Our tunable XFP portfolio is the broadest in the market and we expect to continue to expand on it.
ROADM revenue grew over 20% sequentially, and represents 35% of total Optical revenue. Our Super Transport Blade revenue grew over 37% sequentially. Given the strength across our ROADM portfolio, we believe we continue to gain market share. We expect that the demand for ROADM products will continue to grow over the long term. We may see some ebb and flow on a quarterly basis depending on specific network build-outs over the next view quarters.
This longer-term growth is expected in the core of the network as dynamic bandwidth requirements drive the need for flexibility and then low-port-count ROADMs to address the steady demand for applications in metro were fewer ports are required. We also expect to see growth in ROADMs moving out to the edge of the network, although full-scale adoption is likely to be 1 to 2 years out. 
Through close collaboration with our customers, we are seeing strong demand for our 40- and 100-gigabit products. This quarter, we announced the release of new 40G and 100G optical components. Our ability to leverage in-house fabrication capability in indium phosphide, gallium arsenide TLCs and lithium niobate materials enables high performance and cost comparative components solutions across these various data formats and data rates. This, in turn, allows the service providers to deploy 40G and 100G optical links in a cost-effective manner wherever increased bandwidth is required in the network. 
We continue to gain traction in gesture recognition. The total revenue for the company continues to be less than 4% of JDSU revenue. We are currently working with over 5 customers to expand the application of gesture recognition technology. The market is still in its infancy, but the potential new markets include further gaming applications, multimedia living room applications and portable applications such as gesture recognition on notebooks.
We have confidence in the optical market as drivers remain strong, but as noted by our guidance, current demand from our customers is choppy in the short term as lead times decline and network equipment manufacturing inventories are being renewed to align with the end-customer demand. We still see strong growth in the optical market, but in the near term, we expect some slowdown in growth.
Now turning to our Lasers business within the CCOP segment. We saw an 8.8% increase in Lasers revenue due to strength in our Q series, solid-state laser for LED, semiconductor and micromachining applications. Traction with our partner, Amada, remains very strong. The recently launched 4-kilowatt fiber laser incorporated into the Amada laser cutting system for material processing applications enables up the 3x faster processing speed on thick materials as compared to traditional CO2 laser technologies. We are shipping in low volumes and are on track to be in full production by September quarter, if not sooner. 
In March, we announced our plans to develop a second generation suite of kilowatt fiber lasers with Amada. We are also developing a new fiber-based class of pulse lasers that enable faster and more accurate micromachining materials in cutting and marketing applications. We expect first revenue for these new lasers to start during the second half of fiscal 2012.
Now moving on to the Comm Test segment. The overall solid performance in Comm Test demonstrates our global market leadership and reflects our alignment with our customers as they look to improve the quality of service and reduce operating expenses in their increasingly complex and higher speed networks, especially in the fast-growing areas of video and mobility. I will discuss these 2 areas in more detail.
Mobile traffic continues to grow on 2G and 3G networks and we see growth in LTE, although we believe that we are still in the early stages for this market. According to the Global mobile Suppliers Association, there are 140 LTE commitments across 56 countries with 17 LTE networks currently deployed. Our products for drive test, protocol test and realtime session trays are being utilized for early deployment in the lab and in the field.
This calendar year, we expect to see more operators moving from predeployment testing to launching networks followed by service assurance. A unique end-to-end LTE solution puts us in a position of strength with our customers to capitalize in all 3 of these stages. 
During Q3, we reported revenue for LTE test in new and existing customers across all geographies. For LTE projects, we currently are working with approximately 42 customers on protocol test, 25 customers on drive test and 12 customers for service assurance.
In Q3, we also announced that CSL, Hong Kong's largest mobile communications operator, selected JDSU's accessLTE service assurance solutions to support their LTE network deployment. JDSU is being recognized in the industry for our LTE product. We earned the INTERNET TELEPHONY Product of the Year for our Signaling Analyzer Real Time or SART LTE test solution. SART improves performance monitoring and helps ensure network quality.
Video continues to dominate network traffic and according to third party it is expected to be 90% of consumer traffic by 2014. Our revenue is driven by this dramatic increase in video traffic both wireline and wireless, as our customers need to manage quality of service and reduce costs. As a result, T1 carriers worldwide are taking advantage of our end-to-end video product portfolio. For example, our PathTrack product, which detects trouble to the street address level grew revenue 33% year-on-year. Our Home Performance Management product, which extends quality of services visibility into the home, has helped the European carrier gain a 2.5x better-than-expected improvement in operating costs. Our HST or Handheld Services Testers saw significant revenue growth as we experienced strong demand for copper test, as carriers seek higher speed from copper. And our Q fiber[ph] growth was up 24% year-on-year. And finally as previously announced, we were recognized by Frost & Sullivan as the Global Fiber Optic Test Market Leader. 
The proliferation of tablets, smartphones and other devices, along with rapidly growing video demand is requiring higher speeds in the network. 100G is showing increasing deployment with service providers globally. Our Q3 revenue from 100G saw 114% growth year-on-year. As 40G and 100G migrate to the field, our presence in the labs positions us with a competitive advantage to earn revenue as these higher speed networks are deployed.
These strong drivers are compelling carriers to spend in order to meet customer demand and manage network growth and complexity. As I mentioned earlier, we don't expect global carrier consolidations to have any short term impact on our outlook. This quarter we booked 18 deals greater than $1 million each across the globe, including a double-digit multi-million dollar North American deal for NSD services that spans a 3-year period. 
In addition, we are penetrating new accounts, especially in Asia, which includes sales of SART LTE testing, 100G and drive tests sales for 3G networks. We continue to see a poll from our customers for more intelligent software support system to collect, analyze, predict and recommend actions to address the unprecedented mix of complicated traffic on the network. For example in Q3, we booked 8 optical network management system deals, illustrating our strength in creating software solutions to provide centralized visibility into fiber networks. 
JDSU's continued focus on collaborative innovation with our customers result in products and features introduced within the last 2 years accounting for over 45% of Comm Test's revenue in fiscal Q3. Through collaborative innovation, we released a number of new products as well as product and software upgrade including the following: JDSU's fiber complete test solution for the T-BERD MTS 4000, which combines the capabilities of 10 instruments into one, lowering CapEx and minimizing testing time by 40%. The ONT-600 Multi-Port Test Module for the development of next-generation high-capacity optical network elements, it's a low-cost solution delivering carrier ethernet, optical transport networks and 100G services ensuring the rapid design and verification of network elements. 
We announced advanced features for our ethernet assurance test solutions that will reduce the turn-up time for ethernet and mobile backlog networks by greater than 50%. And the new JDSU FI-60 Live Fiber Identifier, which easily detects the users' optical signal without disconnecting fiber or disrupting network traffic.
Our innovation engine is gaining momentum, and we will continue to invest in R&D in order to ensure we continue our leadership position in key market segments. Our remaining segment is Advanced Optical Technologies or AOT. Revenues for the quarter included growth in currencies, thin films and continued recovery in the transaction product market due to an expanding economic recovery. 
Our new Suzhou facility, which provides a strategic platform for JDSU to grow our Optical Coatings business is now operational, staffed and meeting expected financial targets.

It's not a cost to our entire customer base and I think it does depend, as we mentioned in the earnings script portion of this. I think it does depend on the rollout, specific timing of rollout of systems so we also saw our VMI go up to approximately 25% of our total revenue in the quarter, up from about 20%, so we are seeing more VMI activity, which gives us better visibility into the market. I think on the guidance with the down 2% to 4%, probably the softest part there would be the ROADMS area, as that's probably the area that has the most inventory potential buildup, less so in tunable XFP and Super Transport Blad as we have a unique position there. I'd say that also China, which has been a strong area for us and we actually did see growth quarter-on-quarter. In China, they're probably having more specificity around their deployments and viewing them a lot closer than they did maybe in the previous quarters."

So we believe that, that will continue to go in the right direction for us as far as the demand drivers. And also we believe we're growing market share as we've mentioned in the earnings call. So between having remaining strong drivers, having the right products I think lining up for the needs of our agility in the network and then also taking market share. We see a very strong future for our total business."

JDSU delivered strong third quarter results with solid financial performance and market share gains. Overall, the end markets for our products remained strong and our collaborative innovation continued to gain momentum with new product introductions. 
In fiscal Q3, we reported revenues of $455.4 million, gross margins of 47.6% and a [indiscernible] margin of 12.1%. If we compare the same period a year ago, revenues grew nearly 37%, gross margins grew by 350 basis points and operating income grew by nearly 150%. This is tremendous progress as we continue to execute against our strategy and advance our overall financial model. 
Our success lies in part with our strategy to operate as a diversified technology company, which allows JDSU, as a whole, the ability to navigate fluctuations that may occur in any one business segment.
I will now address 3 recent events in the market. First, the events in Japan are tragic and have affected the lives of many people. We are thankful that all of our employees in Japan are safe. JDSU  and its employees have contributed to the relief effort and we are committed to helping the people of Japan recover from this unfortunate event. 
While our business saw a very limited impact from the events in Japan during the March quarter, we will continue to monitor the situation closely and we'll work with our suppliers in order to fulfill our customer requirements.
Second, with respect to the consolidations we are seeing in our service provider customers, we do not believe we will see any impact in near-term demand as a result of recent announcements in the sector. We will continue to work closely with our customers as they continue to build out 2G and 3G networks and with the rollouts of 4G and LTE. 
And finally, recent announcements have caused some uncertainty in the Optical Communications market. We do agree that there's a current slowdown in sequential quarterly demand and at some customers, there's an effort to reduce inventory levels. At the same time, we believe market drivers remain strong. 
Our Optical Communications business grew nearly 10% quarter-over-quarter and over 68% year-over-year. Our strategic focus on integrated, differentiated products is working. We are both increasing our customer penetration and taking market share. For example, our ROADM and Tunable XFP revenue each grew over 20% sequentially and now represent over 45% of total optical communication revenue. We are not immune to volatility in this market, but our portfolio of broadly accepted innovative products is separating us from our competition.
Now let me hand the call over to Dave, who will take you through the details of our financial performance in Q3 and will discuss our outlook for Q4. Following Dave's remarks, I will provide more detail on our results, the trends we are seeing and our strategy moving forward."

Before I start, please note that all numbers are non-GAAP, unless I state otherwise.Third quarter revenue of $455.4 million was down 4.6% from the prior quarter and up 36.8% when compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Revenues inc",1584,"Thank you, Tom. Before I start, please note that all numbers are non-GAAP, unless I state otherwise.
Third quarter revenue of $455.4 million was down 4.6% from the prior quarter and up 36.8% when compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Revenues increased sequentially in our CCOP and AOT segments and declined, as expected, in our Comm Test segment due to March quarter seasonality. Book-to-bill for Comm Test, Lasers and AOT were each above 1, while Optical Communication's book-to-bill was below 1. Book-to-bill for the total company was also below 1. 
Third quarter gross margin was 47.6% of revenue, down from the previous quarter's gross margin of 48.8% and up from third quarter fiscal 2010's gross margin of 44.1%. The third quarter sequential decline in gross margin was primarily due to segment mix. The year-over-year improvement in gross margin was due to improved margins in CCOP and in Comm Test. 
Operating expenses for the third fiscal quarter of $161.9 million were 35.6% of revenue, up slightly from the prior quarter's $159.8 million. The increase in expenses from last quarter was within our stated range and primarily for higher employer payroll taxes and the impact of the weaker dollar on operating expenses.
The fiscal third quarter operating margin for the company was 12.1%, up from 6.6% for the year ago period, primarily due to higher revenues and gross margins. Net income was $51 million or $0.22 per share, which compares to $67 million or $0.29 per share for the second fiscal quarter and $23.2 million or $0.10 per share for the year ago period. 
A detailed reconciliation of our non-GAAP results to our GAAP results is available in today's press release. Our third quarter non-GAAP results exclude, among other items, amortization of acquired technology and other intangibles of $22.3 million; a $10.9 million charge for stock-based compensation; an acquisition accounting adjustment to revenue of $1.4 million; restructuring and nonrecurring charges totaling $7.6 million; and a $34.9 million tax benefit from the release of a deferred tax valuation allowance for a foreign jurisdiction. 
Including the noted items, the third quarter fiscal 2011 GAAP net income was $38.6 million or $0.16 per share, which compares to a prior year third quarter GAAP net loss of $11.9 million or a loss of $0.05 per share. 
Now looking at quarterly revenue by region. Americas revenue of $208.8 million or 46% of total revenue was down $35.1 million from the prior quarter. The decrease was in Test and Measurement and was due primarily to approximately $20 million of service provider budget flush that was realized in the December quarter and seasonally lower service provider demand. EMEA revenue of $127.2 million or 28% of total revenue was up $5.7 million compared to the prior quarter due primarily to strength in our Optical Communications business and in our AOT segment. Asia-Pacific revenue was $119.4 million or 26% of total revenue, up $7.6 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to higher demand for Optical Communications products.
Moving to the segments. In the CCOP segment, the breakout of key metrics for Optical Communications and Lasers is as follows: Optical Communications revenue in fiscal Q3 was $184.7 million, up 9.7% when compared to the prior quarter's revenue and up 68.1% when compared to the prior year. We saw particular strength in ROADMs, circuit packs and tunable XFPs. All of the geographic regions grew sequentially. Quarterly ASP decline was 3.9%, which was below our expectations. Gross margin for the quarter was 32.9%, flat with the prior quarter and within our target range of 30% to 35%. 
During the quarter, we continued to increase our test capacity for a number of our products which allowed us to expand our VMI portfolio for 2 major customers and reduce our product lead times. In our Lasers business, third quarter revenue of $24.7 million was up 8.8% when compared to the prior quarter and up 31.9% compared to the prior year due to the demand for our solid-state lasers used in semiconductor, LED and micromachining applications. Gross margins were 46.8%, up from the prior quarter. 
Total CCOP revenue was $209.4 million, up 9.6% from the prior quarter. Gross margin was 34.6% and operating income was $39.6 million or 18.9% of revenue. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to higher revenue. Our sustainable targeted CCOP operating model has operating margins of 16% to 20% when revenues are above $190 million on a quarterly basis.
Now moving on to our Comm Test segment. As a reminder, the March quarter revenue is typically seasonally lower than the December quarter. As expected, the March quarter revenue of $189.2 million was down 10.5% from December quarter's revenue, after adjusting the December quarter revenue for $20 million of calendar year end customer budget flush. 
On a year-over-year basis, third quarter revenue was up 29.9% from the prior fiscal year. Q3 organic revenue growth, which excludes revenue from the NSD product and from third party complementary product, was up 15% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, Asia-Pacific revenues grew modestly while EMEA and the Americas revenues declined primarily due to seasonality.
Fiscal Q3 gross margin for Comm Test of 61.9% exceeded our targeted range of 57% to 61% and increased by 700 basis points from the prior year's Q3 gross margin of 54.9%. The gross margin improvement was driven by revenue from the NSD acquisition, which was completed after fiscal Q3 last year and from favorable product mix as 45% of Comm Test revenue came from products introduced in the last 2 years. 
As a result of the higher gross margin, Comm Test operating profit was $22.6 million or 11.9% of revenue, which compares to $11.5 million or 7.9% of revenue in the prior year. The operating profit is below our targeted range due to seasonal revenue levels and our current investment levels in R&D and selling costs.
Comm Test revenues tend to be seasonal, with the June and December quarter-ends typically the strongest and the March and September quarter-ends being lower. As previously noted, our targeted Comm Test operating model is for operating margins of 20% to 23% when quarterly revenues are greater than $215 million. 
Our operating expenses for the Comm Test segment are currently above the targeted range, as a percentage of revenue, as we continue to invest in products for mobile, video and ethernet backhaul. We are expanding our sales presence in high-growth markets also, such as Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia.
As part of this investment focus, we have started transitioning investment away from certain products that are not hitting our profitability targets. This transition will be completed over the next several quarters and resulted in a restructuring charge of $6.8 million in the fiscal third quarter.
For the Advanced Optical Technologies or AOT segment, fiscal Q3 revenue was $56.8 million, up 3.8% when compared to the prior quarter. We saw revenue increases in our currency, transaction card and thin film businesses. As previously noted, currency products will see demand fluctuate according to the level of bank note printing needs. 
Fiscal Q3 gross margin for our AOT business was 48.3%, up slightly from 48% in the prior quarter due to product mix. AOT operating profit for the quarter was $17.9 million or 31.5% of revenue, slightly below our operating profit target range of 32% to 35%.
As a reminder, JDSU's total company targeted operating margin range is 14% to 17% when quarterly revenues are $460 million or greater, and gross margins are 49% or higher. Also, JDSU's revenues are impacted by seasonal buying patterns of our customers. The March and September quarter revenues tend to be lower than the December and June quarter revenues.
Carrier buying patterns impact the December and March quarters, while EMEA customer buying patterns impact the September quarter.
Moving to the balance sheet. For fiscal Q3 2011, the company generated $52.9 million of cash from operations. Capital expenditures totaled approximately $34.2 million. At the end of fiscal Q3, the company held over $700 million in total cash and short-term investments. Headcount as of April 2, 2011, was 5,028. 
Now to our Q4 guidance. First, some points to consider as you think about our financial performance over the coming quarter. Based on our current visibility, we expect Comm Test revenues to grow sequentially between 6% and 13%, AOT revenues to be down sequentially 2% to 4% and CCOP revenues to be down 2% to 4% sequentially. 
Operating expenses are expected to increase up to $4 million to $5 million sequentially, primarily for increased investment in R&D and selling costs. Comm Test operating margins are estimated to be between 14% and 17% due to higher revenue. AOT operating margins are expected to be between 28% and 30% due to lower revenue and CCOP operating margins are expected to decline by approximately 1 percentage point due to increased R&D investment. 
Taxes, interests and other income are expected to result in a net expense of $6 million to $7 million. Share count for calculating earnings per share is expected to be approximately 237 million shares. Capital equipment purchases will be between 4% and 5% of revenue, as we continue to invest in expanding our manufacturing and test capacity for AOT and Optical Communications products.
Taking into consideration the factors above and based on our current visibility, we expect fourth quarter revenue to be between $455 million and $475 million and our non-GAAP operating margin to be between 11.5% and 13.5%. 
I will now turn the call back to Tom."

I will start with the CCOP segment. First, Optical Communications. The strength in revenue was driven primarily by growth in ROADMs, tunables, circuit packs, which includes our Super Transport Blade, pluggables, as well as gesture recognition products. Our customers are clearly recognizing our technology leadership, and we believe we are gaining market share across the majority of our customer base.
Revenue from products introduced within the last 2 years accounted for 65% of total revenue in fiscal Q3. We expect our new product revenue to continue to grow in the near term. Tunable XFPs grew by over 35% sequentially and accounted for over 13% of total Optical Communications revenue. Our penetration across the customer base is strong, having shipped to 37 customers, many with multiple applications. We believe demand will remain strong as customers continue to design the Tunable XFP into more applications within their optical network. 
We continue to ship our second generation Tunable XFP, replacing 300 pin transponders in the regional and long-haul markets. This quarter, we began revenue shipments into the new applications at 4 major customers. Our Tunable XFP portfolio is the broadest in the market and we expect to continue to expand on it.
ROADM revenue grew over 20% sequentially and represents 35% of total Optical revenue. Our Super Transport Blade revenue grew over 37% sequentially. Given the strength across our ROADM portfolio, we believe we continue to gain market share. We expect that the demand for ROADM products will continue to grow over the long term. We may see some ebb and flow on a quarterly basis depending on specific network build-outs over the next few quarters.
This longer-term growth is expected in the core of the network as dynamic bandwidth requirements drive the need for flexibility and in low-port-count ROADMs to address the steady demand for applications in the metro wbere fewer ports are required. We also expect to see growth in ROADMs moving out to the edge of the network, although full-scale adoption is likely to be 1 to 2 years out. 
Through close collaboration with our customers, we are seeing strong demand for our 40- and 100-gigabit products. This quarter we announced the release of new 40G and 100G optical components. Our ability to leverage in-house fabrication capability in indium phosphide, gallium arsenide TLCs and lithium niobate materials enables high performance and cost comparative component solutions across these various data formats and data rates. This, in turn, allows the service providers to deploy 40G and 100G optical links in a cost-effective manner wherever increased bandwidth is required in the network. 
We continue to gain traction in gesture recognition. The total revenue for the company continues to be less than 4% of JDSU revenue. We are currently working with over 5 customers to expand the application of gesture recognition technology. The market is still in its infancy, but the potential new markets include further gaming applications, multimedia living room applications and portable applications such as gesture recognition on notebooks.
We have confidence in the optical market as drivers remain strong, but as noted by our guidance, current demand from our customers is choppy in the short term as lead times decline and network equipment manufacturing inventories are being renewed to align with the end-customer demand. We still see strong growth in the optical market, but in the near term, we expect some slowdown in growth.
Now turning to our Lasers business within the CCOP segment. We saw an 8.8% increase in Lasers revenue due to strength in our Q series, solid-state laser for LED, semiconductor and micromachining applications. Traction with our partner, Amada, remains very strong. The recently launched 4-kilowatt fiber laser incorporated into the Amada laser cutting system for material processing applications enables up the 3x faster processing speed on thick materials as compared to traditional CO2 laser technologies. We are shipping in low volumes and are on track to be in full production by September quarter, if not sooner. 
In March, we announced our plans to develop a second generation suite of kilowatt fiber lasers with Amada. We are also developing a new fiber-based class of pulse lasers that enable faster and more accurate micromachining materials in cutting and marking applications. We expect first revenue for these new lasers to start during the second half of fiscal 2012.
Now moving on to the Comm Test segment. The overall solid performance in Comm Test demonstrates our global market leadership and reflects our alignment with our customers as they look to improve the quality of service and reduce operating expenses in their increasingly complex and higher speed networks, especially in the fast-growing areas of video and mobility. I will discuss these 2 areas in more detail.
Mobile traffic continues to grow on 2G and 3G networks and we see growth in LTE, although we believe that we are still in the early stages for this market. According to the Global Mobile Suppliers Association, there are 140 LTE commitments across 56 countries with 17 LTE networks currently deployed. Our products for drive test, protocol test and realtime session trays are being utilized for early deployment in the lab and in the field.
This calendar year, we expect to see more operators moving from predeployment testing to launching networks followed by service assurance. Our unique end-to-end LTE solution puts us in a position of strength with our customers to capitalize on all 3 of these stages. 
During Q3, we reported revenue for LTE test in new and existing customers across all geographies. For LTE projects, we currently are working with approximately 42 customers on protocol test, 25 customers on drive test and 12 customers for service assurance.
In Q3, we also announced that CSL, Hong Kong's largest mobile communications operator, selected JDSU's accessLTE service assurance solution to support their LTE network deployment. JDSU is being recognized in the industry for our LTE products. We earned the INTERNET TELEPHONY Product of the Year for our Signaling Analyzer Real Time, or SART, LTE test solution. SART improves performance monitoring and helps ensure network quality.
Video continues to dominate network traffic and, according to third parties, is expected to be 90% of consumer traffic by 2014. Our revenue is driven by this dramatic increase in video traffic both wireline and wireless, as our customers need to manage quality of service and reduce costs. As a result, T1 carriers worldwide are taking advantage of our end-to-end video product portfolio. For example, our PathTrack product, which detects trouble to the street address level grew revenue 33% year-on-year. Our Home Performance Management product, which extends quality of services visibility into the home, has helped the European carrier gain a 2.5x better-than-expected improvement in operating costs. Our HST, or Handheld Services Testers, saw significant revenue growth as we experienced strong demand for copper test, as carriers seek higher speed from copper. And our Q [ph] test growth was up 24% year-on-year. And finally, as previously announced, we were recognized by Frost & Sullivan as the Global Fiber Optic Test Market Leader. 
The proliferation of tablets, smartphones and other devices, along with rapidly growing video demand is requiring higher speeds in the network. 100G is showing increasing deployment with service providers globally. Our Q3 revenue from 100G saw 114% growth year-on-year. As 40G and 100G migrate to the field, our presence in the labs positions us with a competitive advantage to earn revenue as these higher speed networks are deployed.
These strong drivers are compelling carriers to spend in order to meet customer demand and manage network growth and complexity. As I mentioned earlier, we don't expect global carrier consolidation to have any short term impact on our outlook. This quarter we booked 18 deals greater than $1 million each across the globe, including a double-digit multi-million dollar North American deal for NSD services that spans a 3-year period. 
In addition, we are penetrating new accounts, especially in Asia, which include sales of SART LTE testing, 100G and drive tests sales for 3G networks. We continue to see a pull from our customers for more intelligent software support system to collect, analyze, predict and recommend actions to address the unprecedented mix of complicated traffic on the network. For example in Q3, we booked 8 optical network management system deals, illustrating our strength in creating software solutions to provide centralized visibility into fiber networks. 
JDSU's continued focus on collaborative innovation with our customers resulted in products and features introduced within the last 2 years accounting for over 45% of Comm Test's revenue in fiscal Q3. Through collaborative innovation, we released a number of new products as well as product and software upgrade including the following: JDSU's fiber complete test solution for the T-BERD MTS 4000, which combines the capabilities of 10 instruments into one, lowering CapEx and minimizing testing time by 40%; the ONT-600 Multi-Port Test Module for the development of next-generation high-capacity optical network elements. It's a low-cost solution delivering carrier ethernet, optical transport networks and 100G services ensuring the rapid design and verification of network elements. 
We announced advanced features for our ethernet assurance test solutions that will reduce the turn-up time for ethernet and mobile backhaul networks by greater than 50%. And the new JDSU FI-60 Live Fiber Identifier, which easily detects the users' optical signal without disconnecting fiber or disrupting network traffic.
Our innovation engine is gaining momentum, and we will continue to invest in R&D in order to ensure we continue our leadership position in key market segments. Our remaining segment is Advanced Optical Technologies or AOT. Revenues for the quarter included growth in currencies, thin films and continued recovery in the transaction card market due to an expanding economic recovery. 
Our new Suzhou facility, which provides a strategic platform for JDSU to grow our Optical Coatings business is now operational, staffed and meeting expected financial targets.

It's not across our entire customer base and I think it does depend, as we mentioned in the earnings script portion of this, I think it does depend on the rollout, specific timing of rollout of systems. We also saw our VMI go up to approximately 25% of our total revenue in the quarter, up from about 20%, so we are seeing more VMI activity, which gives us better visibility into the market. I think on the guidance with the down 2% to 4%, probably the softest part there would be the ROADMS area, as that's probably the area that has the most inventory potential buildup, less so in Tunable XFP and Super Transport Blade as we have a unique position there. I'd say that also China, which has been a strong area for us and we actually did see growth quarter-on-quarter. In China, they're probably having more specificity around their deployments and viewing them a lot closer than they did maybe in the previous quarters."

I believe the demand is still ahead of the capacity out there in the networks and we all experience that almost day-to-day in our own activities and interfacing on the network. I think this is more of a short-term timing of network build-outs and some inventory build-ins, some specific customers.

JDSU delivered solid fourth quarter results in an uncertain macro economic environment. Revenue of $472 million was at the high end of our guidance range and operating margin of 12.3% was near the midpoint of our range. Gross margins of 46.7% were down less than 1 percentage point from the prior quarter and up more than 1 percentage point from the prior year. Cash generated from operations was $56 million. I am pleased with the business model improvement achieved in fiscal year 2011. From fiscal year 2010 to fiscal year 2011, revenue grew 32%, gross profit was up 40% and operating income increased by over 136%. Throughout fiscal year 2011, we benefited from our collaborative innovation strategy as revenue from new products continued to grow. In fiscal Q4, we achieved record new product revenue with over 71% of Optical Communications revenue and 52% of CommTest revenue generated from products less than 2 years old. Our financial strength continues to provide us with the necessary capital to fund our robust new product pipeline. We generated over $200 million of cash from operations during the fiscal year.
As we look ahead, there are several factors causing some short-term volatility for JDSU: first, our general economic conditions and uncertainties; second, our inventory corrections by our Optical Communications customers; and finally, the September quarter seasonality for our CommTest business segment. We strongly believe that fundamental end market drivers for our products remain strong for the long-term. But as indicated by our guidance, we are not immune to the current macroeconomic challenges, optical inventory corrections for CommTest demand seasonality. We cannot predict exactly how long this downturn will last for us but we do believe it's a near-term issue. During this time, we will remain focused on our winning strategy, including profitability and cash flow generation where we continue to invest in R&D and new product that will further differentiate us in the marketplace.
I'll now hand the call over to Dave, who will take you through the details of our financial performance in Q4 and the fiscal year and will discuss our outlook for Q1. Following Dave's remarks, I will provide more details on our results, the trends we are seeing and our strategy moving forward."

Before I start, please note that all numbers are non-GAAP, unless I state otherwise.Fourth quarter revenue of $472.3 million was up 3.7% in the prior quarter and up 18.6% when compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Revenues incre",1756,"Thank you, Tom. Before I start, please note that all numbers are non-GAAP, unless I state otherwise.
Fourth quarter revenue of $472.3 million was up 3.7% in the prior quarter and up 18.6% when compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Revenues increased sequentially in our CommTest and AOT segments and declined, as expected, in our CCOP segment. Book-to-bill for AOT was greater than 1, CommTest and lasers book-to-bill were approximately 1 while Optical Communications was below 1. Book-to-bill for the company was also below 1.
Fourth quarter gross margin was 46.7% of revenue, down from the previus quarter's gross margin of 47.6% and up from fourth quarter fiscal 2010's gross margin of 45.5%. The fourth quarter sequential decline in gross margin is primarily due to product mix within the segments and lower manufacturing absorption in the optical business. The year-over-year improvement in gross margin was due to improved margins in both the CCOP and the CommTest segments. Operating expenses for the fourth fiscal quarter of $162.3 million were 34.4% of revenue, relatively flat from the prior quarter's $161.9 million. Increased R&D investments were offset by lower G&A spending. The fiscal fourth quarter operating margin for the company was 12.3%, up from 9.3% for the year ago period, primarily due to higher revenues and gross margins. Net income was $53.9 million or $0.23 per share, which compares to $51 million or $0.22 per share for the third fiscal quarter and $33.1 million or $0.15 per share for the year ago period. For the full fiscal year, total revenue was $1.8 billion, up 32.2% from the prior year. Gross margin for the full fiscal year was 47.6%, up from 44.6% for fiscal 2010. Operating income for fiscal 2011 was $230.7 million or 12.7% of revenue, up from 7.1% of revenue for fiscal 2010. Improved operating income is primarily due to increased revenue and gross margins.
Our net income for the year was $216.7 million or $0.93 per share, up from $91.9 million or $0.41 per share for fiscal 2010. A detailed reconciliation of our non-GAAP results from out GAAP results is available in today's press release.
Our fourth quarter non-GAAP operating income excludes, among other items, amortization of acquired technology and other intangibles of $22 million, an $11.5 million charge for stock-based compensation and restructuring and nonrecurring charges totaling $4.5 million. Including the noted items, for fourth quarter fiscal 2011, GAAP net income was $9.3 million or $0.04 per share, which compares to a prior year GAAP net income of $1.5 million or $0.01 per share. For the full fiscal year, GAAP net income was $71.6 million or $0.31 per share, which compares to a GAAP net loss of $61.8 million or a loss of $0.28 per share for fiscal 2010. Now looking at quarterly revenue by region.
Americas revenue of $230.1 million or 49% of total revenue was up $21.2 million from the prior quarter. The increase is due to strength in AOT and in CommTest 2008, as CommTest experienced typical, seasonal demand from service providers. The MDA revenue of $122.5 million or 26% of total revenue was down $4.8 million compared to the prior quarter, due primarily to lower demand in the Optical Communications business. Asia-Pacific revenue was $119.7 million or 25% of total revenue, relatively flat from the prior quarter. An increase in Optical Communications and laser revenues was offset by a slight decline in AOT and CommTest revenues. Now moving to the segments.
First, to the CCOP segment. Total CCOP revenue was $202.3 million, down 3.4% from the prior quarter end within our guidance of down 2% to 4%. Gross margin was 32.8% and operating income was $32.2 million or 15.9% of revenue. The decline in operating profit was primarily due to lower optical revenue and gross margins. Geographically, Asia revenue grew in both our optical and lasers businesses, while the Americas and European revenues declined. Optical Communications revenue in fiscal Q4 was $174.5 million, down 5.5% when compared to the prior quarter's revenue and up 29.5% compared to the prior year. Seven out of 12 product lines grew sequentially. We saw strength in our products for LAN applications, while revenue for ROADMs, circuit packs and Tunable XFPs declined, primarily due to customer inventory corrections. Quarterly ASP decline was 2.1%, which was at the low end of our historical range of 2% to 4% sequentially. Gross margin for the quarter was 31.1%, down from the prior quarter's 32.9% but within our target range of 30% to 35%. Gross margins declined due to product mix and lower overhead absorption.
Additionally, as a result of increased capacity and current demand levels, we have reduced product lead times to 4 weeks to 6 weeks on a majority of our optical products allowing our customers to respond better to their customer requirements. In our lasers business, fourth quarter revenue of $27.8 million was up 12.6% when compared to the prior quarter and up 23% compared to the prior year due to strength in our Q series solid-state lasers and our newly launched 4-kilowatt fiber laser, which is incorporated into an Amada Laser Cutting System for metal processing applications. In the fourth quarter, we recognized approximately $1 million of revenue from our kilowatt fiber laser and we expect this to grow throughout fiscal 2012. Gross margins were 43.4%, down from the prior quarter, primarily due to startup and transfer costs for our kilowatt fiber laser production.
As a reminder, our targeted CCOP operating model is for operating margins of 16% to 20% when revenues are above $190 million.
Now moving on to our CommTest segment.
Fiscal Q4 revenue of $211.3 million was up 11.7% from the March quarter's revenues. On a year-over-year basis, fourth quarter revenue was up 13.5%. Q4 revenue, excluding the products and the third-party complementary products, grew by 10.4%. On a sequential basis, Americas revenue saw strength while our EMEA and Asia-Pacific revenues declined modestly. Fiscal Q4 gross margin for CommTest of 59.3% increased by more than 300 basis points from the prior year's Q4 gross margin of 56.1%. The decline, on a sequential basis, primarily due to product mix and inventory charges. The year-over-year gross margin improvement was driven by favorable product mix, a 62% CommTest revenues product introduced in the last 2 years. Our target range for CommTest gross margin remains at 57% to 61%. CommTest operating profit was $30.4 million or 14.4% of revenues, which compares to $20.5 million or 11% of revenue in the prior year. The operating profit is below our targeted operating model range, due primarily to our current investment levels in R&D and selling costs, which are focused on advancing the business in high-growth regions.
Our targeted CommTest operating model is for operating margins of 20% to 23% when revenues are greater than $215 million. As previously noted, we are transitioning our CommTest investment away from certain products that do not meet our profitability targets, while at the same time continuing to invest in products for mobile, video, wireless and ethernet backhaul. As a result of this transition, we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $4 million in the fourth quarter. We expect our CommTest business to be in the targeted operating model range for the December quarter, provided we meet the revenue and gross margin targets. For the Advanced Optical Technologies or AOT segment, fiscal Q4 revenue was $58.7 million, up 3.3% when compared to the prior quarter. We saw revenue increases in our currency and transaction card businesses. As previously noted, demand for currency products will fluctuate according to the level of bank note printing. Fiscal Q4 gross margin for our AOT business was 49.4%, up from 48.3% in the prior quarter due to favorable product mix. AOT operating profit for the quarter was $20 million or 34.1% of revenue, up from 31.5% for the last quarter. The AOT target operating model operating margin of 32% to for quarterly revenues greater than $55 million.
As a reminder, JDSU's total company targeted operating margin range is 14% to 17% when quarterly revenues for the company are $460 million or greater and gross margins are 49% or higher. Also, JDSU revenues are impacted by the seasonal buying patterns of our customers. The margins September quarter sent to be lower than the December, June quarter revenues. Carrier buying patterns positively impact the December quarter and negatively impact the March quarter, while EMEA customer buying patterns impact the September quarter.
Moving to the balance sheet. For fiscal Q4 2011, the company generated $56 million of cash from operations. Capital expenditures totaled $30.9 million. At the end of fiscal Q4, the company held over $728 million in total cash and short-term investments. Headcount as of July 2, 2011, was 5,001.
Now to our Q1 guidance. First, some points to consider as you think about our financial performance over the coming quarter. Based on our current visibility, we expect normal seasonality to result in CommTest revenues declining sequentially by 12% to 15%. AOT revenues are expected to be down sequentially by 3% to 6%. And although recent bookings trends are improving in our Optical Communications business, CCOP revenues are expected to decline between 10% and 13% sequentially. The reduction in CCOP revenue is approximately evenly split between lower demand for telecom optical products and lower demand for gesture recognition products as some of our customers adjust their inventory levels. Gesture recognition revenue is expected to be less than 2% of total company revenue for the September and December quarters. This compares to recent quarterly revenue of less than 4% of total company revenue. Operating expenses are expected to be down by $3 million to $7 million sequentially. Due to the lower revenues in each segment, CommTest operating margins are estimated to be between 8.5% and 10%. AOT operating margins are expected to be between 30% and 32% and CCOP operating margins are expected to be between 13% and 15%. Access interest and other income are expected to a net expense of $5 million. Share count for calculating EPS is expected to be approximately 236 million shares and capital equipment purchases will be approximately 6% of revenues. Given the current macroeconomic uncertainties and our limited visibility at this point in the quarter, we are providing a broader guidance range for the September quarter. Taking into consideration the factors above, we expect first quarter revenue to be between $400 million and $425 million and our non-GAAP operating margin to be between 7.5% and 9.5%. I will now turn the call back to Tom."

I will start with the CCOP segment. First, Optical Communications. I am extremely pleased with the accomplishments of this business. On a year-over-year basis, fiscal Q4 revenue increased approximately 30%. Gross margins improved by nearly 3 percentage points and operating margins improved by over 4 percentage points. We continue to grow market share with our product portfolio offerings to support growth enterprise and telecom customers. Our achievements are a result of our technology leadership in ROADM, including our Super Transport Blades and Tunable XFP and gesture recognition products, where we are significantly ahead of our competitors. We expect that in FY12, our customers will qualify second sources for some of these products. It is important to note, however, that we have negotiated long-term share agreements with a number of customers for our Tunable XFP and we have one significant customer for our Super Transport Blade. We expect that as the total available market extends for these products, we will continue to benefit. Most importantly, we believe our continued investment in technology and expansion of our product portfolio will keep us ahead of the competition. Currently, the optical market is facing a short-term inventory correction. We still see strength in the drivers for optical products but in the near term, we will experience a slowdown in demand.
Tunable XFPs revenue declined 6% quarter-over-quarter and grew by over 300% year-over-year. Our penetration across the customer base is strong, having shipped to 41 customers to date, up from 37 customers last quarter. We believe demand will remain strong for the long-term as customers continue to design Tunable XFP for more applications within their optical network.
Our tunable XFP portfolio is the broadest in the market and we expect to continue to expand on it. This quarter, we will release an even higher performance variant, targeted for 2 key customers. Just yesterday, we announced that JDSU has developed the first Tunable XFP plus transceiver designed to replace Wavelength XFP plus transceivers in the enterprise and Metro networks. The tunable XFP plus will allow network operators increased flexibility to optimize the performance of the network and will ease the cost of holding expensive inventory required with current fixed Wavelength XFP product. In addition, due to a smaller form factor and reduced power consumption, it increases the density of transmission parts. We are very excited about this new market opportunity, which Infonetics estimates to be $300 million in 2012. It is expected to continue growing rapidly as enterprise and metro networks are optimized to be growing bandwidth demands. Being first to market, we expect will give JDSU a competitive advantage similar to the advantage we have with the ROADMs, Super Transport Blade and Tunable XFP. We expect to have the product introduction in the next 12 months.
ROADM revenue represented 28% of total Optical Communications revenue for fiscal Q4. Our growth in this product area was significant for the full year, growing over 100% from fiscal 2010. Despite short-term inventory timing issues, long-term growth is expected to continue for ROADM products as carriers upgrade their networks to include better wavelength provisioning functionality.
JDSU is currently working with the customers to support next-generation collarless, directionless and contentionless technology with the ROADM-based networks. Our MEMS solution serve the current market well today. For future applications beyond 100V, we're building on existing JDSU skills to produce L-cost-based products as well. We believe that with both MEMS and L cost base product portfolios, we will have solutions for diverse requirements of future networks. We will have the broadest ROADM portfolio to meet the needs of our customers today and in the future as networks demand both low-cost and high flexibility. Over the last few quarters, we announced the release of new 40G and 100G optical components. We continue to gain traction on 40G short and long-reach noncoherent components, as well as components for 40G. customers, who have developed their own. Strong product roadmap for high-performance 40G modules that we will launch in calendar 2012. For 40G and 100G applications, we currently have 16 design wins and 20 more in process with 17 customers. Revenue from gesture recognition grew 8.5% quarter-over-quarter, as our customers completed it's necessary inventory build-ahead for the holiday buying season. As a result, we saw a positive booking for Q4 and consequently revenue in Q1 to decline significantly. The total just revenue continue to be less than 4% of JDSU's revenue in Q4.
Now I'll turn to our lasers business within the CCOP segment. We continue to see strength in our lasers business with 12.6% revenue growth quarter-over-quarter and 23% growth year-over-year due to strength in our Q series state lasers and our newly launched 4-kilowatt fiber laser incorporated into the Amada Laser Cutting System for metal processing applications. This new laser enables up to 3x faster processing speeds as compared to traditional CO2 laser technology. Due to strong and customer interest, we are working with Amada to expand manufacturing capacity for this product. We are also developing a second-generation suite of kilowatt fiber lasers with Amada and we are also developing a new fiber-based class of pulse lasers expected to ship during the second half of fiscal 2012. We continue to make progress in developing our concentrated photovoltaic or CTV cell technology for large-scale solar power applications. In July, we announced the acquisition of important technology assets from This technology allows more light to be converted to electrical power by raising the efficiency of CPG sales, the most important metric in the solar industry. Leveraging this technology will enable JDSU to further differentiate our product and expand our position in the CPV solar market as popularity for CPV gross.
Now I'll go on to our CommTest segment. CommTest delivered solid financial performance in Q4 FY '11 reflecting the ongoing challenge your customers are encountering to add millions of broadband subscribers to the network and therefore, the need for our field service tools for service activation and troubleshooting. Infonetics forecast broadband subscribers to grow from $1 billion in 2010 to $2.9 billion by 2015. This trend is evidenced by our growth in field-test instruments by 24% quarter-over-quarter and 17% growth year-over-year and in representing nearly 61% of overall CommTest revenues. In the cable market, Infonetics estimates that over 100 million  homes worldwide have DOCSIS 3.0 service available, yet only 1% to 2% of the homes have subscribed to date. Even in the early stages of this rollout, we delivered strong results in the quarter with revenue from our DOCSIS 3.0 rollout growing 14% quarter-on-quarter to 29% year-on-year.
During the quarter, we also saw increased carrier spending on IP video projects. Gardner forecast IPTV subscribers to grow from 35 million to 75 million for 2014. Because testing for bonded payers is essential for IPTV Rolfs, we introduced the first-to-market bonded combination DSL test solution. Infonetics also forecasted fiber-to-the-home subscribers will grow from 33 million in 2010 to 98 million in 2015 with net addition rates increasing each year. Once again, our fiber optic field-tested business delivered strong results with 23% growth quarter-on-quarter and 39% year-on-year. Our leadership in this area is confirmed as Roth and Sullivan have recognized JDSU as the global leader for private content with 24% market share.
As more broadband subscribers are added, video traffic is growing exponentially and is expected that 90% of consumer traffic by 2014. Tier 1 carriers took advantage of our expertise during the quarter, with growth in our fiber and asset test businesses as I mentioned earlier. We also made strong progress in other areas supporting video test. Our abstract remains, which offers significant labor savings for carriers by detecting troubles at the street level rather than the node, with over Q4 revenue growth of 40% quarter-on-quarter and 43% year-on-year. In addition, we added over 20 deals to our pipelines in Q4 for Home PM, which extends quality of visibility service into the home.
The current customer in Europe already reports Home PM is driving CapEx savings at a rate that is 2.5x greater than anticipated. Another spending priority for our customers remains mobility. LTE standards remain an investment priority for carriers as. It's expected that 81 LTE networks will be in commercial service by the end of 2012. Our strength and early position with LTE, particularly in the LANs, will translate into growing revenue of service roles more broadly worldwide. Expected growth in LTE spending on 3G to 2G mobility projects remains larger than LTE spending. Also, Sullivan reports that over 60% of global total sales measurement spend will be on 2G, 3G projects by 2014. Our products developed particularly for 3G, 2G and LTE mobile testing saw 21% growth quarter-on-quarter. The move to 40G and 100G networks continues with major carriers worldwide making a public announcement of their intention to deploy 100G into their networks. With Q4 revenue growth of 27% quarter-on-quarter and 40% year-on-year and this area, we are enjoying an early leadership position in the lab and production environment and expect this to translate into field deployments as the carriers begin to scale.
Our focus on penetrating high growth regions of the world is paying off. As Asia grew 10% year-on-year, we introduced new products to high growth regions, including the MTS 5800 ethernet field tester in a new features set for PathTrak. Sullivan recognized our leadership across Asia by awarding JDSU the 2011 Asia Pacific Test and Measurement Company of the Year, citing our industry-leading portfolio of LTE, mobile video, next-generation broadband and fiber optic test solutions.
The remaining segment is Advanced Optical Technologies. Revenues for the quarter included growth in currency and the transaction part market, where we are experiencing positive momentum due to financial institution M&A and rebranding efforts and new banking regulations. We recently announced the partnership with new momentum that will strengthen our authentication solution with online brand monitoring capabilities. The agreement enhances JDSU's end-to-end suite of services to help brand owners reduce risk and serious businesses that arise from counterfeit transactions.
As I conclude my formal remarks, I'd like to emphasize that we believe end market drivers remain strong and see this uncertain economic time as an opportunity to further our leadership position in the markets we serve. We will do this with focus on achieving share growth and technology leadership through investments in R&D. Innovation is at the core of JDSU's success and we'll continue to invest in market-based profitable innovation for the long-term benefit of the company.
Operator, we'll now take questions."

I think there's still a lot of additional broadband requirements in the networks in Europe and that needs to be addressed. But there is just some being conservative, I think, in the short-term spending. But it did impact us across the world but probably most significantly, in Europe from what we saw, on T&Ms specifically. I think as far as the broadband deployment, I think what we see from the operator, they haven't changed any of the plans. They are Still planning to pretty aggressively roll out additional capacity, additional networks and what we've seen from sales of smart devices out there in the market, they continue to be deployed at an increasingly rapid rate so we the know network's are in pretty difficult shape. They need to be expanded and the capacity added. So I think there's only so long that investments can be delayed into these networks."

JDSU delivered solid fourth quarter results in an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Revenue of $472 million was at the high end of our guidance range and operating margin of 12.3% was near the midpoint",377,"Thank you, Michelle, and good afternoon, everyone. JDSU delivered solid fourth quarter results in an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Revenue of $472 million was at the high end of our guidance range and operating margin of 12.3% was near the midpoint of our range. Gross margins of 46.7% were down less than 1 percentage point from the prior quarter and up more than 1 percentage point from the prior year. Cash generated from operations was $56 million. I am pleased with the business model improvement achieved in fiscal year 2011. 
From fiscal year 2010 to fiscal year 2011, revenue grew 32%, gross profit was up 40% and operating income increased by over 136%. Throughout fiscal year 2011, we benefited from our collaborative innovation strategy as revenue from new products continued to grow. In fiscal Q4, we achieved record new product revenue with over 71% of Optical Communications revenue and 52% of CommTest revenue generated from products less than 2 years old. Our financial strength continues to provide us with the necessary capital to fund our robust new product pipeline. We generated over $200 million of cash from operations during the fiscal year.
As we look ahead, there are several factors causing some short-term volatility for JDSU: First, our general economic conditions and uncertainties; second, our inventory corrections by our Optical Communications customers; and finally, the September quarter seasonality for our CommTest business segment. We strongly believe that fundamental end-market drivers for our products remain strong for the long-term, but, as indicated by our guidance, we are not immune to the current macroeconomic challenges, optical inventory corrections or CommTest demand seasonality. We cannot predict exactly how long this downturn will last for us but we do believe it's a near-term issue. During this time, we will remain focused on our winning strategy, including profitability and cash flow generation while we continue to invest in R&D and new products that will further differentiate us in the marketplace.
I'll now hand the call over to Dave, who will take you through the details of our financial performance in Q4 and the fiscal year and will discuss our outlook for Q1. Following Dave's remarks, I will provide more details on our results, the trends we are seeing and our strategy moving forward."

Before I start, please note that all numbers are non-GAAP, unless I state otherwise.Fourth quarter revenue of $472.3 million was up 3.7% from the prior quarter and up 18.6% when compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Revenues inc",1774,"Thank you, Tom. Before I start, please note that all numbers are non-GAAP, unless I state otherwise.
Fourth quarter revenue of $472.3 million was up 3.7% from the prior quarter and up 18.6% when compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Revenues increased sequentially in our CommTest and AOT segments and declined, as expected, in our CCOP segment. Book-to-bill for AOT was greater than 1, CommTest and lasers book-to-bill were approximately 1, while Optical Communications was below 1. Book-to-bill for the total company was also below 1.
Fourth quarter gross margin was 46.7% of revenue, down from the previus quarter's gross margin of 47.6% and up from fourth quarter fiscal 2010's gross margin of 45.5%. The fourth quarter sequential decline in gross margin was primarily due to product mix within the segments and lower manufacturing absorption in the optical business. The year-over-year improvement in gross margin was due to improved margins in both the CCOP and the CommTest segments. Operating expenses for the fourth fiscal quarter of $162.3 million were 34.4% of revenue, relatively flat from the prior quarter's $161.9 million. Increased R&D investments were offset by lower G&A spending. 
The fiscal fourth quarter operating margin for the company was 12.3%, up from 9.3% for the year ago period, primarily due to higher revenues and gross margins. Net income was $53.9 million or $0.23 per share, which compares to $51 million or $0.22 per share for the third fiscal quarter and $33.1 million or $0.15 per share for the year ago period. For the full fiscal year, total revenue was $1.8 billion, up 32.2% from the prior year. Gross margin for the full fiscal year was 47.6%, up from 44.6% for fiscal 2010. Operating income for fiscal 2011 was $230.7 million or 12.7% of revenue, up from 7.1% of revenue for fiscal 2010. Improved operating income is primarily due to increased revenue and gross margins.
Our net income for the year was $216.7 million or $0.93 per share, up from $91.9 million or $0.41 per share for fiscal 2010. A detailed reconciliation of our non-GAAP results to our GAAP results is available in today's press release.
Our fourth quarter non-GAAP operating income excludes, among other items, amortization of acquired technology and other intangibles of $22 million, an $11.5 million charge for stock-based compensation and restructuring and nonrecurring charges totaling $4.5 million. Including the noted items, for fourth quarter fiscal 2011, GAAP net income was $9.3 million or $0.04 per share, which compares to our prior year GAAP net income of $1.5 million or $0.01 per share. For the full fiscal year, GAAP net income was $71.6 million or $0.31 per share, which compares to a GAAP net loss of $61.8 million or a loss of $0.28 per share for fiscal 2010. 
Now looking at quarterly revenue by region.  Americas revenue of $230.1 million or 49% of total revenue was up $21.2 million from the prior quarter. The increase was due to strength in AOT and in CommTest 2008, as CommTest experienced typical, seasonal demand from service providers. The MDA revenue of $122.5 million or 26% of total revenue was down $4.8 million compared to the prior quarter, due primarily to lower demand in the Optical Communications business. Asia-Pacific revenue was $119.7 million or 25% of total revenue, relatively flat from the prior quarter. And the increase in Optical Communications and laser revenues was offset by a slight decline in AOT and CommTest revenues. 
Now moving to the segments.  First, to the CCOP segment. Total CCOP revenue was $202.3 million, down 3.4% from the prior quarter and within our guidance of down 2% to 4%. Gross margin was 32.8% and operating income was $32.2 million or 15.9% of revenue. The decline in operating profit was primarily due to lower optical revenue and gross margins. Geographically, Asia revenue grew in both our optical and lasers businesses, while the Americas and European revenues declined. Optical Communications revenue in fiscal Q4 was $174.5 million, down 5.5% when compared to the prior quarter's revenue and up 29.5% compared to the prior year. Seven out of 12 product lines grew sequentially. We saw strength in our pluggable products for LAN/SAN applications, while revenue for ROADMs, circuit packs and Tunable XFPs declined, primarily due to customer inventory corrections. Quarterly ASP decline was 2.1%, which was at the low end of our historical range of 2% to 4% sequentially. Gross margin for the quarter was 31.1%, down from the prior quarter's 32.9% but within our target range of 30% to 35%. Gross margin's declined due to product mix and lower overhead absorption.
Additionally, as a result of increased capacity and current demand levels, we have reduced product lead times to 4 weeks to 6 weeks on a majority of our optical products allowing our customers to respond better to their customer requirements. In our lasers business, fourth quarter revenue of $27.8 million was up 12.6% when compared to the prior quarter and up 23% compared to the prior year due to strength in our Q series solid-state lasers and our newly launched 4-kilowatt fiber laser, which is incorporated into an Amada Laser Cutting System for metal processing applications. In the fourth quarter, we recognized approximately $1 million of revenue from our kilowatt fiber laser and we expect this to grow throughout fiscal 2012. Gross margins were 43.4%, down from the prior quarter, primarily due to startup and transfer costs for our kilowatt fiber laser production.
As a reminder, our targeted CCOP operating model is for operating margins of 16% to 20% when revenues are above $190 million.
Now moving on to our CommTest segment.  Fiscal Q4 revenue of $211.3 million was up 11.7% from the March quarter's revenue. On a year-over-year basis, fourth quarter revenue was up 13.5%. Q4 revenue, excluding the NSD products and the third-party complementary products, grew by 10.4% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, Americas revenue saw strength while EMEA and Asia-Pacific revenues declined modestly. Fiscal Q4 gross margin for CommTest of 59.3% increased by more than 300 basis points from the prior year's Q4 gross margin of 56.1%. The decline, on a sequential basis, primarily due to product mix and inventory charges. The year-over-year gross margin improvement was driven by favorable product mix as 52% of CommTest revenue came products introduced in the last 2 years. Our target range for CommTest gross margins remains at 57% to 61%. CommTest operating profit was $30.4 million or 14.4% of revenue, which compares to $20.5 million or 11% of revenue in the prior year. The operating profit is below our targeted operating model range, due primarily to our current investment levels in R&D and selling costs, which are focused on advancing the business in high-growth regions.
Our targeted CommTest operating model is for operating margins of 20% to 23% when revenues are greater than $215 million. As previously noted, we are transitioning our CommTest investment away from certain products that do not meet our profitability targets, while at the same time continuing to invest in products for mobile, video, wireless and ethernet backhaul. As a result of this transition, we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $4 million in the fourth quarter. We expect our CommTest business to be in the target operating model range for the December quarter, provided we meet the revenue and gross margin targets. For the Advanced Optical Technologies, or AOT, segment, fiscal Q4 revenue was $58.7 million, up 3.3% when compared to the prior quarter. We saw revenue increases in our currency and transaction card businesses. As previously noted, demand for currency products will fluctuate according to the level of bank note printing. Fiscal Q4 gross margin for our AOT business was 49.4%, up from 48.3% in the prior quarter due to favorable product mix. AOT operating profit for the quarter was $20 million or 34.1% of revenue, up from 31.5% for the last quarter. The AOT target operating model is for operating margin of 32% to 35% when quarterly revenue is greater than $55 million.
As a reminder, JDSU's total company targeted operating margin range is 14% to 17%, when quarterly revenues for the company are $460 million or greater and gross margins are 49% or higher. Also, JDSU revenues are impacted by the seasonal buying patterns of our customers. The March and September quarter revenues tend to be lower than the December and June quarter revenues. Carrier buying patterns positively impact the December quarter and negatively impact the March quarter, while EMEA customer buying patterns impact the September quarter.
Moving to the balance sheet. For fiscal Q4 2011, the company generated $56 million of cash from operations. Capital expenditures totaled $30.9 million. At the end of fiscal Q4, the company held over $728 million in total cash and short-term investments. Headcount as of July 2, 2011, was 5,001.
Now to our Q1 guidance. First, some points to consider as you think about our financial performance over the coming quarter. Based on our current visibility, we expect normal seasonality to result in CommTest revenues declining sequentially by 12% to 15%. AOT revenues are expected to be down sequentially by 3% to 6%. And although recent bookings trends are improving in our Optical Communications business, CCOP revenues are expected to decline between 10% and 13% sequentially. The reduction in CCOP revenue is approximately evenly split between lower demand for telecom optical products and lower demand for gesture recognition products as some of our customers adjust their inventory levels. Gesture recognition revenue is expected to be less than 2% of total company revenue for the September and December quarters. This compares to recent quarterly revenue of less than 4% of total company revenue. Operating expenses are expected to be down by $3 million to $7 million sequentially. Due to the lower revenues in each segment, CommTest operating margins are estimated to be between 8.5% and 10%, AOT operating margins are expected to be between 30% and 32% and CCOP operating margins are expected to be between 13% and 15%. Taxes, interest and other income are expected to result in a net expense of $5 million to $6 million. Share count for calculating EPS is expected to be approximately 236 million shares and capital equipment purchases will be approximately 6% of revenue. 
Given the current macroeconomic uncertainties and our limited visibility at this point in the quarter, we are providing a broader guidance range for the September quarter. Taking into consideration the factors above, we expect first quarter revenue to be between $400 million and $425 million and our non-GAAP operating margin to be between 7.5% and 9.5%. 
I will now turn the call back to Tom."

I will start with the CCOP segment. First, Optical Communications. I am extremely pleased with the accomplishments of this business. On a year-over-year basis, fiscal Q4 revenue increased approximately 30%, gross margins improved by nearly 3 percentage points and operating margins improved by over 4 percentage points. We continue to grow market share and grow our product portfolio offerings to support both enterprise and telecom customers. Our achievements are a result of our technology leadership in ROADM, including our Super Transport Blades and in Tunable XFP and gesture recognition products, where we are significantly ahead of our competitors. 
We expect that in FY'12, our customers will qualify second sources for some of these products. It is important to note, however, that we have negotiated long-term share agreements with a number of customers for our Tunable XFP and we have one significant customer for our Super Transport Blade. We expect that as the total available market expands for these products, we will continue to benefit. Most importantly, we believe our continued investment in technology and expansion of our product portfolio will keep us ahead of the competition. 
Currently, the optical market is facing a short-term inventory correction. We still see strength in the drivers for optical products but in the near term, we will experience a slowdown in demand.
Tunable XFPs revenue declined 6% quarter-over-quarter and grew by over 300% year-over-year. Our penetration across the customer base is strong, having shipped to 41 customers to date, up from 37 customers last quarter. We believe demand will remain strong for the long-term as customers continue to design the Tunable XFP into more applications within their optical network.
Our Tunable XFP portfolio is the broadest in the market and we expect to continue to expand on it. This quarter, we will release an even higher performance variant, targeted for 2 key customers. Just yesterday, we announced that JDSU has developed the first Tunable SFP+ transceiver designed to replace fixed wavelength SFP+ transceivers in the enterprise and Metro networks. The Tunable SFP+ will allow network operators increased flexibility to optimize the performance of the network and will ease the cost of holding expensive inventory required with current fixed wavelength SFP products. In addition, due to it's smaller form factor and reduced power consumption, it increases the density of transmission parts. We are very excited about this new market opportunity, which Infonetics estimates to be $300 million in 2012. It is expected to continue growing rapidly as enterprise and Metro networks are optimized to meet growing bandwidth demands. Being first to market, we expect we will give JDSU a competitive advantage similar to the advantage we have with the ROADMs, Super Transport Blade and Tunable XFP. We expect to have the product introduction in the next 12 months.
ROADM revenue represented 28% of total Optical Communications revenue for fiscal Q4. Our growth in this product area was significant for the full year, growing over 100% from fiscal 2010. Despite short-term inventory timing issues, long-term growth is expected to continue for ROADM products as carriers upgrade their networks to include better wavelength provisioning functionality.
JDSU is currently working with their customers to support next-generation colorless, directionless and contentionless technology for the ROADM-based networks. Our MEMS solution serve the current market well today. For future applications beyond 100V, we're building on existing JDSU R&D skills to produce L-cost-based products as well. We believe that with both MEMS and L-cost-based product portfolios, we will have solutions for diverse requirements of future networks. We will have the broadest ROADM portfolio to meet the needs of our customers today and in the future as networks demand both low-cost and high flexibility. 
Over the last few quarters, we announced the release of new 40G and 100G optical components. We continue to gain traction on 40G short and long-reach non-coherent components, as well as components for coherent 40G and 100G customers, who have developed their own 40G and 100G solutions. We have developed  a strong product roadmap for high-performance 40G and 100G coherent modules that we will launch in calendar 2012. For 40G and 100G applications, we currently have 16 design wins and 20 more in process with 17 customers. Revenue from gesture recognition grew 8.5% quarter-over-quarter, as our customer completed it's necessary inventory build-ahead for the holiday buying season. As a result, we saw a pause in bookings for Q4 and, consequently, revenue in Q1 is expected to decline significantly. The total gesture revenue for the company continue to be less than 4% of JDSU's revenue in Q4.
Now I'll turn to our lasers business within the CCOP segment. We continue to see strength in our lasers business with 12.6% revenue growth quarter-over-quarter and 23% growth year-over-year due to strength in our Q series solid-state lasers and our newly launched 4-kilowatt fiber laser incorporated into the Amada Laser Cutting System for metal processing applications. This new laser enables up to 3x faster processing speeds on thick materials as compared to traditional CO2 laser technologies. Due to strong end-customer interest, we are working with Amada to expand manufacturing capacity for this product. We're also developing a second-generation suite of kilowatt fiber lasers with Amada, and we are also developing a new fiber-based class of pulse lasers expected to ship during the second half of fiscal 2012. We continue to make progress in developing our concentrated photovoltaic or CPV cell technology for large-scale solar power applications. In July, we announced the acquisition of important technology assets from QuantaSol. This technology allows more light to be converted to electrical power by raising the efficiency of CPV cells, the most important metric in the solar industry. Leveraging this technology will enable JDSU to further differentiate our product and expand our position in the CPV solar market as popularity for CPV grows.
Now I'll go on to our CommTest segment. CommTest delivered solid financial performance in Q4 FY '11 reflecting the ongoing challenge your customers are encountering to add millions of new broadband subscribers to their network and, therefore, their need for our field service tools for service activation and troubleshooting. Infonetics forecast broadband subscribers to grow from 1 billion in 2010 to 2.9 billion by 2015. This trend is evidenced by our growth in field-test instruments by 24% quarter-over-quarter and 17% growth year-over-year and representing nearly 61% of overall CommTest revenue. In the cable market, Infonetics estimates that over 100 million homes, worldwide, have DOCSIS 3.0 service available, yet only 1% to 2% of the homes have subscribed to date. Even in the early stages of this rollout, we delivered strong results in the quarter with revenue from our DOCSIS 3.0 rollout toll growing 14% quarter-on-quarter and 29% year-on-year.
During the quarter, we also saw increased carrier spending on IP video projects. Gardner forecast IPTV subscribers to grow from 35 million to 75 million by 2014. Because testing for bonded pairs is essential for IPTV rollouts, we introduced the first-to-market bonded combination VDSL2/ADSL2 test solution. Infonetics also forecasted fiber-to-the-home subscribers will grow from 33 million in 2010 to 98 million by 2015 with net addition rates increasing each year. Once again, our fiber optic field-test business delivered strong results with 23% growth quarter-on-quarter and 39% year-on-year. Our leadership in this area is confirmed at Frost & Sullivan as they recognized JDSU as the #1 global leader for fiber test with 24% market share.
As more broadband subscribers are added, video traffic is growing exponentially and is expected that 90% of consumer traffic by 2014. Tier 1 carriers took advantage of our expertise during the quarter, with growth in our fiber and asset [ph] test businesses as I mentioned earlier. We also made strong progress in other areas supporting video test, by PathTrak return path monitoring, which offers significant labor savings for carriers by detecting troubles at the street level rather than the node, we'll have a Q4 revenue growth of 40% quarter-on-quarter and 43% year-on-year. In addition, we added over 20 deals to our pipeline in Q4 for Home PM, which extends quality of service visibility into the home.
The current customer in Europe already reports Home PM is driving CapEx savings at a rate that is 2.5x greater than anticipated. Another spending priority for our customers remains mobility. LTE standards remain an investment priority for carriers, as expected, that 81 LTE networks will be in commercial service by the end of 2012. Our strengths and early position with LTE, particularly in the labs, will translate into growing revenue of service roles more broadly worldwide. Despite the growth in LTE, spending on 3G and 2G mobility projects remains larger than LTE spending. Also, Frost & Sullivan reports that over 60% of global total test and measurement spend will be on 2G, 3G projects by 2014. Our products developed particularly for 3G, 2G and LTE mobile testing saw 21% growth quarter-on-quarter. The move to 40G and 100G networks continues with major carriers worldwide making public announcements of their intention to deploy 100G into their networks. With Q4 revenue growth of 27% quarter-on-quarter and 40% year-on-year in this area, we are enjoying an early leadership position in the lab and production environment and expect this to translate into field deployments as the carriers begin to scale.
Our focus on penetrating high growth regions of the world is paying off. As Asia grew 10% year-on-year, we introduced new products for high growth regions, including the MTS 5800 Ethernet field tester in a new feature set for PathTrak. Frost & Sullivan recognized our leadership across Asia by awarding JDSU the 2011 Asia Pacific Test and Measurement Company of the Year, citing our industry-leading portfolio of LTE, mobile video, next-generation broadband and fiber optic test solutions.
The remaining segment is Advanced Optical Technologies. Revenues for the quarter included growth in currency and the transaction card hologram market, where we are experiencing positive momentum due to financial institution M&A and rebranding efforts and new banking regulations. We recently announced the partnership with New Momentum that will strengthen our authentication solution with online brand monitoring capabilities. The agreement enhances JDSU's end-to-end suite of services to help brand owners reduce risk and serious business issues that arise from counterfeit transactions.
As I conclude my formal remarks, I'd like to emphasize that we believe end-market drivers remain strong and see this uncertain economic time as an opportunity to further our leadership position in the markets we serve. We will do this with focus on achieving share growth and technology leadership through investments in R&D. Innovation is at the core of JDSU's success and we'll continue to invest in market-based profitable innovation for the long-term benefit of the company.

Most of them broadly said of slowing down in terms of pushing out their deployments, so they're pulling their pin and most of the work that you're doing with them right now, how are they -- what period are they focused on in terms of accelerating some of sort of transition to next generation like 40G/100G as well as 4G and LTE?"

I think first of all, in the macro T&M, it was a bit more skewed towards the European region where I think as you can tell, there are probably heavier macro concerns today, so I think it really is some delays in spending related to those macro concerns. I think there's still a lot of additional broadband requirements in the networks in Europe and that needs to be addressed. But there is some just being conservative, I think, in the short-term spending. But it did impact us across the world but probably most significantly in Europe, from what we saw on T&Ms, specifically. I think as far as the broadband deployments, I think what we see from the operator, they haven't changed any of their plans. They are still planning to pretty aggressively roll out additional capacity, additional networks, and what we've seen from sales of smart devices out there in the market, they continue to be deployed at an increasingly rapid rate, so we the know network's are in pretty difficult shape. They need to be expanded and the capacity added. So I think there's only so long that investments can be delayed into these networks."

And good afternoon, everyone. JDSU delivered solid fourth quarter results in an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Revenue of $472 million was at the high end of our guidance range and operating margin of 12.3% was near the midpoint",377,"Thank you, Michelle. And good afternoon, everyone. JDSU delivered solid fourth quarter results in an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Revenue of $472 million was at the high end of our guidance range and operating margin of 12.3% was near the midpoint of our range. Gross margins of 46.7% were down less than 1 percentage point from the prior quarter and up more than 1 percentage point from the prior year. Cash generated from operations was $56 million. I am pleased with the business model improvement achieved in fiscal year 2011. 
From fiscal year 2010 to fiscal year 2011, revenue grew 32%, gross profit was up 40%, and operating income increased by over 136%. Throughout fiscal year 2011, we benefited from our collaborative innovation strategy as revenue from new products continued to grow. In fiscal Q4, we achieved record new product revenue with over 71% of Optical Communications revenue and 52% of CommTest revenue generated from products less than 2 years old. Our financial strength continues to provide us with the necessary capital to fund our robust new product pipeline. We generated over $200 million of cash from operations during the fiscal year.
As we look ahead, there are several factors causing some short-term volatility for JDSU: First, our general economic conditions and uncertainties; second, our inventory corrections by our Optical Communications customers; and finally, the September quarter seasonality for our CommTest business segment. 
We strongly believe that fundamental end-market drivers for our products remain strong for the long-term, but, as indicated by our guidance, we are not immune to the current macroeconomic challenges, optical inventory corrections or CommTest demand seasonality. 
We cannot predict exactly how long this downturn will last for us but we do believe it's a near-term issue. During this time, we will remain focused on our winning strategy, including profitability and cash flow generation while we continue to invest in R&D and new products that will further differentiate us in the marketplace.
I'll now hand the call over to Dave, who will take you through the details of our financial performance in Q4 and the fiscal year and will discuss our outlook for Q1. Following Dave's remarks, I will provide more details on our results, the trends we are seeing, and our strategy moving forward."

Before I start, please note that all numbers are non-GAAP, unless I state otherwise.Fourth quarter revenue of $472.3 million was up 3.7% from the prior quarter and up 18.6% when compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Revenues inc",1773,"Thank you, Tom. Before I start, please note that all numbers are non-GAAP, unless I state otherwise.
Fourth quarter revenue of $472.3 million was up 3.7% from the prior quarter and up 18.6% when compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Revenues increased sequentially in our CommTest and AOT segments and declined, as expected, in our CCOP segment. Book-to-bill for AOT was greater than 1, CommTest and lasers book-to-bill were approximately 1, while Optical Communications was below 1. Book-to-bill for the total company was also below 1.
Fourth quarter gross margin was 46.7% of revenue, down from the previus quarter's gross margin of 47.6% and up from fourth quarter fiscal 2010's gross margin of 45.5%. The fourth quarter sequential decline in gross margin was primarily due to product mix within the segments and lower manufacturing absorption in the optical business. 
The year-over-year improvement in gross margin was due to improved margins in both the CCOP and the CommTest segments. Operating expenses for the fourth fiscal quarter of $162.3 million were 34.4% of revenue, relatively flat from the prior quarter's $161.9 million. Increased R&D investments were offset by lower G&A spending. 
The fiscal fourth quarter operating margin for the company was 12.3%, up from 9.3% for the year ago period, primarily due to higher revenues and gross margins. Net income was $53.9 million or $0.23 per share, which compares to $51 million or $0.22 per share for the third fiscal quarter and $33.1 million or $0.15 per share for the year ago period. For the full fiscal year, total revenue was $1.8 billion, up 32.2% from the prior year. 
Gross margin for the full fiscal year was 47.6%, up from 44.6% for fiscal 2010. Operating income for fiscal 2011 was $230.7 million or 12.7% of revenue, up from 7.1% of revenue for fiscal 2010. Improved operating income is primarily due to increased revenue and gross margins.
Our net income for the year was $216.7 million or $0.93 per share, up from $91.9 million or $0.41 per share for fiscal 2010. A detailed reconciliation of our non-GAAP results to our GAAP results is available in today's press release.
Our fourth quarter non-GAAP operating income excludes, among other items, amortization of acquired technology and other intangibles of $22 million, an $11.5 million charge for stock-based compensation and restructuring and nonrecurring charges totaling $4.5 million. Including the noted items, for fourth quarter fiscal 2011, GAAP net income was $9.3 million or $0.04 per share, which compares to our prior year GAAP net income of $1.5 million or $0.01 per share. 
For the full fiscal year, GAAP net income was $71.6 million or $0.31 per share, which compares to a GAAP net loss of $61.8 million or a loss of $0.28 per share for fiscal 2010. 
Now looking at quarterly revenue by region.  Americas revenue of $230.1 million or 49% of total revenue was up $21.2 million from the prior quarter. The increase was due to strength in AOT and in CommTest, as CommTest experienced typical seasonal demand from service providers. The MDA revenue of $122.5 million or 26% of total revenue was down $4.8 million compared to the prior quarter, due primarily to lower demand in the Optical Communications business. Asia-Pacific revenue was $119.7 million or 25% of total revenue, relatively flat from the prior quarter. And the increase in Optical Communications and laser revenues was offset by a slight decline in AOT and CommTest revenues. 
Now moving to the segments.  First, to the CCOP segment. Total CCOP revenue was $202.3 million, down 3.4% from the prior quarter and within our guidance of down 2% to 4%. Gross margin was 32.8% and operating income was $32.2 million or 15.9% of revenue. The decline in operating profit was primarily due to lower optical revenue and gross margins. 
Geographically, Asia revenue grew in both our optical and lasers businesses, while the Americas and European revenues declined. Optical Communications revenue in fiscal Q4 was $174.5 million, down 5.5% when compared to the prior quarter's revenue and up 29.5% compared to the prior year. Seven out of 12 product lines grew sequentially. 
We saw strength in our pluggable products for LAN/SAN applications, while revenue for ROADMs, circuit packs and Tunable XFPs declined, primarily due to customer inventory corrections. Quarterly ASP decline was 2.1%, which was at the low end of our historical range of 2% to 4% sequentially. Gross margin for the quarter was 31.1%, down from the prior quarter's 32.9% but within our target range of 30% to 35%. Gross margin's declined due to product mix and lower overhead absorption.
Additionally, as a result of increased capacity and current demand levels, we have reduced product lead times to 4 weeks to 6 weeks on a majority of our optical products allowing our customers to respond better to their customer requirements. In our lasers business, fourth quarter revenue of $27.8 million was up 12.6% when compared to the prior quarter and up 23% compared to the prior year due to strength in our Q series solid-state lasers and our newly launched 4-kilowatt fiber laser, which is incorporated into an Amada Laser Cutting System for metal processing applications. 
In the fourth quarter, we recognized approximately $1 million of revenue from our kilowatt fiber laser, and we expect this to grow throughout fiscal 2012. Gross margins were 43.4%, down from the prior quarter, primarily due to startup and transfer costs for our kilowatt fiber laser production.
As a reminder, our targeted CCOP operating model is for operating margins of 16% to 20% when revenues are above $190 million.
Now moving on to our CommTest segment.  Fiscal Q4 revenue of $211.3 million was up 11.7% from the March quarter's revenue. On a year-over-year basis, fourth quarter revenue was up 13.5%. Q4 revenue, excluding the NSD products and the third-party complementary products, grew by 10.4% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, Americas revenue saw strength while EMEA and Asia-Pacific revenues declined modestly. 
Fiscal Q4 gross margin for CommTest of 59.3% increased by more than 300 basis points from the prior year's Q4 gross margin of 56.1%. The decline, on a sequential basis, primarily due to product mix and inventory charges. The year-over-year gross margin improvement was driven by favorable product mix as 52% of CommTest revenue came products introduced in the last 2 years. 
Our target range for CommTest gross margins remains at 57% to 61%. CommTest operating profit was $30.4 million or 14.4% of revenue, which compares to $20.5 million or 11% of revenue in the prior year. The operating profit is below our targeted operating model range, due primarily to our current investment levels in R&D and selling costs, which are focused on advancing the business in high-growth regions.
Our targeted CommTest operating model is for operating margins of 20% to 23% when revenues are greater than $215 million. As previously noted, we are transitioning our CommTest investment away from certain products that do not meet our profitability targets, while at the same time continuing to invest in products for mobile, video, wireless and ethernet backhaul. 
As a result of this transition, we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $4 million in the fourth quarter. We expect our CommTest business to be in the target operating model range for the December quarter, provided we meet the revenue and gross margin targets. 
For the Advanced Optical Technologies, or AOT, segment, fiscal Q4 revenue was $58.7 million, up 3.3% when compared to the prior quarter. We saw revenue increases in our currency and transaction card businesses. As previously noted, demand for currency products will fluctuate according to the level of bank note printing. 
Fiscal Q4 gross margin for our AOT business was 49.4%, up from 48.3% in the prior quarter due to favorable product mix. AOT operating profit for the quarter was $20 million or 34.1% of revenue, up from 31.5% for the last quarter. The AOT target operating model is for operating margin of 32% to 35% when quarterly revenue is greater than $55 million.
As a reminder, JDSU's total company targeted operating margin range is 14% to 17%, when quarterly revenues for the company are $460 million or greater and gross margins are 49% or higher. Also, JDSU revenues are impacted by the seasonal buying patterns of our customers. The March and September quarter revenues tend to be lower than the December and June quarter revenues. Carrier buying patterns positively impact the December quarter and negatively impact the March quarter, while EMEA customer buying patterns impact the September quarter.
Moving to the balance sheet. For fiscal Q4 2011, the company generated $56 million of cash from operations. Capital expenditures totaled $30.9 million. At the end of fiscal Q4, the company held over $728 million in total cash and short-term investments. Headcount as of July 2, 2011, was 5,001.
Now to our Q1 guidance. First, some points to consider as you think about our financial performance over the coming quarter. Based on our current visibility, we expect normal seasonality to result in CommTest revenues declining sequentially by 12% to 15%. AOT revenues are expected to be down sequentially by 3% to 6%. And although recent bookings trends are improving in our Optical Communications business, CCOP revenues are expected to decline between 10% and 13% sequentially. 
The reduction in CCOP revenue is approximately evenly split between lower demand for telecom optical products and lower demand for gesture recognition products as some of our customers adjust their inventory levels. Gesture recognition revenue is expected to be less than 2% of total company revenue for the September and December quarters. This compares to recent quarterly revenue of less than 4% of total company revenue. 
Operating expenses are expected to be down by $3 million to $7 million sequentially. Due to the lower revenues in each segment, CommTest operating margins are estimated to be between 8.5% and 10%, AOT operating margins are expected to be between 30% and 32%. And CCOP operating margins are expected to be between 13% and 15%. 
Taxes, interest and other income are expected to result in a net expense of $5 million to $6 million. Share count for calculating EPS is expected to be approximately 236 million shares and capital equipment purchases will be approximately 6% of revenue. 
Given the current macroeconomic uncertainties and our limited visibility at this point in the quarter, we are providing a broader guidance range for the September quarter. Taking into consideration the factors above, we expect first quarter revenue to be between $400 million and $425 million, and our non-GAAP operating margin to be between 7.5% and 9.5%. 
I will now turn the call back to Tom."

I will start with the CCOP segment. First, Optical Communications. I am extremely pleased with the accomplishments of this business. On a year-over-year basis, fiscal Q4 revenue increased approximately 30%, gross margins improved by nearly 3 percentage points, and operating margins improved by over 4 percentage points. We continue to grow market share and grow our product portfolio offerings to support both enterprise and telecom customers. Our achievements are a result of our technology leadership in ROADM, including our Super Transport Blades, and in Tunable XFP and gesture recognition products where we are significantly ahead of our competitors. 
We expect that in FY'12, our customers will qualify second sources for some of these products. It is important to note, however, that we have negotiated long-term share agreements with a number of customers for our Tunable XFP, and we have one significant customer for our Super Transport Blade. We expect that as the total available market expands for these products, we will continue to benefit. Most importantly, we believe our continued investment in technology and expansion of our product portfolio will keep us ahead of the competition. 
Currently, the optical market is facing a short-term inventory correction. We still see strength in the drivers for optical products but, in the near term, we will experience a slowdown in demand.
Tunable XFPs revenue declined 6% quarter-over-quarter and grew by over 300% year-over-year. Our penetration across the customer base is strong, having shipped to 41 customers to date, up from 37 customers last quarter. We believe demand will remain strong for the long-term as customers continue to design the Tunable XFP into more applications within their optical network.
Our Tunable XFP portfolio is the broadest in the market and we expect to continue to expand on it. This quarter, we will release an even higher performance variant, targeted for 2 key customers. Just yesterday, we announced that JDSU has developed the first Tunable SFP+ transceiver designed to replace fixed wavelength SFP+ transceivers in the enterprise and Metro networks. The Tunable SFP+ will allow network operators increased flexibility to optimize the performance of the network and will ease the cost of holding expensive inventory required with current fixed wavelength SFP products.  In addition, due to it's smaller form factor and reduced power consumption, it increases the density of transmission parts. 
We are very excited about this new market opportunity, which Infonetics estimates to be $300 million in 2012. It is expected to continue growing rapidly as enterprise and Metro networks are optimized to meet growing bandwidth demands. Being first to market, we expect we will give JDSU a competitive advantage, similar to the advantage we have with the ROADMs, Super Transport Blade and Tunable XFP. We expect to have the product introduction in the next 12 months.
ROADM revenue represented 28% of total Optical Communications revenue for fiscal Q4. Our growth in this product area was significant for the full year, growing over 100% from fiscal 2010. Despite short-term inventory timing issues, long-term growth is expected to continue for ROADM products as carriers upgrade their networks to include better wavelength provisioning functionality.
JDSU is currently working with their customers to support next-generation colorless, directionless and contentionless technology for the ROADM-based networks. Our MEMS solution serve the current market well today. For future applications beyond 100V, we're building on existing JDSU R&D skills to produce L-cost-based products as well. We believe that with both MEMS and L-cost-based product portfolios, we will have solutions for diverse requirements of future networks. We will have the broadest ROADM portfolio to meet the needs of our customers today and in the future as networks demand both low-cost and high flexibility. 
Over the last few quarters, we announced the release of new 40G and 100G optical components. We continue to gain traction on 40G short and long-reach non-coherent components, as well as components for coherent 40G and 100G customers, who have developed their own 40G and 100G solutions. We have developed  a strong product roadmap for high-performance 40G and 100G coherent modules that we will launch in calendar 2012. For 40G and 100G applications, we currently have 16 design wins and 20 more in process with 17 customers. 
Revenue from gesture recognition grew 8.5% quarter-over-quarter, as our customer completed its necessary inventory build-ahead for the holiday buying season. As a result, we saw a pause in bookings for Q4, and consequently, revenue in Q1 is expected to decline significantly. The total gesture revenue for the company continue to be less than 4% of JDSU's revenue in Q4.
Now I'll turn to our lasers business within the CCOP segment. We continue to see strength in our lasers business with 12.6% revenue growth quarter-over-quarter and 23% growth year-over-year due to strength in our Q series solid-state lasers and our newly launched 4-kilowatt fiber laser incorporated into the Amada Laser Cutting System for metal processing applications. This new laser enables up to 3x faster processing speeds on thick materials as compared to traditional CO2 laser technologies. 
Due to strong end-customer interest, we are working with Amada to expand manufacturing capacity for this product. We're also developing a second-generation suite of kilowatt fiber lasers with Amada, and we are also developing a new fiber-based class of pulse lasers expected to ship during the second half of fiscal 2012. 
We continue to make progress in developing our concentrated photovoltaic, or CPV cell technology, for large-scale solar power applications. In July, we announced the acquisition of important technology assets from QuantaSol. This technology allows more light to be converted to electrical power by raising the efficiency of CPV cells, the most important metric in the solar industry. Leveraging this technology will enable JDSU to further differentiate our product and expand our position in the CPV solar market as popularity for CPV grows.
Now I'll go on to our CommTest segment. CommTest delivered solid financial performance in Q4 FY '11 reflecting the ongoing challenge our customers are encountering to add millions of new broadband subscribers to their network, and therefore their need for our field service tools, for service activation and troubleshooting. Infonetics forecast broadband subscribers to grow from 1 billion in 2010 to 2.9 billion by 2015. 
This trend is evidenced by our growth in field-test instruments by 24% quarter-over-quarter and 17% growth year-over-year and representing nearly 61% of overall CommTest revenue. In the cable market, Infonetics estimates that over 100 million homes, worldwide, have DOCSIS 3.0 service available, yet only 1% to 2% of the homes have subscribed to date. Even in the early stages of this rollout, we delivered strong results in the quarter with revenue from our DOCSIS 3.0 rollout toll growing 14% quarter-on-quarter and 29% year-on-year.
During the quarter, we also saw increased carrier spending on IP video projects, Gardner forecast IPTV subscribers to grow from 35 million to 75 million by 2014. Because testing for bonded pairs is essential for IPTV rollouts, we introduced the first-to-market bonded combination VDSL2/ADSL2 test solution.  Infonetics also forecasted fiber-to-the-home subscribers will grow from 33 million in 2010 to 98 million by 2015 with net addition rates increasing each year. 
Once again, our fiber optic field-test business delivered strong results with 23% growth quarter-on-quarter and 39% year-on-year. Our leadership in this area is confirmed at Frost & Sullivan as they recognized JDSU as the #1 global leader for fiber test with 24% market share.
As more broadband subscribers are added, video traffic is growing exponentially and is expected that 90% of consumer traffic by 2014. Tier 1 carriers took advantage of our expertise during the quarter, with growth in our fiber and access test businesses as I mentioned earlier. 
We also made strong progress in other areas supporting video tests. By PathTrak return path monitoring, which offers significant labor savings for carriers by detecting troubles at the street level rather than the node, we'll have a Q4 revenue growth of 40% quarter-on-quarter and 43% year-on-year. In addition, we added over 20 deals to our pipeline in Q4 for Home PM, which extends quality of service visibility into the home.
The current customer in Europe already reports Home PM is driving CapEx savings at a rate that is 2.5x greater than anticipated. Another spending priority for our customers remains mobility. LTE standards remain an investment priority for carriers. It is expected that 81 LTE networks will be in commercial service by the end of 2012. Our strengths and early position with LTE, particularly in the labs, will translate into growing revenue as service rolls out more broadly worldwide. 
Despite the growth in LTE, spending on 3G and 2G mobility projects remains larger than LTE spending. Also, Frost & Sullivan reports that over 60% of global total test and measurement spend will be on 2G, 3G projects by 2014. Our products developed particularly for 3G, 2G and LTE mobile testing saw 21% growth quarter-on-quarter. The move to 40G and 100G networks continues with major carriers worldwide making public announcements of their intention to deploy 100G into their networks. With Q4 revenue growth of 27% quarter-on-quarter and 40% year-on-year in this area, we are enjoying an early leadership position in the lab and production environment and expect this to translate into field deployments as the carriers begin to scale.
Our focus on penetrating high growth regions of the world is paying off. As Asia grew 10% year-on-year, we introduced new products for high growth regions, including the MTS 5800 Ethernet field tester in a new feature set for PathTrak. Frost & Sullivan recognized our leadership across Asia by awarding JDSU the 2011 Asia Pacific Test and Measurement Company of the Year, citing our industry-leading portfolio of LTE, mobile video, next-generation broadband and fiber optic test solutions.
The remaining segment is Advanced Optical Technologies. Revenues for the quarter included growth in currency and the transaction card hologram market, where we are experiencing positive momentum due to financial institution M&A and rebranding efforts and new banking regulations. We recently announced the partnership with New Momentum that will strengthen our authentication solution with online brand monitoring capabilities. The agreement enhances JDSU's end-to-end suite of services to help brand owners reduce risk and serious business issues that arise from counterfeit transactions.
As I conclude my formal remarks, I'd like to emphasize that we believe end-market drivers remain strong and see this uncertain economic time as an opportunity to further our leadership position in the markets we serve. We will do this with focus on achieving share growth and technology leadership through investments in R&D. Innovation is at the core of JDSU's success and we'll continue to invest in market-based profitable innovation for the long-term benefit of the company.

I think first of all, in the macro T&M, it was a bit more skewed towards the European region where I think as you can tell, there are probably heavier macro concerns today, so I think it really is some delays in spending related to those macro concerns. I think there's still a lot of additional broadband requirements in the networks in Europe and that needs to be addressed. But there is some just being conservative, I think, in the short-term spending. But it did impact us across the world but probably most significantly in Europe, from what we saw on T&Ms, specifically. I think as far as the broadband deployments, I think what we see from the operator, they haven't changed any of their plans. They are still planning to pretty aggressively roll out additional capacity, additional networks, and what we've seen from sales of smart devices out there in the market, they continue to be deployed at an increasingly rapid rate, so we the know network's are in pretty difficult shape. They need to be expanded and the capacity added. So I think there's only so long that investments can be delayed into these networks."

Gross margins for the quarter improved from the prior quarter despite lower revenues. Operating expenses declined by over $9 million due to stringent cost controls, resulting in an operating margin of 10.9%, which exceeded our guidance range. In fiscal Q1, new product revenue remains strong with 67% of Optical Communications revenue and 56% of CommTest revenue being generated from products less than 2 years old. Additionally, our financial strength continue to provide us with the necessary capital to fund our robust new product pipeline as cash generated from operations totaled $22.9 million.
On our last call, I highlighted that we expect some short-term revenue volatility due to uncertainty in the macro environment and that optical customers were reducing their on-hand inventory levels. I'd like to provide an update on these topics, as well as some clarity on the impact with the recent flooding in Thailand.
Significant improvements in our optical customers' inventory levels have been made over the past 6 months. Q1 bookings for some of our key optical products were very encouraging. ROADM bookings were up nearly 25% from last quarter and were the highest level in the last 3 quarters. Our tunable XFP bookings were up 70% from the prior quarter. 7 out of 12 product line saw their bookings increase on a sequential bookings.
Turning to the situation in Thailand, the floods have created a great deal of hardship on the Thai people, the infrastructure and the ability to do business in the affected areas. I am happy to report that all the JDSU employees in Thailand are safe but many of them have been displaced from their homes due to the flooding. We are doing what we can to help them through this situation.
As for the impact on our business, I'm happy to say that our equipment is safe and dry at this point. The water level at the Pinehurst, Fabrinet facility has been steadily subsiding and over the past week has dropped by several ages, which is encouraging. Fabrinet has reported that power has been restored to the Pinehurst facilities and that the equipment is being ready for production. We are also executing some of our contingency plans in an effort to maximize output to satisfy our customers' top priorities. The timing of achieving full production is still not certain as water levels are still causing challenges with the infrastructure in the area but we are very encouraged by the events of the past several days and expect to have some level of production within the next week or 2. While there are a number of logistical challenges, we have been able to ship some existing finished goods to our customers. Dave will talk more about the Thailand situation, when he updates you on our guidance shortly.
Moving on to demand for our products. Broadband drivers remain strong, however, the macro economic environment remains challenging and recent indicators have become more volatile since our last call. As a result, we are seeing our service provider customers implement lengthier CapEx approval processes and we now expect little to no budget flush in the December quarter.
We cannot predict exactly how long the current macro economic conditions will impact our revenues but when the Fabrinet, Pinehurst facility in Thailand will be back in full production. At the same time, given the healthy underlying fundamentals of our business, we remain focused on meeting our customers needs, profitability and cash flow generation while continuing to invest in R&D and new products that will further differentiate us in our markets. 
I'll now hand the call over to Dave, who will take you through the details of our financial performance in fiscal Q1 and will discuss our outlook for Q2. Following Dave's remarks, I will provide more details on our results, the trends we are seeing and our strategy moving forward."

Before I start, please note that all numbers are non-GAAP, unless I state otherwise.First quarter revenue of $421.4 million was down 10.8% from the prior quarter and up 2.4% when compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Revenues dec",1737,"Thank you, Tom. Before I start, please note that all numbers are non-GAAP, unless I state otherwise.
First quarter revenue of $421.4 million was down 10.8% from the prior quarter and up 2.4% when compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Revenues declined slightly in each of our business segments as expected. Book-to-bill for lasers was approximately 1. CommTest, Optical Communications and AOT book-to-bill were each less than 1. Book-to-bill for the total company was also below 1. 
The first quarter's gross margin was 47.3% of revenue, up from the previous quarter's gross margin of 46.7% and relatively flat with first quarter fiscal 2011's gross margin. The sequential increase in gross margin was primarily due to segment mix and improved CommTest gross margins. Operating expenses for the first quarter of $152.9 million was down from the prior quarter's $162.3 million, primarily due to lower headcount in CommTest, a direct result of the previously announced restructuring activities and lower corporate spending.
The first quarter operating margin for the company was 10.9%, up from 10.8% for the year ago period, due to lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. Net income for the quarter was $40.9 million or $0.18 per share, which compares to $53.9 million or $0.23 per share for the prior fiscal quarter and to $44.8 million or $0.20 per share for the year ago period. The year ago period benefited from a favorable tax provision. A detailed reconciliation of our non-GAAP results to our GAAP results is available in today's press release. Our non-GAAP operating income excludes, among other items, amortization of acquired technology and other intangibles of $21.2 million, an $11.6 million charge for stock-based compensation and a $7.4 million accrual for a legal dispute. Including the noted items, the fiscal first quarter 2012 GAAP net loss was $5.8 million or a loss of $0.03 per share, which compares to a prior year first quarter GAAP net income of approximately $100,000 or breakeven earnings per share. Now looking at quarterly revenue by region.
Americas revenue of $212.4 million or 50% of total revenue was down $17.7 million from the prior quarter. The decrease was due primarily to CommTest experiencing lower demand due to macroeconomic conditions and typical summer seasonality. EMEA revenue of $101 million or 24% of total revenue was down $21.5 million compared to the prior quarter due primarily to seasonal demand in CommTest and inventory adjustments in Optical Communications business. Asia-Pacific revenue was $107.7 million or 26% of total revenue, down $12 million from the prior quarter. An increase in AOT and laser revenues was offset by a slight decline in CommTest revenue, as well as a decline in Optical Communications revenue, primarily driven by lower demand for gesture recognition components.
Moving to the segments. First to the CCOP segment. Total CCOP revenue was $180.3 million, down 10.9% from the prior quarter and within our guidance of down 10% to 13%. Gross margin was 32.3% and operating income was $25.6 million or 14.2% of revenue. The decline in operating profit was primarily due to lower optical revenue and gross margin. Geographically, our optical business saw strength in the Americas and a decline in Europe and Asia, whereas lasers so a decline in the Americas with solid growth in Asia and a slight increase in Europe.
Optical Communications revenue in fiscal Q1 was $150.1 million, down 14% when compared to the previous quarter's revenue and up 5% when compared to the prior year. 6 out of 12 product lines grew sequentially, including our pluggable products for LAN/SAN applications. As expected, gesture recognition revenue declined to less than 2% of total JDSU revenue and accounted for more than 50% of the sequential decline in optical revenue. 
Revenue for ROADMs and tunable XFPs declined, primarily due to customer inventory correction. Quarterly ASP decline was 2.7%, which was below the midpoint of our historical range of 2% to 4% sequentially.
Gross margin for the quarter was 28.8%, down from the prior quarter's 31.1% and just below our target range of 30% to 35%. Gross margins declined due to product mix and lower volumes. Product lead times during the quarter were 4 to 6 weeks for the majority of our optical products, allowing our customers to respond better to their customer requirements.
We anticipate that lead times for our Fabrinet assemble products, due to the complications from the flooding, will be extended during Q2. This includes our ROADMs, our tunable XFP, some of our amplifiers and some of our low volume product. In our lasers business, which includes not only Commercial Lasers but also our photovoltaic business, first quarter revenue of $30.2 million was up 8.6% compared to the prior quarter and up 20.8% compared to the prior year due to strength in Q series solid state lasers, our CPV solar cells and our recently introduced 4kW fiber laser. We recognized approximately $2 million of revenue from our kilowatt fiber laser in the quarter. Gross margins were 49.3%, up from the prior quarter, primarily due to growth in our solid-state lasers.
As a reminder, the majority of our commercial laser products are manufactured at Fabrinet in Thailand and is subject to supply chain disruption due to the flooding.
Finally, our targeted CCOP operating margins of 16% to 20% when revenues are above $190 million.
Now moving on to our CommTest segment. Fiscal Q1 revenue of $185.2 million was down 12.4% from the prior quarter's revenue due to macroeconomic conditions and typical summer seasonality. On a year-over-year basis, first quarter revenue was up 1.3%. On a sequential basis, each geographic region saw revenues decline, except Latin America, which had a slight increase. 
Fiscal Q1 gross margin for CommTest was 61.9%, which compares to a gross margin of 59.3% for the previous quarter and 60.7% for the year ago quarter. Gross margin improvement was mainly driven by favorable product mix as 56% of CommTest revenue came from products introduced in the last 2 years. CommTest operating profit was $24.1 million or 13% of revenue, which compares to $21.7 million or 11.9% of revenue in the prior year. The higher operating margin was driven by higher gross margin. Our targeted CommTest operating model is for operating margins of 20% to 23% when revenues are greater than $215 million in gross margins are at or above the higher end of the 57% to 61% targeted range.
For the advanced optical technologies or AOT segment, fiscal Q1 revenue was $55.6 million, down 5.3% when compared to the prior quarter due to a decline in demand for our currency, transaction card and gesture recognition products. As previously noted, demand for currency products will fluctuate according to the level of bank note printing. Fiscal Q1 gross margin for AOT business was 47.1%, down from 49.4% in the prior quarter due to volumes and product mix. AOT operating profit for the quarter was $17.5 million or 31.5% of revenue, down from 34.1% for the prior quarter due to the lower gross margin. The AOT target operating model is for operating margins of 32% to 35% when the quarterly revenue is greater than $55 million.
As a reminder, JDSU's total company targeted operating margin range is 14% to 17% when quarterly revenues for the company are $460 million or greater and gross margins are 49% or higher.
Moving to the balance sheet. For fiscal Q1 2012, the company generated $22.9 million of cash from operations. Capital expenditures totaled $21.2 million and at the end of fiscal Q1, the company held over $723.3 million in total cash and investments. Headcount as of October 1, 2011 was 4,929.
Now to our Q2 guidance. First, some points to consider as you think about our financial performance over the coming quarter. Based on our current visibility, we expect below normal seasonal revenue levels in CommTest, due to continued weak demand from EMEA service providers and lower demand from Americas service providers, including little to no end of year budget flush. Therefore, we expect CommTest revenue to be flat to up 4% from the previous quarter. AOT revenues are also expected to be flat to up 4% sequentially.
For CCOP, we believe that the September quarter would have been the low point of revenue for the fiscal year had the Thailand flooding not occurred. As we saw in the quarter, customer inventory levels in Q1 reduced to more targeted levels combined with stronger bookings. Without the impact of flooding in Thailand, we believe our Q2 CCOP revenue guidance would have been a sequential growth in the low to mid single-digit percent.
Given the current conditions in Thailand and the uncertainty of the ramp to full production, our revenue guidance for Q2 is for a sequential reduction of 15% to 25% from Q1. The 25% number being driven by an assumption of continued challenges in Thailand and a slow and gradual return to production. While we are implementing our contingency plan and are encouraged by the events over the past week in Thailand, we cannot be assured that our plans will be successful or the rate at which production will ramp, which leads us to this wide guidance range. This guidance estimates a $35 million to $45 million revenue impact due to the flood.
The company's operating expenses for Q2 are expected to increase by less than $5 million sequentially, primarily due to our annual employee merit increase and certain R&D investment activity. Now looking at operating margins for the segments.
CommTest operating margins are estimated to be between 12.5% and 14.5%. AOT operating margins are expected to be between 30% and 32% and CCOP operating margins, due to the wider revenue range and incremental costs being incurred to attempt to bring production back on, are expected to be between 3% and 7%. Axis interest and other income are expected to result in a net expense of $4 million to $6 million. Share count for calculating EPS is expected to be approximately 234 million shares. Capital equipment purchases will be approximately 5% of revenue. Given the current macro economic conditions and the impact on our CCOP business from the Thailand flooding, we are providing a broader guidance range for the December quarter. Taking into consideration the factors above, we expect second quarter revenue to be between $375 million and $405 million and our non-GAAP operating margin to be between 5.5% and 8.5%. I will now turn the call back to Tom."

ROADMs we",1283,"Thanks, Dave. I will now provide fiscal Q1 highlights from each of our business segments.
I will start with the CCOP segment, first Optical Communications.
Innovation remains robust as we saw 67% of revenue from products less than 2 years old. ROADMs were 28% of optical revenue with strong booking. Book-to-bill was nearly 1, following 3 consecutive quarters of book-to-bill less than 1 due to the inventory build up. During the quarter, Infonetics identified JDSU as the leading provider of ROADM products for the first half of the calendar year at over 50% market share as we took significant share from a major competitors. In Q1, we also secured an increase in share at a major customer for our 50 gigahertz ROADM, expanding our leadership position into the second half of fiscal year '12. 
Tunable XFP revenue was 10% of optical revenue. Bookings were up 70% quarter-over-quarter and book-to-bill was over 1. Super Transport Blade revenues were up 18% and bookings increased by 28% quarter-over-quarter. 40G demand continues to gain momentum as we are] winning new slots at the component level and with our new 40G modules. In the second half of FY12, we will launch our coherent 40G solution line side module and additional 40G client-side solutions to add to our existing portfolios.
100G design activity is also strong and customers are engaging with us on new partnerships. In Q1, we increase our shipments of 100G coherent receivers and coherent modulators and made significant progress in the development of our 100G coherent solutions and client-side solutions. our vertical integration of 100G components provides us with a competitive advantage as we develop and introduce our 100G module solution.
As we introduce these products over the next several quarters, we will provide additional updates.
For 40G and 100G applications, we currently have 18 design wins and 39 more in process with 20 customers. We continue to focus on our Optical Communications technology leadership with the development of new products. During the quarter, we announced a new suite of products to be rolled out in the second half of calendar 2012 critical to the buildout of next-generation optical networks or what we are referring to as self-aware networks. Self-aware networks are needed to support the growing volume of high-bandwidth and unpredictable traffic and require new architecture and a new set of compact high-performance and cost-effective components. Our development of this product suite is based on several years of collaboration with customers to understand the requirements of next-generation networks. Included in this product portfolio is our twin WSF product, 2 independent, 1 by 20 WSF integrated into a compact form factor. This copackaging saves space and cost for the customer and can support the needed colorless, directionless and contentionless capability.
Now turning to our racers business. In fiscal Q1, we achieved the highest revenue for this business in over 2 years. The growth is due to strength in solar, Q Series solid-state lasers and high-power fiber lasers for micromachining application. We are currently developing a second-generation suite of kilowatt fiber lasers with Amada due to strong end customer interest. We are also developing a fiber-based class of pulse lasers, which is expected to ship during the second half of calendar 2012.
Now the CommTest segment. CommTest performance for Q1 reflects solid operational progress evidenced by improved gross margins at 61.9% and lower operating expenses despite a softer spending environment as carriers are becoming more cautious with CapEx spending. Q1 revenue from products less than 2 years old represents 56% of total revenue as we continue to collaborate closely with customers to bring innovation to the market. 
Macroeconomic conditions in Europe and North America are causing increased scrutiny of orders and delays in placement but the fundamental demand for more bandwidth, access and quality improvement continue to grow. Asia-Pacific and Latin America are investing aggressively. Although we are seeing China starting to moderate the rate of build out, investment levels remain healthy. Bookings from high-growth markets increased 18% year-over-year with strength in Brazil, China, Indonesia and Korea. This quarter, we saw our customers spend more on access to support service activations for millions of new global cable and IPTV subscribers, as well as business ethernet deployments to push out on more discretionary spending for metro projects and continued spending to upgrade the core to 100G to support the huge increases in content-heavy traffic.
On the access side, we are seeing momentum in our newly released HST module that test bonded VDSL 2 ADSL 2 to support IPTV testing. Also, our investment in the T-BERD MTS-5800 is being well-accepted in high-growth markets, proving our success in developing products for these markets. Our fiber business, recognized by Frost & Sullivan as the worldwide leader in fiber test, launched 5 new products during the quarter to support 14% year-on-year revenue growth. As carriers cope with increasing bandwidth demand, we continue to see strong traction for 100G test, shipping 26 units to 15 customers during the quarter. 100G revenue in Q1 was up 41% year-on-year and 11% sequentially. In the cable market, Infonetics projections for DOCSIS 3.0 deployment indicates 60% compounded annual growth rate for 2010 through 2015 for cable market subscribers. We saw strong year-over-year growth for our PathTrak products and expect continued growth as DOCSIS 3.0 is deployed. Our products are being recognized in the industry for their technology leadership. JDSU was honored by Frost & Sullivan's 2011 Global Customer Value for JDSU's market-leading DSL test solutions used by service providers worldwide to provide high-quality broadband services.
Finally, JDSU earned high marks in Broadband Technology Reports' 2011 Diamond Technology Reviews for the roll our products play in ensuring customer quality for advanced broadband service performance. 
During the quarter, we had 10 new product launches. A few launches of note are as follows. In fiber-optic, we launched OMMSI for remote fiber optic testing that allows service providers to achieve 30% less downtime by using our technology during our troubleshooting than with conventional methods. We also introduced a new drive test solution for LTE capabilities, which expands the range of LTE networks and equipment tested, allowing service providers to test with a single tool. We also introduced the new release of our award-winning star protocol analyzer, this release brings enhanced LTE and 3G testing capabilities to help manufacturers develop LTE products faster and service providers to build out networks more quickly and operate them more effectively. Lastly, we introduced the first optical transport network multichannel test solution for 10G, 40G and 100G networks. This solution enables service providers to accelerate the development and deployment of high-speed OTM based equipment for more cost effective transmission of high-bandwidth traffic.
We will continue to support our customers' requirements and invest in R&D to keep our innovation pipeline strong to support test and major 3D and LTE mobility, video, IPTV and broadband deployment.
Now onto our remaining segment, advanced optical technologies or AOT. Revenues for the quarter were impacted by the slowing global economy, especially in the currency and transaction part. We continue to invest in the growth of this highly profitable business, including the upgrade of our production capability and technology platforms to more efficiently produce security product, expected to come online in fiscal Q2. We are also increasing our production capacity to serve ramping demand of security. This capacity addition is on plan and is scheduled to be commissioned by the end of fiscal Q4. Both of these capital investments support the demand forecast from our banknote and security customers. We also continue to focus on 3D glasses and projector color wheels as growth drivers for this segment. Applications include cinema, 3-D rides at theme parks and education.
Operator, we'll now take questions."

At the same time, as our customers will be looking for other folks that can meet their immediate needs, so that portion could potentially be diverted elsewhere and so it will be a factor of how quickly we bring the revenue or the production lines back on track. As we noted in the call, as you asked about the costs rolling into December, we believe we can get the factory from what we know right now, to a higher level of production. Obviously, we'll have much more information week by week and we expect by the end of the quarter, we'd be at ramp up to full production, provided there are no other logistic issues that get to interfere with that. So I think we're in sort of a wait and see to see if we can get back to full production.

Look at some of the larger carriers and what they've announced as far as spending and how that's proportion down in the year, gives us the inclination that Q4 is going to not have robust budget flush and be slower than what we normally see in the December quarter. I think Europe's been soft for a number of quarters and we're starting to see a bit of that hesitancy in North America on the spending."

Gross margins for the quarter improved from the prior quarter despite lower revenues. Operating expenses declined by over $9 million due to stringent cost controls, resulting in an operating margin of 10.9%, which exceeded our guidance range.
In fiscal Q1, new product revenue remains strong, with 67% of Optical Communications revenue and 56% of CommTest revenue being generated from products less than 2 years old. Additionally, our financial strength continue to provide us with the necessary capital to fund our robust new product pipeline, as cash generated from operations totaled $22.9 million.
On our last call, I highlighted that we expect some short-term revenue volatility due to uncertainty in the macro environment, and that optical customers were reducing their on-hand inventory levels. I'd like to provide an update on these topics, as well as some clarity on the impact with the recent flooding in Thailand.
Significant improvements in our optical customers' inventory levels have been made over the past 6 months. Q1 bookings for some of our key optical products were very encouraging. ROADM bookings were up nearly 25% from last quarter, and were the highest level in the last 3 quarters. Our tunable XFP bookings were up 70% from the prior quarter. 7 out of 12 product lines saw their bookings increase on a sequential basis.
Turning to the situation in Thailand, the floods have created a great deal of hardship on the Thai people, the infrastructure and the ability to do business in the affected areas. I am happy to report that all the JDSU employees in Thailand are safe but many of them have been displaced from their homes due to the flooding. We are doing what we can to help them through this situation.
As for the impact on our business, I'm happy to say that our equipment is safe and dry at this point. The water level at the Pinehurst, Fabrinet facility has been steadily subsiding, and over the past week has dropped by several inches, which is encouraging. Fabrinet has reported that power has been restored to the Pinehurst facilities, and that the equipment is being ready for production. 
We are also executing some of our contingency plans in an effort to maximize output to satisfy our customers' top priorities. The timing of achieving full production is still not certain, as water levels are still causing challenges with the infrastructure in the area, but we are very encouraged by the events of the past several days and expect to have some level of production within the next week or 2. While there are a number of logistical challenges, we have been able to ship some existing finished goods to our customers. Dave will talk more about the Thailand situation, when he updates you on our guidance shortly.
Moving on to demand for our products. Broadband drivers remain strong, however, the macro economic environment remains challenging and recent indicators have become more volatile since our last call. As a result, we are seeing our service provider customers implement lengthier CapEx approval processes, and we now expect little to no budget flush in the December quarter.
We cannot predict exactly how long the current macro economic conditions will impact our revenues but when the Fabrinet, Pinehurst facility in Thailand will be back in full production. At the same time, given the healthy underlying fundamentals of our business, we remain focused on meeting our customers needs, profitability, and cash flow generation while continuing to invest in R&D and new products that will further differentiate us in our markets. 
I'll now hand the call over to Dave, who will take you through the details of our financial performance in fiscal Q1, and will discuss our outlook for Q2. Following Dave's remarks, I will provide more details on our results, the trends we are seeing, and our strategy moving forward."

Before I start, please note that all numbers are non-GAAP, unless I state otherwise.First quarter revenue of $421.1 million was down 10.8% from the prior quarter, and up 2.4% when compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Revenues de",1740,"Thank you, Tom. Before I start, please note that all numbers are non-GAAP, unless I state otherwise.
First quarter revenue of $421.1 million was down 10.8% from the prior quarter, and up 2.4% when compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Revenues declined slightly in each of our business segments as expected. Book-to-bill for lasers was approximately 1. CommTest, Optical Communications, and AOT book-to-bill were each less than 1. Book-to-bill for the total company was also below 1. 
The first quarter's gross margin was 47.3% of revenue, up from the previous quarter's gross margin of 46.7% and relatively flat with first quarter fiscal 2011's gross margin. The sequential increase in gross margin was primarily due to segment mix and improved CommTest gross margins. Operating expenses for the first quarter of $152.9 million was down from the prior quarter's $162.3 million, primarily due to lower headcount in CommTest, a direct result of the previously announced restructuring activities and lower corporate spending.
The first quarter operating margin for the company was 10.9%, up from 10.8% for the year ago period, due to lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. Net income for the quarter was $40.9 million or $0.18 per share, which compares to $53.9 million or $0.23 per share for the prior fiscal quarter, and to $44.8 million or $0.20 per share for the year ago period. 
The year ago period benefited from a favorable tax provision. A detailed reconciliation of our non-GAAP results to our GAAP results is available in today's press release. Our non-GAAP operating income excludes, among other items, amortization of acquired technology and other intangibles of $21.2 million, an $11.6 million charge for stock-based compensation, and a $7.4 million accrual for a legal dispute. 
Including the noted items, the fiscal first quarter 2012 GAAP net loss was $5.8 million or a loss of $0.03 per share, which compares to a prior year first quarter GAAP net income of approximately $100,000, or break even earnings per share. Now looking at quarterly revenue by region.
Americas revenue of $212.4 million or 50% of total revenue was down $17.7 million from the prior quarter. The decrease was due primarily to CommTest experiencing lower demand due to macroeconomic conditions and typical summer seasonality. 
EMEA revenue of $101 million, or 24% of total revenue, was down $21.5 million compared to the prior quarter due primarily to seasonal demand in CommTest and inventory adjustments in Optical Communications business. Asia-Pacific revenue was $107.7 million or 26% of total revenue, down $12 million from the prior quarter. An increase in AOT and laser revenues was offset by a slight decline in CommTest revenue, as well as a decline in Optical Communications revenue, primarily driven by lower demand for gesture recognition component.
Moving to the segments. First to the CCOP segment. Total CCOP revenue was $180.3 million, down 10.9% from the prior quarter and within our guidance of down 10% to 13%. Gross margin was 32.3% and operating income was $25.6 million or 14.2% of revenue. The decline in operating profit was primarily due to lower optical revenue and gross margin. Geographically, our optical business saw strength in the Americas and a decline in Europe and Asia, whereas lasers saw a decline in the Americas, with solid growth in Asia and a slight increase in Europe.
Optical Communications revenue in fiscal Q1 was $150.1 million, down 14% when compared to the previous quarter's revenue and up 5% when compared to the prior year. 6 out of 12 product lines grew sequentially, including our pluggable products for LAN/SAN application. As expected, gesture recognition revenue declined to less than 2% of total JDSU revenue and accounted for more than 50% of the sequential decline in optical revenue. 
Revenue for ROADMs and tunable XFPs declined, primarily due to customer inventory correction. Quarterly ASP decline was 2.7%, which was below the midpoint of our historical range of 2% to 4% sequentially.
Gross margin for the quarter was 28.8%, down from the prior quarter's 31.1% and just below our target range of 30% to 35%. Gross margins declined due to product mix and lower volumes. Product lead times during the quarter were 4 to 6 weeks for the majority of our optical products, allowing our customers to respond better to their customer requirements.
We anticipate that lead times for our Fabrinet assembled products, due to the complications from the flooding, will be extended during Q2. This includes our ROADMs, our tunable XFPs, some of our amplifiers, and some of our other low volume products. 
In our lasers business, which includes not only Commercial Lasers, but also our photovoltaic business, first quarter revenue of $30.2 million was up 8.6% compared to the prior quarter, and up 20.8% compared to the prior year due to strength in our Q series solid state lasers, our CPV solar cells, and our recently introduced, 4 kW fiber laser. We recognized approximately $2 million of revenue from our kilowatt fiber laser in the quarter. Gross margins were 49.3%, up from the prior quarter, primarily due to growth in our solid-state lasers.
As a reminder, the majority of our commercial laser products are manufactured at Fabrinet in Thailand and is subject to supply chain disruption due to the flooding.
Finally, our targeted CCOP operating margins of 16% to 20% when revenues are above $190 million.
Now moving on to our CommTest segment. Fiscal Q1 revenue of $185.2 million was down 12.4% from the prior quarter's revenue due to macroeconomic conditions and typical summer seasonality. On a year-over-year basis, first quarter revenue was up 1.3%. On a sequential basis, each geographic region saw revenues decline, except Latin America, which had a slight increase. 
Fiscal Q1 gross margin for CommTest was 61.9%, which compares to a gross margin of 59.3% for the previous quarter and 60.7% for the year ago quarter. Gross margin improvement was mainly driven by favorable product mix, as 56% of CommTest revenue came from products introduced in the last 2 years. 
CommTest operating profit was $24.1 million or 13% of revenue, which compares to $21.7 million or 11.9% of revenue in the prior year. The higher operating margin was driven by higher gross margin. Our targeted CommTest operating model is for operating margins of 20% to 23% when revenues are greater than $215 million in gross margins are at or above the higher end of the 57% to 61% targeted range.
For the advanced optical technologies or AOT segment, fiscal Q1 revenue was $55.6 million, down 5.3% when compared to the prior quarter due to a decline in demand for our currency, transaction card, and gesture recognition product. As previously noted, demand for currency products will fluctuate according to the level of bank note printing. Fiscal Q1 gross margin for AOT business was 47.1%, down from 49.4% in the prior quarter due to volumes and product mix. 
AOT operating profit for the quarter was $17.5 million or 31.5% of revenues, down from 34.1% for the prior quarter due to the lower gross margin. The AOT target operating model is for operating margins of 32% to 35% when quarterly revenue is greater than $55 million.
As a reminder, JDSU's total company targeted operating margin range is 14% to 17% when quarterly revenues for the company are $460 million or greater and gross margins are 49% or higher.
Moving to the balance sheet. For fiscal Q1 2012, the company generated $22.9 million of cash from operations. Capital expenditures totaled $21.2 million, and at the end of fiscal Q1, the company held over $723.3 million in total cash and investments. Headcount as of October 1, 2011 was 4,929.
Now to our Q2 guidance. First, some points to consider as you think about our financial performance over the coming quarter. Based on our current visibility, we expect below normal seasonal revenue levels in CommTest, due to continued weak demand from EMEA service providers, and lower demand from Americas service providers, including little to no end of year budget flush. Therefore, we expect CommTest revenue to be flat to up 4% from the previous quarter. AOT revenues are also expected to be flat to up 4% sequentially.
For CCOP, we believe that the September quarter would have been the low point of revenue for the fiscal year, had the Thailand flooding not occurred. As we saw in the quarter, customer inventory levels during Q1 reduced to more targeted levels combined with stronger bookings. Without the impact of flooding in Thailand, we believe our Q2 CCOP revenue guidance would have been a sequential growth in the low to mid single-digit percent.
Given the current conditions in Thailand and the uncertainty of the ramp to full production, our revenue guidance for Q2 is for a sequential reduction of 15% to 25% from Q1. The 25% number being driven by an assumption of continued challenges in Thailand, and a slow and gradual return to production. 
While we are implementing our contingency plan and are encouraged by the events over the past week in Thailand, we cannot be assured that our plans will be successful, or the rate at which production will ramp, which leads us to this wide guidance range. This guidance estimates a $35 million to $45 million revenue impact due to the flood.
The company's operating expenses for Q2 are expected to increase by less than $5 million sequentially, primarily due to our annual employee merit increase and certain R&D investment activity. Now looking at operating margins for the segments.
CommTest operating margins are estimated to be between 12.5% and 14.5%. AOT operating margins are expected to be between 30% and 32%,  and CCOP operating margins, due to the wider revenue range and incremental costs being incurred to attempt to bring production back on, are expected to be between 3% and 7%. 
Axis, interest, and other income are expected to result in a net expense of $4 million to $6 million. Share count for calculating EPS is expected to be approximately 234 million shares. Capital equipment purchases will be approximately 5% of revenue. Given the current macro economic conditions and the impact on our CCOP business from the Thailand flooding, we are providing a broader guidance range for the December quarter. 
Taking into consideration the factors above, we expect second quarter revenue to be between $375 million and $405 million, and our non-GAAP operating margin to be between 5.5% and 8.5%. I will now turn the call back to Tom."

I will start with the CCOP segment, first Optical Communications. Innovation remains robust as we saw 67% of revenue from products less than 2 years old. ROADMs were 28% of optical revenue with strong booking. Book-to-bill was nearly 1, following 3 consecutive quarters of book-to-bill less than 1, due to the inventory build up. 
During the quarter, Infonetics identified JDSU as the leading provider of ROADM products for the first half of the calendar year at over 50% market share as we took significant share from a major competitor. In Q1, we also secured an increase in share at a major customer for our 50 gigahertz ROADM, expanding our leadership position into the second half of fiscal year '12. 
Tunable XFP revenue was 10% of optical revenue. Bookings were up 70% quarter-over-quarter and book-to-bill was over 1. Super Transport Blade revenues were up 18% and bookings increased by 28% quarter-over-quarter. 40G demand continues to gain momentum as we are winning new slots at the component level, and with our new 40G module. In the second half of FY '12, we will launch our coherent 40G solution line side module, and additional 40G client-side solutions to add to our existing portfolio.
100G design activity is also strong, and customers are engaging with us on new partnerships. In Q1, we increase our shipments of 100G coherent receivers and coherent modulators, and made significant progress in the development of our 100G coherent solutions and client-side solutions. Our vertical integration of 100G components provides us with a competitive advantage as we develop and introduce our 100G module solution. As we introduce these products over the next several quarters, we will provide additional updates.
For 40G and 100G applications, we currently have 18 design wins and 39 more in process with 20 customers. We continue to focus on our Optical Communications technology leadership with the development of new products. During the quarter, we announced a new suite of 5 products to be rolled out in the second half of calendar 2012, critical to the buildout of next-generation optical network, or what we are referring to as self-aware networks.
Self-aware networks are needed to support the growing volume of high-bandwidth and unpredictable traffic, and require new architecture and a new set of compact, high-performance, and cost-effective component. Our development of this product suite is based on several years of collaboration with customers to understand the requirements of next-generation networks. Included in this product portfolio is our twin WSS product, 2 independent, 1x20 WSSs integrated into a compact form factor. This co-packaging saves space and cost for the customer, and can support the needed colorless, directionless, and contentionless capabilities.
Now turning to our lasers business. In fiscal Q1, we achieved the highest revenue for this business in over 2 years. The growth is due to strength in solar, Q Series solid-state lasers and high-power fiber lasers for macromachining application. We are currently developing a second-generation suite of kilowatt fiber lasers with Amada due to strong end customer interest. We are also developing a fiber-based class of pulse lasers, which is expected to ship during the second half of calendar 2012.
Now the CommTest segment. CommTest performance for Q1 reflects solid operational progress evidenced by improved gross margins at 61.9% and lower operating expenses despite a softer spending environment as carriers are becoming more cautious with CapEx spending. Q1 revenue from products less than 2 years old represents 56% of total revenue, as we continue to collaborate closely with customers to bring innovation to the market. 
Macroeconomic conditions in Europe and North America are causing increased scrutiny of orders and delays in placement, but the fundamental demand for more bandwidth, access and quality improvement continue to grow. Asia-Pacific and Latin America are investing aggressively. Although we are seeing China starting to moderate the rate of build out, investment levels remain healthy. Bookings from high-growth markets increased 18% year-over-year, with strength in Brazil, China, Indonesia and Korea.
This quarter, we saw our customers spend more on access to support service activations for millions of new mobile, cable, and IPTV subscribers, as well as business ethernet deployments that push out our more discretionary spending for metro projects, and continued spending to upgrade the core to 100G to support the huge increases in content-heavy traffic.
On the access side, we are seeing momentum in our newly released HST module that test Bonded VDSL2/ADSL2 to support IPTV testing. Also, our investment in the T-BERD MTS-5800 is being well-accepted in high-growth markets, proving our success in developing products for these markets.
Our Fiber business, recognized by Frost & Sullivan as the worldwide leader in fiber tech, launched 5 new products during the quarter to support 14% year-on-year revenue growth. As carriers cope with increasing bandwidth demand, we continue to see strong traction for 100G test, shipping 26 units to 15 customers during the quarter. 
100G revenue in Q1 was up 41% year-on-year, and 11% sequentially. In the cable market, Infonetics projections for DOCSIS 3.0 deployment indicates 60% compounded annual growth rate for 2010 through 2015 for cable market subscribers. We saw strong year-over-year growth for our PathTrak product, and expect continued growth as DOCSIS 3.0 is deployed.
Our products are being recognized in the industry for their technology leadership. JDSU was honored with Frost & Sullivan's 2011 Global Customer Value Enhancement Award for JDSU's market-leading xDSL test solutions used by service providers worldwide to provide high-quality broadband services. Finally, JDSU earned high marks in Broadband Technology Reports' 2011 Diamond Technology Reviews for the roll our products play in ensuring customer quality for advanced broadband service deployment. 
During the quarter, we had 10 new product launches. Key launches of note are as follows: In fiber-optic, we launched ONMSi for remote fiber optic testing that allows service providers to achieve 30% less downtime by using our technology during troubleshooting than with conventional methods. 
We also introduced a new drive test solution for LTE test capabilities, which expands the range of LTE networks and equipment tested, allowing service providers to test with a single tool. We also introduced a new release of our award-winning smart protocol analyzer, this release brings enhanced LTE and 3G testing capabilities to help manufacturers develop LTE products faster, and service providers to build out networks more quickly, and operate them more effectively. 
Lastly, we introduced the first optical transport network multichannel test solution for 10G, 40G, and 100G network. This solution enables service providers to accelerate the development and deployment of high-speed OTN based equipment for more cost effective transmission of high-bandwidth traffic.
We will continue to support our customers' requirements and invest in R&D to keep our innovation pipeline strong to support test in major minutes with 3G and LTE mobility, video, IPTV, and broadband deployment.
Now onto our remaining segment, advanced optical technologies or AOT. Revenues for the quarter were impacted by the slowing global economy, especially in the currency and transaction part. We continue to invest in the growth of this highly profitable business, including the upgrade of our production capability and prevalent technology platforms to more efficiently produce security threat product, expected to come online in fiscal Q2. 
We are also increasing our production capacity to serve ramping demand of security pigment. This capacity addition is on plan and is scheduled to be commissioned by the end of fiscal Q4.

So is there going to be any adjustments to those price discussions that would impact the rate of change in pricing in the first quarter of next year or into the second quarter because of the tightness of supply as a result of the flooding? And second I know it's almost impossible to get your arms around the timing of when you're going to get that facility back up, but would you expect the costs associated with bringing the facility backup in Thailand to be a cost that increases beyond the December quarter and continues to impact you into the first quarter, or will those lines be up and running by the end of the year and therefore no incremental pressure? And conversely would you get that revenue back that you lost in the December quarter, in the first quarter, in a nonseasonal fashion as they make up for the lost orders in 1Q, or in the December quarter.

Second, with regards to the carryover of any revenue, we believe there will be some carryover of revenue. At the same time, as our customers will be looking for other folks that can meet their immediate needs, so that portion could potentially be diverted elsewhere and so it will really be a factor of how quickly we bring the revenue or the production lines back on track. As we noted in the call, as you asked about the costs rolling into December, we believe we can get the factory from what we know right now, to a higher level of production. Obviously, we'll have much more information week by week, and we expect by the end of the quarter, we'd be ramped up to full production, provided there are no other logistic issues that get -- that interfere with that.

I would say because of the fragmented nature of the CommTest market and the areas of -- that we see to be able to continue to build out in places like wireless and the LTE deployment, it does offer a number of opportunities for us that are pretty visible at this point. It doesn't mean we're not looking in the other 2 parts of our business, but I would say that there are -- tend to be more of those kind of opportunities in CommTest because of what I just mentioned."

Gross margins for the quarter improved from the prior quarter despite lower revenues. Operating expenses declined by over $9 million due to stringent cost controls, resulting in an operating margin of 10.9%, which exceeded our guidance range.
In fiscal Q1, new product revenue remains strong, with 67% of Optical Communications revenue and 56% of CommTest revenue being generated from products less than 2 years old. Additionally, our financial strength continued to provide us with the necessary capital to fund our robust new product pipeline, as cash generated from operations totaled $22.9 million.
On our last call, I highlighted that we expect some short-term revenue volatility due to uncertainty in the macro environment, and that optical customers were reducing their on-hand inventory levels. I'd like to provide an update on these topics, as well as some clarity on the impact with the recent flooding in Thailand.
Significant improvements in our optical customers' inventory levels have been made over the past 6 months. Q1 bookings for some of our key optical products were very encouraging. ROADM bookings were up nearly 25% from last quarter, and were the highest level in the last 3 quarters. Our tunable XFP bookings were up 70% from the prior quarter. 7 out of 12 product lines saw their bookings increase on a sequential basis.
Turning to the situation in Thailand, the floods have created a great deal of hardship on the Thai people, the infrastructure and the ability to do business in the affected areas. I am happy to report that all the JDSU employees in Thailand are safe but many of them have been displaced from their homes due to the flooding. We are doing what we can to help them through this situation.
As for the impact on our business, I'm happy to say that our equipment is safe and dry at this point. The water level at the Pinehurst, Fabrinet facility has been steadily subsiding, and over the past week has dropped by several inches, which is encouraging. Fabrinet has reported that power has been restored to the Pinehurst facilities, and that the equipment is being readied for production. 
We are also executing some of our contingency plans in an effort to maximize output to satisfy our customers' top priorities. The timing of achieving full production is still not certain, as water levels are still causing challenges with the infrastructure in the area, but we are very encouraged by the events of the past several days and expect to have some level of production within the next week or 2. While there are a number of logistical challenges, we have been able to ship some existing finished goods to our customers. Dave will talk more about the Thailand situation, when he updates you on our guidance shortly.
Moving on to demand for our products. Broadband drivers remain strong, however, the macro economic environment remains challenging and recent indicators have become more volatile since our last call. As a result, we are seeing our service provider customers implement lengthier CapEx approval processes, and we now expect little to no budget flush in the December quarter.
We cannot predict exactly how long the current macro economic conditions will impact our revenues or when the Fabrinet, Pinehurst facility in Thailand will be back in full production. At the same time, given the healthy underlying fundamentals of our business, we remain focused on meeting our customers needs, profitability, and cash flow generation while continuing to invest in R&D and new products that will further differentiate us in our markets. 
I'll now hand the call over to Dave, who will take you through the details of our financial performance in fiscal Q1, and will discuss our outlook for Q2. Following Dave's remarks, I will provide more details on our results, the trends we are seeing, and our strategy moving forward."

Before I start, please note that all numbers are non-GAAP, unless I state otherwise.First quarter revenue of $421.1 million was down 10.8% from the prior quarter, and up 2.4% when compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Revenues de",1740,"Thank you, Tom. Before I start, please note that all numbers are non-GAAP, unless I state otherwise.
First quarter revenue of $421.1 million was down 10.8% from the prior quarter, and up 2.4% when compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Revenues declined sequentially in each of our business segments as expected. Book-to-bill for lasers was approximately 1. CommTest, Optical Communications, and AOT book-to-bill were each less than 1. Book-to-bill for the total company was also below 1. 
The first quarter's gross margin was 47.3% of revenue, up from the previous quarter's gross margin of 46.7% and relatively flat with first quarter fiscal 2011's gross margin. The sequential increase in gross margin was primarily due to segment mix and improved CommTest gross margins. Operating expenses for the first quarter of $152.9 million was down from the prior quarter's $162.3 million, primarily due to lower headcount in CommTest, a direct result of the previously announced restructuring activities and lower corporate spending.
The first quarter operating margin for the company was 10.9%, up from 10.8% for the year ago period, due to lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. Net income for the quarter was $40.9 million or $0.18 per share, which compares to $53.9 million or $0.23 per share for the prior fiscal quarter, and to $44.8 million or $0.20 per share for the year ago period. 
The year ago period benefited from a favorable tax provision. A detailed reconciliation of our non-GAAP results to our GAAP results is available in today's press release. Our non-GAAP operating income excludes, among other items, amortization of acquired technology and other intangibles of $21.2 million, an $11.6 million charge for stock-based compensation, and a $7.4 million accrual for a legal dispute. 
Including the noted items, the fiscal first quarter 2012 GAAP net loss was $5.8 million or a loss of $0.03 per share, which compares to a prior year first quarter GAAP net income of approximately $100,000, or break even earnings per share. Now looking at quarterly revenue by region.
Americas revenue of $212.4 million or 50% of total revenue was down $17.7 million from the prior quarter. The decrease was due primarily to CommTest experiencing lower demand due to macroeconomic conditions and typical summer seasonality. 
EMEA revenue of $101 million, or 24% of total revenue, was down $21.5 million compared to the prior quarter due primarily to seasonal demand in CommTest and inventory adjustments in Optical Communications business. Asia-Pacific revenue was $107.7 million or 26% of total revenue, down $12 million from the prior quarter. An increase in AOT and laser revenues was offset by a slight decline in CommTest revenue, as well as a decline in Optical Communications revenue, primarily driven by lower demand for gesture recognition components.
Moving to the segments. First to the CCOP segment. Total CCOP revenue was $180.3 million, down 10.9% from the prior quarter and within our guidance of down 10% to 13%. Gross margin was 32.3% and operating income was $25.6 million or 14.2% of revenue. The decline in operating profit was primarily due to lower optical revenue and gross margin. Geographically, our optical business saw strength in the Americas and a decline in Europe and Asia, whereas lasers saw a decline in the Americas, with solid growth in Asia and a slight increase in Europe.
Optical Communications revenue in fiscal Q1 was $150.1 million, down 14% when compared to the previous quarter's revenue and up 5% when compared to the prior year. 6 out of 12 product lines grew sequentially, including our pluggable products for LAN/SAN application. As expected, gesture recognition revenue declined to less than 2% of total JDSU revenue and accounted for more than 50% of the sequential decline in optical revenue. 
Revenue for ROADMs and tunable XFPs declined, primarily due to customer inventory correction. Quarterly ASP decline was 2.7%, which was below the midpoint of our historical range of 2% to 4% sequentially.
Gross margin for the quarter was 28.8%, down from the prior quarter's 31.1% and just below our target range of 30% to 35%. Gross margins declined due to product mix and lower volumes. Product lead times during the quarter were 4 to 6 weeks for the majority of our optical products, allowing our customers to respond better to their customer requirements.
We anticipate that lead times for our Fabrinet assembled products, due to the complications from the flooding, will be extended during Q2. This includes our ROADMs, our tunable XFPs, some of our amplifiers, and some of our other low volume products. 
In our lasers business, which includes not only Commercial Lasers, but also our photovoltaic business, first quarter revenue of $30.2 million was up 8.6% compared to the prior quarter, and up 20.8% compared to the prior year due to strength in our Q series solid state lasers, our CPV solar cells, and our recently introduced, 4 kW fiber laser. We recognized approximately $2 million of revenue from our kilowatt fiber laser in the quarter. Gross margins were 49.3%, up from the prior quarter, primarily due to growth in our solid-state lasers.
As a reminder, the majority of our commercial laser products are manufactured at Fabrinet in Thailand and is subject to supply chain disruption due to the flooding.
Finally, our targeted CCOP operating margins of 16% to 20% when revenues are above $190 million.
Now moving on to our CommTest segment. Fiscal Q1 revenue of $185.2 million was down 12.4% from the prior quarter's revenue due to macroeconomic conditions and typical summer seasonality. On a year-over-year basis, first quarter revenue was up 1.3%. On a sequential basis, each geographic region saw revenues decline, except Latin America, which had a slight increase. 
Fiscal Q1 gross margin for CommTest was 61.9%, which compares to a gross margin of 59.3% for the previous quarter and 60.7% for the year ago quarter. Gross margin improvement was mainly driven by favorable product mix, as 56% of CommTest revenue came from products introduced in the last 2 years. 
CommTest operating profit was $24.1 million or 13% of revenue, which compares to $21.7 million or 11.9% of revenue in the prior year. The higher operating margin was driven by higher gross margin. Our targeted CommTest operating model is for operating margins of 20% to 23% when revenues are greater than $215 million in gross margins are at or above the higher end of the 57% to 61% targeted range.
For the advanced optical technologies or AOT segment, fiscal Q1 revenue was $55.6 million, down 5.3% when compared to the prior quarter due to a decline in demand for our currency, transaction card, and gesture recognition products. As previously noted, demand for currency products will fluctuate according to the level of bank note printing. Fiscal Q1 gross margin for AOT business was 47.1%, down from 49.4% in the prior quarter due to volumes and product mix. 
AOT operating profit for the quarter was $17.5 million or 31.5% of revenue, down from 34.1% for the prior quarter due to the lower gross margin. The AOT target operating model is for operating margins of 32% to 35% when quarterly revenue is greater than $55 million.
As a reminder, JDSU's total company targeted operating margin range is 14% to 17% when quarterly revenues for the company are $460 million or greater and gross margins are 49% or higher.
Moving to the balance sheet. For fiscal Q1 2012, the company generated $22.9 million of cash from operations. Capital expenditures totaled $21.2 million, and at the end of fiscal Q1, the company held over $723.3 million in total cash and investments. Headcount as of October 1, 2011 was 4,929.
Now to our Q2 guidance. First, some points to consider as you think about our financial performance over the coming quarter. Based on our current visibility, we expect below normal seasonal revenue levels in CommTest, due to continued weak demand from EMEA service providers, and lower demand from Americas service providers, including little to no end of year budget flush. Therefore, we expect CommTest revenue to be flat to up 4% from the previous quarter. AOT revenues are also expected to be flat to up 4% sequentially.
For CCOP, we believe that the September quarter would have been the low point in revenue for the fiscal year, had the Thailand flooding not occurred. As we saw in the quarter, customer inventory levels during Q1 reduced to more targeted levels combined with stronger bookings. Without the impact of flooding in Thailand, we believe our Q2 CCOP revenue guidance would have been a sequential growth in the low to mid single-digit percent.
Given the current conditions in Thailand and the uncertainty of the ramp to full production, our revenue guidance for Q2 is for a sequential reduction of 15% to 25% from Q1. The 25% number being driven by an assumption of continued challenges in Thailand, and a slow and gradual return to production. 
While we are implementing our contingency plans and are encouraged by the events over the past week in Thailand, we cannot be assured that our plans will be successful, or the rate at which production will ramp, which leads us to this wide guidance range. This guidance estimates a $35 million to $45 million revenue impact due to the flood.
The company's operating expenses for Q2 are expected to increase by less than $5 million sequentially, primarily due to our annual employee merit increase and certain R&D investment activity. Now looking at operating margins for the segments.
CommTest operating margins are estimated to be between 12.5% and 14.5%. AOT operating margins are expected to be between 30% and 32%,  and CCOP operating margins, due to the wider revenue range and incremental costs being incurred to attempt to bring production back on, are expected to be between 3% and 7%. 
Axis, interest, and other income are expected to result in a net expense of $4 million to $6 million. Share count for calculating EPS is expected to be approximately 234 million shares. Capital equipment purchases will be approximately 5% of revenue. Given the current macro economic conditions and the impact on our CCOP business from the Thailand flooding, we are providing a broader guidance range for the December quarter. 
Taking into consideration the factors above, we expect second quarter revenue to be between $375 million and $405 million, and our non-GAAP operating margin to be between 5.5% and 8.5%. I will now turn the call back to Tom."

I will start with the CCOP segment, first Optical Communications. Innovation remains robust as we saw 67% of revenue from products less than 2 years old. ROADMs were 28% of optical revenue with strong booking. Book-to-bill was nearly 1, following 3 consecutive quarters of book-to-bill less than 1, due to the inventory build up. 
During the quarter, Infonetics identified JDSU as the leading provider of ROADM products for the first half of the calendar year at over 50% market share as we took significant share from a major competitor. In Q1, we also secured an increase in share at a major customer for our 50 gigahertz ROADM, expanding our leadership position into the second half of fiscal year '12. 
Tunable XFP revenue was 10% of optical revenue. Bookings were up 70% quarter-over-quarter and book-to-bill was over 1. Super Transport Blade revenues were up 18% and bookings increased by 28% quarter-over-quarter. 40G demand continues to gain momentum as we are winning new slots at the component level, and with our new 40G module. In the second half of FY '12, we will launch our coherent 40G solution line-side module, and additional 40G client-side solutions to add to our existing portfolio.
100G design activity is also strong, and customers are engaging with us on new partnerships. In Q1, we increased our shipments of 100G coherent receivers and coherent modulators, and made significant progress in the development of our 100G coherent solutions and client-side solutions. Our vertical integration of 100G components provides us with a competitive advantage as we develop and introduce our 100G module solution. As we introduce these products over the next several quarters, we will provide additional updates.
For 40G and 100G applications, we currently have 18 design wins and 39 more in process with 20 customers. We continue to focus on our Optical Communications technology leadership with the development of new products. During the quarter, we announced a new suite of 5 products to be rolled out in the second half of calendar 2012, critical to the buildout of next-generation optical networks, or what we are referring to as self-aware networks.
Self-aware networks are needed to support the growing volume of high-bandwidth and unpredictable traffic, and require new architecture and a new set of compact, high-performance, and cost-effective components. Our development of this product suite is based on several years of collaboration with customers to understand the requirements of next-generation networks. Included in this product portfolio is our twin WSS product, 2 independent, 1x20 WSSs integrated into a compact form factor. This co-packaging saves space and cost for the customer, and can support the needed colorless, directionless, and contentionless capabilities.
Now turning to our lasers business. In fiscal Q1, we achieved the highest revenue for this business in over 2 years. The growth is due to strength in solar, Q Series solid-state lasers and high-power fiber lasers for macromachining application. We are currently developing a second-generation suite of kilowatt fiber lasers with Amada due to strong end customer interest. We are also developing a fiber-based class of pulse lasers, which is expected to ship during the second half of calendar 2012.
Now the CommTest segment. CommTest performance for Q1 reflects solid operational progress evidenced by improved gross margins at 61.9% and lower operating expenses despite a softer spending environment as carriers are becoming more cautious with CapEx spending. Q1 revenue from products less than 2 years old represents 56% of total revenue, as we continue to collaborate closely with customers to bring innovation to the market. 
Macroeconomic conditions in Europe and North America are causing increased scrutiny of orders and delays in placement, but the fundamental demand for more bandwidth, access and quality improvement continue to grow. Asia-Pacific and Latin America are investing aggressively. Although we are seeing China starting to moderate the rate of build out, investment levels remain healthy. Bookings from high-growth markets increased 18% year-over-year, with strength in Brazil, China, Indonesia and Korea.
This quarter, we saw our customers spend more on access to support service activations for millions of new mobile, cable, and IPTV subscribers, as well as business ethernet deployments that push out our more discretionary spending for metro projects, and continued spending to upgrade the core to 100G to support the huge increases in content-heavy traffic.
On the access side, we are seeing momentum in our newly released HST module that test Bonded VDSL2/ADSL2 to support IPTV testing. Also, our investment in the T-BERD MTS-5800 is being well-accepted in high-growth markets, proving our success in developing products for these markets.
Our Fiber business, recognized by Frost & Sullivan as the worldwide leader in fiber test, launched 5 new products during the quarter to support 14% year-on-year revenue growth. As carriers cope with increasing bandwidth demand, we continue to see strong traction for 100G test, shipping 26 units to 15 customers during the quarter. 
100G revenue in Q1 was up 41% year-on-year, and 11% sequentially. In the cable market, Infonetics projections for DOCSIS 3.0 deployment indicates 60% compounded annual growth rate for 2010 through 2015 for cable market subscribers. We saw strong year-over-year growth for our PathTrak product, and expect continued growth as DOCSIS 3.0 is deployed.
Our products are being recognized in the industry for their technology leadership. JDSU was honored with Frost & Sullivan's 2011 Global Customer Value Enhancement Award for JDSU's market-leading xDSL test solutions used by service providers worldwide to provide high-quality broadband services. Finally, JDSU earned high marks in Broadband Technology Reports' 2011 Diamond Technology Reviews for the roll our products play in ensuring customer quality for advanced broadband service deployment. 
During the quarter, we had 10 new product launches. Key launches of note are as follows: In fiber-optic, we launched ONMSi for remote fiber optic testing that allows service providers to achieve 30% less downtime by using our technology during troubleshooting than with conventional methods. 
We also introduced a new drive test solution for LTE test capabilities, which expands the range of LTE networks and equipment tested, allowing service providers to test with a single tool. We also introduced a new release of our award-winning smart protocol analyzer, this release brings enhanced LTE and 3G testing capabilities to help manufacturers develop LTE products faster, and service providers to build out networks more quickly, and operate them more effectively. 
Lastly, we introduced the first optical transport network multichannel test solution for 10G, 40G, and 100G networks. This solution enables service providers to accelerate the development and deployment of high-speed OTN based equipment for more cost effective transmission of high-bandwidth traffic.
We will continue to support our customers' requirements and invest in R&D to keep our innovation pipeline strong to support test in major minutes with 3G and LTE mobility, video, IPTV, and broadband deployment.
Now onto our remaining segment, advanced optical technologies or AOT. Revenues for the quarter were impacted by the slowing global economy, especially in the currency and transaction part. We continued to invest in the growth of this highly profitable business, including the upgrade of our production capability and prevalent technology platforms to more efficiently produce security threat product, expected to come online in fiscal Q2. 
We are also increasing our production capacity to serve ramping demand of security pigment. This capacity addition is on plan and is scheduled to be commissioned by the end of fiscal Q4. Both of these capital investments support the demand forecast from our banknote and security customer. We also continue to focus on 3D glasses and projector color wheels as growth drivers for this segment. Applications include cinema, 3D rides at theme parks, and education.

And second I know it's almost impossible to get your arms around the timing of when you're going to get that facility back up, but would you expect the costs associated with bringing the facility back up in Thailand to be a cost that increases beyond the December quarter and continues to impact you into the first quarter, or will those lines be up and running by the end of the year and therefore no incremental pressure? And conversely would you get that revenue back that you lost in the December quarter, in the first quarter, in a nonseasonal fashion as they make up for the lost orders in 1Q, or in the December quarter.
