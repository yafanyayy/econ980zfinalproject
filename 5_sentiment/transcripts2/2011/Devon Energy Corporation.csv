Welcome to Devon's Year End 2010 Earnings Call and Webcast. Today, we will follow our standard format. I will begin with a few preliminary items, and then I'll turn the call over to our President and C",659,"Thank you, operator, and good morning to, everyone. Welcome to Devon's Year End 2010 Earnings Call and Webcast. 
Today, we will follow our standard format. I will begin with a few preliminary items, and then I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO, John Richels. John's going to provide the highlights of 2010 and its thoughts on the year ahead. Following John's remarks, Dave Hager, our Executive Vice President of Exploration and Production will cover the operating highlights as well as our 2011 capital program. And then finally, Jeff Agosta, our CFO, will finish up the review of the year's financial results in our guidance for 2011. At that point, we'll open the call to your questions. I'd like to point out that we have our Executive Chairman, Larry Nichols, and other members of the senior management team with us for the Q&A session. As usual, we'll conclude the call in about an hour. And if we get to your question during the call, our IR staff will be around the rest of the date to take any follow-up.
As always, we ask each participant to limit his or her question to one initial inquiry and we'll follow up, and we'll attempt to enforce that. 
A replay of this call will be available later today through a link on our Home page. That's www.devonenergy.com. After the call today, we'll fire a Form 8-K that will provide our full year detailed forecast for operating items, as well as our capital plans for 2011. And the guidance section of the Devon website will contain a copy of the 8-K, along with any other forward-looking estimates that we mention on the call. To access that information, just click on the Guidance link found within the Investor Relations section of the Devon website.
Before we get to the business of the call, we are obligated to remind you that the discussions today of our expectations, plans, forecasts and estimates are all considered forward-looking statements under U.S. securities law. And while we always strive to give you the very best estimates possible, there are many factors that could cause our actual results to differ from these estimates. For a discussion of those risk factors, see the Form 8-K that we are following today. 
One other note, we refer to various non-GAAP performance measures in today's call. When we use these measures, U.S. securities law require us to provide certain additional disclosures. Those disclosures are available for your review on our website as well.  
Before we jump into the call, I have a couple of things to remind everybody up. First, our strategic position and took us out of the Gulf of Mexico and International business triggered accounting rules for discontinued operations. However, the accounting standards for discontinued operations and do not apply to our Gulf of Mexico divestitures. So that creates a confusing situation. While we've excluded in the international production volumes for all periods presented and collapsed the revenues and expenses associated with the international operations into the discontinued ops line item on the income statement, the results from our that divested Gulf of Mexico operations are included in our continuing operations for the portion of 2010 up to the point of sale of those assets. For that reason, we're providing supplemental information in our press release today that isolates our results from go-forward North America onshore operations.
Similar to the last several quarters, the accounting treatment for discontinued ops affected the comparability of earnings estimates from the Street during the fourth quarter. However, and now by this time, most analysts are reporting fourth quarter estimates for continuing operations only. The first call mean of those analysts that forecasted continuing ops was $1.40 a share. And that our actual results of non-GAAP earnings of $1.46 per share exceeded those expectations by $0.06. 
With those items out of the way, I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO, John Richels."
266510,111214317,103597,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2011",2011-02-16,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you Vince, and good morning, everyone. Throughout 2010, we undertook the strategic repositioning of Devon by selling our international and Gulf of Mexico properties to focus solely on North America. The process has gone extremely well. And today,",1176,"Thank you Vince, and good morning, everyone. 
Throughout 2010, we undertook the strategic repositioning of Devon by selling our international and Gulf of Mexico properties to focus solely on North America. The process has gone extremely well. And today, we're reporting some very good results, which reflect our continued commitment to capital discipline and cost management and, as you know, ultimately, we're focused on maximizing our share per returns. 
We are emerging from the repositioning in a very enviable situation. The depth and breadth of Devon's North America property portfolio provide many years of visible economic growth and a good balance between liquids and natural gas. Our asset base underpins our confidence that we can deliver strong growth in oil and liquids over the next several years from opportunities that we have already captured within our asset portfolio. Furthermore, we have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry, and we're in a position to supplement our top line growth and enhance our per share returns with our stock buyback program.
Looking now to some of the specific highlights of 2010. We entered into sale contracts for our Gulf of Mexico and international assets, with proceeds expected to top $10 billion, far exceeding initial expectations. Essentially, all of these transactions have closed with the exception of Brazil. 
In the midst of the repositioning, we generated outstanding results from our go-forward North American business. North American Onshore oil and gas production grew to 619,000 barrels equivalent per day in the fourth quarter. That's up 8% from the year-ago quarter when we announced the repositioning.
The repositioning also drove cost savings across several expense categories in 2010. This included general and administrative expenses, which declined 13%. Reported net earnings for 2010 were $4.6 billion or $10.31 per diluted share. That's the highest reported earnings per share in Devon's history.
Cash flow before balance sheet changes climbed 21% over the prior year to $5.7 billion. And when you combine that with almost $7 billion in divestiture proceeds received to date, Devon's total cash inflows approach $13 billion in 2010. 
With that cash flow, we funded our E&P and Midstream capital budgets, including $1.2 billion of acreage capture focused on oil and liquids-rich plays. 
We retired $1.8 billion of debt, ending the year with a near-bulletproof balance sheet And with net debt adjusted capitalization ratio of 10%, including cash on hand of $3.4 billion.
And in addition to our capital program and debt reduction, we also returned more than $1.4 billion to our shareholders through our stock buyback program in dividend payments. 
In 2010, we repurchased over 18 million shares. We've continued to be active in the market subsequent to year end. And through lastly, we had repurchased a total of 23.5 million shares or just over 5% of our outstanding shares. With an aggregate cost of $1.6 billion, this gives us an average cost to date of $69.60 per share. 
Finally, we had another strong year of company-wide reserve growth. We added 464 million barrels, boosting year-end proved reserves to an all-time record of 2.9 million barrels. This means that our North American reserve additions more than replace all of the years production and the roughly 200 million barrels of proved reserves associated with our divestiture. We ended 2010 with record proved reserves in spite of selling properties worth more than 20% of our enterprise value during the year.
Looking more closely at the 2010 reserve activities. Our drill-bit reserve additions, so that includes discoveries, extensions and performance revisions for our go-forward North American Onshore business, totaled 389 million BOE. These additions were 175% of our 2010 North American Onshore production. 
When we announced the $500 million pipe joint venture with BP, you member that's our joint venture in the oil sands in Canada, we said that our 2010 drill-bit F&D would likely come in between $14 and $16 per barrel. Following that announcement, we stepped up our acreage capture $700 million an acreage in the Permian Basin and in our Cana play and on other undisclosed new place been our total acreage capture for the year up to $1.2 billion. This resulted in total drill bit capital of $6.1 billion, including capitalized G&A and interest. And in spite of the additional acreage capture, our organic North American Onshore finding and development cost came in and line with the original estimate at $15.74 per BOE. This positive result is because our drill-bit reserve additions far exceeded our original estimate. 
It's worth noting that we achieved our 2010 F&D results without increasing our percentage of proved undeveloped reserves. In fact, on December 31, our North America onshore undeveloped reserves accounted for just 29% of total proved.
It's important to remember that the one-year F&D cost of the somewhat arbitrary. I'll remind you that we reported our 2009 results, we told you that the $6.59 per barrel F&D cost for 2009 was unrealistically low. If you combine our 2009 and 2010 results for the go-forward business, you're right that an average F&D for the two years of a little over $10.60 per barrel, so very competitive result even with the unusually large acreage acquisition in 2010.
Price revisions for our North American Onshore properties give us a net positive boost in 2010 of adding another 71 million barrels. Positive gas-price related revisions principally from the Barnett Shale more than offset negative price revisions related to higher oil prices and the sliding scale royalty impact on our thermal oil sands in Canada. This underscores the value of a balanced portfolio of properties. Taking into account the net price revisions, our total North American Onshore reserve additions from all sources were 464 million BOEs, more than double our North American production.
That boosted Devon's North American Onshore reserves to 2.9 billion equivalent representing 9% growth over year-end 2009. And that's important, because this reserve growth really supports our future production growth. 
Looking to 2011, we're forecasting our North American Onshore production to total between 236 million and 240 million equivalent barrels. This implies a growth of 6% to 8% over our 2010 production of 223 million equivalent barrels. The preliminary forecast that we provided last November called for a 20% increase in oil and liquids production for 2011. However, updated liquids yield data from some of our emerging plays has resulted in a slight shift in the gas to liquids ratio. We now expect our 2011 production growth to be driven by oil and liquids growth in the high teens.
Before I turn the call over to Dave, I'd like to update you on the status of the $3.2 billion sale of our assets in Brazil to BP. While we'd expected this transaction to close in 2010, we have not yet received approval from the government of Brazil. However, we've seen nothing that would lead us to believe that these transaction will not ultimately be approved. 
So with that, I will turn the call over to David Hager for a review of our quarterly operating highlights and our 2011 capital budget. Dave?"
266510,111214317,103597,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2011",2011-02-16,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Our growth in reserves and production reflect the outstanding results achieved with our 2010 capital program. We drilled 1,584 wells onshore in North America, including 1,493 development wells and 91 exploration wells",2407,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Our growth in reserves and production reflect the outstanding results achieved with our 2010 capital program. We drilled 1,584 wells onshore in North America, including 1,493 development wells and 91 exploration wells. Almost all of the wells were successful. We exited the year with 71 Devon-operated rigs running. And today, at the height of our winter drilling program in Canada, we have 90 rigs running.
Let's look now at some of our areas, area by area -- look at some of the area by area highlights. At our Jackfish thermal oil project in Eastern Alberta, our fourth quarter daily production averaged 22,200 barrels per day net of royalties,  That Jackfish rate volumes that were curtailed in early December is a result of outages in the pipeline system have been restored, and production at Jackfish is currently running about 30,000 barrels per day, net of royalties, the level we expected to average in the first quarter. More than three years into production, Jackfish continues to be one of the best-performing projects in the industry as measured by both production per well and by steam oil ratio.
Construction of Jackfish 2 is now complete, with total capital expenditures to start up presented under just $1 billion. Plant commissioning activities are underway, and we expect to begin injecting steam in the second quarter of this year. We expect to deliver first oil late this year, with production ramping up throughout 2010.
Review of our regulatory application for Jackfish 3 is currently underway. Pending approval, we could begin site work around your and with plant startups targeted for 2015. Detailed engineering work continues, and we have all major equipment orders in place. Devon operates Jackfish projects and owned 100% working interest.
With the initial phase of Jackfish running near capacity and now major turnarounds schedule in 2011, we expect our thermal oil production to grow nearly 3 million barrels over 2010 level to about 12 million barrels in 2011. 
At Pike, our oil sands joint venture with BP, we began appraisal drilling in the fourth quarter, and plan to drill about 150 core wells as this winter. We also are acquiring some 60 miles of 3D seismic data. This drilling and seismic information will help us determine the optimum development configuration for the initial phase of development. We hope to begin the regulatory process for the first phase of Pike around the and the of the year. 
In aggregate, we plan to spend about $600 million on our thermal all Sands project in 2011, as we continue toward the goal of growing our net oil production to between 150,000 to 175,000 barrels per day by 2020.
This represents roughly a 20% compound annual growth rate in production through the end of the decade. 
At year end, we had 440 million barrels of reserves booked in our thermal oil sands. As we move through the development of Jackfish and Pike projects, we expect about roughly 1 billion additional barrels of that resource.
In our oil play in Alberta, we drilled 57 new wells in the fourth quarter, which brought our full year total to 191 wells. In 2011, we plan to spend about $100 million drilling approximately 170 wells in the area, allowing us to hold production steady at roughly 40,000 barrels equivalent per day.
Also in Canada, in 2011, we plan to spend about $150 million testing more than a half dozen different oil and liquids-rich gas plays that we have identified across our vast land base. This includes fractured oil shales, tight oil carbonates and plastics and tight oil Deep Basin. Specifically, we plan to drill 13 wells this year testing the Viking oil play on our 900,000 acres of fee title lands in the area of Saskatchewan. 
In the Deep Basin of Alberta, where we have nearly 600,000 net acres, we will drill several wells targeting the Cardium light oil play and the liquids-rich lower zones including the formation. These are just a few of the areas we'll be testing in 2011 to better understand the potential for commercial success in these new plays across our vast Canadian acreage position. We will keep you updated as we move forward.
Shifting to the Rocky Mountains, we are currently testing the oil potential in our 220,000-net acre position in the Powder River Basin. We are in the early stages of evaluating several Cretaceous oil objectives, including the Niobrara. In 2011, we plan to spend about $50 million and drill 15 wells testing these play concepts.
Moving to the Permian Basin, our net production averaged 45,000 oil equivalent barrels per day in the fourth quarter, up 16% over the fourth quarter of 2009. Our fourth quarter oil NGL production at Permian was up 23% over 2009 and accounted for 73% of our total Permian volumes. We continue to be very active in the Basin, with 17 operated rigs running. 
In 2011, we expect to spend $650 million and drill about 300 wells in the Permian. Growth from our Permian assets is expected to contribute approximately 3 million barrels of liquids growth over 2000 levels to 14 million barrels in 2011.
In our Wolfberry light oil play, we currently have six operated rigs running. Since drilling our first Wolfberry well in late 2008, we have drilled more than 140 wells, allowing us to derisk large portions of our 197,000 perspective net acres. Our drilling results to date support the EURs of between 100,000 and 150,000 barrels of oil per well across roughly 160,000 net acres. 
On our 37,000 net acres located on the northern part of the play, we had marginal success. However, this acreage has potential in some additional zones. In 2011, we plan to spend $250 million in the Wolfberry and drill approximately 125  wells from our inventory of more than 1,000 locations.
Also in the Permian Basin, in Avalon Shale play, we are currently running four rigs. Devon has assembled over 200,000 prospective net acres in this condensate and liquids-rich as play. Although we are still in the early stages of evaluation and drilling results have varied depending on location within the broader play area, we are beginning to see some trends. 
In the fourth quarter, we drilled three Devon-operated wells in the central portion of the play. One of these wells was brought online with an average 30-day IP rate of 360 barrels of condensate per day and 1.7 million cubic feet of gas per day. In 2011, we plan to spend $160 million in the Avalon and drill about 75 wells, as we continue to delineate the play on our acreage position.
Elsewhere in the Permian, we've continued to see solid results in the Bone Springs oil play, where Devon have 170,000 net acres. In the fourth quarter, we brought four Bone Spring wells online in average 30-day IP rate of more than 400 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We have three rigs running in play and plan to spend $85 million to drill approximately 45 Bone Springs wells in 2011.
Our four remaining operated rigs in the Permian are targeting conventional formations. This includes objectives such as the Delaware, Wolfcamp a clear and Wichita Albany accessing, primarily with horizontal wells. 
In the fourth quarter, we drilled some very strong conventional wells, including a Delaware horizontal well on our unit that came online with the 30-day IP rate of 700 barrels of oil per day. 
In 2011, we plan to spend a little over $100 million and drill 50 wells in these conventional targets.
Moving north to the Texas Panhandle, where Devon has assembled approximately 62,000 net acres in the Granite Wash play, we stepped up drilling activity during the quarter with the addition of a fourth rate that was relocated from the Barnett. In the fourth quarter, we brought five Devon-operated wells online, with average IP rates of 2,730 oil equivalent barrels per day, including 580 barrels of oil and 870 barrels of NGLs.
Production history from our Cherokee Granite Wash wells continue to support EURs of about 1 million barrels equivalent. At roughly $7 million to drill and complete, these wells generate outstanding full cycle rates of return. In 2011, we plan to spend $175 million and drill 55 wells with an average working interest of about 50%. Our activity in the Granite Wash is expected to contribute approximately 1 million barrels to our company-wide year-over-year liquids growth.
Moving to the Cana-Woodford Shale in Western Oklahoma, we continue to add to our acreage position during the fourth quarter and now have approximately 243,000 net acres. Devon is currently operating 23 out of the 39 rigs running play-wide. 
In the fourth quarter, we continued to aggressively derisk our position and secure the term acreage we acquired last year. 
We continue to see outstanding results from Cana. In the fourth quarter, we brought 21 operated wells online, with average five-day IP rates of 4.9 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including an average of 66 barrels of condensate and 174 barrels of NGLs. Fourth quarter net production from Cana averaged a record 137 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day, with over 20% of this production stream coming from condensate and NGLs. This is a 17% increase on a sequential quarter basis.
I also want to briefly update you on the status of our Cana infill pilot program we initiated last year in the core area. Production history from our 500-foot spaced wells continue to perform while, supporting an 8 Bcf type curve. These results support that we have eight to 10 wells per section and less the likely spacing in the core area. However, to date, we have only booked five wells per section in the core area.
From a reserves performance perspective, Cana was a leading growth area for the company in 2010. Extensions, discoveries and performance revisions at Cana accounted for 105 million BOE of additions. Related drill-bit capital was $729 million, including roughly 200 million of additional acreage capture. 
At your end, we had 175 million equivalent barrels booked at Cana-Woodford. With some 11 Bcf equivalent of risk resource potential, and more than 5,000 risk locations remaining, we expect many years of highly economic production and reserve growth from Cana.
In December of 2010, we began processing gas in our new Cana liquids extraction plant. The facility has an initial processing capacity of 200 million cubic feet per day and is capable of extracting up to 15,000 barrels of liquid per day. The plan is expandable to 600 million per day inlet capacity as we grow Cana volumes. This facility allows us to capture additional value from their liquids-rich Cana gas stream.
In 2011, we plan to invest over $800 million of capital and drill more than 200 wells. By year end, we expect our net production from Cana to reach 250 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including 14,000 barrels per day of condensate and NGLs. This will contribute approximately 2.5 million barrels to our company-wide year-over-year liquids growth.
Shifting to the Barnett Shale field in North Texas. In the fourth quarter, our net production held steady at a record 1.2 Bcf equivalent per day, including over 42,000 barrels of NGLs and per day. We continue to achieve outstanding results in the Barnett, with pad drilling and improved drilling efficiency. 
In 2010, we are able to offset rising service costs by further reducing the number of days it takes to drill a well. In 2010, we averaged just 13.3 days from spud to rig release, down from 14.4 days in 2009. In the fourth quarter, we completed a 21-well drilling program from a single pad in which we averaged just 10.6 days from spud to spud. 
From a reserve performance perspective, extensions, discoveries and performance revisions in the Barnett Shale accounted for 112 million barrels of additions, including 26 million barrels of positive performance revisions. This marks a the seventh consecutive year of upward performance revisions in the Barnett that, in aggregate, total over to 30 million barrels. Drill-bit additions more than replaced our Barnett production of 70 million equivalent barrels for the year. Related drill-bit capital was $1.1 billion. At year end, we had to 1.1 million barrels equivalent booked in the Barnett, with thousands of remaining unbooked locations.
In 2011, we plan to invest about $900 million of capital in the Barnett, running a 12-rig program. This will result in us drilling 300-operated Barnett wells and participating in about 25 non-operated wells. 
The 2011 program is focused on the liquids-rich areas of the play. This level of activity will allow us to generate significant free cash flow and maintain current production levels. Our expected year-over-year production growth in the Barnett should add approximately 2.5 million barrels to our company-wide year-over-year liquids growth.
When you step back and look at the overall results of our 2010 capital program, you see that from both the perspectives of both reserve additions and productions trajectory, the results were very get. What is not reflected in these numbers is the tremendous resource capture beyond proved reserves we accomplished over the last year. 
Last August, we told you that we had acquired 260,000 net acres in new plays that we are not ready to discuss. Our goal was to identify and establish large first-mover position in a highly economic plays that had not yet become competitive. Since that time, we have continued building these positions and now have roughly 750,000 acres and a handful of new plays. 
In 2011, we have allocated roughly $200 million of capital to continue building these positions, acquire seismic and test several of these new play concepts. While it is unlikely that all of these plays will be successful, we are excited about the potential and expect to have positive news later this year. 
In total, we expect our full year 2011 E&P capital expenditures to be between $4.5 billion and $4.9 billion for our North American Onshore business. As John mentioned, with that level of spending, we expect overall production growth of 6% to 8%, led by high teens growth in oil and NGL volumes. When you add roughly $1 billion for capitalized G&A and interest, Midstream and other corporate capital, our total 2011 capital amounts are expected to fall between $5.4 billion to $6 
billion. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff Agosta for the financial review and outlook. Jeff?"

As Vince mentioned earlier, we have reclassified the assets, li",1729,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. 
Today, we will begin by looking at some of the key drivers that impacted our 2010 financial results and provide commentary on our outlook for 2011. As Vince mentioned earlier, we have reclassified the assets, liabilities and results of operations from our international assets and to discontinued operations for all accounting periods presented.
Our fourth quarter results from continuing operations represent just our North American Onshore business or, in other words, the results of the repositioned Devon. However, it is important to note that our reported fully results from continuing operations do include a partial year of results from our non-divested Gulf assets. 
Let's begin by production. For 2011, Devon's reported production totaled 228 million oil equivalent barrels. This includes approximately 5 million barrels of production from our now divested Gulf of Mexico properties. Excluding the Gulf production, you'll find our North America onshore assets produced 223 million barrels during the year. This result represents a 3 million-barrel increase over 2009, which was driven entirely by higher oil and NGL production. 
Looking specifically at the fourth quarter of 2010, Devon produced 56.9 million equivalent barrels or approximately 619,000 barrels per day. This is about 6,000 barrels per day shy of our guidance range due to a number of minor operational issues which reduced our fourth quarter production by approximately 11,000 barrels per day. These included volume curtailments attributable to Enbridge pipeline outage, other third-party facility outages and delays in the well completions. 
In spite of these curtailments, when compared to last year's fourth quarter production from our North American Onshore asset exhibited strong year-over-year growth of 46,000 barrels per day or 8%. 
Increased oil production from our Permian Basin properties and growth from our liquids-rich Barnett and Cana shale plays drove this results. 
Our 2011 budget calls for the first quarter production of 630,000 barrels equivalent per day, up slightly from the fourth quarter. However, continued curtailments due to third-party facility outages and unusually severe winter weather in Texas and the Mid-Continent region have negatively impacted first quarter production by about 1 million barrels or approximately 10,000 barrels per day. That production has now been restored, and we are currently producing approximately 630,000 barrels per day. Assuming no additional surprises, positive or negative, we would now expect first quarter reported production to average 615,000 to 625,000 barrels per day. 
Looking beyond the first quarter, we expect production to increase in each of the remaining quarters of 2011. The plan calls for the biggest jump in the second quarter, up to 645,000 to 655,000 barrels per day as we tie in a large well pad and liquids-rich area of the Barnett and we begin to see the impact of the increased activity levels in Cana and the Permian Basin. 
Moving to price realizations. It was another strong quarter for oil. The WTI benchmark price rose steadily throughout the fourth quarter and averaged $85.15 per barrel. Our company-wide realized price came in at $68.35 in the fourth quarter or 80% of WTI, right at the midpoint of our guidance. The escalating oil price environment boosted our fourth quarter realized price by almost 10% over the previous quarter and our full year realized oil price by 27%. 
On in the natural gas side, the Henry Hub Index average $3.84 per Mcf for the fourth quarter. Our realized gas price before the impact of hedges came in at 87% of Henry Hub or $3.32. We had fourth quarter hedges totaling 1.6 Bcf per day or nearly 2/3 of our natural gas production, with a weighted average protected price of $5.87.
Cash settlements from our hedging position increased our average realized price by $1.32 to an all-in realized price of $4.64 per Mcf. 
For natural gas liquids, in the fourth quarter, we realized in price improved to $34.65 per barrel or just over 40% of the WTI Index. An increase in seasonal demand combined with higher overall prices led to a 19% increase in realized prices over the third quarter of 2010. 
For the full year of 2011, we expect Devon's realized NGL price to range between 35% and 40% of the WTI benchmark price. We expect continued supply growth from the industry to keep downward pressure on NGL pricing in 2011.
Taking a brief look at our hedging positions, for the first quarter of 2011, we now have approximately 784 million cubic feet per day swap at a weighted average price of $5.43. For the full year, we have an average of 730 million cubic feet per day swap at an average price of $5.49. In aggregate, this hedging position represents roughly 30% of our expected natural gas production for the year.
To facilitate a portion of this hedge position, we sold call options on 19,500 barrels of oil per day for 2011 and 2012 at $95 per barrel.And call options on $588 million cubic feet per day of gas for 2012 at $6 per Mcf.
Additionally, we now have collars in place, covering 45,000 barrels of oil per day with a weighted average floor of $75 an average ceiling of $109. We will be posting a hedging schedule on our website after the call that will provide some more detail on these hedge positions.
Turning now to our Marketing and Midstream division. Our Marketing and Midstream operations once again produced another high-quality quarter, generating $127 million of operating profit, bringing our full year operating profit to $510 million. Increased gas throughput and strong cost control drove our solid performance. 
Looking ahead to 2011, we expect our full year operating profit for our Midstream division to be between $485 million and $535 million.
Turning to expenses. In the fourth quarter, lease operating expenses were right in line with our expectations at $418 million or $7.36 per barrel produced. In spite of higher Canadian dollar exchange rates and upward pressure on oilfield services and supply, our LOE per BOE remained flat when compared to the third quarter. 
Looking forward to 2011, we expect industry inflation to continue. As a result, we are forecasting a moderate increase in LOE to a range of $7.50 to $7.90 per BOE.
For 2010, Devon's full year DD&A expense for oil and gas properties also came in at $7.36 per BOE, a 6% decline from last year. Overall, our DD&A rate benefited from the sale of our Gulf assets. We anticipate that our DD&A rate will increase to a range of $7.40 to $8 per barrel in 2011.
Moving to G&A expense. The company did a very good job of controlling G&A costs during 2010. As John said for the full year, our reported G&A expenses totaled $563 million. That is a decrease of $85 million or 13% versus 2009. This significant reduction in G&A is entirely attributable to the operational efficiencies achieved through our strategic repositioning. We expect our 2011 G&A expense per BOE to remain roughly flat with 2010.
Turning to interest expense. For 2010, it totaled $363 million, right in line with our expectations and up slightly from 2009. However, it's important to note that our 2010 interest expense included a onetime $19 million charge related to the early retirement of senior notes that we repaid in June. Excluding this charge, interest expense actually declined by $5 million as compared to 2009.  As we look forward to 2011, we expect our interest expense to decline to a range of $300 million to $340 million.
The final expense item I would like to touch on is income taxes. Devon's adjusted full year 2010 income tax rate came in at 32% of pretax earnings, comprised of a 2% current tax rate and a 30% deferred rate. As we discussed in last quarter's conference call, additional carryover benefits from prior year tax return led to a lower-than-forecasted current tax rate in 2010. These carryover benefits and the accelerated depreciation provisions that were passed into law in December also reduced our adjusted fourth quarter current tax rate. 
In Q4, our current tax rate was a negative 12%, and deferred taxes were 42% of pretax income, for an overall adjusted tax rate of 30%. Looking to 2011, we would expect an income tax rate similar to that of 2010, with less than a third of the tax expense being current. 
Cutting to the bottom line, for the full year 2010, our adjusted earnings from continuing operations were an impressive $2.5 billion or $5.75 per diluted share. Higher oil and gas revenues and strong cost control, combined with a reduced share count, increased diluted earnings per share by nearly 80% over 2009. 
In the fourth quarter, our adjusted earnings from continuing ops came in at $1.46 per diluted share. As Vince mentioned, this result exceeded the mean earnings estimate by about $0.06.
Before we open the call to Q&A, I would like to conclude with a quick review of our financial position. 
As John mentioned, cash flow from operations and proceeds of asset sales close to date approach $13 billion. During the year, we deployed our cash inflows to fund all of our capital investments, resulting in a greatly expanded reserve base and midstream infrastructure on enhancing our long-term growth prospects.
In addition to our capital program, we also repaid $1.8 billion of debt and returned more than $1.4 billion to our shareholders through our stock buyback program and dividend payments. 
Devon ended the year with one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. At December 31, our debt had declined to $5.6 million, and cash on hand was a $3.4 billion. 
While Devon clearly possesses a great deal of financial strength and flexibility, we are fully committed to exercising capital discipline, maximizing our margins, maintaining our balance sheet strength and optimizing our growth per debt-adjusted share. The upcoming year is a great example of how our disciplined approach to the business will benefit our shareholders.
Our focus on maximizing returns on our capital investments is leading to top line production growth of 6% to 8% in 2011. We expect our shareholder-friendly initiatives of stock buybacks and debt reduction to boost our debt-adjusted production per share to a double-digit growth rate. We believe this disciplined per share growth we are delivering in 2011 will compare very favorably to our peers. 
At this point, I will turn the call over back to Vince for the Q&A."

And that's in a depressed natural gas and liquids environment. I'd also point out that a lot of our growth is black oil. Our largest liquids growth areas in 2011 are the Permian and Jackfish. 3/4 of our Permian growth will be oil, not NGLs. Or of our total liquid growth in the Permian will be oil and not NGL.

I would point out to you that in the fourth quarter, we slowdown our share repurchases for the months of October and November as we finalized our capital budget and our updated our outlook for commodity prices going forward. Then we were back in the market in a big way in December and so far in the first quarter of this year. When we announced the share buyback, we said we fully expect it to complete it. However, we would continue to weigh our options and as the commodity price outlook changed and what was available within our portfolio change, we would attempt to optimize growth per share by making the correct allocation between capital projects and share repurchases. While we are updating our view for 2011, we thought it was prudent to be out of the market. Now that we've set our 2011 capital budget and updated our outlook for commodity prices, we're in there pretty aggressively. I'd point out to you that the $88 a share where our stock opened today or close to that, we're paying about $12 a barrel, which is down quite a bit because of all the reserves that we added at your and 2010. So we think on a relative basis, this is still a great buy, and we are on track to complete the repurchase program within the authorization period. And in the absence of some big change in expectations, we'd expect to complete it. John, do you have anything to add to that?"

Welcome to Devon's year-end 2010 earnings call and webcast. 
Today, we will follow our standard format. I will begin with a few preliminary items and then I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO, John Richels. John's going to provide the highlights of 2010 and his thoughts on the year ahead. Following John's remarks, Dave Hager, our Executive Vice President of Exploration and Production, will cover the operating highlights as well as our 2011 capital program. And then finally, Jeff Agosta, our CFO, will finish up with a review of the year's financial results and our guidance for 2011. At that point, we'll open the call to your questions. I'd like to point out that we have our Executive Chairman, Larry Nichols, and other members of the senior management team with us today for the Q&A session. As usual, we'll conclude the call in about an hour. And if we don't get to your question during the call, the IR staff will be around the rest of the day to take any follow-up. As always, we ask each participant to limit his or her question to one initial inquiry and one follow-up, and we'll attempt to enforce that. 
A replay of this call will be available later today through a link on our Home page. That's devonenergy.com. After the call today, we'll file a Form 8-K. That will provide our full year detailed forecast for operating items, as well as our capital plans for 2011. And the guidance section of the Devon website will contain a copy of the 8-K, along with any other forward-looking estimates that we mention on the call. To access that information, you just click on the Guidance link found within the Investor Relations section of the Devon website.
Before we get to the business of the call, we are obligated to remind you that the discussions today of our expectations, plans, forecasts and estimates are all considered forward-looking statements under U.S. Securities Law. And while we always strive to give you the very best estimates possible, there are many factors that could cause our actual results to differ from these estimates. For a discussion of those risk factors, see the Form 8-K that we're filing today. 
One other note, we refer to various non-GAAP performance measures in today's call. When we use these measures, U.S. securities law requires us to provide certain additional disclosures. Those disclosures are available for your review on our website as well.  
Before we jump into the call, I have a couple of things to remind everybody of. First, our strategic repositioning that took us out of the Gulf of Mexico and international businesses triggered accounting rules for discontinued operations. However, the accounting standards for discontinued ops do not apply to our Gulf of Mexico divestitures, so that creates a confusing situation. While we've excluded the international production volumes for all periods presented and collapsed the revenues and expenses associated with the international operations into the discontinued ops line item on the income statement, the results from our divested Gulf of Mexico operations are included in our continuing operations for the portion of 2010 up to the point of sale of those assets. For that reason, we're providing supplemental information in our press release today that isolates our results from go-forward North American onshore operations.
Similar to the last several quarters, the accounting treatment for discontinued ops affected the comparability of earnings estimates from TheStreet during the fourth quarter. However, now by this time, most analysts are reporting fourth quarter estimates for continuing operations only. The first call mean [ph] of those analysts that forecasted continuing ops was $1.40 a share. And our actual results of non-GAAP earnings of $1.46 per share exceeded those expectations by $0.06. With those items out of the way, I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO, John Richels."
266510,111214317,103780,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2011",2011-02-16,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Throughout 2010, we undertook the strategic repositioning of Devon by selling our international and Gulf of Mexico properties to focus solely on North America. The process has gone extremely well. And today, w",1188,"Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Throughout 2010, we undertook the strategic repositioning of Devon by selling our international and Gulf of Mexico properties to focus solely on North America. The process has gone extremely well. And today, we are reporting some very good results, which reflect our continued commitment to capital discipline and cost management and as you know, ultimately, we are focused on maximizing our per share returns. 
We're emerging from the repositioning in a very enviable situation. The depth and breadth of Devon's North American property portfolio provides many years of visible economic growth and a good balance between liquids and natural gas. Our asset base underpins our confidence, that we can deliver strong growth in oil and liquids over the next several years from opportunities that we have already captured within our asset portfolio. Furthermore, we have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry, and we're in a position to supplement our top line growth and enhance our per share returns with our stock buyback program.
Looking now to some of the specific highlights of 2010. We entered into sale contracts for our Gulf of Mexico and international assets, with proceeds expected to top $10 billion, far exceeding initial expectations. Essentially, all of these transactions have closed with the exception of Brazil. 
In the midst of the repositioning, we generated outstanding results from our go-forward North American business. North American onshore oil and gas production grew to 619,000 barrels equivalent per day in the fourth quarter. That's up 8% from the year-ago quarter when we announced the repositioning.
The repositioning also drove cost savings across several expense categories in 2010. This included general and administrative expenses, which declined 13%. Reported net earnings for 2010 were $4.6 billion or $10.31 per diluted share. That's the highest reported earnings per share in Devon's history.
Cash flow before balance sheet changes climbed 21% over the prior year to $5.7 billion. And when you combine that with almost $7 billion in divestiture proceeds received to date, Devon's total cash inflows approach $13 billion in 2010. With that cash flow, we funded our E&P and Midstream capital budgets, including $1.2 billion of acreage capture focused on oil and liquids-rich plays. 
We retired $1.8 billion of debt, ending the year with a near-bulletproof balance sheet and with debt and net debt as adjusted capitalization ratio of 10%, including cash on hand of $3.4 billion. And in addition to our capital program and debt reduction, we also returned more than $1.4 billion to our shareholders through our stock buyback program in dividend payments. 
In 2010, we repurchased over 18 million shares. We've continued to be active in the market subsequent to year end. And through last week, we had repurchased a total of 23.5 million shares or just over 5% of our outstanding shares. With an aggregate cost of $1.6 billion, this gives us an average cost to date of $69.60 per share. 
Finally, we had another strong year of company-wide reserve growth. We added 464 million barrels, boosting year-end proved reserves to an all-time record of 2.9 billion barrels. This means that our North American reserve additions more than replace all of the year's production and the roughly 200 million barrels of proved reserves associated with our divestiture. We ended 2010 with record proved reserves in spite of selling properties worth more than 20% of our enterprise value during the year.
Looking more closely at the 2010 reserve activities. Our drill-bit reserve additions, so that includes discoveries, extensions and performance revisions for our go-forward North American Onshore business, total of 389 million Boe. These additions were 175% of our 2010 North American Onshore production. 
When we announced the $500 million pipe joint venture with BP -- you'll remember that's our joint venture in the oil sands in Canada, we said that our 2010 drill-bit F&D would likely come in between $14 and $16 per barrel. Following that announcement, we stepped up our acreage capture and spent another $700 million an acreage in the Permian Basin and in our Cana play and on other undisclosed new plays, bringing our total acreage capture for the year up to $1.2 billion. This resulted in total drill-bit capital of $6.1 billion, including capitalized G&A and interest. And in spite of the additional acreage capture, our organic North American Onshore finding and development cost came in, in line with the original estimate at $15.74 per Boe. This positive result is because our drill-bit reserve additions far exceeded our original estimate. 
It's worth noting that we achieved our 2010 F&D results without increasing our percentage of proved undeveloped reserves. In fact, at December 31, our North American onshore undeveloped reserves accounted for just 29% of total proved.
It's important to remember that the one-year F&D cost can be somewhat arbitrary. I will remind you that when we reported our 2009 results, we told you that the $6.59 per barrel F&D cost for 2009 was unrealistically low. If you combine our 2009 and 2010 results for the go-forward business, you arrive at an average F&D for the two years of a little over $10.60 per barrel, some very competitive result even with the unusually large acreage acquisitions in 2010.
Price revisions for our North American Onshore properties gave us a net positive boost in 2010, adding another 71 million barrels. Positive gas-price related revisions principally from the Barnett Shale more than offset negative price revisions related to higher oil prices and the sliding scale royalty impact on our thermal oil sands in Canada. This underscores the value of a balanced portfolio of properties. Taking into account the net price revisions, our total North American Onshore reserve additions from all sources were 464 million Boes, more than double our North American production. That boosted Devon's North American Onshore reserves to 2.9 billion equivalent barrels, representing 9% growth over year-end 2009. And that's important, because this reserve growth really supports our future production growth. 
Looking to 2011, we're forecasting our North American Onshore production to total between 236 million and 240 million equivalent barrels. This implies a growth of 6% to 8% over our 2010 production of 223 million equivalent barrels. The preliminary forecast that we provided last November called for a 20% increase in oil and liquids production for 2011. However, updated liquids yield data from some of our emerging plays has resulted in a slight shift in the gas to liquids ratio. We now expect our 2011 production growth to be driven by oil and liquids growth in the high teens.
Before I turn the call over to Dave, I'd like to update you on the status of the $3.2 billion sale of our assets in Brazil to BP. While we had expected this transaction to close in 2010, we have not yet received approval from the government of Brazil. However, we've seen nothing that would lead us to believe that this transaction will not ultimately be approved. 
So with that, I will turn the call over to Dave Hager for a review of our quarterly operating highlights and our 2011 capital budget. Dave?"
266510,111214317,103780,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2011",2011-02-16,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Our growth in reserves and production reflect the outstanding results achieved with our 2010 capital program. We drilled 1,584 wells onshore in North America, including 1,493 development wells and 91 exploration wells",2437,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Our growth in reserves and production reflect the outstanding results achieved with our 2010 capital program. We drilled 1,584 wells onshore in North America, including 1,493 development wells and 91 exploration wells. Almost all of the wells were successful. We exited the year with 71 Devon-operated rigs running. And today, at the height of our winter drilling program in Canada, we have 90 rigs running.
Let's look now at some of our areas, area by area -- look at some of the area by area highlights. At our Jackfish thermal oil project in Eastern Alberta, our fourth quarter daily production averaged 22,200 barrels per day net of royalties. The Jackfish volumes that were curtailed in early December is a result of outages on the Enbridge pipeline system have been restored, and production at Jackfish is currently running about 30,000 barrels per day, net of royalties, the level we expect to average in the first quarter. More than three years into production, Jackfish continues to be one of the best-performing Side B [ph] projects in the industry as measured by both production per well and by steam oil ratio.
Construction of Jackfish 2 is now complete, with total capital expenditures to start up projected to come in at just under $1 billion. Plant commissioning activities are underway, and we expect to begin injecting steam in the second quarter of this year. We expect to deliver first oil late this year, with production ramping up throughout 2012.
Review of our regulatory application for Jackfish 3 is currently underway. Pending approval, we could begin site work around year-end, with plant startup targeted for 2015. Detailed engineering work continues, and we have all major equipment orders in place. Devon operates all the Jackfish projects and owned 100% working interest.
With the initial phase of Jackfish running near capacity and no major turnarounds scheduled in 2011, we expect our thermal oil production to grow nearly 3 million barrels over 2010 level to about 12 million barrels in 2011. 
At Pike, our Side B [ph] oil sands joint venture with BP, we began appraisal drilling in the fourth quarter and plan to drill about 150 stratigraphic core wells this winter. We also are acquiring some 60 miles of 3D seismic data. This drilling and seismic information will help us determine the optimum development configuration for the initial phase of development. We hope to begin the regulatory process for the first phase of Pike around the end of the year. 
In aggregate, we plan to spend about $600 million on our thermal oil sands project in 2011, as we continue toward the goal of growing our net Side B [ph] oil production to between 150,000 to 175,000 barrels per day by 2020. This represents roughly a 20% compound annual growth rate in Side B [ph] production through the end of the decade. 
At year end, we had 440 million barrels of reserves booked in our thermal oil sands. As we move through the development of Jackfish and Pike projects, we expect to book roughly 1 billion additional barrels of net resource.
In our Lloydminster oil play in Alberta, we drilled 57 new wells in the fourth quarter, which brought our full year total to 191 wells. In 2011, we plan to spend about $100 million drilling approximately 170 wells in the Lloydminster area, allowing us to hold production steady at roughly 40,000 barrels equivalent per day.
Also in Canada, in 2011, we plan to spend about $150 million testing more than a half dozen different oil and liquids-rich gas plays that we have identified across our vast land base. This includes fractured oil shales, tight oil carbonates and tight oil plastics in the Deep Basin. Specifically, we plan to drill 13 wells this year testing the Viking-like oil play on our 900,000 acres of feed title lands in the Kindersley area of Saskatchewan. 
In the Deep Basin of Alberta, where we have nearly 600,000 net acres, we will drill several wells targeting the Cardium light oil play and the liquid-rich lower Cretaceous zones including the Cadomin Formation. These are just a few of the areas we'll be testing in 2011 to better understand the potential for commercial success in these new plays across our vast Canadian acreage position. We will keep you updated as we move forward.
Shifting to the Rocky Mountains, we are currently testing the oil potential on our 220,000-net acre position in the Powder River Basin. We are in the early stages of evaluating several Cretaceous oil objectives, including the Parkman and Niobrara. In 2011, we plan to spend about $50 million and drill 15 wells testing these play concepts.
Moving to the Permian Basin, our net production averaged 45,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day in the fourth quarter, up 16% over the fourth quarter of 2009. Our fourth quarter oil NGL production at Permian was up 23% over 2009 and accounted for 73% of our total Permian volumes. We continue to be very active in the Basin with 17 operated rigs running. 
In 2011, we expect to spend $650 million and drill about 300 wells in the Permian. Growth from our Permian assets is expected to contribute approximately 3 million barrels of liquids growth over 2010 levels to 14 million barrels in 2011.
In our Wolfberry light oil play, we currently have six operated rigs running. Since drilling our first Wolfberry well in late 2008, we have drilled more than 140 wells, allowing us to derisk large portions of our 197,000 perspective net acres. Our drilling results to date support EURs of between 100,000 and 150,000 barrels of oil per well across roughly 160,000 net acres. 
On our 37,000 net acres located in the northern part of the play, we have had marginal success. However, this acreage has potential in some additional zones. In 2011, we plan to spend $250 million in the Wolfberry and drill approximately 125  wells from our inventory of more than 1,000 risk locations.
Also in the Permian Basin, in the Avalon Shale play, we are currently running four rigs. Devon has assembled over 200,000 prospective net acres in this condensate and liquids-rich gas play. Although we are still in the early stages of evaluation and drilling results have varied depending on the location within the broader play area, we are beginning to see some trends. 
In the fourth quarter, we drilled three Devon-operated wells in the central portion of the play. One of these wells was brought online with an average 30-day IP rate of 360 barrels of condensate per day and 1.7 million cubic feet of gas per day. In 2011, we plan to spend $160 million in the Avalon and drill about 75 wells, as we continue to delineate the play on our acreage position.
Elsewhere in the Permian, we continue to see solid results from the Bone Springs oil play, where Devon has 170,000 net acres. In the fourth quarter, we brought four Bone Spring wells online with an average 30-day IP rate of more than 400 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We have three rigs running in play and plan to spend $85 million to drill approximately 45 Bone Springs wells in 2011.
Our four remaining operated rigs in the Permian are targeting conventional formations. This includes objectives such as the Delaware, Wolfcamp, Clear Fork [ph] and Wichita-Albany, they were accessing primarily with horizontal wells. 
In the fourth quarter, we drilled some very strong conventional wells, including a Delaware horizontal well on our cut-and-dry unit that came online with a 30-day IP rate of 700 barrels of oil per day. In 2011, we plan to spend a little over $100 million and drill 50 wells in these conventional targets.
Moving north to the Texas Panhandle, where Devon has assembled approximately 62,000 net acres in the Granite Wash play, we stepped up drilling activity during the quarter with the addition of a fourth rig that was relocated from the Barnett. In the fourth quarter, we brought five Devon-operated wells online, with average IP rates of 2,730 oil equivalent barrels per day, including 580 barrels of oil and 870 barrels of NGLs.
Production history from our Cherokee Granite Wash wells continue to support EURs of about 1 million barrels equivalent. At roughly $7 million to drill and complete, these wells generate outstanding full-cycle rates to return. In 2011, we plan to spend $175 million and drill 55 wells with an average working interest of about 50%. Our activity in the Granite Wash is expected to contribute approximately 1 million barrels to our company-wide year-over-year liquids growth.
Moving to the Cana-Woodford Shale in Western Oklahoma, we continue to add to our acreage position during the fourth quarter and now have approximately 243,000 net acres. Devon is currently operating 23 out of the 39 rigs running play-wide. 
In the fourth quarter, we continued to aggressively derisk our position and secure the term acreage we acquired last year. We continue to see outstanding results from Cana. In the fourth quarter, we brought 21 operated wells online, with average five-day IP rates of 4.9 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including an average of 66 barrels of condensate and 174 barrels of NGLs. Fourth quarter net production from Cana averaged a record 137 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day, with over 20% of this production stream coming from condensate and NGLs. This is a 17% increase on a sequential quarter basis.
I also want to briefly update you on the status of our Cana infill pilot program we initiated last year in the core area. Production history from our 500-foot spaced wells continue to perform well, supporting an 8 Bcf type curve. These results support that we have eight to 10 wells per section and that's a likely spacing in the core area. However, to date, we have only booked five wells per section in the core area.
From a reserves performance perspective, Cana was a leading growth area for the company in 2010. Extensions, discoveries and performance revisions at Cana accounted for 105 million Boe of additions. Related drill-bit capital was $729 million, including roughly 200 million of additional acreage capture. 
At your end, we had 175 million equivalent barrels booked at Cana-Woodford. With some 11 Tcf equivalent of risk resource potential, and more than 5,000 risk locations remaining, we expect many years of highly economic production and reserve growth from Cana.
In December of 2010, we began processing gas in our new Cana liquids extraction plant. The facility has an initial processing capacity of 200 million cubic feet per day and is capable of extracting up to 15,000 barrels of liquids per day. The plan is expandable to 600 million per day inlet capacity as we grow Cana volumes. This facility allows us to capture additional value from the liquid-rich Cana gas stream.
In 2011, we plan to invest over $800 million of capital and drill more than 200 wells. By year end, we expect our net production from Cana to reach 250 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including 14,000 barrels per day of condensate and NGLs. This will contribute approximately 2.5 million barrels to our company-wide year-over-year liquids growth.
Shifting to the Barnett Shale field in North Texas. In the fourth quarter, our net production held steady at a record 1.2 Bcf equivalent per day, including over 42,000 barrels of NGLs and condensate per day. We continue to achieve outstanding results from the Barnett, with pad drilling and improved drilling efficiency. 
In 2010, we were able to offset rising service costs by further reducing the number of days it takes to drill a well. In 2010, we averaged just 13.3 days from spud to rig release, down from 14.4 days in 2009. In the fourth quarter, we completed a 21-well drilling program from a single pad in which we averaged just 10.6 days from spud to spud. 
From a reserve performance perspective, extensions, discoveries and performance revisions in the Barnett Shale accounted for 112 million barrels of additions, including 26 million barrels of positive performance revisions. This marks a the seventh consecutive year of upward performance revisions in the Barnett that, in aggregate, total over 230 million barrels. Drill-bit additions more than replaced our Barnett production of 70 million equivalent barrels for the year. Related drill-bit capital was $1.1 billion. At year end, we had 1.1 million barrels equivalent booked in the Barnett, with thousands of remaining unbooked locations.
In 2011, we plan to invest about $900 million of capital in the Barnett, running a 12-rig program. This will result in us drilling 300-operated Barnett wells and participating in about 25 non-operated wells. 
The 2011 program is focused on the liquids-rich areas of the play. This level of activity will allow us to generate significant free cash flow and maintain current production levels. Our expected year-over-year production growth in the Barnett should add approximately 2.5 million barrels to our company-wide year-over-year liquids growth.
When you step back and look at the overall results of our 2010 capital program, you see that from both the perspectives of both reserve additions and production trajectory, the results were very good. What is not reflected in these numbers is the tremendous resource capture beyond proved reserves that we accomplished over the last year. 
Last August, we told you that we had acquired 260,000 net acres in new plays that we are not ready to discuss. Our goal was to identify and establish large first-mover positions in highly economic plays that had not yet become competitive. Since that time, we have continued building these positions and now have roughly 750,000 acres and a handful of new plays. 
In 2011, we have allocated roughly $200 million of capital to continue building these positions, acquire seismic and test several of these new play concepts. While it is unlikely that all of these plays will be successful, we are excited about the potential and expect to have positive news later this year. 
In total, we expect our full year 2011 E&P capital expenditures to be between $4.5 billion and $4.9 billion for our North American Onshore business. As John mentioned, with that level of spending, we would expect overall production growth of 6% to 8%, led by high teens growth in oil and NGL volumes. When you add roughly $1 billion for capitalized G&A and interest, Midstream and other corporate capital, our total 2011 capital amounts are expected to fall between $5.4 billion to $6 
billion. 
With that, I would turn the call over to Jeff Agosta for the financial review and outlook. Jeff?"
266510,111214317,103780,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2011",2011-02-16,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Today, we will begin by looking at some of the key drivers that impacted our 2010 financial results and provide commentary on our outlook for 2011. As Vince mentioned earlier, we have reclassified the assets, liab",1737,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Today, we will begin by looking at some of the key drivers that impacted our 2010 financial results and provide commentary on our outlook for 2011. As Vince mentioned earlier, we have reclassified the assets, liabilities and results of operations from our international assets and to discontinue the operations for all accounting periods presented.
Our fourth quarter results from continuing operations represent just our North American Onshore business or in other words, the results of the repositioned Devon. However, it is important to note that our reported full year results from continuing operations do include a partial year of results from our now divested Gulf assets. 
Let's begin with production. For 2010, Devon's reported production totaled 228 million oil equivalent barrels. This includes approximately 5 million barrels of production from our now divested Gulf of Mexico properties. Excluding the Gulf production, you will find that our North American Onshore assets produced 223 million barrels during the year. This result represents a 3 million-barrel increase over 2009, which was driven entirely by higher oil and NGL production. 
Looking specifically at the fourth quarter of 2010, Devon produced 56.9 million equivalent barrels or approximately 619,000 barrels per day. This is about 6,000 barrels per day shy of our guidance range due to a number of minor operational issues, which reduced our fourth quarter production by approximately 11,000 barrels per day. These included volume curtailments attributable to the Enbridge pipeline outage, other third-party facility outages and delays in well completions. In spite of these curtailments, when compared to last year's fourth quarter production from our North American Onshore assets exhibited strong year-over-year growth of 46,000 barrels per day or 8%. Increased oil production from our Permian Basin properties and growth from our liquids-rich Barnett and Cana Shale plays drove this result. 
Our 2011 budget calls for first quarter production of 630,000 barrels equivalent per day, up slightly from the fourth quarter. However, continued curtailments due to third-party facility outages and unusually severe winter weather in Texas and the mid-continent region have negatively impacted first quarter production by about 1 million barrels or approximately 10,000 barrels per day. That production has now been restored, and we are currently producing approximately 630,000 barrels per day. Assuming no additional surprises, positive or negative, we would now expect first quarter reported production to average 615,000 to 625,000 barrels per day. 
Looking beyond the first quarter, we expect production to increase in each of the remaining quarters of 2011. The plan calls for the biggest jump in the second quarter, up to 645,000 to 655,000 barrels per day as we tie in a large well pad and the liquids-rich area of the Barnett, and we'd begin to see the impact of the increased activity levels in Cana and the Permian Basin. 
Moving to price realizations. It was another strong quarter for oil. The WTI benchmark price rose steadily throughout the fourth quarter and averaged $85.15 per barrel. Our company-wide realized price came in at $68.35 in the fourth quarter or 80% of WTI, right at the midpoint of our guidance. The escalating oil price environment boosted our fourth quarter realized price by almost 10% over the previous quarter and our full year realized oil price by 27%. 
On the natural gas side, the Henry Hub Index averaged $3.84 per Mcf for the fourth quarter. Our realized gas price before the impact of hedges came in at 87% of Henry Hub or $3.32. We had fourth quarter hedges totaling 1.6 Bcf per day or nearly 2/3 of our natural gas production, with a weighted average protected price of $5.87. Cash settlements from our hedging position increased our average realized price by $1.32 to an all-in realized price of $4.64 per Mcf. 
For natural gas liquids, in the fourth quarter, our realized NGL price improved to $34.65 per barrel or just over 40% of the WTI Index. An increase in seasonal demand combined with higher overall prices led to a 19% increase in realized prices over the third quarter of 2010. 
For the full year of 2011, we expect Devon's realized NGL price to range between 35% and 40% of the WTI benchmark price. We expect continued supply growth from the industry to keep downward pressure on NGL pricing in 2011.
Taking a brief look at our hedging positions, for the first quarter of 2011, we now have approximately 784 million cubic feet per day swapped at a weighted average price of $5.43. For the full year, we have an average of 730 million cubic feet per day swapped at an average price of $5.49. In aggregate, this hedging position represents roughly 30% of our expected natural gas production for the year.
To facilitate a portion of this hedge position, we sold call options on 19,500 barrels of oil per day for 2011 and 2012 at $95 per barrel, and call options on 588 million cubic feet per day of gas for 2012 at $6 per Mcf.
Additionally, we now have collars in place, covering 45,000 barrels of oil per day with a weighted average floor of $75 an average ceiling of $109. We will be posting a hedging schedule on our website after the call that will provide some more detail on these hedge positions.
Turning now to our Marketing and Midstream division. Our Marketing and Midstream operations once again produced another high-quality quarter, generating $127 million of operating profit, bringing our full year operating profit to $510 million. Increased gas throughput and strong cost control drove our solid performance. Looking ahead to 2011, we expect our full year operating profit for our Midstream division to be between $485 million and $535 million.
Turning to expenses. In the fourth quarter, lease operating expenses were right in line with our expectations at $418 million or $7.36 per barrel produced. In spite of higher Canadian dollar exchange rates and upward pressure on oilfield services and supply, our LOE per Boe remained flat when compared to the third quarter. Looking forward to 2011, we expect industry inflation to continue. As a result, we are forecasting a moderate increase in LOE to a range of $7.50 to $7.90 per Boe.
For 2010, Devon's full year DD&A [depreciation, depletion and amortization] expense for oil and gas properties also came in at $7.36 per Boe, a 6% decline from last year. Overall, our DD&A rate benefited from the sale of our Gulf assets. We anticipate that our DD&A rate will increase to a range of $7.40 to $8 per barrel in 2011.
Moving to G&A expense. The company did a very good job of controlling G&A costs during 2010. As John said, for the full year, our reported G&A expenses totaled $563 million. That is a decrease of $85 million or 13% versus 2009. This significant reduction in G&A is entirely attributable to the operational efficiencies achieved through our strategic repositioning. We expect our 2011 G&A expense per Boe to remain roughly flat with 2010.
Turning to interest expense. For 2010, it totaled $363 million, right in line with our expectations and up slightly from 2009. However, it's important to note that our 2010 interest expense included a one-time $19 million charge related to the early retirement of senior notes that we repaid in June. Excluding this charge, interest expense actually declined by $5 million as compared to 2009.  As we look forward to 2011, we expect our interest expense to decline to a range of $300 million to $340 million.
The final expense item I would like to touch on is income taxes. Devon's adjusted full year 2010 income tax rate came in at 32% of pretax earnings, comprised of a 2% current tax rate and a 30% deferred rate. As we discussed in last quarter's conference call, additional carryover benefits from a prior-year tax return led to a lower-than-forecasted current tax rate in 2010. These carryover benefits and the accelerated depreciation provisions that were passed into law in December also reduced our adjusted fourth quarter current tax rate. 
In Q4, our current tax rate was a negative 12% and deferred taxes were 42% of pretax income for an overall adjusted tax rate of 30%. Looking to 2011, we would expect an income tax rate similar to that of 2010 with less than a third of the tax expense being current. 
Cutting to the bottom line. For the full year 2010, our adjusted earnings from continuing operations were an impressive $2.5 billion or $5.75 per diluted share. Higher oil and gas revenues and strong cost control, combined with a reduced share count, increased diluted earnings per share by nearly 80% over 2009. 
In the fourth quarter, our adjusted earnings from continuing ops came in at $1.46 per diluted share. As Vince mentioned earlier, this result exceeded the mean earnings estimate by about $0.06. Before we open the call to Q&A, I would like to conclude with a quick review of our financial position. 
As John mentioned, cash flow from operations and proceeds of asset sales closed to date approached $13 billion. During the year, we deployed our cash inflows to fund all of our capital investments, resulting in a greatly expanded reserve base and Midstream infrastructure while enhancing our long-term growth prospects.
In addition to our capital program, we also repaid $1.8 billion of debt and returned more than $1.4 billion to our shareholders through our stock buyback program and dividend payments. 
Devon ended the year with one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. At December 31, our debt had declined to $5.6 million and cash on hand was $3.4 billion. 
While Devon clearly possesses a great deal of financial strength and flexibility, we're fully committed to exercising capital discipline, maximizing our margins, maintaining our balance sheet strength and optimizing our growth per debt-adjusted share. The upcoming year is a great example of how our disciplined approach to the business will benefit our shareholders.
Our focus on maximizing returns on our capital investments is leading to top line production growth of 6% to 8% in 2011. We expect our shareholder-friendly initiatives of stock buybacks and debt reduction to boost our debt-adjusted production per share to a double-digit growth rate. We believe this disciplined per share growth we are delivering in 2011 will compare very favorably to our peers. At this point, I will turn the call back over to Vince for the Q&A."

They're in Pike that we talked about. And then, we have another 13 deployed across the rest of Canada. The more liquids-rich ones will be about three in the Lloyd area there and then we're also testing some concepts, as I mentioned, some exploration concepts that are liquids-rich there. We have about 23 located in Cana that are primarily drilling the liquids-rich portion of the play and the extension of the play to the northwest from our core. We have 13 right now in the Barnett. They are concentrating on the liquids-rich portion. And four in the Granite Wash. We also go into our Texas Gulf Coast area. We have four rigs working in the Carthage area, around an area we have traditionally high return pud program that we're executing there, proved and undeveloped program. One in Groesbeck, one in North Louisiana and one in South Texas. And then particularly in the more liquids-rich and oil-rich area of the Permian Basin, we have 17 rigs working there. I detailed where those are located in the call pretty well. I think it's six -- and they move around a little bit. But it's roughly six in the Wolfberry, four in the Avalon Shale, three in the Bone Springs and four growing out of conventional targets.

As usual, we'll conclude the call in about an hour. And if we don't get to your question during the call, the IR staff will be around the rest of the day to take any follow-up. As always, we ask each participant to limit his or her question to one initial inquiry and one follow-up, and we'll attempt to enforce that. 
A replay of this call will be available later today through a link on our Home page. That's devonenergy.com. After the call today, we'll file a Form 8-K. That will provide our full year detailed forecast for operating items, as well as our capital plans for 2011. And the guidance section of the Devon website will contain a copy of the 8-K, along with any other forward-looking estimates that we mention on the call. To access that information, you just click on the Guidance link found within the Investor Relations section of the Devon website.
Before we get to the business of the call, we are obligated to remind you that the discussions today of our expectations, plans, forecasts and estimates are all considered forward-looking statements under U.S. Securities Law. And while we always strive to give you the very best estimates possible, there are many factors that could cause our actual results to differ from these estimates. For a discussion of those risk factors, see the Form 8-K that we're filing today. 
One other note, we refer to various non-GAAP performance measures in today's call. When we use these measures, U.S. securities law requires us to provide certain additional disclosures. Those disclosures are available for your review on our website as well.  
Before we jump into the call, I have a couple of things to remind everybody of. First, our strategic repositioning that took us out of the Gulf of Mexico and international businesses triggered accounting rules for discontinued operations. However, the accounting standards for discontinued ops do not apply to our Gulf of Mexico divestitures, so that creates a confusing situation. While we've excluded the international production volumes for all periods presented and collapsed the revenues and expenses associated with the international operations into the discontinued ops line item on the income statement, the results from our divested Gulf of Mexico operations are included in our continuing operations for the portion of 2010 up to the point of sale of those assets. For that reason, we're providing supplemental information in our press release today that isolates our results from go-forward North American onshore operations.
Similar to the last several quarters, the accounting treatment for discontinued ops affected the comparability of earnings estimates from TheStreet during the fourth quarter. However, now by this time, most analysts are reporting fourth quarter estimates for continuing operations only. The first call mean [ph] of those analysts that forecasted continuing ops was $1.40 a share. And our actual results of non-GAAP earnings of $1.46 per share exceeded those expectations by $0.06. With those items out of the way, I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO, John Richels."
266510,111214317,103862,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2011",2011-02-16,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Throughout 2010, we undertook the strategic repositioning of Devon by selling our international and Gulf of Mexico properties to focus solely on North America. The process has gone extremely well. And today, w",1188,"Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Throughout 2010, we undertook the strategic repositioning of Devon by selling our international and Gulf of Mexico properties to focus solely on North America. The process has gone extremely well. And today, we are reporting some very good results, which reflect our continued commitment to capital discipline and cost management and as you know, ultimately, we are focused on maximizing our per share returns. 
We're emerging from the repositioning in a very enviable situation. The depth and breadth of Devon's North American property portfolio provides many years of visible economic growth and a good balance between liquids and natural gas. Our asset base underpins our confidence, that we can deliver strong growth in oil and liquids over the next several years from opportunities that we have already captured within our asset portfolio. Furthermore, we have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry, and we're in a position to supplement our top line growth and enhance our per share returns with our stock buyback program.
Looking now to some of the specific highlights of 2010. We entered into sale contracts for our Gulf of Mexico and international assets, with proceeds expected to top $10 billion, far exceeding initial expectations. Essentially, all of these transactions have closed with the exception of Brazil. 
In the midst of the repositioning, we generated outstanding results from our go-forward North American business. North American onshore oil and gas production grew to 619,000 barrels equivalent per day in the fourth quarter. That's up 8% from the year-ago quarter when we announced the repositioning.
The repositioning also drove cost savings across several expense categories in 2010. This included general and administrative expenses, which declined 13%. Reported net earnings for 2010 were $4.6 billion or $10.31 per diluted share. That's the highest reported earnings per share in Devon's history.
Cash flow before balance sheet changes climbed 21% over the prior year to $5.7 billion. And when you combine that with almost $7 billion in divestiture proceeds received to date, Devon's total cash inflows approach $13 billion in 2010. With that cash flow, we funded our E&P and Midstream capital budgets, including $1.2 billion of acreage capture focused on oil and liquids-rich plays. 
We retired $1.8 billion of debt, ending the year with a near-bulletproof balance sheet and with debt and net debt as adjusted capitalization ratio of 10%, including cash on hand of $3.4 billion. And in addition to our capital program and debt reduction, we also returned more than $1.4 billion to our shareholders through our stock buyback program in dividend payments. 
In 2010, we repurchased over 18 million shares. We've continued to be active in the market subsequent to year end. And through last week, we had repurchased a total of 23.5 million shares or just over 5% of our outstanding shares. With an aggregate cost of $1.6 billion, this gives us an average cost to date of $69.60 per share. 
Finally, we had another strong year of company-wide reserve growth. We added 464 million barrels, boosting year-end proved reserves to an all-time record of 2.9 billion barrels. This means that our North American reserve additions more than replace all of the year's production and the roughly 200 million barrels of proved reserves associated with our divestiture. We ended 2010 with record proved reserves in spite of selling properties worth more than 20% of our enterprise value during the year.
Looking more closely at the 2010 reserve activities. Our drill-bit reserve additions, so that includes discoveries, extensions and performance revisions for our go-forward North American Onshore business, total of 389 million Boe. These additions were 175% of our 2010 North American Onshore production. 
When we announced the $500 million pipe joint venture with BP -- you'll remember that's our joint venture in the oil sands in Canada, we said that our 2010 drill-bit F&D would likely come in between $14 and $16 per barrel. Following that announcement, we stepped up our acreage capture and spent another $700 million an acreage in the Permian Basin and in our Cana play and on other undisclosed new plays, bringing our total acreage capture for the year up to $1.2 billion. This resulted in total drill-bit capital of $6.1 billion, including capitalized G&A and interest. And in spite of the additional acreage capture, our organic North American Onshore finding and development cost came in, in line with the original estimate at $15.74 per Boe. This positive result is because our drill-bit reserve additions far exceeded our original estimate. 
It's worth noting that we achieved our 2010 F&D results without increasing our percentage of proved undeveloped reserves. In fact, at December 31, our North American onshore undeveloped reserves accounted for just 29% of total proved.
It's important to remember that the one-year F&D cost can be somewhat arbitrary. I will remind you that when we reported our 2009 results, we told you that the $6.59 per barrel F&D cost for 2009 was unrealistically low. If you combine our 2009 and 2010 results for the go-forward business, you arrive at an average F&D for the two years of a little over $10.60 per barrel, some very competitive result even with the unusually large acreage acquisitions in 2010.
Price revisions for our North American Onshore properties gave us a net positive boost in 2010, adding another 71 million barrels. Positive gas-price related revisions principally from the Barnett Shale more than offset negative price revisions related to higher oil prices and the sliding scale royalty impact on our thermal oil sands in Canada. This underscores the value of a balanced portfolio of properties. Taking into account the net price revisions, our total North American Onshore reserve additions from all sources were 464 million Boes, more than double our North American production. That boosted Devon's North American Onshore reserves to 2.9 billion equivalent barrels, representing 9% growth over year-end 2009. And that's important, because this reserve growth really supports our future production growth. 
Looking to 2011, we're forecasting our North American Onshore production to total between 236 million and 240 million equivalent barrels. This implies a growth of 6% to 8% over our 2010 production of 223 million equivalent barrels. The preliminary forecast that we provided last November called for a 20% increase in oil and liquids production for 2011. However, updated liquids yield data from some of our emerging plays has resulted in a slight shift in the gas to liquids ratio. We now expect our 2011 production growth to be driven by oil and liquids growth in the high teens.
Before I turn the call over to Dave, I'd like to update you on the status of the $3.2 billion sale of our assets in Brazil to BP. While we had expected this transaction to close in 2010, we have not yet received approval from the government of Brazil. However, we've seen nothing that would lead us to believe that this transaction will not ultimately be approved. 
So with that, I will turn the call over to Dave Hager for a review of our quarterly operating highlights and our 2011 capital budget. Dave?"

We exited the year with 71 Devon-operated rigs running. And today, at the height of our winter drilling program in Canada, we have 90 rigs running.
Let's look now at some of our areas, area by area -- look at some of the area by area highlights. At our Jackfish thermal oil project in Eastern Alberta, our fourth quarter daily production averaged 22,200 barrels per day net of royalties. The Jackfish volumes that were curtailed in early December is a result of outages on the Enbridge pipeline system have been restored, and production at Jackfish is currently running about 30,000 barrels per day, net of royalties, the level we expect to average in the first quarter. More than three years into production, Jackfish continues to be one of the best-performing Side B [ph] projects in the industry as measured by both production per well and by steam oil ratio.
Construction of Jackfish 2 is now complete, with total capital expenditures to start up projected to come in at just under $1 billion. Plant commissioning activities are underway, and we expect to begin injecting steam in the second quarter of this year. We expect to deliver first oil late this year, with production ramping up throughout 2012.
Review of our regulatory application for Jackfish 3 is currently underway. Pending approval, we could begin site work around year-end, with plant startup targeted for 2015. Detailed engineering work continues, and we have all major equipment orders in place. Devon operates all the Jackfish projects and owned 100% working interest.
With the initial phase of Jackfish running near capacity and no major turnarounds scheduled in 2011, we expect our thermal oil production to grow nearly 3 million barrels over 2010 level to about 12 million barrels in 2011. 
At Pike, our Side B [ph] oil sands joint venture with BP, we began appraisal drilling in the fourth quarter and plan to drill about 150 stratigraphic core wells this winter. We also are acquiring some 60 miles of 3D seismic data. This drilling and seismic information will help us determine the optimum development configuration for the initial phase of development. We hope to begin the regulatory process for the first phase of Pike around the end of the year. 
In aggregate, we plan to spend about $600 million on our thermal oil sands project in 2011, as we continue toward the goal of growing our net Side B [ph] oil production to between 150,000 to 175,000 barrels per day by 2020. This represents roughly a 20% compound annual growth rate in Side B [ph] production through the end of the decade. 
At year end, we had 440 million barrels of reserves booked in our thermal oil sands. As we move through the development of Jackfish and Pike projects, we expect to book roughly 1 billion additional barrels of net resource.
In our Lloydminster oil play in Alberta, we drilled 57 new wells in the fourth quarter, which brought our full year total to 191 wells. In 2011, we plan to spend about $100 million drilling approximately 170 wells in the Lloydminster area, allowing us to hold production steady at roughly 40,000 barrels equivalent per day.
Also in Canada, in 2011, we plan to spend about $150 million testing more than a half dozen different oil and liquids-rich gas plays that we have identified across our vast land base. This includes fractured oil shales, tight oil carbonates and tight oil plastics in the Deep Basin. Specifically, we plan to drill 13 wells this year testing the Viking-like oil play on our 900,000 acres of feed title lands in the Kindersley area of Saskatchewan. 
In the Deep Basin of Alberta, where we have nearly 600,000 net acres, we will drill several wells targeting the Cardium light oil play and the liquid-rich lower Cretaceous zones including the Cadomin Formation. These are just a few of the areas we'll be testing in 2011 to better understand the potential for commercial success in these new plays across our vast Canadian acreage position. We will keep you updated as we move forward.
Shifting to the Rocky Mountains, we are currently testing the oil potential on our 220,000-net acre position in the Powder River Basin. We are in the early stages of evaluating several Cretaceous oil objectives, including the Parkman and Niobrara. In 2011, we plan to spend about $50 million and drill 15 wells testing these play concepts.
Moving to the Permian Basin, our net production averaged 45,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day in the fourth quarter, up 16% over the fourth quarter of 2009. Our fourth quarter oil NGL production at Permian was up 23% over 2009 and accounted for 73% of our total Permian volumes. We continue to be very active in the Basin with 17 operated rigs running. 
In 2011, we expect to spend $650 million and drill about 300 wells in the Permian. Growth from our Permian assets is expected to contribute approximately 3 million barrels of liquids growth over 2010 levels to 14 million barrels in 2011.
In our Wolfberry light oil play, we currently have six operated rigs running. Since drilling our first Wolfberry well in late 2008, we have drilled more than 140 wells, allowing us to derisk large portions of our 197,000 perspective net acres. Our drilling results to date support EURs of between 100,000 and 150,000 barrels of oil per well across roughly 160,000 net acres. 
On our 37,000 net acres located in the northern part of the play, we have had marginal success. However, this acreage has potential in some additional zones. In 2011, we plan to spend $250 million in the Wolfberry and drill approximately 125 wells from our inventory of more than 1,000 risk locations.
Also in the Permian Basin, in the Avalon Shale play, we are currently running four rigs. Devon has assembled over 200,000 prospective net acres in this condensate and liquids-rich gas play. Although we are still in the early stages of evaluation and drilling, results have varied depending on the location within the broader play area, we are beginning to see some trends. 
In the fourth quarter, we drilled three Devon-operated wells in the central portion of the play. One of these wells was brought online with an average 30-day IP rate of 360 barrels of condensate per day and 1.7 million cubic feet of gas per day. In 2011, we plan to spend $160 million in the Avalon and drill about 75 wells, as we continue to delineate the play on our acreage position.
Elsewhere in the Permian, we continue to see solid results from the Bone Springs oil play, where Devon has 170,000 net acres. In the fourth quarter, we brought four Bone Spring wells online with an average 30-day IP rate of more than 400 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We have three rigs running in play and plan to spend $85 million to drill approximately 45 Bone Springs wells in 2011.
Our four remaining operated rigs in the Permian are targeting conventional formations. This includes objectives such as the Delaware, Wolfcamp, Clear Fork [ph] and Wichita-Albany, they were accessing primarily with horizontal wells. 
In the fourth quarter, we drilled some very strong conventional wells, including a Delaware horizontal well on our cut-and-dry unit that came online with a 30-day IP rate of 700 barrels of oil per day. In 2011, we plan to spend a little over $100 million and drill 50 wells in these conventional targets.
Moving north to the Texas Panhandle, where Devon has assembled approximately 62,000 net acres in the Granite Wash play, we stepped up drilling activity during the quarter with the addition of a fourth rig that was relocated from the Barnett. In the fourth quarter, we brought five Devon-operated wells online, with average IP rates of 2,730 oil equivalent barrels per day, including 580 barrels of oil and 870 barrels of NGLs.
Production history from our Cherokee Granite Wash wells continue to support EURs of about 1 million barrels equivalent. At roughly $7 million to drill and complete, these wells generate outstanding full-cycle rates to return. In 2011, we plan to spend $175 million and drill 55 wells with an average working interest of about 50%. Our activity in the Granite Wash is expected to contribute approximately 1 million barrels to our company-wide year-over-year liquids growth.
Moving to the Cana-Woodford Shale in Western Oklahoma, we continue to add to our acreage position during the fourth quarter and now have approximately 243,000 net acres. Devon is currently operating 23 out of the 39 rigs running play-wide. 
In the fourth quarter, we continued to aggressively derisk our position and secure the term acreage we acquired last year. We continue to see outstanding results from Cana. In the fourth quarter, we brought 21 operated wells online, with average five-day IP rates of 4.9 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including an average of 66 barrels of condensate and 174 barrels of NGLs. Fourth quarter net production from Cana averaged a record 137 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day, with over 20% of this production stream coming from condensate and NGLs. This is a 17% increase on a sequential quarter basis.
I also want to briefly update you on the status of our Cana infill pilot program we initiated last year in the core area. Production history from our 500-foot spaced wells continue to perform well, supporting an 8 Bcf type curve. These results support that we have eight to 10 wells per section and that's a likely spacing in the core area. However, to date, we have only booked five wells per section in the core area.
From a reserves performance perspective, Cana was a leading growth area for the company in 2010. Extensions, discoveries and performance revisions at Cana accounted for 105 million Boe of additions. Related drill-bit capital was $729 million, including roughly 200 million of additional acreage capture. 
At your end, we had 175 million equivalent barrels booked at Cana-Woodford. With some 11 Tcf equivalent of risk resource potential, and more than 5,000 risk locations remaining, we expect many years of highly economic production and reserve growth from Cana.
In December of 2010, we began processing gas in our new Cana liquids extraction plant. The facility has an initial processing capacity of 200 million cubic feet per day and is capable of extracting up to 15,000 barrels of liquids per day. The plan is expandable to 600 million per day inlet capacity as we grow Cana volumes. This facility allows us to capture additional value from the liquid-rich Cana gas stream.
In 2011, we plan to invest over $800 million of capital and drill more than 200 wells. By year end, we expect our net production from Cana to reach 250 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including 14,000 barrels per day of condensate and NGLs. This will contribute approximately 2.5 million barrels to our company-wide year-over-year liquids growth.
Shifting to the Barnett Shale field in North Texas. In the fourth quarter, our net production held steady at a record 1.2 Bcf equivalent per day, including over 42,000 barrels of NGLs and condensate per day. We continue to achieve outstanding results from the Barnett, with pad drilling and improved drilling efficiency. 
In 2010, we were able to offset rising service costs by further reducing the number of days it takes to drill a well. In 2010, we averaged just 13.3 days from spud to rig release, down from 14.4 days in 2009. In the fourth quarter, we completed a 21-well drilling program from a single pad in which we averaged just 10.6 days from spud to spud. 
From a reserve performance perspective, extensions, discoveries and performance revisions in the Barnett Shale accounted for 112 million barrels of additions, including 26 million barrels of positive performance revisions. This marks a the seventh consecutive year of upward performance revisions in the Barnett that, in aggregate, total over 230 million barrels. Drill-bit additions more than replaced our Barnett production of 70 million equivalent barrels for the year. Related drill-bit capital was $1.1 billion. At year end, we had 1.1 million barrels equivalent booked in the Barnett, with thousands of remaining unbooked locations.
In 2011, we plan to invest about $900 million of capital in the Barnett, running a 12-rig program. This will result in us drilling 300-operated Barnett wells and participating in about 25 non-operated wells. 
The 2011 program is focused on the liquids-rich areas of the play. This level of activity will allow us to generate significant free cash flow and maintain current production levels. Our expected year-over-year production growth in the Barnett should add approximately 2.5 million barrels to our company-wide year-over-year liquids growth.
When you step back and look at the overall results of our 2010 capital program, you see that from both the perspectives of both reserve additions and production trajectory, the results were very good. What is not reflected in these numbers is the tremendous resource capture beyond proved reserves that we accomplished over the last year. 
Last August, we told you that we had acquired 260,000 net acres in new plays that we are not ready to discuss. Our goal was to identify and establish large first-mover positions in highly economic plays that had not yet become competitive. Since that time, we have continued building these positions and now have roughly 750,000 acres and a handful of new plays. 
In 2011, we have allocated roughly $200 million of capital to continue building these positions, acquire seismic and test several of these new play concepts. While it is unlikely that all of these plays will be successful, we are excited about the potential and expect to have positive news later this year. 
In total, we expect our full year 2011 E&P capital expenditures to be between $4.5 billion and $4.9 billion for our North American Onshore business. As John mentioned, with that level of spending, we would expect overall production growth of 6% to 8%, led by high teens growth in oil and NGL volumes. When you add roughly $1 billion for capitalized G&A and interest, Midstream and other corporate capital, our total 2011 capital amounts are expected to fall between $5.4 billion to $6 billion. 
With that, I would turn the call over to Jeff Agosta for the financial review and outlook. Jeff?"
266510,111214317,103862,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2011",2011-02-16,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Today, we will begin by looking at some of the key drivers that impacted our 2010 financial results and provide commentary on our outlook for 2011. As Vince mentioned earlier, we have reclassified the assets, liab",1737,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Today, we will begin by looking at some of the key drivers that impacted our 2010 financial results and provide commentary on our outlook for 2011. As Vince mentioned earlier, we have reclassified the assets, liabilities and results of operations from our international assets and to discontinue the operations for all accounting periods presented.
Our fourth quarter results from continuing operations represent just our North American Onshore business or in other words, the results of the repositioned Devon. However, it is important to note that our reported full year results from continuing operations do include a partial year of results from our now divested Gulf assets. 
Let's begin with production. For 2010, Devon's reported production totaled 228 million oil equivalent barrels. This includes approximately 5 million barrels of production from our now divested Gulf of Mexico properties. Excluding the Gulf production, you will find that our North American Onshore assets produced 223 million barrels during the year. This result represents a 3 million-barrel increase over 2009, which was driven entirely by higher oil and NGL production. 
Looking specifically at the fourth quarter of 2010, Devon produced 56.9 million equivalent barrels or approximately 619,000 barrels per day. This is about 6,000 barrels per day shy of our guidance range due to a number of minor operational issues, which reduced our fourth quarter production by approximately 11,000 barrels per day. These included volume curtailments attributable to the Enbridge pipeline outage, other third-party facility outages and delays in well completions. In spite of these curtailments, when compared to last year's fourth quarter production from our North American Onshore assets exhibited strong year-over-year growth of 46,000 barrels per day or 8%. Increased oil production from our Permian Basin properties and growth from our liquids-rich Barnett and Cana Shale plays drove this result. 
Our 2011 budget calls for first quarter production of 630,000 barrels equivalent per day, up slightly from the fourth quarter. However, continued curtailments due to third-party facility outages and unusually severe winter weather in Texas and the mid-continent region have negatively impacted first quarter production by about 1 million barrels or approximately 10,000 barrels per day. That production has now been restored, and we are currently producing approximately 630,000 barrels per day. Assuming no additional surprises, positive or negative, we would now expect first quarter reported production to average 615,000 to 625,000 barrels per day. 
Looking beyond the first quarter, we expect production to increase in each of the remaining quarters of 2011. The plan calls for the biggest jump in the second quarter, up to 645,000 to 655,000 barrels per day as we tie in a large well pad and the liquids-rich area of the Barnett, and we'd begin to see the impact of the increased activity levels in Cana and the Permian Basin. 
Moving to price realizations. It was another strong quarter for oil. The WTI benchmark price rose steadily throughout the fourth quarter and averaged $85.15 per barrel. Our company-wide realized price came in at $68.35 in the fourth quarter or 80% of WTI, right at the midpoint of our guidance. The escalating oil price environment boosted our fourth quarter realized price by almost 10% over the previous quarter and our full year realized oil price by 27%. 
On the natural gas side, the Henry Hub Index averaged $3.84 per Mcf for the fourth quarter. Our realized gas price before the impact of hedges came in at 87% of Henry Hub or $3.32. We had fourth quarter hedges totaling 1.6 Bcf per day or nearly 2/3 of our natural gas production, with a weighted average protected price of $5.87. Cash settlements from our hedging position increased our average realized price by $1.32 to an all-in realized price of $4.64 per Mcf. 
For natural gas liquids, in the fourth quarter, our realized NGL price improved to $34.65 per barrel or just over 40% of the WTI Index. An increase in seasonal demand combined with higher overall prices led to a 19% increase in realized prices over the third quarter of 2010. 
For the full year of 2011, we expect Devon's realized NGL price to range between 35% and 40% of the WTI benchmark price. We expect continued supply growth from the industry to keep downward pressure on NGL pricing in 2011.
Taking a brief look at our hedging positions, for the first quarter of 2011, we now have approximately 784 million cubic feet per day swapped at a weighted average price of $5.43. For the full year, we have an average of 730 million cubic feet per day swapped at an average price of $5.49. In aggregate, this hedging position represents roughly 30% of our expected natural gas production for the year.
To facilitate a portion of this hedge position, we sold call options on 19,500 barrels of oil per day for 2011 and 2012 at $95 per barrel, and call options on 588 million cubic feet per day of gas for 2012 at $6 per Mcf.
Additionally, we now have collars in place, covering 45,000 barrels of oil per day with a weighted average floor of $75 an average ceiling of $109. We will be posting a hedging schedule on our website after the call that will provide some more detail on these hedge positions.
Turning now to our Marketing and Midstream division. Our Marketing and Midstream operations once again produced another high-quality quarter, generating $127 million of operating profit, bringing our full year operating profit to $510 million. Increased gas throughput and strong cost control drove our solid performance. Looking ahead to 2011, we expect our full year operating profit for our Midstream division to be between $485 million and $535 million.
Turning to expenses. In the fourth quarter, lease operating expenses were right in line with our expectations at $418 million or $7.36 per barrel produced. In spite of higher Canadian dollar exchange rates and upward pressure on oilfield services and supply, our LOE per Boe remained flat when compared to the third quarter. Looking forward to 2011, we expect industry inflation to continue. As a result, we are forecasting a moderate increase in LOE to a range of $7.50 to $7.90 per Boe.
For 2010, Devon's full year DD&A [depreciation, depletion and amortization] expense for oil and gas properties also came in at $7.36 per Boe, a 6% decline from last year. Overall, our DD&A rate benefited from the sale of our Gulf assets. We anticipate that our DD&A rate will increase to a range of $7.40 to $8 per barrel in 2011.
Moving to G&A expense. The company did a very good job of controlling G&A costs during 2010. As John said, for the full year, our reported G&A expenses totaled $563 million. That is a decrease of $85 million or 13% versus 2009. This significant reduction in G&A is entirely attributable to the operational efficiencies achieved through our strategic repositioning. We expect our 2011 G&A expense per Boe to remain roughly flat with 2010.
Turning to interest expense. For 2010, it totaled $363 million, right in line with our expectations and up slightly from 2009. However, it's important to note that our 2010 interest expense included a one-time $19 million charge related to the early retirement of senior notes that we repaid in June. Excluding this charge, interest expense actually declined by $5 million as compared to 2009.  As we look forward to 2011, we expect our interest expense to decline to a range of $300 million to $340 million.
The final expense item I would like to touch on is income taxes. Devon's adjusted full year 2010 income tax rate came in at 32% of pretax earnings, comprised of a 2% current tax rate and a 30% deferred rate. As we discussed in last quarter's conference call, additional carryover benefits from a prior-year tax return led to a lower-than-forecasted current tax rate in 2010. These carryover benefits and the accelerated depreciation provisions that were passed into law in December also reduced our adjusted fourth quarter current tax rate. 
In Q4, our current tax rate was a negative 12% and deferred taxes were 42% of pretax income for an overall adjusted tax rate of 30%. Looking to 2011, we would expect an income tax rate similar to that of 2010 with less than a third of the tax expense being current. 
Cutting to the bottom line. For the full year 2010, our adjusted earnings from continuing operations were an impressive $2.5 billion or $5.75 per diluted share. Higher oil and gas revenues and strong cost control, combined with a reduced share count, increased diluted earnings per share by nearly 80% over 2009. 
In the fourth quarter, our adjusted earnings from continuing ops came in at $1.46 per diluted share. As Vince mentioned earlier, this result exceeded the mean earnings estimate by about $0.06. Before we open the call to Q&A, I would like to conclude with a quick review of our financial position. 
As John mentioned, cash flow from operations and proceeds of asset sales closed to date approached $13 billion. During the year, we deployed our cash inflows to fund all of our capital investments, resulting in a greatly expanded reserve base and Midstream infrastructure while enhancing our long-term growth prospects.
In addition to our capital program, we also repaid $1.8 billion of debt and returned more than $1.4 billion to our shareholders through our stock buyback program and dividend payments. 
Devon ended the year with one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. At December 31, our debt had declined to $5.6 million and cash on hand was $3.4 billion. 
While Devon clearly possesses a great deal of financial strength and flexibility, we're fully committed to exercising capital discipline, maximizing our margins, maintaining our balance sheet strength and optimizing our growth per debt-adjusted share. The upcoming year is a great example of how our disciplined approach to the business will benefit our shareholders.
Our focus on maximizing returns on our capital investments is leading to top line production growth of 6% to 8% in 2011. We expect our shareholder-friendly initiatives of stock buybacks and debt reduction to boost our debt-adjusted production per share to a double-digit growth rate. We believe this disciplined per share growth we are delivering in 2011 will compare very favorably to our peers. At this point, I will turn the call back over to Vince for the Q&A."

They're in Pike that we talked about. And then, we have another 13 deployed across the rest of Canada. The more liquids-rich ones will be about three in the Lloyd area there and then we're also testing some concepts, as I mentioned, some exploration concepts that are liquids-rich there. We have about 23 located in Cana that are primarily drilling the liquids-rich portion of the play and the extension of the play to the northwest from our core. We have 13 right now in the Barnett. They are concentrating on the liquids-rich portion. And four in the Granite Wash. We also go into our Texas Gulf Coast area. We have four rigs working in the Carthage area, around an area we have traditionally high return pud program that we're executing there, proved and undeveloped program. One in Groesbeck, one in North Louisiana and one in South Texas. And then particularly in the more liquids-rich and oil-rich area of the Permian Basin, we have 17 rigs working there. I detailed where those are located in the call pretty well. I think it's six -- and they move around a little bit. But it's roughly six in the Wolfberry, four in the Avalon Shale, three in the Bone Springs and four growing out of conventional targets. And then we have three rigs up in Wyoming, some of which we're testing our more oil-oriented concepts in Powder River Basin. We have one rig working and one should key [ph] as well.

Our largest liquids growth areas in 2011 are the Permian and Jackfish. 3/4 of our Permian growth will be oil, not NGLs, or of our total liquids growth in the Permian will be oil and not NGLs. And of course, Jackfish, 100% of that growth is oil. So we are not changing our oil and NGLs mix during 2011. We anticipate growing them both and maintaining our percentage of oil, which is more oil than NGLs."

Now that we've set our 2011 capital budget and updated our outlook for commodity prices, we're in there pretty aggressively. I'd point out to you that at the $88 a share where our stock, I think, opened today or close to that, we're paying about $12 a barrel, which is down quite a bit because of all the reserves that we added at year end 2010.

But since the revisions are so minor, we're not going to issue a new 8-K. We'll just post the changes to our guidance page on our website. To find that, just click on the Guidance link found in the Investor Relations section of the Devon website. 
Please note that all references in today's call to our plans forecast, expectations, estimates and so on are forward-looking statements under U.S. securities law. And while many factors could cause our actual results to differ from those estimates, we always strive to give you the very best guidance we can. We encourage you to review a discussion of risk factors if you're so inclined, that is provided with our Form 8-K forecast.
We will reference certain non-GAAP performance measures in today's call when we use these measures, we are required to provide certain related disclosures and those disclosures can also be found on the Devon website. 
One final item, while our first quarter cash flow per share significantly beat the consensus estimate, our earnings per share from continuing operations came in about $0.05 shy of consensus. Production was better than expected and our pretax cost per barrel were lower than the mid point of our guidance. However, our deferred taxes were higher than expected. Total adjusted income tax expense for the quarter are 34% of pretax earnings was 4 percentage points over the midpoint of our guidance. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO, John Richels. John?"

The first quarter of 2011 was really an outstanding one for Devon. Our North American onshore production increased 7% compared to the first quarter of 2010, exceeding the top end of our guidance range. 
We achieved this year-over-year production growth in spite of first quarter production outages resulting from severe weather. In addition, production growth accelerated as we exited the first quarter. We're very confident that we will deliver on our second quarter 2011 production forecast of 645,000 to 655,000 equivalent barrels per day. This represents an increase of about 3.5% over the first quarter. 
We remain on track to deliver on our full year 2000 production forecast of 236 to 240 million barrels of oil equivalent. And in addition, we expect to shrink our balance sheet with share repurchases and a reduction in net debt. This should drive our 2011 production growth per debt adjusted share to a rate in the midteens. 
Devon also delivered an excellent first quarter performance from a cost-containment perspective. Continued focus on cost containment, mitigated industry inflation and the impact of the stronger Canadian dollar, as a result, Devon actually saw a decrease in unit cost versus the year-ago quarter. 
As Dave is going to discuss later in the call, we continued executing on our North American onshore strategy with excellent results from our key development projects, and we also made some encouraging progress on the exploration front. 
In the first quarter, we generated $1.5 billion of cash flow before balance sheet changes. This cash flow from operations and the liquidity provided through our strategic repositioning comfortably funded our capital programs and returned nearly $800 million to our shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and dividends. Of the $3.5 billion authorized per share repurchases in May of 2010, we've now spent about $2.1 billion. We have purchased with that more than 28 million shares or just over 6% of our outstanding shares at an average price of roughly $73 per share. This brings our total share repurchases since 2004 up to 95 million shares or roughly 20% of our shares outstanding. 
As we previously indicated, we expect to complete our share repurchase program by year end. I'm sure by now that most of you are aware of the recent statements to the press by Brazilian authorities indicating that approval of the $3.2 billion sale of our Brazilian assets to BP is imminent. Based on their statements, we expect this transaction to close within the next few weeks. With a strategic repositioning that we began in November of 2009 now substantially complete, I could not be more pleased with the results. The repositioned company has all of the attributes necessary to deliver superior per share growth. We're generating excellent, full cycle returns, we have superior financial strength and we have a very deep inventory of highly economic low-risk development projects.
The depth and breadth of our balanced North American property portfolio provides us with a compelling strategic advantage. The luxury of easily shifting capital in response to changing market conditions. Unlike many of our peers, we can focus our capital on economic, liquids opportunities within our existing portfolio. Because we've always valued a liquids to gas balance, we already have a vast inventory of liquids opportunities including the Canadian Oil Sands, the Permian Basin, the Barnett Shale, the Cana-Woodford Shale and the Granite wash. 
In addition, we continue to replenish and build upon that inventory with our new ventures activities. In 2011, we're allocating well over 90% of our upstream capital towards oil and liquids rich opportunities. This will enable us to grow our year-over-year oil and natural gas liquids production at a rate in the high teens. And inevitably at some point in the future, gas prices will recover and incentivize the drilling of dry gas place. Since the vast majority of our properties are held by production, we can easily maintain our dry gas positions in the option value they represent. In the meantime, we'll continue to allocate our capital to oil and liquids-rich growth projects to generate strong rates of return in the current environment. 
This in summary, we remain fully committed to optimizing our growth on a per-share basis adjusted for debt. And in order to achieve that goal, we remain keenly focus on exercising capital discipline, maximizing our full cycle margins and maintaining a high degree of financial strength and flexibility. So with that overview, I'll turn the call over to Dave Hager for our review of our quarterly operating highlights. Dave?"
266510,127127502,122179,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 04, 2011",2011-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone.

In this morning's earnings release, we have included a table to detail production, operated",2038,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Before I get started, I want to point out a couple of changes we're making this quarter to our operational disclosures. 
In this morning's earnings release, we have included a table to detail production, operated rigs and wells drilled by key operating areas. The absence of this information from my remarks combined with our efforts to streamline the discussion of quarterly results should result in a more concise call, and we have more time for your questions. So with that, let's look at our E&P program. 
The majority of our 2011 E&P program is focused on execution of our low-risk, repeatable development place like the Barnett, the Cana and Jackfish. We also have upside potential with funds devoted to the evaluation and derisking of various emerging plays in the Permian, the Rockies and in Canada. 
In addition, we have allocated capital to the acquisition of additional acreage and drilling of the initial wells and a handful of new opportunities that we have not previously disclosed. One of which, I will identify today. 
Looking first at our thermal oil project in Eastern Alberta, we wrapped up the final commissioning activities for Jackfish 2 in the first quarter and expect to begin injecting steam in the next couple of weeks with first plant oil for later this year. Jackfish 2 production will continue ramping up throughout 2012. Our regulatory application for Jackfish 3 continues to progress through the review process. 
At Pike, our SAGD oil sands joint venture with BP, we began appraisal drilling in the fourth quarter and continued throughout most of the first quarter. In total, we drilled 135 stratigraphic core wells this winter and acquired some 60 square miles of 3D seismic data. Although additional seismic interpretation work will be done in the coming months, results from the start drilling program were in line with our expectations. 
Our 2011 drilling efforts were concentrated around the north-central portion of our Pike acreage and confirmed sufficient resources for at least one 300 million barrel project. Ultimately, we expect Pike to yield 4 or 5 similar size projects. We hope to begin the regulatory approval process for the first phase of Pike in the first half of 2012. Planning is already underway for next winter's drilling strap program and seismic program aimed at further refining our view on additional Pike prospects. 
Our combined interest in the Jackfish and Pike projects represent estimated risk resource potential of 1.4 billion barrels net to Devon. The development of these projects is expected to drive our net SAGD production from the 30,000 barrels per day we are currently producing to at least 150,000 barrels per day by 2020. This is based on the acreage we currently have in hand, without any additional acreage acquisitions. 
Moving now to the Bone Springs play in the Permian Basin, Devon has established a position covering 185,000 net acres. We currently have 3 operated rigs running. Our initial activity has been focused in 2 primary areas of the play. We have been running 2 rigs targeting a first and second Bone Springs interval in Northern Ety and Leak counties in New Mexico. Our second focus area targets the third Bone Springs on the Texas side in Reeves and Loving Counties. 
In the first quarter, we have completed our second well targeting the third Bone Springs interval and the results were quite impressive. The 100% Devon owned Teledata 651H was brought online with an average 30 day IP rate of more than 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We recently added another rig to the Texas side of the play in the second quarter, bringing the total number of rigs we have focused on the Bone Springs to 4. Also in the Permian Basin and the avalanche shale play, we're currently running 3 rigs. We are still in the early stages of evaluating our acreage position. However, based on drilling results today, it appears, as you move East within the play, condensate yields improve. For example, the convent draw Unit 134H in the eastern portion of the play was brought online late in the first quarter. For the 12 days, the well was holding back before it was shut in for installation of a pump, the well averaged 534 barrels of condensate per day and 2.5 million cubic feet of gas per day. Production history from similar wells in the area appears to support ultimate recoveries of between 400,000 and 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent. With approximately 60,000 net acres located in the eastern part of the play, Devon is well-positioned in the liquids-rich portion of the play. 
Moving north to the Granite Wash play in the Texas Panhandle, we continue to see solid results from our Turkey and Granite Wash area wells. The right 151-2H completed in the Granite Wash A was brought online in the first quarter with a 30-day IP rate of nearly 2,800 oil-equivalent barrels per day. Including 690 barrels of oil and 704 barrels of NGLs. We also drilled our first Granite Wash B well during the quarter. The 11 and 4H has brought on line with a 30-day IP rate of 1,700 oil equivalent barrels per day, including 340 barrels of oil and 410 barrels of NGLs. 
In total, Devon brought 6 operated Granite Wash wells online during the first quarter. 30-day IP rates from these wells averaged 1,760 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 250 barrels of oil and 490 barrels of natural gas liquids per day. 
We believe that we have about 700 risk undrilled locations in the Granite Wash. 
Moving now to the Cana-Woodford Shale in Western Oklahoma, where we are continuing to see outstanding results. First quarter production raised a record 162 million cubic feet equivalent per day. This puts us well on track to reach our year-end target of 250 million cubic feet equivalent per day. We continue to aggressively de-risk our position and secure the term acreage we acquired last year located northwest of the core area. Initial drilling results from this extentionary indicated attractive rates of return, which should compete favorably for capital within our portfolio. In our Cana in filled pilot program we initiated last year in the core area, production history from our 500-foot space wells continued to perform well. As a result, we plan to drill 3 additional infill pilot programs later this year. The additional production history gain from this infill wells should further support our position that 8 to 10 wells per section is the correct spacing in the core area. 
Shifting to the Barnett Shale field in North Texas. Our initial plan call for running 12 rigs throughout 2011. However, as we enter the year, we had 13 rigs running in the Barnett. Given the tightness in the market, we decide to retain the 13th rig with a thought that we can probably need it in the Granite Wash as we de-risk that position. Given our recent success in the Granite Wash program, we will be moving that rig up there during the second quarter. And in addition, we picked up a 14th rig in the Barnett during late March. This is a high-efficiency rig being dropped by another company, and we secured it to high grade our fleet. We will drop a lower efficiency rig, bringing our operated Barnett rig count to 12, where we expect to keep it for the remainder of the year. 
Our net production continue to grow during the first quarter, and we exited the quarter producing over 1.2 Bcf equivalent per day, including 43,000 barrels of NGLs and condensate per day. Remarkably, our Barnett production has climbed in spite of reducing our rig count over the last 12 months. Our deep inventory of undrilled locations at some of the best parts of the play has allowed us to high grade our drilling program, which in turn has yielded higher IP rates. In the first quarter, we brought 103 Barnett wells online with average 30-day IP rates of approximately 2.7 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including an average of 137 barrels of liquids per day. 
We also continue to improve results with PAD drilling and other drilling efficiencies in the Barnett. By further reducing the number of days it takes to drill a well, we were able to mitigate rising service cost. In 2010, we averaged 13.3 days from spud to rig release. While so far in 2011, we're averaging just 12.6 days. 
On the exploration front, we continue to actively evaluate the oil and liquids potential on our acreage within our portfolio, dispensed numerous play types across multiple basins in the U.S. and Canada. In Canada, for instance, our Viking light oil place in Saskatchewan, we drilled 3 wells in the first quarter. We're still in the early stages of evaluating our acreage position. But believe we could have between 1,000 and 2,000 Viking drilling locations. 
And in addition, we have 3 Cardium wells drilled at the end of the quarter at the Deep Basin of Alberta. Of our nearly 600,000 net acres in the Deep Basin, we believe at least 80,000 acres is perspective for the Cardium. We expect to complete both the Viking and the Cardium wells in the second quarter. 
In the Rocky Mountains, our exploration efforts are focused on evaluating several Cretaceous oil objectives, including the Niobrara and Parkman on our 220,000 net acres in the Powder River Basin. We have 3 rigs currently running, with 2 drilling Parkman wells and 1 drilling for the Niobrara. On the first quarter, we drilled 4 Parkman wells, which are all scheduled to be completed in the second quarter. We will keep you updated on our progress as we move forward. 
We have been telling you for sometime now about our goal to identify and establish large acreage positions in highly economic place at reasonable prices. We have continued building this new venture positions and now have roughly 850,000 net acres and a handful of new plays primarily targeting oil and liquid rich gas. While we are still actively leasing in several of these plays, we're not ready to discuss them all, we have largely secured our position in 1 area that I will tell you about today. 
The Tuscaloosa shale is located along Louisiana and Mississippi border. This is a Cretaceous age formation that is stratigraphically equivalent to the Eagle Ford Shale. It is approximately 200 to 400 feet thick, the depth of 11,000 to 14,000 feet across our acreage position. Oil production has been established up dip in the play from the Tuscaloosa shale. We plan to utilize horizontal drilling and fracture simulation to enhance the productivity of the reservoir in both the oil and liquids-rich portion of the play. We have leased or have committed under contract approximately 250,000 prospective net acres at an average cost of $180 per acre. We plan to drill our first 2 horizontal wells in the play this year. 
In total, first quarter capital expenditures for North American onshore exploration and development totaled $1.5 billion. Our 2011 capital budget is front-end loaded due to our winter drilling program in Canada and because most of our 2011 SAGD expenditures occurred early in the year. However, the $1.5 billion of upstream capital spent in the first quarter is about $100 million over our internal budget. Two areas drove most of this overspent. First, activity levels on properties operated by others exceeded the level we expected. And second, some smaller working interest owners and properties operated by Devon were unable to fund their share of capital, thereby allowing us to step in for a greater interest in these projects. While this will likely push us to the higher end of the range we provided for capital expenditures, it should also result in greater production later in the year and into 2012. 
So in summary, our key developed projects are delivering excellent results. Accordingly, we are highly confident of meeting our production growth targets. This growth is being driven by strong, double-digit liquids growth. And we are making substantial progress on the exploration front. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff Agosta for the financial review and outlook. Jeff?"
266510,127127502,122179,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 04, 2011",2011-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. Before we move into the financial review of the quarter, I want to remind everyone my comments will be focused on results from continuing operations or in other words, our North American onshore business. For those",972,"Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. Before we move into the financial review of the quarter, I want to remind everyone my comments will be focused on results from continuing operations or in other words, our North American onshore business. 
For those of you interested in a more detailed review of our discontinued operations, we have provided supplemental tables in our news release. As John mentioned earlier, first quarter results were very strong and most income statement in key operating metrics were right in line with our expectations. 
For today's call, I will only review those items that required additional commentary or outside our forecasted guidance range. The first item I will cover is our production performance. We produced 56.6 million equivalent barrels from continuing operations or approximately 629,000 barrels per day. This exceeded the top end of our guidance range by roughly 4,000 barrels per day. First quarter production benefited from better than expected performance from key properties, including the Cana-Woodford and Barnett Shales. 
When compared to the first quarter of 2010, our North American onshore production increased 7%. This growth was achieved in spite of production interruptions caused by severe winter weather in the first quarter of '11. The most significant portion of this year-over-year growth came from U.S. oil and NGL production. Gains in the Cana, Permian Basin and Barnett drove this growth. 
Looking ahead to the second quarter of 2011, we anticipate continued strong growth. The midpoint of our guidance range is 645,000 to 655,000 barrels per day implies an increase in sequential quarter production nearly 3.5%. This growth is driven by the same areas that drove our first quarter results, the Cana, Permian Basin and Barnett. 
Given our performance thus far, we feel very comfortable with our forecast for liquids production growth in the high teens driving overall top line production growth of 6% to 8% in 2011. While we are clearly on track to come in at the high end of this range, we are not modifying our full year guidance at this time. 
On the pricing front, the major story for the quarter was the robust oil price environment. Geopolitical tensions and strong worldwide demand resulted in WTI oil price surprising $100 a barrel in early March. The strength in oil prices provided a good opportunity to hedge oil at historically attractive levels. As we have discussed in the past, we try to protect the price on roughly half of our expected production of both oil and natural gas. Our objective is to strike an appropriate balance between managing risk and retaining exposure to upsize volatility. 
For the full year 2012, we now have 76,000 barrels per day, hedged through various swap and causes collar contracts. Of this amount, 22,000 barrels per day were swapped at a weighted average price of $107 per barrel and the remaining position utilizes colors with a weighted average ceiling of $126 and a floor of $86. 
Natural gas price volatility has also provided an opportunity to boost our hedge position. For the second quarter of this year, we added 550 million cubic feet per day of hedges, increasing our total hedged production for the second quarter to roughly 1.3 Bcf per day. This position covers approximately 50% of our expected natural gas production in the second quarter with a weighted average protective price of $4.95. We have also begun adding gas hedges for next year. For the full year of 2012, we now have swapped in collar contracts covering nearly 400 million cubic feet per day with a weighted average protective price of $4.93 per Mcf. We will post an updated hedging schedule on our website today that provides a more detailed view of our 2011 and '12 hedge positions. 
Looking now to expenses. Once again, the repositioned company did a very good job controlling costs. Expenses in most categories were generally in line with expectations during the first quarter. In aggregate, our pretax cash cost for the quarter came in at $13.12 per Boe and we're about $0.10 per barrel lower than the first quarter of 2010. As E&P and service companies alike have disclosed, we are in a rising service and supply cost environment. However, our focus on cost control, combined with the efficiencies realized through our repositioning have more than offset both industry inflation and the negative impact of the strengthening Canadian dollar. 
Shifting to income taxes. As events mentioned earlier, our overall tax rate was 34% of adjusted pretax earnings or about 4 percentage points over the midpoint of our guidance. Current taxes were 2%, while deferred taxes were 32% of adjusted pretax earnings. This is indicative of what we expect for tax rates on adjusted earnings for the full year. A reconciliation of tax on both GAAP and adjusted earnings is available in today's release. 
Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, we anticipate continued upward pressure on cost. However, we remain comfortable with the full year expense forecasts provided in our February 8-K. Regardless of industry conditions, we are confident that Devon is well positioned to continue generating full cycle margins that are among the best of our peer group. 
Also, from a balance sheet perspective, Devon remains exceptionally strong. At March 31, we exited the quarter with $3.4 billion in cash and short-term investments and total debt of only $6.8 billion. This of course is before the $3.2 billion we received upon the close of the sale of Brazil. This significant financial strength provides us the flexibility to consistently invest in our business based on our long-term outlook regardless of the near-term macro economic backdrop. We believe that we are extremely well-positioned to compete effectively, delivering highly competitive growth and cash flow and production for debt adjusted share. At this point, I'll turn the call back over to Vince for the Q&A."

And having said that, this is a frontier place. So I do want to mischaracterize it as something else and frankly we have been leading the industry by taking our position here. So it is a frontier play. But let me tell you some of the things that we do like about the play that gives us reason for encouragement. It is the stratigraphic equivalent to the Eagle Ford Shale. It is deeper than Eagle Ford Shale about 11,000 to 14,000 foot depth. But it is a strategic equivalent to it. There has been oil production established up dip in the Tuscaloosa Shale also there have been some vertical wells that have been drilled in there that indicate that you're getting for a shale type play that has good frosty and permeability. We're also seeing some carbonates in there, which indicate that maybe somewhat brittle and able to be fractured. We've seen IPs on the vertical wells up to 300 barrels per day. We're just a very small number of horizontal wells have been drilled a couple of years ago and there were a limited horizontal link on the order of 15 to 2,000 foot with only 3 stages. But they tested up to 500 barrels per day from these very limited and minimally fraced wells. So all of those give us reasons for encouragement. Now having said that, it's very early on and we're going to start drilling some horizontal wells, we need to get more data on Rockford ability and there are some sands below that we need to stay away from those. We need to get some more information on the face, oil and natural gas. There aren't that many wells to know exactly where the play the boundaries between those are. So there are some risk associated with it. I don't want to mislead you. But there are some encouraging qualities to establish 250,000-acre position for less than $50 million that's kind of thing we are successful we can create an awful lot of value."

And then Dave Hager, our Executive Vice President of Exploration and Production, will cover the operating highlights. Following Dave's remarks, Jeff Agosta, our Chief Financial Officer, will finish up with a financial review. We will follow with a Q&A period. And as usual, we'll hold the call to about an hour.

As always, we'll ask each participant on the call to limit his or her questions to one initial inquiry and one follow-up. A replay of the call will be available later today through a link on our Home page, that's www.devonenergy.com. 
During the call today, we will make some minor refinements to our forward-looking estimates for items such as production, capital expenditures and our hedge position. But since the revisions are so minor, we're not going to issue a new 8-K. We'll just post the changes to our Guidance page on our website. To find that, just click on the Guidance link found in the Investor Relations section of the Devon website. 
Please note that all references in today's call to our plans, forecast, expectations, estimates and so on are forward-looking statements under U.S. securities law. And while many factors could cause our actual results to differ from those estimates, we always strive to give you the very best guidance we can. We encourage you to review a discussion of risk factors if you're so inclined that is provided with our Form 8-K forecast.
We will reference certain non-GAAP performance measures in today's call. When we use these measures, we're required to provide certain related disclosures and those disclosures can also be found on the Devon website. 
One final item, while our first quarter cash flow per share significantly beat the consensus estimate, our earnings per share from continuing operations came in about $0.05 shy of consensus. Production was better than expected and our pretax cost per barrel were lower than the midpoint of our guidance. However, our deferred taxes were higher than expected. Total adjusted income tax expense for the quarter or 34% of pretax earnings was 4 percentage points over the midpoint of our guidance.

We're very confident that we will deliver on our second quarter 2011 production forecast of 645,000 to 655,000 equivalent barrels per day. This represents an increase of about 3.5% over the first quarter. 
We remain on track to deliver on our full year 2000 production forecast of 236 million to 240 million barrels of oil equivalent. And in addition, we expect to shrink our balance sheet with share repurchases and a reduction in net debt. This should drive our 2011 production growth per debt adjusted share to a rate in the mid-teens. 
Devon also delivered an excellent first quarter performance from a cost-containment perspective. Continued focus on cost containment, mitigated industry inflation and the impact of the stronger Canadian dollar. As a result, Devon actually saw a decrease in unit cost versus the year-ago quarter. 
As Dave is going to discuss later in the call, we continued executing on our North American onshore strategy with excellent results from our key development projects, and we also made some encouraging progress on the exploration front. 
In the first quarter, we generated $1.5 billion of cash flow before balance sheet changes. This cash flow from operations and the liquidity provided through our strategic repositioning comfortably funded our capital programs and returned nearly $800 million to our shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and dividends. Of the $3.5 billion authorized per share repurchases in May of 2010, we've now spent about $2.1 billion. We have purchased with that more than 28 million shares or just over 6% of our outstanding shares at an average price of roughly $73 per share. This brings our total shares repurchase since 2004 up to 95 million shares or roughly 20% of our shares outstanding. As we previously indicated, we expect to complete our share repurchase program by year end. 
I'm sure by now that most of you are aware of the recent statements to the press by Brazilian authorities indicating that approval of the $3.2 billion sale of our Brazilian assets to BP is imminent. Based on their statements, we expect this transaction to close within the next few weeks. With a strategic repositioning that we began in November of 2009 now substantially complete, I could not be more pleased with the results. The repositioned company has all of the attributes necessary to deliver superior per share growth. We're generating excellent full cycle returns, we have superior financial strength and we have a very deep inventory of highly economic low-risk development projects.
The depths and breadths of our balanced North American property portfolio provides us with a compelling strategic advantage, the luxury of easily shifting capital in response to changing market conditions. Unlike many of our peers, we can focus our capital on economic, liquids opportunities within our existing portfolio. Because we've always valued a liquids to gas balance, we already have a vast inventory of liquids opportunities, including the Canadian oil sands, the Permian Basin, the Barnett Shale, the Cana-Woodford Shale and the Granite Wash. 
In addition, we continue to replenish and build upon that inventory with our new ventures activities. In 2011, we're allocating well over 90% of our upstream capital towards oil and liquids-rich opportunities. This will enable us to grow our year-over-year oil and natural gas liquids production at a rate in the high teens. And inevitably at some point in the future, gas prices will recover and incentivize the drilling of dry gas place. Since the vast majority of our properties are held by production, we can easily maintain our dry gas positions in the option value they represent. In the meantime, we'll continue to allocate our capital to oil and liquids-rich growth projects to generate strong rates of return in the current environment. 
This in summary, we remain fully committed to optimizing our growth on a per-share basis adjusted for debt. And in order to achieve that goal, we remain keenly focused on exercising capital discipline, maximizing our full cycle margins and maintaining a high degree of financial strength and flexibility. 
So with that overview, I'll turn the call over to Dave Hager for our review of our quarterly operating highlights. Dave?"
266510,127127502,122512,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 04, 2011",2011-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone.

Before I get started, I want to point out a couple of changes we're making this quarter to our operational disclosures. In this morning's earnings release, we have included a table that details production, operated rigs and wells drilled by key operating areas. The absence of this information from my remarks combined with our efforts to streamline the discussion of quarterly results should result in a more concise call and leave more time for your questions. 
So with that, let's look at our E&P program. The majority of our 2011 E&P program is focused on execution of our low-risk, repeatable development plays like the Barnett, the Cana and Jackfish. We also have upside potential with funds devoted to the evaluation and de-risking of various emerging plays in the Permian, the Rockies and in Canada. In addition, we have allocated capital to the acquisition of additional acreage and drilling of the initial wells and a handful of new opportunities that we have not previously disclosed. One of which I will identify today. 
Looking first in our thermal oil project in Eastern Alberta. We wrapped up the final commissioning activities for Jackfish 2 in the first quarter and expect to begin injecting steam in the next couple of weeks with first plant oil for later this year. Jackfish 2 production will continue ramping up throughout 2012. Our regulatory application for Jackfish 3 continues to progress through the review process. 
At Pike, our SAGD oil sands joint venture with BP, we began appraisal drilling in the fourth quarter and continued throughout most of the first quarter. In total, we drilled 135 stratigraphic core wells this winter and acquired some 60 square miles of 3D seismic data. Although additional seismic interpretation work will be done in the coming months, results from the strat drilling program were in line with our expectations. 
Our 2011 drilling efforts were concentrated around the north-central portion of our Pike acreage and confirmed sufficient resources for at least one 300 million barrel project. Ultimately, we expect Pike to yield 4 or 5 similar size projects. We hope to begin the regulatory approval process for the first phase of Pike in the first half of 2012. Planning is already underway for next winter's drilling strat program and seismic program aimed at further refining our view on additional Pike prospects. 
Our combined interest in the Jackfish and Pike projects represent estimated risk resource potential of 1.4 billion barrels net to Devon. The development of these projects is expected to drive our net SAGD production from the 3,000 barrels per day, we are currently producing to at least 150,000 barrels per day by 2020. This is based on the acreage we currently have in hand, without any additional acreage acquisitions. 
Moving now to the Bone Springs play in the Permian Basin, Devon has established a position, covering 185,000 net acres. We currently have 3 operated rigs running. Our initial activity has been focused in 2 primary areas of the play. We have been running 2 rigs targeting the first and second Bone Springs interval in Northern Eddy and Lea County in New Mexico. 
Our second focus area targets the third Bone Springs on the Texas side in Reeves and Loving Counties. In the first quarter, we have completed our second well targeting this third Bone Springs interval and the results were quite impressive. The 100% Devon owned Talladaga 65 #1H was brought online, with an average 30-day IP rate of more than 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We recently added another rig to the Texas side of the play in the second quarter, bringing the total number of rigs we have focused on the Bone Springs to 4. 
Also in the Permian Basin and the Avalon Shale Play, we're currently running 3 rigs. We are still in the early stages of evaluating our acreage position. However, based on drilling results today, it appears, as you move east within the play, condensate yields improve. For example, the Cotton Draw Unit 134H in the eastern portion of the play was brought online late in the first quarter. For the 12 days, the well was flowing back before a shut in for installation of a pump, the well averaged 534 barrels of condensate per day and 2.5 million cubic feet of gas per day. Production history from similar wells in the area appears to support ultimate recoveries of between 400,000 and 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent. With approximately 60,000 net acres located in the eastern part of the play, Devon is well positioned in the liquids-rich portion of the play. 
Moving north to the Granite Wash play in the Texas panhandle, we continue to see solid results from our Turkey and Granite Wash A wells. The Wright 151-2H completed in the Granite Wash A was brought online in the first quarter with a 30-day IP rate of nearly 2,800 oil equivalent barrels per day, including 690 barrels of oil and 704 barrels of NGLs. We also drilled our first Granite Wash B Well during the quarter. The Eden 11 4H was brought on line with a 30-day IP rate of 1,700 oil equivalent barrels per day, including 340 barrels of oil and 410 barrels of NGLs. 
In total, Devon brought 6 operated Granite Wash wells online during the first quarter. 30-day IP rates from these wells averaged 1,760 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 250 barrels of oil and 490 barrels of natural gas liquids per day. We believe that we have about 700 risk undrilled locations in the Granite Wash. 
Moving now to the Cana-Woodford Shale in Western Oklahoma, where we are continuing to see outstanding results. First quarter production reached a record 162 million cubic feet equivalent per day. This puts us well on track to reach our year-end target of 250 million cubic feet equivalent per day. We continue to aggressively de-risk our position and secure the term acreage we acquired last year located northwest of the core area. Initial drilling results from this extension area indicate attractive rates of return, which should compete favorably for capital within our portfolio. 
In our Cana infill pilot program we initiated last year in the core area, production history from our 500-foot space wells continued to perform well. As a result, we plan to drill 3 additional infill pilot programs later this year. The additional production history gain from this infill wells should further support our position that 8 to 10 wells per section is the correct spacing in the core area. 
Shifting to the Barnett Shale field in North Texas, our initial plan call for running 12 rigs throughout 2011. However, as we enter the year, we had 13 rigs running in the Barnett. Given the tightness in the market, we decided to retain the 13th rig with a thought that we could probably need it in the Granite Wash as we de-risk that position. Given our recent success in the Granite Wash program, we will be moving that rig up there during the second quarter. And in addition, we picked up a 14th rig in the Barnett during late March. This is a high-efficiency rig being dropped by another company and we secured it to high grade our fleet. We will drop a lower efficiency rig, bringing our operated Barnett rig count back to 12 where we expect to keep it for the remainder of the year. 
Our net production continue to grow during the first quarter, and we exited the quarter producing over 1.2 Bcf equivalent per day, including 43,000 barrels of NGLs and condensate per day. Remarkably, our Barnett production has climbed in spite of reducing our rig count over the last 12 months. Our deep inventory of undrilled locations is some of the best parts of the play has allowed us to high grade our drilling program which, in turn, has yielded higher IP rates. In the first quarter, we brought 103 Barnett wells online with average 30-day IP rates of approximately 2.7 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including an average of 137 barrels of liquids per day. 
We also continue to improve results with pad drilling and other drilling efficiencies in the Barnett. By further reducing the number of days it takes to drill a well, we are able to mitigate rising service cost. In 2010, we averaged 13.3 days from spud to rig release. While so far in 2011, we're averaging just 12.6 days. 
On the exploration front, we continue to actively evaluate the oil and liquids potential on our acreage within our portfolio, dispensed numerous play types across multiple basins in the U.S. and Canada. In Canada, for instance, at our Viking light oil play in Saskatchewan, we drilled 3 wells in the first quarter. We are still in the early stages of evaluating our acreage position, but believe we could have between 1,000 and 2,000 Viking drilling locations. 
And in addition, we had 3 Cardium wells drilled at the end of the quarter in the Deep Basin of Alberta. Of our nearly 600,000 net acres in the Deep Basin, we believe at least 80,000 acres is perspective for the Cardium. We expect to complete both the Viking and Cardium wells in the second quarter. 
In the Rocky Mountains, our exploration efforts are focused on evaluating several Cretaceous oil objectives, including the Niobrara and Parkman on our 220,000 net acres in the Powder River Basin. We have 3 rigs currently running, with 2 drilling Parkman wells and one drilling for the Niobrara. In the first quarter, we drilled 4 Parkman wells which are all scheduled to be completed in the second quarter. We will keep you updated on our progress as we move forward. 
We have been telling you for sometime now about our goal to identify and establish large acreage positions in highly economic place at reasonable prices. We have continued building this new venture positions and now have roughly 850,000 net acres and a handful of new plays, primarily targeting oil and liquid rich gas. 
While we are still actively leasing in several of these plays, we're not ready to discuss them all, we have largely secured our position in one new area that I will tell you about today. The Tuscaloosa Shale is located along Louisiana and Mississippi border. This is a Cretaceous age formation that is stratigraphically equivalent to the Eagle Ford Shale. It is approximately 200 to 400 feet thick, at depths of 11,000 to 14,000 feet across our acreage position. Oil production has been established, up dip in the play from the Tuscaloosa Shale. We plan to utilize horizontal drilling and fracture simulation to enhance the productivity of the reservoir in both the oil and liquids-rich portion of the play. We have leased or have committed under contract approximately 250,000 prospective net acres at an average cost of $180 per acre. We plan to drill our first 2 horizontal wells in the play this year. 
In total, first quarter capital expenditures for North American onshore exploration and development totaled $1.5 billion. Our 2011 capital budget is front-end loaded due to our winter drilling program in Canada and because most of our 2011 SAGD expenditures occurred early in the year. However, the $1.5 billion of upstream capital spent in the first quarter is about $100 million over our internal budget. 
Two areas drove most of this overspent. First, activity levels on properties operated by others exceeded the level we expected; and second, some smaller working interest owners and properties operated by Devon were unable to fund their share of capital, thereby allowing us to step in for a greater interest in these projects. While this will likely push us to the higher end of the range we provided for capital expenditures, it should also result in greater production later in the year and into 2012. 
So in summary, our key developed projects are delivering excellent results. Accordingly, we are highly confident of meeting our production growth targets. This growth is being driven by strong, double-digit liquids growth. And we are making substantial progress on the exploration front. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff Agosta for the financial review and outlook. Jeff?"
266510,127127502,122512,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 04, 2011",2011-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. Before we move into the financial review of the quarter, I want to remind everyone, my comments will be focused on results from continuing operations or in other words, our North American Onshore business. For those o",974,"Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. Before we move into the financial review of the quarter, I want to remind everyone, my comments will be focused on results from continuing operations or in other words, our North American Onshore business. For those of you interested in a more detailed review of our discontinued operations, we have provided supplemental tables in our news release. 
As John mentioned earlier, first quarter results were very strong and most income statement in key operating metrics were right in line with our expectations. For today's call, I will only review those items that require additional commentary or outside our forecasted guidance range. 
The first item I will cover is our production performance. We produced 56.6 million equivalent barrels from continuing operations or approximately 629,000 barrels per day. This exceeded the top end of our guidance range by roughly 4,000 barrels per day. First quarter production benefited from better than expected performance from key properties, including the Cana-Woodford and Barnett Shales. 
When compared to the first quarter of 2010, our North American Onshore production increased 7%. This growth was achieved in spite of production interruptions caused by severe winter weather in the first quarter of '11. The most significant portion of this year-over-year growth came from U.S. oil and NGL production. Gains in the Cana, Permian Basin and Barnett drove this growth. 
Looking ahead to the second quarter of 2011, we anticipate continued strong growth. The midpoint of our guidance range of 645,000 to 655,000 barrels per day implies an increase in sequential quarter production nearly 3.5%. This growth is driven by the same areas that drove our first quarter results, the Cana, Permian Basin and Barnett. 
Given our performance thus far, we feel very comfortable with our forecast for liquids production growth in the high teens, driving overall top line production growth of 6% to 8% in 2011. While we are clearly on track to come in at the high end of this range, we are not modifying our full year guidance at this time. 
On the pricing front, the major story for the quarter was the robust oil price environment. Geopolitical tensions and strong worldwide demand resulted in WTI oil price surpassing $100 of barrel in early March. The strength in oil prices provided a good opportunity to hedge oil at historically attractive levels. As we have discussed in the past, we try to protect the price on roughly half of our expected production of both oil and natural gas. Our objective is to strike an appropriate balance between managing risk and retaining exposure to upside volatility. 
For the full year 2012, we now have 76,000 barrels per day, hedged through various swap and causes collar contracts. Of this amount, 22,000 barrels per day were swapped at a weighted average price of $107 per barrel, and the remaining position utilizes colors with a weighted average ceiling of $126 and a floor of $86. 
Natural gas price volatility has also provided an opportunity to boost our hedge position. For the second quarter of this year, we added 550 million cubic feet per day of hedges, increasing our total hedged production for the second quarter to roughly 1.3 Bcf per day. This position covers approximately 50% of our expected natural gas production in the second quarter, with a weighted average protected price of $4.95. 
We have also begun adding gas hedges for next year. For the full year of 2012, we now have swap and collar contracts covering nearly 400 million cubic feet per day, with a weighted average protected price of $4.93 per Mcf. We will post an updated hedging schedule on our website today that provides a more detailed view of our 2011 and '12 hedge positions. 
Looking now to expenses. Once again, the repositioned company did a very good job controlling costs. Expenses in most categories were generally in line with expectations during the first quarter. In aggregate, our pretax cash cost for the quarter came in at $13.12 per Boe and were about $0.10 per barrel lower than the first quarter of 2010. 
As E&P and service companies alike have disclosed, we are in a rising service and supply cost environment. However, our focus on cost control, combined with the efficiencies realized through our repositioning have more than offset both industry inflation and the negative impact of the strengthening Canadian dollar. 
Shifting to income taxes. As Vince mentioned earlier, our overall tax rate was 34% of adjusted pretax earnings or about 4 percentage points over the midpoint of our guidance. Current taxes were 2%, while deferred taxes were 32% of adjusted pretax earnings. This is indicative of what we expect for tax rates on adjusted earnings for the full year. A reconciliation of tax on both GAAP and adjusted earnings is available in today's release. 
Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, we anticipate continued upward pressure on cost. However, we remain comfortable with the full year expense forecasts provided in our February 8-K. Regardless of industry conditions, we are confident that Devon is well positioned to continue generating full cycle margins that are among the best of our peer group. 
Also, from a balance sheet perspective, Devon remains exceptionally strong. At March 31, we exited the quarter with $3.4 billion in cash and short-term investments and total debt of only $6.8 billion. This, of course, is before the $3.2 billion we will receive upon the close of the sale of Brazil. This significant financial strength provides us the flexibility to consistently invest in our business based on our long-term outlook regardless of the near-term macro economic backdrop. We believe that we are extremely well positioned to compete effectively, delivering highly competitive growth in cash flow and production per debt adjusted share. 
At this point, I'll turn the call back over to Vince for the Q&A."

And having said that, this is a frontier place, so I do want to mischaracterize it as something else because -- and frankly, we have been leading the industry by taking our position here. So it is a frontier play. But let me tell you some of the things that we do like about the play that give us reason for encouragement. It is the stratigraphic equivalent to the Eagle Ford Shale. It is deeper than Eagle Ford Shale about 11,000 to 14,000 foot depth, but it is a stratigraphic equivalent to it. There has been oil production established up dip in the Tuscaloosa Shale also. There have been some vertical wells that have been drilled in there that indicate that you're getting for a shale-type play, that has good porosity and permeability. We're also seeing some carbonates in there, which indicate that maybe somewhat brittle and able to be fractured. We've seen IPs on the vertical wells up to 300 barrels per day. They were just about -- just a very small number of horizontal wells have been drilled a couple or 3 years ago, and they were of limited horizontal link on the order of 1,500 to 2,000 foot with only 3 stages. But they tested up to 500 barrels per day from these very limited and minimally frac-ed wells. So all of those give us reasons for encouragement. Now having said that, it's very early on, and we're going to start drilling some horizontal wells, we need to get more data on rock frac-ability. And there are some sands below that are -- we need to stay away from those. We need to get more information on the phase, oil and natural gas because just aren't that many wells. We know exactly who are on the play, the boundaries between those are. So there are some risks associated with it. I don't want to mislead you. But there are some encouraging qualities to establish a 250,000-acre position for less than $50 million, that's kind of thing we're successful. We can create an awful lot of value."

As always, we'll ask each participant on the call to limit his or her questions to one initial inquiry and one follow-up. A replay of the call will be available later today through a link on our Home page, that's www.devonenergy.com. 
During the call today, we will make some minor refinements to our forward-looking estimates for items such as production, capital expenditures and our hedge position. But since the revisions are so minor, we're not going to issue a new 8-K. We'll just post the changes to our Guidance page on our website. To find that, just click on the Guidance link found in the Investor Relations section of the Devon website. 
Please note that all references in today's call to our plans, forecast, expectations, estimates and so on are forward-looking statements under U.S. securities law. And while many factors could cause our actual results to differ from those estimates, we always strive to give you the very best guidance we can. We encourage you to review a discussion of risk factors if you're so inclined that is provided with our Form 8-K forecast.
We will reference certain non-GAAP performance measures in today's call. When we use these measures, we're required to provide certain related disclosures and those disclosures can also be found on the Devon website. 
One final item, while our first quarter cash flow per share significantly beat the consensus estimate, our earnings per share from continuing operations came in about $0.05 shy of consensus. Production was better than expected and our pretax cost per barrel were lower than the midpoint of our guidance. However, our deferred taxes were higher than expected. Total adjusted income tax expense for the quarter of 34% of pretax earnings was 4 percentage points over the midpoint of our guidance. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO, John Richels. John?"

We achieved th",758,"Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. First quarter of 2011 was really an outstanding one for Devon. Our North American onshore production increased 7% compared to the first quarter of 2010, exceeding the top end of our guidance range. We achieved this year-over-year production growth in spite of first quarter production outages resulting from severe weather. In addition, production growth accelerated as we exited the first quarter. We're very confident that we will deliver on our second quarter 2011 production forecast of 645,000 to 655,000 equivalent barrels per day. This represents an increase of about 3.5% over the first quarter. 
We remain on track to deliver on our full year 2000 production forecast of 236 million to 240 million barrels of oil equivalent. And in addition, we expect to shrink our balance sheet with share repurchases and a reduction in net debt. This should drive our 2011 production growth per debt adjusted share to a rate in the mid-teens. 
Devon also delivered an excellent first quarter performance from a cost-containment perspective. Continued focus on cost containment, mitigated industry inflation and the impact of the stronger Canadian dollar. As a result, Devon actually saw a decrease in unit cost versus the year-ago quarter. 
As Dave is going to discuss later in the call, we continued executing on our North American onshore strategy with excellent results from our key development projects, and we also made some encouraging progress on the exploration front. 
In the first quarter, we generated $1.5 billion of cash flow before balance sheet changes. This cash flow from operations and the liquidity provided through our strategic repositioning comfortably funded our capital programs and returned nearly $800 million to our shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and dividends. Of the $3.5 billion authorized per share repurchases in May of 2010, we've now spent about $2.1 billion. We have purchased with that more than 28 million shares or just over 6% of our outstanding shares at an average price of roughly $73 per share. This brings our total shares repurchase since 2004 up to 95 million shares or roughly 20% of our shares outstanding. As we previously indicated, we expect to complete our share repurchase program by year end. 
I'm sure by now that most of you are aware of the recent statements to the press by Brazilian authorities indicating that approval of the $3.2 billion sale of our Brazilian assets to BP is imminent. Based on their statements, we expect this transaction to close within the next few weeks. With the strategic repositioning that we began in November of 2009 now substantially complete, I could not be more pleased with the results. The repositioned company has all of the attributes necessary to deliver superior per share growth. We're generating excellent full cycle returns, we have superior financial strength and we have a very deep inventory of highly economic low-risk development projects.
The depths and breadths of our balanced North American property portfolio provides us with a compelling strategic advantage, the luxury of easily shifting capital in response to changing market conditions. Unlike many of our peers, we can focus our capital on economic, liquids opportunities within our existing portfolio. Because we've always valued a liquids to gas balance, we already have a vast inventory of liquids opportunities, including the Canadian oil sands, the Permian Basin, the Barnett Shale, the Cana-Woodford Shale and the Granite Wash. 
In addition, we continue to replenish and build upon that inventory with our new ventures activities. In 2011, we're allocating well over 90% of our upstream capital towards oil and liquids-rich opportunities. This will enable us to grow our year-over-year oil and natural gas liquids production at a rate in the high teens. And inevitably at some point in the future, gas prices will recover and incentivize the drilling of dry gas place. Since the vast majority of our properties are held by production, we can easily maintain our dry gas positions in the option value they represent. In the meantime, we'll continue to allocate our capital to oil and liquids-rich growth projects to generate strong rates of return in the current environment. 
This in summary, we remain fully committed to optimizing our growth on a per-share basis adjusted for debt. And in order to achieve that goal, we remain keenly focused on exercising capital discipline, maximizing our full cycle margins and maintaining a high degree of financial strength and flexibility. 
So with that overview, I'll turn the call over to Dave Hager for our review of our quarterly operating highlights. Dave?"
266510,127127502,122522,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 04, 2011",2011-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone.

Before I get started, I want to point out a couple of changes we're making this quarter to our operational disclosures. In this morning's earnings release, we have included a table that details production, operated rigs and wells drilled by key operating areas. The absence of this information from my remarks combined with our efforts to streamline the discussion of quarterly results should result in a more concise call and leave more time for your questions. 
So with that, let's look at our E&P program. The majority of our 2011 E&P program is focused on execution of our low-risk, repeatable development plays like the Barnett, the Cana and Jackfish. We also have upside potential with funds devoted to the evaluation and de-risking of various emerging plays in the Permian, the Rockies and in Canada. In addition, we have allocated capital to the acquisition of additional acreage and drilling of the initial wells and a handful of new opportunities that we have not previously disclosed. One of which I will identify today. 
Looking first in our thermal oil project in Eastern Alberta. We wrapped up the final commissioning activities for Jackfish 2 in the first quarter and expect to begin injecting steam in the next couple of weeks with first plant oil for later this year. Jackfish 2 production will continue ramping up throughout 2012. Our regulatory application for Jackfish 3 continues to progress through the review process. 
At Pike, our SAGD oil sands joint venture with BP, we began appraisal drilling in the fourth quarter and continued throughout most of the first quarter. In total, we drilled 135 stratigraphic core wells this winter and acquired some 60 square miles of 3D seismic data. Although additional seismic interpretation work will be done in the coming months, results from the strat drilling program were in line with our expectations. 
Our 2011 drilling efforts were concentrated around the north-central portion of our Pike acreage and confirmed sufficient resources for at least one 300 million barrel project. Ultimately, we expect Pike to yield 4 or 5 similar size projects. We hope to begin the regulatory approval process for the first phase of Pike in the first half of 2012. Planning is already underway for next winter's drilling strat program and seismic program aimed at further refining our view on additional Pike prospects. 
Our combined interest in the Jackfish and Pike projects represent estimated risk resource potential of 1.4 billion barrels net to Devon. The development of these projects is expected to drive our net SAGD production from the 3,000 barrels per day, we are currently producing to at least 150,000 barrels per day by 2020. This is based on the acreage we currently have in hand, without any additional acreage acquisitions. 
Moving now to the Bone Springs play in the Permian Basin, Devon has established a position, covering 185,000 net acres. We currently have 3 operated rigs running. Our initial activity has been focused in 2 primary areas of the play. We have been running 2 rigs targeting the first and second Bone Springs interval in Northern Eddy and Lea County in New Mexico. 
Our second focus area targets the third Bone Springs on the Texas side in Reeves and Loving Counties. In the first quarter, we have completed our second well targeting this third Bone Springs interval and the results were quite impressive. The 100% Devon owned Talladaga 65 #1H was brought online, with an average 30-day IP rate of more than 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We recently added another rig to the Texas side of the play in the second quarter, bringing the total number of rigs we have focused on the Bone Springs to 4. 
Also in the Permian Basin and the Avalon Shale Play, we're currently running 3 rigs. We are still in the early stages of evaluating our acreage position. However, based on drilling results to date, it appears, as you move east within the play, condensate yields improve. For example, the Cotton Draw Unit 134H in the eastern portion of the play was brought online late in the first quarter. For the 12 days, the well was flowing back before a shut in for installation of a pump, the well averaged 534 barrels of condensate per day and 2.5 million cubic feet of gas per day. Production history from similar wells in the area appears to support ultimate recoveries of between 400,000 and 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent. With approximately 60,000 net acres located in the eastern part of the play, Devon is well positioned in the liquids-rich portion of the play. 
Moving north to the Granite Wash play in the Texas panhandle, we continue to see solid results from our Cherokee and Granite Wash A wells. The Wright 151-2H completed in the Granite Wash A was brought online in the first quarter with a 30-day IP rate of nearly 2,800 oil equivalent barrels per day, including 690 barrels of oil and 704 barrels of NGLs. We also drilled our first Granite Wash B Well during the quarter. The Eden 11 4H was brought on line with a 30-day IP rate of 1,700 oil equivalent barrels per day, including 340 barrels of oil and 410 barrels of NGLs. 
In total, Devon brought 6 operated Granite Wash wells online during the first quarter. 30-day IP rates from these wells averaged 1,760 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 250 barrels of oil and 490 barrels of natural gas liquids per day. We believe that we have about 700 risk undrilled locations in the Granite Wash. 
Moving now to the Cana-Woodford Shale in Western Oklahoma, where we are continuing to see outstanding results. First quarter production reached a record 162 million cubic feet equivalent per day. This puts us well on track to reach our year-end target of 250 million cubic feet equivalent per day. We continue to aggressively de-risk our position and secure the term acreage we acquired last year located northwest of the core area. Initial drilling results from this extension area indicate attractive rates of return, which should compete favorably for capital within our portfolio. 
In our Cana infill pilot program we initiated last year in the core area, production history from our 500-foot space wells continued to perform well. As a result, we plan to drill 3 additional infill pilot programs later this year. The additional production history gain from these infill wells should further support our position that 8 to 10 wells per section is the correct spacing in the core area. 
Shifting to the Barnett Shale field in North Texas, our initial plan calls for running 12 rigs throughout 2011. However, as we enter the year, we had 13 rigs running in the Barnett. Given the tightness in the market, we decided to retain the 13th rig with a thought that we could probably need it in the Granite Wash as we de-risk that position. Given our recent success in the Granite Wash program, we will be moving that rig up there during the second quarter. And in addition, we picked up a 14th rig in the Barnett during late March. This is a high-efficiency rig being dropped by another company and we secured it to high grade our fleet. We will drop a lower efficiency rig, bringing our operated Barnett rig count back to 12 where we expect to keep it for the remainder of the year. 
Our net production continue to grow during the first quarter, and we exited the quarter producing over 1.2 Bcf equivalent per day, including 43,000 barrels of NGLs and condensate per day. Remarkably, our Barnett production has climbed in spite of reducing our rig count over the last 12 months. Our deep inventory of undrilled locations is some of the best parts of the play has allowed us to high grade our drilling program which, in turn, has yielded higher IP rates. In the first quarter, we brought 103 Barnett wells online with average 30-day IP rates of approximately 2.7 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including an average of 137 barrels of liquids per day. 
We also continue to improve results with pad drilling and other drilling efficiencies in the Barnett. By further reducing the number of days it takes to drill a well, we are able to mitigate rising service cost. In 2010, we averaged 13.3 days from spud to rig release. While so far in 2011, we're averaging just 12.6 days. 
On the exploration front, we continue to actively evaluate the oil and liquids potential on our acreage within our portfolio that spans numerous play types across multiple basins in the U.S. and Canada. In Canada, for instance, at our Viking light oil play in Saskatchewan, we drilled 3 wells in the first quarter. We are still in the early stages of evaluating our acreage position, but believe we could have between 1,000 and 2,000 Viking drilling locations. 
And in addition, we had 3 Cardium wells drilled at the end of the quarter in the Deep Basin of Alberta. Of our nearly 600,000 net acres in the Deep Basin, we believe at least 80,000 acres is perspective for the Cardium. We expect to complete both the Viking and Cardium wells in the second quarter. 
In the Rocky Mountains, our exploration efforts are focused on evaluating several Cretaceous oil objectives, including the Niobrara and Parkman on our 220,000 net acres in the Powder River Basin. We have 3 rigs currently running, with 2 drilling Parkman wells and one drilling for the Niobrara. In the first quarter, we drilled 4 Parkman wells which are all scheduled to be completed in the second quarter. We will keep you updated on our progress as we move forward. 
We have been telling you for sometime now about our goal to identify and establish large acreage positions in highly economic plays at reasonable prices. We have continued building these new venture positions and now have roughly 850,000 net acres and a handful of new plays, primarily targeting oil and liquid rich gas. 
While we are still actively leasing in several of these plays, we're not ready to discuss them all, we have largely secured our position in one new area that I will tell you about today. The Tuscaloosa Shale is located along Louisiana and Mississippi border. This is a Cretaceous age formation that is stratigraphically equivalent to the Eagle Ford Shale. It is approximately 200 to 400 feet thick, at depths of 11,000 to 14,000 feet across our acreage position. Oil production has been established, up dip in the play from the Tuscaloosa Shale. We plan to utilize horizontal drilling and fracture simulation to enhance the productivity of the reservoir in both the oil and liquids-rich portion of the play. We have leased or have committed under contract approximately 250,000 prospective net acres at an average cost of $180 per acre. We plan to drill our first 2 horizontal wells in the play this year. 
In total, first quarter capital expenditures for North American onshore exploration and development totaled $1.5 billion. Our 2011 capital budget is front-end loaded due to our winter drilling program in Canada and because most of our 2011 SAGD expenditures occurred early in the year. However, the $1.5 billion of upstream capital spent in the first quarter is about $100 million over our internal budget. 
Two areas drove most of this overspent. First, activity levels on properties operated by others exceeded the level we expected; and second, some smaller working interest owners and properties operated by Devon were unable to fund their share of capital, thereby allowing us to step in for a greater interest in these projects. While this will likely push us to the higher end of the range we provided for capital expenditures, it should also result in greater production later in the year and into 2012. 
So in summary, our key developed projects are delivering excellent results. Accordingly, we are highly confident of meeting our production growth targets. This growth is being driven by strong, double-digit liquids growth. And we are making substantial progress on the exploration front. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff Agosta for the financial review and outlook. Jeff?"
266510,127127502,122522,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 04, 2011",2011-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. Before we move into the financial review of the quarter, I want to remind everyone, my comments will be focused on results from continuing operations or in other words, our North American Onshore business. For those o",976,"Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. Before we move into the financial review of the quarter, I want to remind everyone, my comments will be focused on results from continuing operations or in other words, our North American Onshore business. For those of you interested in a more detailed review of our discontinued operations, we have provided supplemental tables in our news release. 
As John mentioned earlier, first quarter results were very strong and most income statement in key operating metrics were right in line with our expectations. For today's call, I will only review those items that require additional commentary or are outside our forecasted guidance range. 
The first item I will cover is our production performance. We produced 56.6 million equivalent barrels from continuing operations or approximately 629,000 barrels per day. This exceeded the top end of our guidance range by roughly 4,000 barrels per day. First quarter production benefited from better than expected performance from key properties, including the Cana-Woodford and Barnett Shales. 
When compared to the first quarter of 2010, our North American Onshore production increased 7%. This growth was achieved in spite of production interruptions caused by severe winter weather in the first quarter of '11. The most significant portion of this year-over-year growth came from U.S. oil and NGL production. Gains in the Cana, Permian Basin and Barnett drove this growth. 
Looking ahead to the second quarter of 2011, we anticipate continued strong growth. The midpoint of our guidance range of 645,000 to 655,000 barrels per day implies an increase in sequential quarter production nearly 3.5%. This growth is driven by the same areas that drove our first quarter results, the Cana, Permian Basin and Barnett. 
Given our performance thus far, we feel very comfortable with our forecast for liquids production growth in the high teens, driving overall top line production growth of 6% to 8% in 2011. While we are clearly on track to come in at the high end of this range, we are not modifying our full year guidance at this time. 
On the pricing front, the major story for the quarter was the robust oil price environment. Geopolitical tensions and strong worldwide demand resulted in WTI oil price surpassing $100 a barrel in early March. The strength in oil prices provided a good opportunity to hedge oil at historically attractive levels. As we have discussed in the past, we try to protect the price on roughly half of our expected production of both oil and natural gas. Our objective is to strike an appropriate balance between managing risk and retaining exposure to upside volatility. 
For the full year of 2012, we now have 76,000 barrels per day, hedged through various swap and causes collar contracts. Of this amount, 22,000 barrels per day were swapped at a weighted average price of $107 per barrel, and the remaining position utilizes collars with a weighted average ceiling of $126 and a floor of $86. 
Natural gas price volatility has also provided an opportunity to boost our hedge position. For the second quarter of this year, we added 550 million cubic feet per day of hedges, increasing our total hedged production for the second quarter to roughly 1.3 Bcf per day. This position covers approximately 50% of our expected natural gas production in the second quarter, with a weighted average protected price of $4.95. 
We have also begun adding gas hedges for next year. For the full year of 2012, we now have swap and collar contracts covering nearly 400 million cubic feet per day, with a weighted average protected price of $4.93 per Mcf. We will post an updated hedging schedule on our website today that provides a more detailed view of our 2011 and '12 hedge positions. 
Looking now to expenses. Once again, the repositioned company did a very good job controlling costs. Expenses in most categories were generally in line with expectations during the first quarter. In aggregate, our pretax cash cost for the quarter came in at $13.12 per Boe and were about $0.10 per barrel lower than the first quarter of 2010. 
As E&P and service companies alike have disclosed, we are in a rising service and supply cost environment. However, our focus on cost control, combined with the efficiencies realized through our repositioning have more than offset both industry inflation and the negative impact of the strengthening Canadian dollar. 
Shifting to income taxes. As Vince mentioned earlier, our overall tax rate was 34% of adjusted pretax earnings or about 4 percentage points over the midpoint of our guidance. Current taxes were 2%, while deferred taxes were 32% of adjusted pretax earnings. This is indicative of what we expect for tax rates on adjusted earnings for the full year. A reconciliation of tax on both GAAP and adjusted earnings is available in today's release. 
Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, we anticipate continued upward pressure on cost. However, we remain comfortable with the full year expense forecasts provided in our February 8-K. Regardless of industry conditions, we are confident that Devon is well positioned to continue generating full cycle margins that are among the best of our peer group. 
Also, from a balance sheet perspective, Devon remains exceptionally strong. At March 31, we exited the quarter with $3.4 billion in cash and short-term investments and total debt of only $6.8 billion. This, of course, is before the $3.2 billion we will receive upon the close of the sale of Brazil. This significant financial strength provides us the flexibility to consistently invest in our business based on our long-term outlook regardless of the near-term macro economic backdrop. We believe that we are extremely well positioned to compete effectively, delivering highly competitive growth in cash flow and production per debt adjusted share. 
At this point, I'll turn the call back over to Vince for the Q&A."

And having said that, this is a frontier place, so I do want to mischaracterize it as something else because -- and frankly, we have been leading the industry by taking our position here. So it is a frontier play. But let me tell you some of the things that we do like about the play that give us reason for encouragement. It is the stratigraphic equivalent to the Eagle Ford Shale. It is deeper than Eagle Ford Shale about 11,000 to 14,000 foot depth, but it is a stratigraphic equivalent to it. There has been oil production established up dip in the Tuscaloosa Shale also. There have been some vertical wells that have been drilled in there that indicates that you're getting for a shale-type play, that has good porosity and permeability. We're also seeing some carbonates in there, which indicate that maybe somewhat brittle and able to be fractured. We've seen IPs on the vertical wells up to 300 barrels per day. They were just about -- just a very small number of horizontal wells have been drilled a couple or 3 years ago, and they were of limited horizontal link on the order of 1,500 to 2,000 foot with only 3 stages. But they tested up to 500 barrels per day from these very limited and minimally frac-ed wells. So all of those give us reasons for encouragement. Now having said that, it's very early on, and we're going to start drilling some horizontal wells, we need to get more data on rock frac-ability. And there are some sands below that are wet, we need to stay away from those. We need to get more information on the phase, oil and natural gas because just aren't that many wells. We know exactly who are on the play, the boundaries between those are. So there are some risks associated with it. I don't want to mislead you. But there are some encouraging qualities to establish a 250,000-acre position for less than $50 million, that's kind of thing we're successful. We can create an awful lot of value."

266510,127127525,151357,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2011",2011-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by stating the obvious. Devon's second quarter 2011 was an excellent one. Our North American onshore production reached an all-time record, averaging 660,000 equivalent barrels per day. That's a 5",904,"Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by stating the obvious. Devon's second quarter 2011 was an excellent one. Our North American onshore production reached an all-time record, averaging 660,000 equivalent barrels per day. That's a 5% increase over the first quarter, continued focus on efficiency and cost control, mitigated industry inflation and the impact of a stronger Canadian dollar. In fact, our pretax cash cost per equivalent barrel were essentially flat compared to the previous quarter and the year-ago quarter. 
With production above our guidance, higher realized commodity prices and effective cost management, our second quarter adjusted earnings climbed 10% over the prior year quarter to $1.71 per diluted share and that exceeded the first call mean by $0.17. 
Cash flow before balance sheet changes reached $1.6 billion or $3.81 per diluted share surpassing the street mean estimate by $0.48. 
Net earnings including the gain on the sale of Brazil totaled a whopping $2.7 billion for the second quarter or $6.48 per diluted share. And during the second quarter, we repurchased 7.1 million shares for $584 million. To date, we have spent $2.6 billion of the $3.5 billion current authorization to repurchase 35.1 million shares. This represents almost 8% of our outstanding shares and those shares were acquired at an average price of roughly $74 per share. We remain on track to complete that repurchase program by the end of the year.
In May, we closed our $3.2 billion sale of our Brazilian assets which essentially completes the strategic repositioning of Devon to a company focused entirely onshore in North America. Our total pretax divestiture proceeds exceeded $10 billion, with after-tax proceeds estimated to $8 billion. Currently, we have more than $6.5 billion of cash and short-term investments outside the U.S. that we have not repatriated. However, it's important to note that our after-tax estimate of proceeds assumes full payment of the taxes triggered by repatriation of most of those funds under current U.S. tax law. If a more favorable tax situation develops for the repatriation of these funds, or if we redeploy the proceeds in Canada, we will have up to $900 million of upside. Until we have a better visibility into potential repatriation tax legislation and determine the optimal long-term capital allocation between the U.S. and Canada, our divestiture proceeds will remain outside the U.S. 
Devon has emerged from the repositioning in a truly enviable position. We have a deep inventory of low-risk drilling locations, including years of high margin oil and liquids-rich development in our cornerstone project areas. This include the Barnett, the Cana, and our steam-assisted gravity drainage project in Canada. We are drilling our most economic wells ever in the liquid-rich portions of the Barnett. Our first mover position has provided us with the largest and best acreage position. Furthermore, our low entry and royalty cost enhanced the economic returns across our inventory of thousands of undrilled Barnett locations. In the liquids-rich Cana, we're taking advantage of opportunities to increase our working interest and are continuing to delineate our condensate-rich acreage to the northwest. We could continue for years at our current pace of development without any additional inventory. However, in order to bring forward the value embedded in our existing acreage positions, we are pursuing a wide range of exploration opportunities across North America. 
In the Permian and Western Canadian sedimentary basins, for example, we're accelerating oil and liquids-rich exploration drilling. Given the recent advances in drilling and completions technology and the stackpay nature of these basins, we are pursuing more than 20 oil and liquids-rich plays that have emerged in these two basins alone. 
Our inventory represents more than 3 billion oil equivalent barrels of net unrisked resource across our more than 5 million net perspective acres. These substantial positions provide Devon with thousands of potential locations, representing many years of additional growth. 
We are also moving forward with the testing of our new venture plays. These include the Tuscaloosa, the Niobrara, the Mississippi Lime in Oklahoma, the Ohio Utica, and the A1 Carbonate and Utica in Michigan. 
We've been successful with our strategy of acquiring sizable positions in these oil and liquids-rich plays, where for the most part competition had not yet driven up prices. Instead of leasing large blocks of trend acreage and then figuring out where the play works best, we've taken more targeted approach. Similar to our approach in the Cana play, we've attempted to identify the best parts of the plays and specifically focused our acreage acquisitions in those areas. 
Utilizing this approach, we've secured 1.1 million net acres at a very reasonable cost in what we believe to be highly economic parts of these five plays. While each of these plays has risk, it's likely several will turn out to be highly economic large scale development plays. The second half of this year is shaping up to be an exciting time for Devon, with the initial drilling results anticipated from a wide range of exploration opportunities. 
In summary, the repositioned company has all the attributes necessary to deliver highly competitive per share growth. We're generating excellent, full cycle returns. We have superior financial strength and we have a deep inventory of economic, low-risk development projects and promising exploration projects in emerging plays and new ventures. So with that overview, I will turn the call over to Dave Hager for a review of our quarterly operating highlights. Dave?"
266510,127127525,151357,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2011",2011-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. We continue to see outstanding results from our 2011 E&P capital program. Our key development plays, including the Barnett, the Cana and Jackfish are all performing very well. We also remain very active in evaluating",2368,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. We continue to see outstanding results from our 2011 E&P capital program. Our key development plays, including the Barnett, the Cana and Jackfish are all performing very well. We also remain very active in evaluating and de-risking the upside potential in our various emerging and new venture plays. With more than 90% of our 2011 E&P capital allocated towards oil and liquids-rich projects and with the solid results we have seen so far this year, we are well on our way to deliver liquids growth in the high teens in 2011. 
So let's take a look at some of the highlights for the quarter. Starting with our oil -- our thermal oil projects in Eastern Alberta, Jackfish continues to deliver industry-leading performance. During the second quarter, Jackfish 1 production averaged 31,000 barrels of oil per day net of oil. At Jackfish 2, we began injecting steam in the second quarter. All four pads are currently in the circulation phase of the process. As some of you may have recall from our recent SAGD school, this is the initial stage where steam is injected into both the injector and producer wells to begin warming the reservoir. Later this month, three of the pads will move into the partial SAGD phase and production will continue to ramp up. We exited the second quarter producing about 8,000 barrels per day net of royalties at Jackfish 2. 
At Pike, with data from nearly 400 wells and some 60 square miles of seismic, our SAGD team has begun engineering work to our 105,000-barrel per day facility for Pike 1. This would be essentially 3 Jackfish-sized facilities from a single plant site. You might recall we completed the resource of valuation for 2 of the 3 projects with the last winter's stratigraphic drilling. 
Planning efforts are already underway for our 2011, 2012 winter growing and seismic programs and we'll focus on defining the third 35,000-barrel per day project in the Pike 1 complex. Ultimately, we believe that Pike can support 4 or 5 Jackfish-sized projects. And when combined with Jackfish, we expect to grow Devon's net thermal oil production to between 150,000 and 175,000 barrels per day by 2020. 
Moving now to the Permian basin, we currently have 19 operated rigs pursuing targets in numerous play types across our roughly 1 million net acre position. Our second quarter production from the Permian increased 17% over the second quarter of 2010 to 49,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Oil and natural gas liquids accounted for 75% of the quarter's production. 
In the Permian in our Wolfberry light oil play, we currently have 5 operated rigs drilling, as we continue the evaluation and development of our 160,000 net acres. Through the second quarter, we have drilled approximately 50 of our planned 135 program -- well program for this year. We recently initiated a four-well 20-acre infill pilot program and will be testing the application of horizontal drilling in certain areas as well. We have significant running room in this high return light oil play, with more than 850 net risk locations remaining. 
On our roughly 200,000 net acres in the Bone Springs oil play, we currently have 5 operated rigs running. We continue to have great results from our horizontal programs, on both the New Mexico and Texas side of the play. In the second quarter, we completed 8 wells in the second Bone Springs interval in New Mexico, with 30-day average IP rates of 665 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This included one exceptionally strong well, the Diamond 1H that was brought online with an average 30-day IP rate of more than 1,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Our Bone Springs well cost in New Mexico are running about $5 million per well, with EURs averaging 400,000 barrels equivalent. On the Texas side in the Bone Springs play, we completed our third well targeting the bone's  third Bone Springs interval. The 100% Devon-owned Talladega 65 2H was brought online recently. After 15 days of production, this well has averaged 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Although our Texas Bone Springs production history is limited to just a few wells, we are encouraged with the shower declines we've seen to this point. With average EURs exceeding 600,000 barrels equivalent, and with well cost running about $7 million, these wells offer outstanding returns. We've planned out a third rig in the Texas side of the play later this year, bringing our total number of rigs working in the Bone Springs up to 6. 
Also in the Permian, the Delaware has another conventional oil information we are targeting with horizontal drilling. We completed 3 wells in the second quarter, including the lagoon salada a lot 6H that came on with 30-day IP rate of more than 800 oil equivalent barrels per day. We now have 3 operated rigs drilling Delaware horizontal wells. 
Elsewhere in the Permian basin, we are targeting 2 operated rigs in the Avalon Shale play. Our activity is now focused on our 65,000 net acres in the eastern portion of the play where condensate yields are higher. We currently have 3 wells in various stages of drilling or completion and should have those results for you next quarter. 
And finally, in the Permian basin, we have assembled approximately 65,000 net acres in the southern end of the Midland Basin and the Wolfcamp Shale oil play. We are currently running 2 operated rigs with our first 3 wells in the play in various stages of drilling or completion. We hope to have results for you next quarter. This is a hot play in the industry. And with the positive indications we've seen to date, we now plan to drill 8 Wolfcamp Shale exploration wells in 2011. 
In addition to the Midland Basin acreage, we have about 200,000 net acres in the Delaware Basin and this perspective for the Wolfcamp Shale our current drilling on test the formation potential in the Delaware Basin. 
Moving north to the Texas panhandle and the Granite Wash play, we continue to see solid results from our Cherokee and Granite Wash wells. We are running 5 operated rigs here and brought 8 operated Granite Wash wells online during the second quarter. the 30-day IPs rates from these wells averaged over 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Including 200 barrels of oil and 730 barrels of natural gas liquids per day. 
Moving now to the Cana Woodford Shale in Western Oklahoma. As everyone is well aware by now, our Cana gas processing plant by damaged by a tornado on May 24. It's worth noting that we have both property and business interruption insurance that Jeff will cover in more detail later. Work is underway to repair the damage and we expect the plant to be forward repaired and operational during the fourth quarter. We are confident of our year-end exit rate target for Cana of 275 million cubic feet equivalent per day, net to Devon's interest. In spite of the planned interruption, our second quarter net Cana production averaged 17% over the first quarter to a record 189 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including nearly 9,000 barrels per day of liquids. 
To keep pace with our Cana Woodford growth and captured additional value from the liquids-rich portions in the field, we plan to begin the first expansion to our Cana gas processing plant later this year. The facility's initial processing capacity of 200 million cubic feet per day will be expanded to 350 million a day and will be capable of extracting up to 27,000 barrels of NGLs per day. The $125 million expansion is expected to be operational in the fourth quarter of 2012.
Shifting to the Barnett Shale field in North Texas. This field still continues to be a significant and highly economic resource for us. Our 2011 program has yielded the best wells we have ever drilled in the Barnett. We have seen average EURs increase to 3.2 Bcf equivalent per day. We were in 13 operated rigs in the Barnett for most in the second quarter. Subsequent to June 30, we dropped one rig, bringing our operated rig count back to 12 where we expect to keep it for the remainder of the year. in the second quarter, we brought 114 Barnett wells online, with average 30-day IP rates of approximately 3.4 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including an average 125 barrels of liquids per day. 
In the second quarter, our net production reached a record 1.28 bcf equivalent per day, that is 1,280 billion in cubic feet equivalent per day including 46,000 barrels of per day liquids. This represents a 5% sequential quarter increase and a 13% increase over the second quarter of last year. 
With the high liquids yield we are seeing from our Barnett drilling combined with our outlook for gas and NGL product spreads, we recently made the decision to expand our Bridgeport gas processing plant for the seventh time. The 140-million-a-day expansion will provide an additional 11,000 barrels per day of NGL production capacity. The $160 million expansion is expected to be operational in the first quarter of 2013. Upon completion, the Bridgeport facility will have an inlet capacity of 790 million cubic feet per day, with an NGL production capacity of 65,000 barrels per day, making it one of the largest gas processing facilities in the lower 48. 
On the exploration front, as John indicated, we are continuing to actively evaluate the oil and liquids potential on acreage within our portfolios that spans numerous play types across multiple basins in the U.S. and Canada. This includes several new venture areas in the U.S. where we have assembled 1.1 million net acres. And in Niobrara, we have approximately 200,000 net acres in the Powder River Basin and 100,000 net acres in northern part of the DJ Basin. This is a very active industry play right now, with about 30 rigs working. Many of the industry wells drilled to date were drilled without the benefit of 3D data, making it difficult to target, identify and land in the appropriate zones. Our initial focus in the DJ Basin will be to utilize 3D to improve upon the lack of consistency demonstrated to date by -- in this play by the industry. 
We are currently drilling our first wells in both basins. We plan to drill or participate in 6 Niobrara wells in the Powder and 4 in the DJ basin in 2011. 
In the Mississippi and oil play located in North Central Oklahoma, we have secured over 200,000 net acres. This is a play originally established by a vertical production years ago, but is now being pursued with horizontal drilling. We drilled our first vertical well to gather data in the second quarter, and we are currently drilling our first horizontal well. In total, we plan to drill or participate in 12-to-15 wells in 2011. 
There's been a lot of discussion lately of the Ohio Utica Shale. And as most of you know, Devon was an early mover. We've established 110,000 net acres in what we believe in the heart of the oil window. The primary risk to a shale play is of course the ability to move fluid through a very tight reservoir. However, we have now analyzed the core from our first Utica well and are highly encouraged by the positive permeability indications seen in our first well. Based on these early results, we believe the oil window could offer some of the best economics in the play. We plan to drill 3 additional Ohio Utica wells this year. 
Just in the north as our 300,000-acre position in the Michigan Basin is prospective for both the Utica Shale, as well as the A1 Carbonate. As you may know, this is historically been a prolific basin. We are particularly excited about the potential of the A1 Carbonate which was a source rock for the Niobrara reef play in Michigan. We drilled our first 2 vertical core wells and are currently evaluating the data. 
And finally, in the Tuscaloosa Shale play located along the Louisiana and Mississippi border, we recently completed drilling, corning and logging operations in our first well, the lane 64-1. This is a vertical well that we drilled to obtain data. The rig has now moved up depth to the beach growth 68 1H where we plan to gather additional core and log data before drilling bilateral and completing it as our first horizontal in the Tuscaloosa. 
Another exploration play that's recently caught the Street's attention is the smack dense oil play located in North Louisiana. We have about 40,000 net acres perspective in the play and expect to spot our first horizontal well in this play next month. 
As I mentioned, we also have a significant exploration effort underway in Canada, targeting the deep basin where we have Cardium and lower Cretaceous drilling programs underway, as well as Cardium program in the Ferrier Area of our Central Alberta and our Viking program in Saskatchewan. 
Although wet weather has delayed a portion of our Canadian expiration program, we expect to still expect to complete our 2011 program. However, at our Viking light oil play in Saskatchewan, we did complete 2 wells in the second quarter, one of which IP'd at 90 barrels of oil per day. We expect this play to be economic, with well cost in the $1 million to $1.2 million per well range, IPs of approximately 40 barrels per day and EURs of 50,000 barrels. While these results are encouraging, we're still in the early stages of evaluating the potential on our 900,000 net acre position. If successful, we could have more than 1,000 Viking drilling locations. 
In summary, all of our key development projects are delivering excellent results, supporting our production growth targets. Growth is being driven by liquids growth in the high teens. In addition, we are entering a very exciting time on the exploration front as we get our first wells down in a variety of different plays. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff Agosta for the financial review and outlook. Jeff?"
266510,127127525,151357,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2011",2011-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Before we move into the financial review for the quarter, I would like to remind everyone my comments will be focused on results from continuing operations. In other words, our North American onshore business.",1377,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Before we move into the financial review for the quarter, I would like to remind everyone my comments will be focused on results from continuing operations. In other words, our North American onshore business. With the close of Brazil, this will be the last quarter that contained significant activity within discontinued operations. 
For those of you interested in a more detailed review of our discontinued ops, we have provided supplemental tables in our news release. For today's call, I will limit my comments to those items that require additional commentary or are outside of our forecasted guidance range. 
The first item I will cover is our production per quarter. In the second quarter of 2011, our reported production totaled 60.1 million oil equivalent barrels or 660,000 Boe per day. These results set a quarterly production record for our North American onshore operations and represents a robust 5% growth rate over the first quarter and a greater than 6% increase over the year-ago quarter. Additionally, our production exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by roughly 10,000 barrels per day, in spite of deferring production from Cana due to a tornado damage at our plant there. 
Our outperformance was driven by strong results from our core properties. Also a gas royalty adjustment in Canada boosted reported second quarter production by about 7,000 barrels per day. 
Looking specifically at the liquids side of our business, our oil and natural gas liquids production averaged 220,000 barrels per day for the quarter, a 12% increase over the year-ago period. The most noteworthy year-over-year growth came in the U.S., led by strong growth from the Barnett, Cana and Permian basin, we increased our second quarter U.S. oil and NGL production by 22% over the second quarter of last year. Looking ahead, we expect downtime at our Cana processing facility to curtail third quarter production by roughly 10,000 Boe per day. In spite of this temporary curtailment, we still expect third quarter production to range between 655 million and 665,000 barrels per day. 
Our sequential quarter production growth for the third quarter will be matched by the tornado impact at Cana volumes and the 7,000 Boe per day royalty adjustment in Canada that we reported in the second quarter. 
For the full year, we are now raising the bottom end of our production forecast by 2 million barrels to a range of 238 million to 240 million barrels. When compared to 2010, the midpoint of our updated guidance range implies a top-line production growth rate of more than 7% from -- for our North American onshore properties. This growth will be achieved in spite of deferring approximately 2.5 million barrels of production due to severe weather, principally the damage to the Cana plant. 
Turning to hedges. In the second quarter, cash settlements from oil and gas hedges totaled $59 million. These settlements boosted our company-wide average price by about $1 per BOE in the quarter. 
Since our last conference call, we have continued to bolster our natural gas hedge position. In the second half of this year, we now have a combination of swap and color contracts covering approximately 980 million cubic feet per day at a weighted average protected price of $5.28 per MCF. 
We have also more than doubled our natural gas hedge position for next year. For the full year of 2012, we now have hedges covering 850 million cubic feet per day, with a weighted average protected price at just under $5 per MCF. However, 60% of these hedged volumes are done using colors. Therefore, we still maintain upside on these volumes should natural gas pricing improve. We will post an updated hedging schedule in our 8-K filing and on our website that provides a detailed view of our 2011 and '12 hedge positions. 
Turning now to our Midstream business, In addition to our strong upstream performance, Devon's marketing and midstream operations also delivered outstanding results. Operating profit for the second quarter came in at $148 million, well above the high end of our implied guidance range. Strong NGL prices and increased throughput drove the increase. Looking ahead, we expect the downtime at our Cana processing facility to reduce our third quarter marketing and midstream operating profit to a range of $120 million to $140 million. However, for the full year, in spite of the setback at Cana, we now expect our operating profit to come in between $515 million and $545 million. This represents an increase of $20 million from our previous guidance. 
It is worth noting as Dave mentioned that we are well-insured for both the property damage and business interruption that has occurred at our Cana facility. Our policy deductibles, our $2.5 million per property damage and a 30-day wait for business interruption. After the 30-day waiting period, our business interruption coverage pays for the loss of production, not only from the wells that were producing at the time of the storm, but also for the ramp up of volumes that would be occurring from the wells that we are drilling. Consequently, our risk management has mitigated most of the financial impact of this incident. 
Looking now at our expenses. In the second quarter, most expense items came in the bottom half of our guidance range. Our focus on controlling costs, combined with our high-graded asset base has helped to offset both industry inflation and the headwinds of the strengthening Canadian dollar. 
Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, we anticipate continued upward pressure on costs. However, we are confident that our scale and key operating regions and consistent focus on cost management will allow us to mitigate much of the impact of inflation. 
Looking at our income taxes, Devon's reported second quarter income tax from continuing operations came in at $1.2 billion. This implies an 87% tax rate on pretax income from continuing ops. The most significant item that influenced our quarterly tax rate was a $744 million charge related to the assumed repatriation of foreign earnings to the U.S.. This is essentially a non-cash charge which results from a required accounting exercise that assumes that we will repatriate a substantial portion of these funds under current U.S. tax law. However, as John mentioned earlier in the call, we have not repatriated these funds and they currently reside outside the U.S. In any case, after backing out the assumed repatriation charge and the impact of other nonrecurring items, you'd get an adjusted tax rate of 32% which is right in line with our guidance. 
Going to the bottom line, Devon's solid second quarter performance and a profitable sale of our assets in Brazil translated into record GAAP earnings of $2.7 billion. After backing up the nonrecurring items, our adjusted earnings totaled $726 million or $1.71 per diluted share. Our cash flows before balance sheet changes totaled $1.6 billion. As John mentioned earlier, this was a solid beat on both earnings per share and cash flow. 
Before we go to the Q&A, I would like to provide a quick update on our financial position. In the second quarter, Devon's cash inflows totaled $4.8 billion. After funding all capital demands for the quarter, repurchasing $584 million of common stock and paying out $72 million in dividends, our cash and short-term investments increased by over $3 billion during the quarter, reaching a total of $6.7 billion. As a result, our net debt declined to just $1.2 billion and our net debt to cap ratio declined to just 5%. 
Following the end of the quarter in the month of July, we issued $2.25 billion of senior notes through a combination of 5, 10, 30-year offerings. This allowed us to take advantage of today's attractive market conditions to fund our upcoming $1.75 billion of debt maturing in December, as well as reduce our outstanding short-term borrowings.
In summary, we are excited about Devon's future and believe that we are well-positioned to compete effectively. Our financial position provides us with significant strength. As importantly, our assets are performing very well. We remain focused on maximizing our operating margins, exercising capital discipline and optimizing growth for debt-adjusted share. At this point, I will turn the call back over to Vince for the Q&A. Vince?"

Let me begin by stating the obvious. Devon's second quarter of 2011 was an excellent one. Our North American onshore production reached an all-time record, averaging 660,000 equivalent barrels per day. That's",904,"Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by stating the obvious. Devon's second quarter of 2011 was an excellent one. Our North American onshore production reached an all-time record, averaging 660,000 equivalent barrels per day. That's a 5% increase over the first quarter, continued focus on efficiency and cost control, mitigated industry inflation and the impact of a stronger Canadian dollar. In fact, our pretax cash cost per equivalent barrel were essentially flat compared to the previous quarter and the year-ago quarter. 
With production above our guidance, higher realized commodity prices and effective cost management, our second quarter adjusted earnings climbed 10% over the prior year quarter to $1.71 per diluted share and that exceeded the first call mean by $0.17. 
Cash flow before balance sheet changes reached $1.6 billion or $3.81 per diluted share surpassing the street mean estimate by $0.48. 
Net earnings including the gain on the sale of Brazil totaled a whopping $2.7 billion for the second quarter or $6.48 per diluted share. And during the second quarter, we repurchased 7.1 million shares for $584 million. To date, we have spent $2.6 billion of the $3.5 billion current authorization to repurchase 35.1 million shares. This represents almost 8% of our outstanding shares and those shares were acquired at an average price of roughly $74 per share. We remain on track to complete that repurchase program by the end of the year.
In May, we closed our $3.2 billion sale of our Brazilian assets which essentially completes the strategic repositioning of Devon to a company focused entirely onshore in North America. Our total pretax divestiture proceeds exceeded $10 billion, with after-tax proceeds estimated to $8 billion. Currently, we have more than $6.5 billion of cash and short-term investments outside the U.S. that we have not repatriated. However, it's important to note that our after-tax estimate of proceeds assumes full payment of the taxes triggered by repatriation of most of those funds under current U.S. tax law. If a more favorable tax situation develops for the repatriation of these funds, or if we redeploy the proceeds in Canada, we will have up to $900 million of upside. Until we have better visibility into potential repatriation tax legislation and determine the optimal long-term capital allocation between the U.S. and Canada, our divestiture proceeds will remain outside the U.S. 
Devon has emerged from the repositioning in a truly enviable position. We have a deep inventory of low-risk drilling locations, including years of high margin oil and liquids-rich development in our cornerstone project areas. This include the Barnett, the Cana, and our steam-assisted gravity drainage project in Canada. We are drilling our most economic wells ever in the liquid-rich portions of the Barnett. Our first mover position has provided us with the largest and best acreage position. Furthermore, our low entry and royalty cost enhanced the economic returns across our inventory of thousands of undrilled Barnett locations. In the liquids-rich Cana, we're taking advantage of opportunities to increase our working interest and are continuing to delineate our condensate-rich acreage to the northwest. We could continue for years, at our current pace of development, without any additional inventory. However, in order to bring forward the value embedded in our existing acreage positions, we're pursuing a wide range of exploration opportunities across North America. 
In the Permian and Western Canadian sedimentary basins, for example, we're accelerating oil and liquids-rich exploration drilling. Given the recent advances in drilling and completions technology and the stacked pay nature of these basins, we're pursuing more than 20 oil and liquids-rich plays that have emerged in these 2 basins alone. 
Our inventory represents more than 3 billion oil equivalent barrels of net unrisked resource across our more than 5 million net perspective acres. These substantial positions provide Devon with thousands of potential locations, representing many years of additional growth. 
We're also moving forward with the testing of our new venture plays. These include the Tuscaloosa, the Niobrara, the Mississippi Lime in Oklahoma, the Ohio Utica, and the A1 Carbonate and Utica in Michigan. 
We've been successful with our strategy of acquiring sizable positions in these oil and liquids-rich plays, where, for the most part, competition had not yet driven up prices. Instead of leasing large blocks of trend acreage and then figuring out where the play works best, we've taken a more targeted approach. Similar to our approach in the Cana play, we've attempted to identify the best parts of the plays and specifically focused our acreage acquisitions in those areas. 
Utilizing this approach, we've secured 1.1 million net acres at a very reasonable cost in what we believe to be highly economic parts of these 5 plays. While each of these plays has risk, it's likely that several will turn out to be highly economic large scale development plays. The second half of this year is shaping up to be an exciting time for Devon, with the initial drilling results anticipated from a wide range of exploration opportunities. 
In summary, the repositioned company has all the attributes necessary to deliver highly competitive per share growth. We're generating excellent, full cycle returns. We have superior financial strength and we have a deep inventory of economic, low-risk development projects and promising exploration projects in emerging plays and new ventures. 
So with that overview, I will turn the call over to Dave Hager for a review of our quarterly operating highlights. Dave?"
266510,127127525,151536,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2011",2011-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone.

Our key development plays, including the Barnett, the Cana and Jackfish are all performing very well. We also remain very active in evaluating and de-risking the upside potential in our various emerging and new venture plays. With more than 90% of our 2011 E&P capital allocated towards oil and liquids-rich projects and with the solid results we have seen so far this year, we are well on our way to deliver liquids growth in the high teens in 2011. 
So let's take a look at some of the highlights for the quarter. Starting with our oil -- our thermal oil projects in Eastern Alberta, Jackfish continues to deliver industry-leading performance. During the second quarter, Jackfish 1 production averaged 31,000 barrels per day net of royalties. At Jackfish 2, we began injecting steam in the second quarter. All 4 pads are currently in the circulation phase of the process. As some of you may have recall from our recent SAGD school, this is the initial stage where steam is injected into both the injector and producer wells to begin warming the reservoir. Later this month, 3 of the pads will move into the partial SAGD phase and production will continue to ramp up. We exited the second quarter producing about 1,000 barrels per day net of royalties at Jackfish 2. 
At Pike, with data from nearly 400 wells and some 60 square miles of seismic, our SAGD team has begun engineering work on a 105,000-barrel per day facility for Pike 1. This would be essentially 3 Jackfish-sized facilities from a single plant site. You might recall we completed the resource of valuation for 2 of the 3 projects with last winter's stratigraphic drilling. 
Planning efforts are already underway for our 2011, 2012 winter drilling and seismic programs and we'll focus on defining the third 35,000-barrel per day project in the Pike 1 complex. Ultimately, we believe that Pike can support 4 or 5 Jackfish-sized projects. And when combined with Jackfish, we expect to grow Devon's net thermal oil production to between 150,000 and 175,000 barrels per day by 2020. 
Moving now to the Permian basin, we currently have 19 operated rigs pursuing targets in numerous play types across our roughly 1 million net acre position. Our second quarter production from the Permian increased 17% over the second quarter of 2010 to 49,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Oil and natural gas liquids accounted for 75% of the quarter's production. 
In the Permian in our Wolfberry light oil play, we currently have 5 operated rigs running, as we continue the evaluation and development of our 160,000 net acres. Through the second quarter, we had drilled approximately 50 of our planned 135 well program for this year. We recently initiated a 4-well 20-acre infill pilot program and we'll be testing the application of horizontal drilling in certain areas as well. We have significant running room in this high return light oil play, with more than 850 net risked locations remaining. 
On our roughly 200,000 net acres in the Bone Springs oil play, we currently have 5 operated rigs running. We continue to have great results from our horizontal programs, on both the New Mexico and Texas sides of the play. In the second quarter, we completed 8 wells in the second Bone Springs interval in New Mexico, with 30-day average IP rates of 665 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This included one exceptionally strong well, the Diamond [ph]  1H that was brought online with an average 30-day IP rate of more than 1,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Our Bone Springs well cost in New Mexico are running about $5 million per well, with EURs averaging 400,000 barrels equivalent. On the Texas side ,i,n the Bone Springs play, we completed our third well targeting the  third Bone Springs interval. The 100% Devon-owned Talladega 65 2H was brought online recently. After 15 days of production, this well has averaged 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Although our Texas Bone Springs production history is limited to just a few wells, we are encouraged with the shallow declines we have seen to this point. With average EURs exceeding 600,000 barrels equivalent, and with well cost running about $7 million, these wells offer outstanding returns. We've planned out a third rig in the Texas side of the play later this year, bringing our total number of rigs working in the Bone Springs up to 6. 
Also in the Permian, the Delaware is another conventional oil information that we are targeting with horizontal drilling. We completed 3 wells in the second quarter, including the Laguna Salada 6H that came online with a 30-day IP rate of more than 800 oil equivalent barrels per day. We now have 3 operated rigs drilling Delaware horizontal wells. 
Elsewhere in the Permian basin, we are targeting 2 operated rigs in the Avalon Shale play. Our activity is now focused on our 65,000 net acres in the eastern portion of the play where condensate yields are higher. We currently have 3 wells in various stages of drilling or completion and should have those results for you next quarter. 
And finally, in the Permian basin, we have assembled approximately 65,000 net acres in the southern end of the Midland Basin and the Wolfcamp Shale oil play. We are currently running 2 operated rigs with our first 3 wells in the play in various stages of drilling or completion. We hope to have results for you next quarter. This is a hot play in the industry, and with the positive indications we've seen to date, we now plan to drill 8 Wolfcamp Shale exploration wells in 2011. 
In addition to the Midland Basin acreage, we have about 200,000 net acres in the Delaware Basin that is perspective for the Wolfcamp Shale. We're currently drilling our first [indiscernible] to test this formation's potential in the Delaware Basin. 
Moving north to the Texas panhandle and the Granite Wash play, we continue to see solid results from our Cherokee and Granite Wash 8 [ph] wells. We are running 5 operated rigs here and brought 8 operated Granite Wash wells online during the second quarter. the 30-day IPs rates from these wells averaged over 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Including 200 barrels of oil and 730 barrels of natural gas liquids per day. 
Moving now to the Cana Woodford Shale in Western Oklahoma. As everyone is well aware by now, our Cana gas processing plant was damaged by a tornado on May 24. It's worth noting that we have both property and business interruption insurance that Jeff will cover in more detail later. Work is underway to repair the damage and we expect the plant to be fully repaired and operational during the fourth quarter. We are confident of our year-end exit rate target for Cana of 275 million cubic feet equivalent per day, net to Devon's interest. In spite of the planned interruption, our second quarter net Cana production averaged 17% over the first quarter to a record 189 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including nearly 9,000 barrels per day of liquids. 
To keep pace with our Cana Woodford growth and capture additional value from the liquids-rich portions in the field, we plan to begin the first expansion to our Cana gas processing plant later this year. The facility's initial processing capacity of 200 million cubic feet per day will be expanded to 350 million a day and will be capable of extracting up to 27,000 barrels of NGLs per day. The $125 million expansion is expected to be operational in the fourth quarter of 2012.
Shifting to the Barnett Shale field in North Texas. This field continues to be a significant and highly economic resource for us. Our 2011 program has yielded the best wells we have ever drilled in the Barnett. We have seen average EURs increase to 3.2 Bcf equivalent per day. We ran 13 operated rigs in the Barnett for most of the second quarter. Subsequent to June 30, we dropped one rig, bringing our operated rig count back to 12, where we expect to keep it for the remainder of the year. In the second quarter, we brought 114 Barnett wells online, with average 30-day IP rates of approximately 3.4 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including an average 125 barrels of liquids per day. 
In the second quarter, our net production reached a record 1.28 Bcf equivalent per day, that is 1,280,000,000 cubic feet equivalent per day including 46,000 barrels of per day liquids. This represents a 5% sequential quarter increase and a 13% increase over the second quarter of last year. 
With the high liquids yield we are seeing from our Barnett drilling combined with our outlook for gas and NGL product spreads, we recently made the decision to expand our Bridgeport gas processing plant for the seventh time. The 140-million-a-day expansion will provide an additional 11,000 barrels per day of NGL production capacity. The  $160 million expansion is expected to be operational in the first quarter of 2013. Upon completion, the Bridgeport facility will have an inlet capacity of 790 million cubic feet per day, with an NGL production capacity of 65,000 barrels per day, making it one of the largest gas processing facilities in the lower 48. 
On the exploration front, as John indicated, we are continuing to actively evaluate the oil and liquids potential on acreage within our portfolios that spans numerous play types across multiple basins in the U.S. and Canada. This includes several new ventures areas in the U.S. where we have assembled 1.1 million net acres. And in Niobrara, we have approximately 200,000 net acres in the Powder River Basin and 100,000 net acres in northern part of the DJ Basin. This is a very active industry play right now, with about 30 rigs working. Many of the industry wells drilled to date were drilled without the benefit of 3D data, making it difficult to target, identify and land in the appropriate zones. Our initial focus in the DJ Basin will be to utilize 3D to improve upon the lack of consistency demonstrated to date in this play by the industry. 
We are currently drilling our first wells in both basins. We plan to drill or participate in 6 Niobrara wells in the Powder and 4 in the DJ basin in 2011. 
In the Mississippi and oil play located in North Central Oklahoma, we have secured over 200,000 net acres. This is a play originally established by vertical production years ago, but is now being pursued with horizontal drilling. We drilled our first vertical well to gather data in the second quarter, and we're currently drilling our first horizontal well. In total, we plan to drill or participate in 12 to 15 wells in 2011. 
There has been a lot of discussion lately of the Ohio Utica Shale. And as most of you know, Devon was an early mover. We've established 110,000 net acres in what we believe within the heart of the oil window. The primary risk to a shale play is of course the ability to move fluid through a very tight reservoir. However, we have now analyzed the core from our first Utica well and are highly encouraged by the positive permeability indications seen in our first well. Based on these early results, we believe the oil window could offer some of the best economics in the play. We plan to drill 3 additional Ohio Utica wells this year. 
Just to the north is our 300,000-acre position in the Michigan Basin is prospective for both the Utica Shale, as well as the A1 Carbonate. As you may know, this has historically been a prolific basin. We are particularly excited about the potential of the A1 Carbonate which was the source rock for the Niagaran Reef play in Michigan. We drilled our first 2 vertical core wells and are currently evaluating the data. 
And finally, in the Tuscaloosa Shale play located along the Louisiana and Mississippi border, we recently completed drilling, coring and logging operations on our first well, the Lane 64-1. This is a vertical well that we drilled to obtain data. The rig has now moved up depth to the Beech Grove 68 1H (sic) [ 68H-1 ] where we plan to gather additional core and log data before drilling the lateral and completing it as our first horizontal in the Tuscaloosa. 
Another exploration play that has recently caught the Street's attention is the Smackover Brown Dense oil play located in North Louisiana. We have about 40,000 net acres perspective in the play and expect to spot our first horizontal well in this play next month. 
As I mentioned, we also have a significant exploration effort underway in Canada, targeting the deep basin where we have Cardium and lower Cretaceous drilling programs underway, as well as Cardium program in the Ferrier Area of our Central Alberta and our Viking program in Saskatchewan. 
Although wet weather has delayed a portion of our Canadian exploration program, we still expect to complete our 2011 program. However, at our Viking light oil play in Saskatchewan, we did complete 2 wells in the second quarter, one of which IP'd at 90 barrels of oil per day. We expect this play to be economic, with well cost in the $1 million to $1.2 million per well range, IPs of approximately 40 barrels per day and EURs of 50,000 barrels. While these results are encouraging, we're still in the early stages of evaluating the potential on our 900,000 net acre position. If successful, we could have more than 1,000 Viking drilling locations. 
In summary, all of our key development projects are delivering excellent results, supporting our production growth targets. Growth is being driven by liquids growth in the high teens. In addition, we are entering a very exciting time on the exploration front as we get our first wells down in a variety of different plays. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff Agosta for the financial review and outlook. Jeff?"
266510,127127525,151536,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2011",2011-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Before we move into the financial review for the quarter, I would like to remind everyone my comments will be focused on results from continuing operations. In other words, our North American onshore business.",1372,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Before we move into the financial review for the quarter, I would like to remind everyone my comments will be focused on results from continuing operations. In other words, our North American onshore business. With the close of Brazil, this will be the last quarter that contains significant activity within discontinued operations. 
For those of you interested in a more detailed review of our discontinued ops, we have provided supplemental tables in our news release. For today's call, I will limit my comments to those items that require additional commentary or are outside of our forecasted guidance range. 
The first item I will cover is our production per quarter. In the second quarter of 2011, our reported production totaled 60.1 million oil equivalent barrels or 660,000 Boe per day. These results set a quarterly production record for our North American onshore operations and represents a robust 5% growth rate over the first quarter and a greater than 6% increase over the year-ago quarter. Additionally, our production exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by roughly 10,000 barrels per day, in spite of deferring production from Cana due to a tornado damage at our plant there. 
Our outperformance was driven by strong results from our core properties. Also a gas royalty adjustment in Canada boosted reported second quarter production by about 7,000 barrels per day. 
Looking specifically at the liquids side of our business, our oil and natural gas liquids production averaged 220,000 barrels per day for the quarter, a 12% increase over the year-ago period. The most noteworthy year-over-year growth came in the U.S., led by strong growth from the Barnett, Cana and Permian basin, we increased our second quarter U.S. oil and NGL production by 22% over the second quarter of last year. Looking ahead, we expect downtime at our Cana processing facility to curtail third quarter production by roughly 10,000 Boe per day. In spite of this temporary curtailment, we still expect third quarter production to range between 655,000 and 665,000 barrels per day. 
Our sequential quarter production growth for the third quarter will be masked by the tornado impacted Cana volumes and the 7,000 Boe per day royalty adjustment in Canada that we reported in the second quarter. 
For the full year, we are now raising the bottom end of our production forecast by 2 million barrels to a range of 238 million to 240 million barrels. When compared to 2010, the midpoint of our updated guidance range implies a top-line production growth rate of more than 7% for our North American onshore properties. This growth will be achieved in spite of deferring approximately 2.5 million barrels of production due to severe weather, principally the damage to the Cana plant. 
Turning to hedges. In the second quarter, cash settlements from oil and gas hedges totaled $59 million. These settlements boosted our company-wide average price by about $1 per Boe in the quarter. 
Since our last conference call, we have continued to bolster our natural gas hedge position. In the second half of this year, we now have a combination of swap and collar contracts covering approximately 980 million cubic feet per day at a weighted average protected price of $5.28 per Mcf. 
We have also more than doubled our natural gas hedge position for next year. For the full year of 2012, we now have hedges covering 850 million cubic feet per day, with a weighted average protected price just under $5 per Mcf. However, 60% of these hedged volumes are done using collars. Therefore, we still maintain upside on these volumes should natural gas pricing improve. We will post an updated hedging schedule in our 8-K filing and on our website that provides a detailed view of our 2011 and '12 hedge positions. 
Turning now to our Midstream business, In addition to our strong upstream performance, Devon's marketing and midstream operations also delivered outstanding results. Operating profit for the second quarter came in at $148 million, well above the high end of our implied guidance range. Strong NGL prices and increased throughput drove the increase. Looking ahead, we expect the downtime at our Cana processing facility to reduce our third quarter marketing and midstream operating profit to a range of $120 million to $140 million. However, for the full year, in spite of the setback at Cana, we now expect our operating profit to come in between $515 million and $545 million. This represents an increase of $20 million from our previous guidance. 
It is worth noting, as Dave mentioned, that we are well-insured for both the property damage and business interruption that has occurred at our Cana facility. Our policy deductibles, our $2.5 million per property damage and a 30-day wait for business interruption. After the 30-day waiting period, our business interruption coverage pays for the loss of production, not only from the wells that we're producing at the time of the storm, but also for the ramp up of volumes that would be occurring from the wells that we are drilling. Consequently, our risk management has mitigated most of the financial impact of this incident. 
Looking now at our expenses. In the second quarter, most expense items came in the bottom half of our guidance range. Our focus on controlling costs, combined with our high-graded asset base has helped offset both industry inflation and the headwinds of the strengthening Canadian dollar. 
Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, we anticipate continued upward pressure on costs. However, we are confident that our scale and key operating regions and consistent focus on cost management will allow us to mitigate much of the impact of inflation. 
Looking at our income taxes, Devon's reported second quarter income tax from continuing operations came in at $1.2 billion. This implies an 87% tax rate on pretax income from continuing ops. The most significant item that influenced our quarterly tax rate was a $744 million charge related to the assumed repatriation of foreign earnings to the U.S.. This is essentially a non-cash charge which results from a required accounting exercise that assumes that we will repatriate a substantial portion of these funds under current U.S. tax law. However, as John mentioned earlier in the call, we have not repatriated these funds and they currently reside outside the U.S. In any case, after backing out the assumed repatriation charge and the impact of other nonrecurring items, you'd get an adjusted tax rate of 32% which is right in line with our guidance. 
Going to the bottom line, Devon's solid second quarter performance and the profitable sale of our assets in Brazil translated into record GAAP earnings of $2.7 billion. After backing up the nonrecurring items, our adjusted earnings totaled $726 million or $1.71 per diluted share. Our cash flows before balance sheet changes totaled $1.6 billion. As John mentioned earlier, this was a solid beat on both earnings per share and cash flow. 
Before we go to the Q&A, I would like to provide a quick update on our financial position. In the second quarter, Devon's cash inflows totaled $4.8 billion. After funding all capital demands for the quarter, repurchasing $584 million of common stock and paying out $72 million in dividends, our cash and short-term investments increased by over $3 billion during the quarter, reaching a total of $6.7 billion. As a result, our net debt declined to just $1.2 billion and our net debt to cap ratio declined to just 5%. 
Following the end of the quarter in the month of July, we issued $2.25 billion of senior notes through a combination of 5-, 10- and 30-year offerings. This allowed us to take advantage of today's attractive market conditions to fund our upcoming $1.75 billion of debt maturing in September, as well as reduce our outstanding short-term borrowings.
In summary, we are excited about Devon's future and believe that we are well-positioned to compete effectively. Our financial position provides us with significant strength. As importantly, our assets are performing very well. We remain focused on maximizing our operating margins, exercising capital discipline and optimizing growth for debt-adjusted share. At this point, I will turn the call back over to Vince for the Q&A. Vince?"

It's not overpressured. So, obviously, you need to be a little bit higher perm in order to move the oil through, but I think we understand that and we know where the permeability is and we're encouraged. And the ultimate test obviously is to drill some horizontal wells out there and we don't have any horizontal wells, but we think we have a pretty good understanding from our vast numbers of horizontal wells we drilled throughout the North America that we understand the relationship pretty well and we're optimistic."

We'll have to see -- if we do have continued success, we might move the rig count up a little bit or limit it a little bit by the infrastructure availability out there and just as we need to mature the play.

And frankly we're excited about the fact that we have 4 million acres in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin and we have done very little exploitation of those for liquids-rich and oil-type opportunities. So we see a very large number of opportunities that could emerge from there. The 3 that we've been traditionally highlighting so far this year are the Viking light oil potential that I mentioned, where we're going to have 1,000 to 2,000 locations across our acreage, 9,000 acres in Saskatchewan. The Cardium light oil play that -- where we have drilled a some wells in the Ferrier Area. But more importantly up in the Deep Basin, we think we have at least 80,000 prospective acres for the Cardium. And then also in the Deep Basin, we're going to be start drilling this fall what we call our Vertizontal Program where we are going to be taking wells that would go actually horizontal in the deepest zone, which will be the Cardomin [ph] and then also complete simultaneously in some of the vertical zones in some of the stacked pay areas. But in addition to that, we're drilling a number of different wells and a number of different play types up there that, with success, all of which could amount -- could be significant and I've got a whole list here of ones we could go through, but it's not worth going through all the details on all of them, but there's just a large number of opportunities, but we're just at the front end of evaluating all these."

After that, we want to be very thoughtful and dispassionate frankly in our views as to whether we're better off allocating funds to share buybacks or capital programs, where we want to allocate it to those areas that are going to create the best returns and the best debt to adjusted share returns for our shareholders. Now as we get further through the year and we haven't obviously finalized or even come close to our 2012 capital budget, there are a lot of moving parts. And our view as to whether we ought to be buying our stock back rather than investing in our E&P programs is dependent on our stock price, on our view of commodity prices for the future, on our view of costs in the future and how that influences our per debt adjusted share metrics. So we'll have to -- we'll have to see how we -- what we do in 2012. And 2011, we're really happy to be able to do a lot of each. And as Vince has mentioned before, we sold roughly 8% to 10% of the company for 23% of the enterprise value and significantly shrunk our balance sheet and that's creating some very good returns and good per-share accretion for our shareholders.

Let me begin by stating the obvious. Devon's second quarter of 2011 was an excellent one. Our North American onshore production reached an all-time record, averaging 660,000 equivalent barrels per day. That's",904,"Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by stating the obvious. Devon's second quarter of 2011 was an excellent one. Our North American onshore production reached an all-time record, averaging 660,000 equivalent barrels per day. That's a 5% increase over the first quarter, continued focus on efficiency and cost control, mitigated industry inflation and the impact of a stronger Canadian dollar. In fact, our pretax cash costs per equivalent barrel were essentially flat compared to the previous quarter and the year-ago quarter. 
With production above our guidance, higher realized commodity prices and effective cost management, our second quarter adjusted earnings climbed 10% over the prior year quarter to $1.71 per diluted share and that exceeded the first call mean by $0.17. 
Cash flow before balance sheet changes reached $1.6 billion or $3.81 per diluted share surpassing the street mean estimate by $0.48. 
Net earnings including the gain on the sale of Brazil totaled a whopping $2.7 billion for the second quarter or $6.48 per diluted share. And during the second quarter, we repurchased 7.1 million shares for $584 million. To date, we have spent $2.6 billion of the $3.5 billion current authorization to repurchase 35.1 million shares. This represents almost 8% of our outstanding shares and those shares were acquired at an average price of roughly $74 per share. We remain on track to complete that repurchase program by the end of the year.
In May, we closed our $3.2 billion sale of our Brazilian assets which essentially completes the strategic repositioning of Devon to a company focused entirely onshore in North America. Our total pretax divestiture proceeds exceeded $10 billion, with after-tax proceeds estimated to $8 billion. Currently, we have more than $6.5 billion of cash and short-term investments outside the U.S. that we have not repatriated. However, it's important to note that our after-tax estimate of proceeds assumes full payment of the taxes triggered by repatriation of most of those funds under current U.S. tax law. If a more favorable tax situation develops for the repatriation of these funds, or if we redeploy the proceeds in Canada, we will have up to $900 million of upside. Until we have better visibility into potential repatriation tax legislation and determine the optimal long-term capital allocation between the U.S. and Canada, our divestiture proceeds will remain outside the U.S. 
Devon has emerged from the repositioning in a truly enviable position. We have a deep inventory of low-risk drilling locations, including years of high margin oil and liquids-rich development in our cornerstone project areas. These include the Barnett, the Cana, and our steam-assisted gravity drainage projects in Canada. We are drilling our most economic wells ever in the liquid-rich portions of the Barnett. Our first mover position has provided us with the largest and best acreage position. Furthermore, our low entry and royalty cost enhanced the economic returns across our inventory of thousands of undrilled Barnett locations. In the liquids-rich Cana, we're taking advantage of opportunities to increase our working interest and are continuing to delineate our condensate-rich acreage to the northwest. We could continue for years at our current pace of development without any additional inventory. However, in order to bring forward the value embedded in our existing acreage positions, we're pursuing a wide range of exploration opportunities across North America. 
In the Permian and Western Canadian sedimentary basins, for example, we're accelerating oil and liquids-rich exploration drilling. Given the recent advances in drilling and completions technology and the stacked pay nature of these basins, we're pursuing more than 20 oil and liquids-rich plays that have emerged in these 2 basins alone. 
Our inventory represents more than 3 billion oil equivalent barrels of net unrisked resource across our more than 5 million net perspective acres. These substantial positions provide Devon with thousands of potential locations, representing many years of additional growth. 
We're also moving forward with the testing of our new venture plays. These include the Tuscaloosa, the Niobrara, the Mississippi Lime in Oklahoma, the Ohio Utica, and the A1 Carbonate and Utica in Michigan. 
We've been successful with our strategy of acquiring sizable positions in these oil and liquids-rich plays, where, for the most part, competition had not yet driven up prices. Instead of leasing large blocks of trend acreage and then figuring out where the play works best, we've taken a more targeted approach. Similar to our approach in the Cana play, we've attempted to identify the best parts of the plays and specifically focused our acreage acquisitions in those areas. 
Utilizing this approach, we've secured 1.1 million net acres at a very reasonable costs in what we believe to be highly economic parts of these 5 plays. While each of these plays has risk, it's likely that several will turn out to be highly economic large scale development plays. The second half of this year is shaping up to be an exciting time for Devon, with the initial drilling results anticipated from a wide range of exploration opportunities. 
In summary, the repositioned company has all the attributes necessary to deliver highly competitive per share growth. We're generating excellent, full cycle returns. We have superior financial strength and we have a deep inventory of economic, low-risk development projects and promising exploration projects in emerging plays and new ventures. 
So with that overview, I will turn the call over to Dave Hager for a review of our quarterly operating highlights. Dave?"
266510,127127525,151763,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2011",2011-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. We continue to see outstanding results from our 2011 E&P capital program. Our key development plays, including the Barnett, the Cana and Jackfish are all performing very well.

Our key development plays, including the Barnett, the Cana and Jackfish are all performing very well. We also remain very active in evaluating and de-risking the upside potential in our various emerging and new venture plays. With more than 90% of our 2011 E&P capital allocated towards oil and liquids-rich projects and with the solid results we have seen so far this year, we are well on our way to deliver liquids growth in the high teens in 2011. 
So let's take a look at some of the highlights for the quarter. Starting with our oil -- our thermal oil projects in Eastern Alberta, Jackfish continues to deliver industry-leading performance. During the second quarter, Jackfish 1 production averaged 31,000 barrels per day net of royalties. At Jackfish 2, we began injecting steam in the second quarter. All 4 pads are currently in the circulation phase of the process. As some of you may have recall from our recent SAGD school, this is the initial stage where steam is injected into both the injector and producer wells to begin warming the reservoir. Later this month, 3 of the pads will move into the partial SAGD phase and production will continue to ramp up. We exited the second quarter producing about 1,000 barrels per day net of royalties at Jackfish 2. 
At Pike, with data from nearly 400 wells and some 60 square miles of seismic, our SAGD team has begun engineering work on a 105,000-barrel per day facility for Pike 1. This would be essentially 3 Jackfish-sized facilities from a single plant site. You might recall we completed the resource evaluation for 2 of the 3 projects with last winter's stratigraphic drilling. 
Planning efforts are already underway for our 2011, 2012 winter drilling and seismic programs and we'll focus on defining the third 35,000-barrel per day project in the Pike 1 complex. Ultimately, we believe that Pike can support 4 or 5 Jackfish-sized projects. And when combined with Jackfish, we expect to grow Devon's net thermal oil production to between 150,000 and 175,000 barrels per day by 2020. 
Moving now to the Permian basin, we currently have 19 operated rigs pursuing targets in numerous play types across our roughly 1 million net acre position. Our second quarter production from the Permian increased 17% over the second quarter of 2010 to 49,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Oil and natural gas liquids accounted for 75% of the quarter's production. 
In the Permian in our Wolfberry light oil play, we currently have 5 operated rigs running, as we continue the evaluation and development of our 160,000 net acres. Through the second quarter, we had drilled approximately 50 of our planned 135 well program for this year. We recently initiated a 4-well 20-acre infill pilot program and we'll be testing the application of horizontal drilling in certain areas as well. We have significant running room in this high return light oil play, with more than 850 net risked locations remaining. 
On our roughly 200,000 net acres in the Bone Springs oil play, we currently have 5 operated rigs running. We continue to have great results from our horizontal programs, on both the New Mexico and Texas sides of the play. In the second quarter, we completed 8 wells in the second Bone Springs interval in New Mexico, with 30-day average IP rates of 665 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This included one exceptionally strong well, the Diamond [ph]  1H that was brought online with an average 30-day IP rate of more than 1,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Our Bone Springs well cost in New Mexico are running about $5 million per well, with EURs averaging 400,000 barrels equivalent. On the Texas side in the Bone Springs play, we completed our third well targeting the  third Bone Springs interval. The 100% Devon-owned Talladega 65 2H was brought online recently. After 15 days of production, this well has averaged 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Although our Texas Bone Springs production history is limited to just a few wells, we are encouraged with the shallow declines we have seen to this point. With average EURs exceeding 600,000 barrels equivalent, and with well cost running about $7 million, these wells offer outstanding returns. We've planned out a third rig in the Texas side of the play later this year, bringing our total number of rigs working in the Bone Springs up to 6. 
Also in the Permian, the Delaware is another conventional oil information that we are targeting with horizontal drilling. We completed 3 wells in the second quarter, including the Laguna Salada 6H that came online with a 30-day IP rate of more than 800 oil equivalent barrels per day. We now have 3 operated rigs drilling Delaware horizontal wells. 
Elsewhere in the Permian basin, we are targeting 2 operated rigs in the Avalon Shale play. Our activity is now focused on our 65,000 net acres in the eastern portion of the play where condensate yields are higher. We currently have 3 wells in various stages of drilling or completion and should have those results for you next quarter. 
And finally, in the Permian basin, we have assembled approximately 65,000 net acres in the southern end of the Midland Basin and the Wolfcamp Shale oil play. We are currently running 2 operated rigs with our first 3 wells in the play in various stages of drilling or completion. We hope to have results for you next quarter. This is a hot play in the industry, and with the positive indications we've seen to date, we now plan to drill 8 Wolfcamp Shale exploration wells in 2011. 
In addition to the Midland Basin acreage, we have about 200,000 net acres in the Delaware Basin that is perspective for the Wolfcamp Shale. We're currently drilling our first well to test this formation's potential in the Delaware Basin. 
Moving north to the Texas panhandle and the Granite Wash play, we continue to see solid results from our Cherokee and Granite Wash 8 [ph] wells. We are running 5 operated rigs here and brought 8 operated Granite Wash wells online during the second quarter. the 30-day IP rates from these wells averaged over 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Including 200 barrels of oil and 730 barrels of natural gas liquids per day. 
Moving now to the Cana Woodford Shale in Western Oklahoma. As everyone is well aware by now, our Cana gas processing plant was damaged by a tornado on May 24. It's worth noting that we have both property and business interruption insurance that Jeff will cover in more detail later. Work is underway to repair the damage and we expect the plant to be fully repaired and operational during the fourth quarter. We are confident of our year-end exit rate target for Cana of 275 million cubic feet equivalent per day, net to Devon's interest. In spite of the planned interruption, our second quarter net Cana production averaged 17% over the first quarter to a record 189 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including nearly 9,000 barrels per day of liquids. 
To keep pace with our Cana Woodford growth and capture additional value from the liquids-rich portions in the field, we plan to begin the first expansion to our Cana gas processing plant later this year. The facility's initial processing capacity of 200 million cubic feet per day will be expanded to 350 million a day and will be capable of extracting up to 27,000 barrels of NGLs per day. The $125 million expansion is expected to be operational in the fourth quarter of 2012.
Shifting to the Barnett Shale field in North Texas. This field continues to be a significant and highly economic resource for us. Our 2011 program has yielded the best wells we have ever drilled in the Barnett. We have seen average EURs increase to 3.2 Bcf equivalent per day. We ran 13 operated rigs in the Barnett for most of the second quarter. Subsequent to June 30, we dropped one rig, bringing our operated rig count back to 12, where we expect to keep it for the remainder of the year. In the second quarter, we brought 114 Barnett wells online, with average 30-day IP rates of approximately 3.4 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including an average 125 barrels of liquids per day. 
In the second quarter, our net production reached a record 1.28 Bcf equivalent per day, that is 1,280,000,000 cubic feet equivalent per day including 46,000 barrels of per day liquids. This represents a 5% sequential quarter increase and a 13% increase over the second quarter of last year. 
With the high liquids yield we are seeing from our Barnett drilling combined with our outlook for gas and NGL product spreads, we recently made the decision to expand our Bridgeport gas processing plant for the seventh time. The 140-million-a-day expansion will provide an additional 11,000 barrels per day of NGL production capacity. The  $160 million expansion is expected to be operational in the first quarter of 2013. Upon completion, the Bridgeport facility will have an inlet capacity of 790 million cubic feet per day, with an NGL production capacity of 65,000 barrels per day, making it one of the largest gas processing facilities in the lower 48. 
On the exploration front, as John indicated, we are continuing to actively evaluate the oil and liquids potential on acreage within our portfolio that spans numerous play types across multiple basins in the U.S. and Canada. This includes several new ventures areas in the U.S. where we have assembled 1.1 million net acres. And in Niobrara, we have approximately 200,000 net acres in the Powder River Basin and 100,000 net acres in northern part of the DJ Basin. This is a very active industry play right now, with about 30 rigs working. Many of the industry wells drilled to date were drilled without the benefit of 3D data, making it difficult to target, identify and land in the appropriate zones. Our initial focus in the DJ Basin will be to utilize 3D to improve upon the lack of consistency demonstrated to date in this play by the industry. 
We are currently drilling our first wells in both basins. We plan to drill or participate in 6 Niobrara wells in the Powder and 4 in the DJ basin in 2011. 
In the Mississippi and oil play located in North Central Oklahoma, we have secured over 200,000 net acres. This is a play originally established by vertical production years ago, but is now being pursued with horizontal drilling. We drilled our first vertical well to gather data in the second quarter, and we're currently drilling our first horizontal well. In total, we plan to drill or participate in 12 to 15 wells in 2011. 
There has been a lot of discussion lately of the Ohio Utica Shale. And as most of you know, Devon was an early mover. We've established 110,000 net acres in what we believe in the heart of the oil window. The primary risk to a shale play is of course the ability to move fluid through a very tight reservoir. However, we have now analyzed the core from our first Utica well and are highly encouraged by the positive permeability indications seen in our first well. Based on these early results, we believe the oil window could offer some of the best economics in the play. We plan to drill 3 additional Ohio Utica wells this year. 
Just to the north is our 300,000 net acre position in the Michigan Basin is prospective for both the Utica Shale, as well as the A1 Carbonate. As you may know, this has historically been a prolific basin. We are particularly excited about the potential of the A1 Carbonate which was the source rock for the Niagaran Reef play in Michigan. We drilled our first 2 vertical core wells and are currently evaluating the data. 
And finally, in the Tuscaloosa Shale play located along the Louisiana and Mississippi border, we recently completed drilling, coring and logging operations on our first well, the Lane 64-1. This is a vertical well that we drilled to obtain data. The rig has now moved up depth to the Beech Grove 68 1H (sic) [ 68H-1 ] where we plan to gather additional core and log data before drilling the lateral and completing it as our first horizontal in the Tuscaloosa. 
Another exploration play that has recently caught the Street's attention is the Smackover Brown Dense oil play located in North Louisiana. We have about 40,000 net acres perspective in the play and expect to spot our first horizontal well in this play next month. 
As I mentioned, we also have a significant exploration effort underway in Canada, targeting the deep basin where we have Cardium and lower Cretaceous drilling programs underway, as well as Cardium program in the Ferrier Area of our Central Alberta and our Viking program in Saskatchewan. 
Although wet weather has delayed a portion of our Canadian exploration program, we still expect to complete our 2011 program. However, at our Viking light oil play in Saskatchewan, we did complete 2 wells in the second quarter, one of which IP'd at 90 barrels of oil per day. We expect this play to be economic, with well costs in the $1 million to $1.2 million per well range, IPs of approximately 40 barrels per day and EURs of 50,000 barrels. While these results are encouraging, we're still in the early stages of evaluating the potential on our 900,000 net acre position. If successful, we could have more than 1,000 Viking drilling locations. 
In summary, all of our key development projects are delivering excellent results, supporting our production growth targets. Growth is being driven by liquids growth in the high teens. In addition, we are entering a very exciting time on the exploration front as we get our first wells down in a variety of different plays. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff Agosta for the financial review and outlook. Jeff?"
266510,127127525,151763,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2011",2011-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Before we move into the financial review for the quarter, I would like to remind everyone my comments will be focused on results from continuing operations. In other words, our North American onshore business.",1373,"Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Before we move into the financial review for the quarter, I would like to remind everyone my comments will be focused on results from continuing operations. In other words, our North American onshore business. With the close of Brazil, this will be the last quarter that contains significant activity within discontinued operations. 
For those of you interested in a more detailed review of our discontinued ops, we have provided supplemental tables in our news release. For today's call, I will limit my comments to those items that require additional commentary or were outside of our forecasted guidance range. 
The first item I will cover is our production for the quarter. In the second quarter of 2011, our reported production totaled 60.1 million oil equivalent barrels or 660,000 Boe per day. This result set a quarterly production record for our North American onshore operations and represents a robust 5% growth rate over the first quarter and a greater than 6% increase over the year-ago quarter. Additionally, our production exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by roughly 10,000 barrels per day, in spite of deferring production from Cana due to tornado damage at our plant there. 
Our outperformance was driven by strong results from our core properties. Also, a gas royalty adjustment in Canada boosted reported second quarter production by about 7,000 barrels per day. 
Looking specifically at the liquids side of our business, our oil and natural gas liquids production averaged 220,000 barrels per day for the quarter, a 12% increase over the year-ago period. The most noteworthy year-over-year growth came in the U.S., led by strong growth from the Barnett, Cana and Permian basin, we increased our second quarter U.S. oil and NGL production by 22% over the second quarter of last year. Looking ahead, we expect downtime at our Cana processing facility to curtail third quarter production by roughly 10,000 Boe per day. In spite of this temporary curtailment, we still expect third quarter production to range between 655,000 and 665,000 barrels per day. 
Our sequential quarter production growth for the third quarter will be masked by the tornado impacted Cana volumes and the 7,000 Boe per day royalty adjustment in Canada that we reported in the second quarter. 
For the full year, we are now raising the bottom end of our production forecast by 2 million barrels to a range of 238 million to 240 million barrels. When compared to 2010, the midpoint of our updated guidance range implies a top-line production growth rate of more than 7% for our North American onshore properties. This growth will be achieved in spite of deferring approximately 2.5 million barrels of production due to severe weather, principally the damage to the Cana plant. 
Turning to hedges. In the second quarter, cash settlements from oil and gas hedges totaled $59 million. These settlements boosted our company-wide average price by about $1 per Boe in the quarter. 
Since our last conference call, we have continued to bolster our natural gas hedge position. In the second half of this year, we now have a combination of swap and collar contracts covering approximately 980 million cubic feet per day at a weighted average protected price of $5.28 per Mcf. 
We have also more than doubled our natural gas hedge position for next year. For the full year of 2012, we now have hedges covering 850 million cubic feet per day, with a weighed of average protected price just under $5 per Mcf. However, 60% of these hedged volumes are done using collars. Therefore, we still maintain upside on these volumes should natural gas pricing improve. We will post an updated hedging schedule in our 8-K filing and on our website that provides a detailed view of our 2011 and '12 hedge positions. 
Turning now to our Midstream business, In addition to our strong upstream performance, Devon's marketing and midstream operations also delivered outstanding results. Operating profit for the second quarter came in at $148 million, well above the high end of our implied guidance range. Strong NGL prices and increased throughput drove the increase. Looking ahead, we expect the downtime at our Cana processing facility to reduce our third quarter marketing and midstream operating profit to a range of $120 million to $140 million. However, for the full year, in spite of the setback at Cana, we now expect our operating profit to come in between $515 million and $545 million. This represents an increase of $20 million from our previous guidance. 
It is worth noting, as Dave mentioned, that we are well-insured for both the property damage and business interruption that has occurred at our Cana facility. Our policy deductibles are $2.5 million per property damage and a 30-day wait for business interruption. After the 30-day waiting period, our business interruption coverage pays for the loss of production, not only from the wells that were producing at the time of the storm, but also for the ramp up of volumes that would be occurring from the wells that we are drilling. Consequently, our risk management has mitigated most of the financial impact of this incident. 
Looking now at our expenses. In the second quarter, most expense items came in the bottom half of our guidance range. Our focus on controlling costs, combined with our high-graded asset base has helped offset both industry inflation and the headwinds of the strengthening Canadian dollar. 
Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, we anticipate continued upward pressure on costs. However, we are confident that our scale and key operating regions and consistent focus on cost management will allow us to mitigate much of the impact of inflation. 
Looking at our income taxes, Devon's reported second quarter income tax from continuing operations came in at $1.2 billion. This implies an 87% tax rate on pretax income from continuing ops. The most significant item that influenced our quarterly tax rate was a $744 million charge related to the assumed repatriation of foreign earnings to the U.S. This is essentially a non-cash charge which results from a required accounting exercise that assumes that we will repatriate a substantial portion of these funds under current U.S. tax law. However, as John mentioned earlier in the call, we have not repatriated these funds and they currently reside outside the U.S. In any case, after backing out the assumed repatriation charge and the impact of other nonrecurring items, you'd get an adjusted tax rate of 32% which is right in line with our guidance. 
Going to the bottom line, Devon's solid second quarter performance and the profitable sale of our assets in Brazil translated into record GAAP earnings of $2.7 billion. After backing out the nonrecurring items, our adjusted earnings totaled $726 million or $1.71 per diluted share. Our cash flows before balance sheet changes totaled $1.6 billion. As John mentioned earlier, this was a solid beat on both earnings per share and cash flow. 
Before we go to the Q&A, I would like to provide a quick update on our financial position. In the second quarter, Devon's cash inflows totaled $4.8 billion. After funding all capital demands for the quarter, repurchasing $584 million of common stock and paying out $72 million in dividends, our cash and short-term investments increased by over $3 billion during the quarter, reaching a total of $6.7 billion. As a result, our net debt declined to just $1.2 billion and our net debt to cap ratio declined to just 5%. 
Following the end of the quarter in the month of July, we issued $2.25 billion of senior notes through a combination of 5-, 10- and 30-year offerings. This allowed us to take advantage of today's attractive market conditions to fund our upcoming $1.75 billion of debt maturing in September, as well as reduce our outstanding short-term borrowings.
In summary, we are excited about Devon's future and believe that we are well-positioned to compete effectively. Our financial position provides us with significant strength. As importantly, our assets are performing very well. We remain focused on maximizing our operating margins, exercising capital discipline and optimizing growth for debt-adjusted share. At this point, I will turn the call back over to Vince for the Q&A. Vince?"

It's not overpressured. So, obviously, you need a little bit higher perm in order to move the oil through, but I think we understand that and we know where the permeability is and we're encouraged. And the ultimate test, obviously, is to drill some horizontal wells out there and we don't have any horizontal wells, but we think we have a pretty good understanding from our vast numbers of horizontal wells we drilled throughout the North America that we understand the relationship pretty well and we're optimistic."

But there is some overlap though between the first and second Bone Springs. And so yes the first Bone Springs is perspective as well on the New Mexico side. It's not -- I don't want to give you the idea that it's strictly a resource play type though. It's the first and second Bone Springs are more channel sands, so you have to make sure that you stay in the channels.

So that's something that we're trying to work out, trying to figure out the optimal capital allocation between the U.S. and Canada. And with regard to share buybacks, unfortunately, I thought at one time it would be clever if we bought our shares back through our Canadian subsidiary, but the folks at the IRS have all that figured out as well and we can't do that with any advantage. But in terms of buying back our stock, we're going to do what we always have. And looking ahead, determine what's going to create the best debt adjusted share returns and best [ph] metrics for our shareholders and allocate that capital appropriately between our E&P opportunities and buying back stock. And as you know, we haven't been shy about that. We bought back about 20% of our stock in the last 6 or 7 years. So we'll have to see all of that sorts out over the next while.

Let me begin by stating the obvious. Devon's second quarter of 2011 was an excellent one. Our North American onshore production reached an all-time record, averaging 660,000 equivalent barrels per day. That's",904,"Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by stating the obvious. Devon's second quarter of 2011 was an excellent one. Our North American onshore production reached an all-time record, averaging 660,000 equivalent barrels per day. That's a 5% increase over the first quarter, continued focus on efficiency and cost control, mitigated industry inflation and the impact of a stronger Canadian dollar. In fact, our pretax cash costs per equivalent barrel were essentially flat compared to the previous quarter and the year-ago quarter. 
With production above our guidance, higher realized commodity prices and effective cost management, our second quarter adjusted earnings climbed 10% over the prior year quarter to $1.71 per diluted share and that exceeded the first call mean by $0.17. 
Cash flow before balance sheet changes reached $1.6 billion or $3.81 per diluted share surpassing the street mean estimate by $0.48. 
Net earnings including the gain on the sale of Brazil totaled a whopping $2.7 billion for the second quarter or $6.48 per diluted share. And during the second quarter, we repurchased 7.1 million shares for $584 million. To date, we have spent $2.6 billion of the $3.5 billion current authorization to repurchase 35.1 million shares. This represents almost 8% of our outstanding shares and those shares were acquired at an average price of roughly $74 per share. We remain on track to complete that repurchase program by the end of the year.
In May, we closed our $3.2 billion sale of our Brazilian assets which essentially completes the strategic repositioning of Devon to a company focused entirely onshore in North America. Our total pretax divestiture proceeds exceeded $10 billion, with after-tax proceeds estimated to $8 billion. Currently, we have more than $6.5 billion of cash and short-term investments outside the U.S. that we have not repatriated. However, it's important to note that our after-tax estimate of proceeds assumes full payment of the taxes triggered by repatriation of most of those funds under current U.S. tax law. If a more favorable tax situation develops for the repatriation of these funds, or if we redeploy the proceeds in Canada, we will have up to $900 million of upside. Until we have better visibility into potential repatriation tax legislation and determine the optimal long-term capital allocation between the U.S. and Canada, our divestiture proceeds will remain outside the U.S. 
Devon has emerged from the repositioning in a truly enviable position. We have a deep inventory of low-risk drilling locations, including years of high margin oil and liquids-rich development in our cornerstone project areas. These include the Barnett, the Cana, and our steam-assisted gravity drainage projects in Canada. We are drilling our most economic wells ever in the liquid-rich portions of the Barnett. Our first mover position has provided us with the largest and best acreage position. Furthermore, our low entry and royalty cost enhanced the economic returns across our inventory of thousands of undrilled Barnett locations. In the liquids-rich Cana, we're taking advantage of opportunities to increase our working interest and are continuing to delineate our condensate-rich acreage to the northwest. We could continue for years at our current pace of development without any additional inventory. However, in order to bring forward the value embedded in our existing acreage positions, we're pursuing a wide range of exploration opportunities across North America. 
In the Permian and Western Canadian sedimentary basins, for example, we're accelerating oil and liquids-rich exploration drilling. Given the recent advances in drilling and completions technology and the stacked pay nature of these basins, we're pursuing more than 20 oil and liquids-rich plays that have emerged in these 2 basins alone. 
Our inventory represents more than 3 billion oil equivalent barrels of net unrisked resource across our more than 5 million net perspective acres. These substantial positions provide Devon with thousands of potential locations, representing many years of additional growth. 
We're also moving forward with the testing of our new venture plays. These include the Tuscaloosa, the Niobrara, the Mississippi Lime in Oklahoma, the Ohio Utica, and the A1 Carbonate and Utica in Michigan. 
We've been successful with our strategy of acquiring sizable positions in these oil and liquids-rich plays, where, for the most part, competition had not yet driven up prices. Instead of leasing large blocks of trend acreage and then figuring out where the play works best, we've taken a more targeted approach. Similar to our approach in the Cana play, we've attempted to identify the best parts of the plays and specifically focused our acreage acquisitions in those areas. 
Utilizing this approach, we've secured 1.1 million net acres at a very reasonable costs in what we believe to be highly economic parts of these 5 plays. While each of these plays has risk, it's likely that several will turn out to be highly economic large scale development plays. The second half of this year is shaping up to be an exciting time for Devon, with the initial drilling results anticipated from a wide range of exploration opportunities. 
In summary, the repositioned company has all the attributes necessary to deliver highly competitive per share growth. We're generating excellent, full cycle returns. We have superior financial strength and we have a deep inventory of economic, low-risk development projects and promising exploration projects in emerging plays and new ventures. 
So with that overview, I will turn the call over to Dave Hager for a review of our quarterly operating highlights. Dave?"

Our key development plays, including the Barnett, the Cana and Jackfish are all performing very well. We also remain very active in evaluating and de-risking the upside potential in our various emerging and new venture plays. With more than 90% of our 2011 E&P capital allocated towards oil and liquids-rich projects and with the solid results we have seen so far this year, we are well on our way to deliver liquids growth in the high teens in 2011. 
So let's take a look at some of the highlights for the quarter. Starting with our oil -- our thermal oil projects in Eastern Alberta, Jackfish continues to deliver industry-leading performance. During the second quarter, Jackfish 1 production averaged 31,000 barrels per day net of royalties. At Jackfish 2, we began injecting steam in the second quarter. All 4 pads are currently in the circulation phase of the process. As some of you may have recall from our recent SAGD school, this is the initial stage where steam is injected into both the injector and producer wells to begin warming the reservoir. Later this month, 3 of the pads will move into the partial SAGD phase and production will continue to ramp up. We exited the second quarter producing about 1,000 barrels per day net of royalties at Jackfish 2. 
At Pike, with data from nearly 400 wells and some 60 square miles of seismic, our SAGD team has begun engineering work on a 105,000-barrel per day facility for Pike 1. This would be essentially 3 Jackfish-sized facilities from a single plant site. You might recall we completed the resource evaluation for 2 of the 3 projects with last winter's stratigraphic drilling. 
Planning efforts are already underway for our 2011, 2012 winter drilling and seismic programs and we'll focus on defining the third 35,000-barrel per day project in the Pike 1 complex. Ultimately, we believe that Pike can support 4 or 5 Jackfish-sized projects. And when combined with Jackfish, we expect to grow Devon's net thermal oil production to between 150,000 and 175,000 barrels per day by 2020. 
Moving now to the Permian basin, we currently have 19 operated rigs pursuing targets in numerous play types across our roughly 1 million net acre position. Our second quarter production from the Permian increased 17% over the second quarter of 2010 to 49,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Oil and natural gas liquids accounted for 75% of the quarter's production. 
In the Permian in our Wolfberry light oil play, we currently have 5 operated rigs running, as we continue the evaluation and development of our 160,000 net acres. Through the second quarter, we had drilled approximately 50 of our planned 135 well program for this year. We recently initiated a 4-well 20-acre infill pilot program and we'll be testing the application of horizontal drilling in certain areas as well. We have significant running room in this high return light oil play, with more than 850 net risked locations remaining. 
On our roughly 200,000 net acres in the Bone Springs oil play, we currently have 5 operated rigs running. We continue to have great results from our horizontal programs, on both the New Mexico and Texas sides of the play. In the second quarter, we completed 8 wells in the second Bone Springs interval in New Mexico, with 30-day average IP rates of 665 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This included one exceptionally strong well, the Diamond [ph]  1H that was brought online with an average 30-day IP rate of more than 1,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Our Bone Springs well cost in New Mexico are running about $5 million per well, with EURs averaging 400,000 barrels equivalent. On the Texas side in the Bone Springs play, we completed our third well targeting the  third Bone Springs interval. The 100% Devon-owned Talladega 65 2H was brought online recently. After 15 days of production, this well has averaged 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Although our Texas Bone Springs production history is limited to just a few wells, we are encouraged with the shallow declines we have seen to this point. With average EURs exceeding 600,000 barrels equivalent, and with well cost running about $7 million, these wells offer outstanding returns. We've planned out a third rig in the Texas side of the play later this year, bringing our total number of rigs working in the Bone Springs up to 6. 
Also in the Permian, the Delaware is another conventional oil information that we are targeting with horizontal drilling. We completed 3 wells in the second quarter, including the Laguna Salada 6H that came online with a 30-day IP rate of more than 800 oil equivalent barrels per day. We now have 3 operated rigs drilling Delaware horizontal wells. 
Elsewhere in the Permian basin, we are targeting 2 operated rigs in the Avalon Shale play. Our activity is now focused on our 65,000 net acres in the eastern portion of the play where condensate yields are higher. We currently have 3 wells in various stages of drilling or completion and should have those results for you next quarter. 
And finally, in the Permian basin, we have assembled approximately 65,000 net acres in the southern end of the Midland Basin and the Wolfcamp Shale oil play. We are currently running 2 operated rigs with our first 3 wells in the play in various stages of drilling or completion. We hope to have results for you next quarter. This is a hot play in the industry, and with the positive indications we've seen to date, we now plan to drill 8 Wolfcamp Shale exploration wells in 2011. 
In addition to the Midland Basin acreage, we have about 200,000 net acres in the Delaware Basin that is perspective for the Wolfcamp Shale. We're currently drilling our first well to test this formation's potential in the Delaware Basin. 
Moving north to the Texas panhandle and the Granite Wash play, we continue to see solid results from our Cherokee and Granite Wash 8 [ph] wells. We are running 5 operated rigs here and brought 8 operated Granite Wash wells online during the second quarter. The 30-day IP rates from these wells averaged over 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 200 barrels of oil and 730 barrels of natural gas liquids per day. 
Moving now to the Cana Woodford Shale in Western Oklahoma. As everyone is well aware by now, our Cana gas processing plant was damaged by a tornado on May 24. It's worth noting that we have both property and business interruption insurance that Jeff will cover in more detail later. Work is underway to repair the damage and we expect the plant to be fully repaired and operational during the fourth quarter. We are confident of our year-end exit rate target for Cana of 275 million cubic feet equivalent per day, net to Devon's interest. In spite of the planned interruption, our second quarter net Cana production averaged 17% over the first quarter to a record 189 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including nearly 9,000 barrels per day of liquids. 
To keep pace with our Cana Woodford growth and capture additional value from the liquids-rich portions in the field, we plan to begin the first expansion to our Cana gas processing plant later this year. The facility's initial processing capacity of 200 million cubic feet per day will be expanded to 350 million a day and will be capable of extracting up to 27,000 barrels of NGLs per day. The $125 million expansion is expected to be operational in the fourth quarter of 2012.
Shifting to the Barnett Shale field in North Texas. This field continues to be a significant and highly economic resource for us. Our 2011 program has yielded the best wells we have ever drilled in the Barnett. We have seen average EURs increase to 3.2 Bcf equivalent per day. We ran 13 operated rigs in the Barnett for most of the second quarter. Subsequent to June 30, we dropped one rig, bringing our operated rig count back to 12, where we expect to keep it for the remainder of the year. In the second quarter, we brought 114 Barnett wells online, with average 30-day IP rates of approximately 3.4 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including an average 125 barrels of liquids per day. 
In the second quarter, our net production reached a record 1.28 Bcf equivalent per day, that is 1,280,000,000 cubic feet equivalent per day including 46,000 barrels of per day liquids. This represents a 5% sequential quarter increase and a 13% increase over the second quarter of last year. 
With the high liquids yield we are seeing from our Barnett drilling combined with our outlook for gas and NGL product spreads, we recently made the decision to expand our Bridgeport gas processing plant for the seventh time. The 140-million-a-day expansion will provide an additional 11,000 barrels per day of NGL production capacity. The  $160 million expansion is expected to be operational in the first quarter of 2013. Upon completion, the Bridgeport facility will have an inlet capacity of 790 million cubic feet per day, with an NGL production capacity of 65,000 barrels per day, making it one of the largest gas processing facilities in the lower 48. 
On the exploration front, as John indicated, we are continuing to actively evaluate the oil and liquids potential on acreage within our portfolio that spans numerous play types across multiple basins in the U.S. and Canada. This includes several new ventures areas in the U.S. where we have assembled 1.1 million net acres. And in Niobrara, we have approximately 200,000 net acres in the Powder River Basin and 100,000 net acres in northern part of the DJ Basin. This is a very active industry play right now, with about 30 rigs working. Many of the industry wells drilled to date were drilled without the benefit of 3D data, making it difficult to target, identify and land in the appropriate zones. Our initial focus in the DJ Basin will be to utilize 3D to improve upon the lack of consistency demonstrated to date in this play by the industry. 
We are currently drilling our first wells in both basins. We plan to drill or participate in 6 Niobrara wells in the Powder and 4 in the DJ basin in 2011. 
In the Mississippi and oil play located in North Central Oklahoma, we have secured over 200,000 net acres. This is a play originally established by vertical production years ago, but is now being pursued with horizontal drilling. We drilled our first vertical well to gather data in the second quarter, and we're currently drilling our first horizontal well. In total, we plan to drill or participate in 12 to 15 wells in 2011. 
There has been a lot of discussion lately of the Ohio Utica Shale. And as most of you know, Devon was an early mover. We've established 110,000 net acres in what we believe in the heart of the oil window. The primary risk to a shale play is of course the ability to move fluid through a very tight reservoir. However, we have now analyzed the core from our first Utica well and are highly encouraged by the positive permeability indications seen in our first well. Based on these early results, we believe the oil window could offer some of the best economics in the play. We plan to drill 3 additional Ohio Utica wells this year. 
Just to the north is our 300,000 net acre position in the Michigan Basin is prospective for both the Utica Shale, as well as the A1 Carbonate. As you may know, this has historically been a prolific basin. We are particularly excited about the potential of the A1 Carbonate which was the source rock for the Niagaran Reef play in Michigan. We drilled our first 2 vertical core wells and are currently evaluating the data. 
And finally, in the Tuscaloosa Shale play located along the Louisiana and Mississippi border, we recently completed drilling, coring and logging operations on our first well, the Lane 64-1. This is a vertical well that we drilled to obtain data. The rig has now moved up depth to the Beech Grove 68 1H (sic) [ 68H-1 ] where we plan to gather additional core and log data before drilling the lateral and completing it as our first horizontal in the Tuscaloosa. 
Another exploration play that has recently caught the Street's attention is the Smackover Brown Dense oil play located in North Louisiana. We have about 40,000 net acres perspective in the play and expect to spot our first horizontal well in this play next month. 
As I mentioned, we also have a significant exploration effort underway in Canada, targeting the deep basin where we have Cardium and lower Cretaceous drilling programs underway, as well as Cardium program in the Ferrier Area of our Central Alberta and our Viking program in Saskatchewan. 
Although wet weather has delayed a portion of our Canadian exploration program, we still expect to complete our 2011 program. However, at our Viking light oil play in Saskatchewan, we did complete 2 wells in the second quarter, one of which IP-ed at 90 barrels of oil per day. We expect this play to be economic, with well costs in the $1 million to $1.2 million per well range, IPs of approximately 40 barrels per day and EURs of 50,000 barrels. While these results are encouraging, we're still in the early stages of evaluating the potential on our 900,000 net acre position. If successful, we could have more than 1,000 Viking drilling locations. 
In summary, all of our key development projects are delivering excellent results, supporting our production growth targets. Growth is being driven by liquids growth in the high teens. In addition, we are entering a very exciting time on the exploration front as we get our first wells down in a variety of different plays. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff Agosta for the financial review and outlook. Jeff?"
266510,127127525,152075,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2011",2011-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Before we move into the financial review for the quarter, I would like to remind everyone my comments will be focused on results from continuing operations. In other words, our North American onshore business.",1372,"Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Before we move into the financial review for the quarter, I would like to remind everyone my comments will be focused on results from continuing operations. In other words, our North American onshore business. With the close of Brazil, this will be the last quarter that contains significant activity within discontinued operations. 
For those of you interested in a more detailed review of our discontinued ops, we have provided supplemental tables in our news release. For today's call, I will limit my comments to those items that require additional commentary or were outside of our forecasted guidance range. 
The first item I will cover is our production for the quarter. In the second quarter of 2011, our reported production totaled 60.1 million oil equivalent barrels or 660,000 Boe per day. This result set a quarterly production record for our North American onshore operations and represents a robust 5% growth rate over the first quarter and a greater than 6% increase over the year-ago quarter. Additionally, our production exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by roughly 10,000 barrels per day, in spite of deferring production from Cana due to tornado damage at our plant there. 
Our outperformance was driven by strong results from our core properties. Also, a gas royalty adjustment in Canada boosted reported second quarter production by about 7,000 barrels per day. 
Looking specifically at the liquids side of our business, our oil and natural gas liquids production averaged 220,000 barrels per day for the quarter, a 12% increase over the year-ago period. The most noteworthy year-over-year growth came in the U.S., led by strong growth from the Barnett, Cana and Permian basin, we increased our second quarter U.S. oil and NGL production by 22% over the second quarter of last year. Looking ahead, we expect downtime at our Cana processing facility to curtail third quarter production by roughly 10,000 Boe per day. In spite of this temporary curtailment, we still expect third quarter production to range between 655,000 and 665,000 barrels per day. 
Our sequential quarter production growth for the third quarter will be masked by the tornado impacted Cana volumes and the 7,000 Boe per day royalty adjustment in Canada that we reported in the second quarter. 
For the full year, we are now raising the bottom end of our production forecast by 2 million barrels to a range of 238 million to 240 million barrels. When compared to 2010, the midpoint of our updated guidance range implies a top-line production growth rate of more than 7% for our North American onshore properties. This growth will be achieved in spite of deferring approximately 2.5 million barrels of production due to severe weather, principally the damage to the Cana plant. 
Turning to hedges. In the second quarter, cash settlements from oil and gas hedges totaled $59 million. These settlements boosted our company-wide average price by about $1 per Boe in the quarter. 
Since our last conference call, we have continued to bolster our natural gas hedge position. In the second half of this year, we now have a combination of swap and collar contracts covering approximately 980 million cubic feet per day at a weighted average protected price of $5.28 per Mcf. 
We have also more than doubled our natural gas hedge position for next year. For the full year of 2012, we now have hedges covering 850 million cubic feet per day, with a weighted average protected price just under $5 per Mcf. However, 60% of these hedged volumes are done using collars. Therefore, we still maintain upside on these volumes should natural gas pricing improve. We will post an updated hedging schedule in our 8-K filing and on our website that provides a detailed view of our 2011 and '12 hedge positions. 
Turning now to our Midstream business, In addition to our strong upstream performance, Devon's marketing and midstream operations also delivered outstanding results. Operating profit for the second quarter came in at $148 million, well above the high end of our implied guidance range. Strong NGL prices and increased throughput drove the increase. Looking ahead, we expect the downtime at our Cana processing facility to reduce our third quarter marketing and midstream operating profit to a range of $120 million to $140 million. However, for the full year, in spite of the setback at Cana, we now expect our operating profit to come in between $515 million and $545 million. This represents an increase of $20 million from our previous guidance. 
It is worth noting, as Dave mentioned, that we are well-insured for both the property damage and business interruption that has occurred at our Cana facility. Our policy deductibles are $2.5 million per property damage and a 30-day wait for business interruption. After the 30-day waiting period, our business interruption coverage pays for the loss of production, not only from the wells that were producing at the time of the storm, but also for the ramp up of volumes that would be occurring from the wells that we are drilling. Consequently, our risk management has mitigated most of the financial impact of this incident. 
Looking now at our expenses. In the second quarter, most expense items came in the bottom half of our guidance range. Our focus on controlling costs, combined with our high-graded asset base has helped offset both industry inflation and the headwinds of the strengthening Canadian dollar. 
Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, we anticipate continued upward pressure on costs. However, we are confident that our scale and key operating regions and consistent focus on cost management will allow us to mitigate much of the impact of inflation. 
Looking at our income taxes, Devon's reported second quarter income tax from continuing operations came in at $1.2 billion. This implies an 87% tax rate on pretax income from continuing ops. The most significant item that influenced our quarterly tax rate was a $744 million charge related to the assumed repatriation of foreign earnings to the U.S. This is essentially a non-cash charge which results from a required accounting exercise that assumes that we will repatriate a substantial portion of these funds under current U.S. tax law. However, as John mentioned earlier in the call, we have not repatriated these funds and they currently reside outside the U.S. In any case, after backing out the assumed repatriation charge and the impact of other nonrecurring items, you'd get an adjusted tax rate of 32% which is right in line with our guidance. 
Going to the bottom line, Devon's solid second quarter performance and the profitable sale of our assets in Brazil translated into record GAAP earnings of $2.7 billion. After backing out the nonrecurring items, our adjusted earnings totaled $726 million or $1.71 per diluted share. Our cash flows before balance sheet changes totaled $1.6 billion. As John mentioned earlier, this was a solid beat on both earnings per share and cash flow. 
Before we go to the Q&A, I would like to provide a quick update on our financial position. In the second quarter, Devon's cash inflows totaled $4.8 billion. After funding all capital demands for the quarter, repurchasing $584 million of common stock and paying out $72 million in dividends, our cash and short-term investments increased by over $3 billion during the quarter, reaching a total of $6.7 billion. As a result, our net debt declined to just $1.2 billion and our net debt to cap ratio declined to just 5%. 
Following the end of the quarter in the month of July, we issued $2.25 billion of senior notes through a combination of 5-, 10- and 30-year offerings. This allowed us to take advantage of today's attractive market conditions to fund our upcoming $1.75 billion of debt maturing in September, as well as reduce our outstanding short-term borrowings.
In summary, we are excited about Devon's future and believe that we are well-positioned to compete effectively. Our financial position provides us with significant strength. As importantly, our assets are performing very well. We remain focused on maximizing our operating margins, exercising capital discipline and optimizing growth for debt-adjusted share. At this point, I will turn the call back over to Vince for the Q&A. Vince?"

It's not overpressured. So, obviously, you need a little bit higher perm in order to move the oil through, but I think we understand that and we know where the permeability is and we're encouraged. And the ultimate test, obviously, is to drill some horizontal wells out there and we don't have any horizontal wells, but we think we have a pretty good understanding from our vast numbers of horizontal wells we drilled throughout the North America that we understand the relationship pretty well and we're optimistic."

So that's something that we're trying to work out, trying to figure out the optimal capital allocation between the U.S. and Canada. And with regard to share buybacks, unfortunately, I thought at one time it would be clever if we bought our shares back through our Canadian subsidiary, but the folks at the IRS have all that figured out as well and we can't do that with any advantage. But in terms of buying back our stock, we're going to do what we always have.

As a company focused entirely on North America, Devon delivered a very solid third quarter performance. Let m",1091,"Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter of 2011 was our first full quarter following the completion of our repositioning. As a company focused entirely on North America, Devon delivered a very solid third quarter performance. Let me begin by highlighting some of our results. 
Our third quarter adjusted net earnings from continuing operations of $1.54 per diluted share increased 18% over the year-ago quarter and exceeded the first call mean by $0.09. 
Our cash flow from continuing operations of $4.19 per diluted share increased 26% over the year-ago quarter and surpassed the first call mean by more than 20%. 
For the third quarter, we increased North American onshore production 8% over the year-ago quarter driven by a 17% increase in oil and natural gas liquids production. 
With strong growth in liquids production and a focus on controlling costs, Devon's pretax cash margin increased to more than $26 per barrel equivalent in the quarter. Also during the third quarter, we repurchased 10.8 million shares for $697 million remaining on track to complete our $3.5 billion stock repurchase program by year end. And with $6.8 billion in cash in the net debt to cap ratio of 10%, our balance sheet remains in terrific shape. 
In addition to the development drilling that's driving our current production growth, we are continuing to actively evaluate the oil and liquids potential on our 1.2 million net acres in five high potential new venture plays. This includes our positions in the Tuscaloosa, the Mississippian, the Niobrara, the Ohio Utica and the Michigan Basin. Our 40-well program across those five plays is well underway. We have drilled our first wells in each of the plays and have additional wells in various stages of completion. While it's still early on, we've been very encouraged with our results, as well as those from industry peers near some of our positions. 
To improve the risk/reward profile of these new venture plays, we've been conducting a data room process to bring in a partner. We are clearly not pursuing this because we need the money. Given the strength of our balance sheet, we can easily pursue all of these opportunities simultaneously, with 100% ownership. However, we see many advantages to bringing in an exploration partner. 
First, the joint venture could improve our capital efficiency, both by recovering the costs associated with establishing the acreage positions and by providing a reduction of our capital requirements in the future. 
Second, the joint venture would allow us to accelerate the de-risking and commercialization of these new venture positions. 
And third, the joint venture could allow us the opportunity to seek exposure in more new play types with less risk. So a joint venture presents us with opportunity for accelerated commercialization, improved capital efficiency and risk mitigation. 
Given that we're currently engaged in this data room process and still adding to our positions, we're not going to report specific well results in our new venture activities today. However, I can tell you that the indications of interest we have seen from potential partners have been very strong. 
Now before I turn the call over to Dave, I would like to address the subject of a number of recent questions concerning our capital outlook for next year. Although we are still in the process of finalizing our 2012 capital budget, our philosophy remains steadfast. We remain fully committed to optimizing value by maximizing growth on a per share basis adjusted for debt. In order to achieve that goal, we remain keenly focused on exercising capital discipline, maximizing our full cycle returns and maintaining a high degree of financial strength and flexibility. Based on this philosophy, we will not compromise our per-share results for top-line growth by funding projects with low rates of return. Instead, we will strive to optimize the allocation of capital among our alternatives of investing in our oil and liquids-rich opportunity base, capturing additional resource and repurchasing our shares. Of course, the relative attractiveness of these various options changes, with movements on Devon's stock price, our borrowing costs and our outlook for commodity prices and industry costs. 
Since we've not finalized our 2012 E&P capital budget, I cannot provide specific capital guidance. However, I will provide some directional comments. In 2012, we expect to implement a drilling program with activity levels similar to 2011. Our focus in 2012 will be on developing the high-margin oil and liquids opportunities in our existing portfolio and accelerating the evaluation of the many new plays that we have captured. 
Our preliminary 2012 capital budget does not contemplate a repeat of the roughly $700 million of acreage acquisitions that we are making in 2011. And therefore, in total, we expect our capital outlay in 2012 to be less than 2011. 
The majority of our 2012 capital will be focused on core development projects. In Canada, we expect to begin construction on the third 35,000-barrel per day phase of Jackfish in the first quarter of 2012. In the Barnett and Cana, we will continue the aggressive development of our inventory of thousands of undrilled locations in the liquids-rich portions. Furthermore, in 2012, we'll be expanding our gas processing plants in each of these plays to keep pace with our growth and capture additional value. 
In the Permian, we will continue investing in our reliable development plays, including the Wolfberry, the Delaware and the Bone Spring. And in addition to investing in these low risk development plays, we will continue to actively evaluate our acreage positions established through our Greenfields new ventures. These exploration plays, coupled with the emerging plays that we're just beginning to evaluate in the Permian and in Western Canada hold tremendous future potential for Devon. 
We strongly believe that Devon's stock creates a differentiating opportunity for investors in the E&P space. Our deep and diverse inventory of oil and liquids-rich opportunities provides us with great flexibility in allocating capital based on market conditions. Our superior financial strength allows us to consistently invest in our business based on our long-term outlook regardless of the near-term macro economic backdrop. We remain intently focused on optimizing margins and continuing to position ourselves as a low-cost producer. 
And finally, we maintain a disciplined approach of balancing resource development with resource capture to optimize the value of our entire portfolio. All of these factors position Devon to deliver competitive growth in cash flow and production per share. 
So at this point, I'll now turn the call over to Dave Hager for a review of our quarterly operating highlights. Dave?"

I will begin with a quick recap of 2011 capital expenditures for our exploration and development activities. E&P spending was $1.6 billion for the third quarter and including $250 million of undeveloped acreage",1769,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I will begin with a quick recap of 2011 capital expenditures for our exploration and development activities. 
E&P spending was $1.6 billion for the third quarter and including $250 million of undeveloped acreage acquisitions. This brings our E&P capital through the first nine months to $4.7 billion. We expect fourth quarter expenditures for exploration and development to be approximately $1.5 billion. While this will take us outside our guidance range for E&P spending, it is partially offset by our Midstream capital which should fall well below the midpoint of our guidance range. Consequently, we expect our total capital expenditures for 2011 to come in near the top end of our guidance range. 
Our 2011 E&P capital program is delivering outstanding results. Our cornerstone development areas, including the Barnett, Cana, the Permian and Jackfish are all performing very well. We also continue to move forward with evaluating and de-risking the upside potential in our various emerging and new venture plays. So let's take a closer look at some of the third quarter highlights in these areas. 
Starting with our thermal oil projects in Eastern Alberta, Jackfish continues to deliver industry-leading performance. During the third quarter, Jackfish 1 production averaged 32,000 barrels per day, net of royalties and continued its trend of excellent plant reliability and efficiency. 
At Jackfish 2, we continue to be very pleased with the ramp up of production. In the third quarter, our net production averaged 4,000 barrels per day. And in October, it averaged almost 9,000 barrels per day, exceeding planned volumes. 
Review of our regulatory application for Jackfish 3 is nearing completion. Pending approval, we will begin construction in the first quarter of next year, with plant start-up targeted for late 2014. Devon operates all three Jackfish projects and owns 100% working interest in each. 
At our Pike joint venture, our 2011, 2012 winter drilling and seismic program will begin later this month. We plan to drill roughly 140 stratigraphic wells and shoot approximately 50 square miles of seismic this winter. The program will focus on confirming the resource potential for a third 35,000-barrel per day project in the Pike 1 Complex. This will bring the identified resource at Pike up to roughly 900 million barrels gross which translates the gross production potential of over 100,000 barrels per day. Devon operates Pike and owns a 50% working interest. Ultimately, we believe the Pike acreage can support the equivalent of 4 or 5 Jackfish-sized projects. In aggregate, between Jackfish and Pike, we expect to drive our net thermal oil production to between 150,000 and 175,000 barrels per day by 2020.
Moving now to the Permian basin, we currently have 19 operated rigs pursuing targets in numerous play types across the basin. Our third quarter Permian oil and liquids production increased 17% over the year-ago quarter. In total, our Permian production average 50,000 equivalent barrels per day in the third quarter, with 75% of that being oil and natural gas liquids. 
In our Wolfberry light oil play in the Permian, we currently have 4 operated rigs running as we continue the evaluation and development of our 160,000 net acres. Our net Wolfberry production climbed to a record 9,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter. 
While we are currently developing the Wolfberry on 40-acre spacing, we have a 20-acre infill pilot program underway. We have brought our first 220-acre Wolfberry in-fill wells online during the third quarter with encouraging results. The remaining in-fill wells in the pilot program are currently drilling, as well as our first horizontal well in the Wolfberry development area. The additional potential represented by 20-acre well spacing and horizontal Wolfcamp wells in certain areas provide upside to our current inventory of more than 850 net risk Wolfberry locations. 
Moving to the Bone Springs oil play also in the Permian, we currently have eight operated rigs running. We continue to see outstanding results from our horizontal program, on both the New Mexico and Texas sides of the play. With average EURs ranging from 400,000 to 600,000 barrels equivalent and well cost between $5 million and $8 million, most of these wells are generating rates of return in excess of 50% based on the current strip pricing. 
In the third quarter, we completed 11 Bone Springs wells with 30-day average IP rates of 540 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Production from our Bone Springs horizontal program has increased 300% to almost 5,000 equivalent barrels per day since the beginning of the year. 
Elsewhere in the Permian, we continue to run two rigs targeting the conventional Delaware oil formation. We drilled seven wells and completed four of them during the third quarter. The 30-day IP rates for the completed wells averaged nearly 400 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Like the Bone Springs, these wells offer outstanding returns based on strip pricing. We have approximately 125 net risk locations remaining in the Delaware. 
Also in the Permian, we increased our Wolfcamp Shale oil position in the Midland Basin during the quarter, to approximately 92,000 net acres. We brought our first horizontal wells online during the quarter, and are very pleased with the results. Much of our acreage is located in the area where current industry activity is concentrated and our initial results indicated this acreage is commercially viable. We plan to drill eight Wolfcamp Shale wells this year, with six or seven completed and online by year end. 
Moving north to the Texas Panhandle in the Granite Wash play, we continue to see solid results from our Cherokee and Granite Wash oil wells. We brought 10 operated Granite Wash wells online during the third quarter. The 30-day IP rates from these wells averaged over 1,250 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 180 barrels of oil and 405 barrels of natural gas liquids per day. 
We were also drilling our first wells in the area to test the Wubo Cao wash and Caldwell zones which provide upside to our Granite Wash position. 
Moving now to the Cana Woodford shale in Western Oklahoma. Reconstruction of our Cana gas processing plant is now complete. We began processing gas in late October and are currently running about 138 million cubic feet per day through the facility. Ramp up will continue over the next several weeks, as we expect to reach the plant's capacity of 200 million a day in September. 
We've also started to work on a planned expansion at Cana. This will increase the capacity of the Cana plant to 350 million a day, with liquids extraction capacity of more than 30,000 barrels per day. The expansion allows us to keep pace with our growing Cana Woodford Shale volumes and roughly doubles our liquids extraction capacity in Cana. We expect the increase in capacity to be operational in the fourth quarter of next year. 
On the drilling front, we ended the quarter -- the third quarter with 17 operated rigs running in the Cana, six rigs fewer than in the previous quarter. We have achieved drilling efficiencies that allow us to now maintain the pace of our Cana program with fewer rigs. Accordingly, we made the decision in third quarter to release two rigs. In addition, while waiting the recommissioning of our Cana plant, we elected the subleasing for additional rigs to another company for the remainder of the year. With the Cana plant coming back online, we are confident in achieving our year-end exit rate target of 275 million cubic feet equivalent per day, net to Devon's interest. 
In spite of the planned operation or interruption, excuse me, our third quarter net Cana production increased 6% over the second quarter to a record 200 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including more than 8,100 barrels per day of liquids.
Shifting to the Barnett shale field in North Texas. We currently have 12 operated rigs running. In the third quarter, we brought 77 Barnett wells online. We are continuing to see outstanding results from our Barnett program in the liquids-rich portion of the plane. Our net Barnett  production increased to a record 1.3 Bcf equivalent per day, including 46,000 barrels per day of liquids. 
Upon completion of our Bridgeport planned expansion in the first quarter of 2013, we would expect to see our net volumes come to an all-time record of more than 1.4 Bcf equivalent per day, with our current 12-rig program. 
On the exploration front, in addition to the progress that John mentioned the other new ventures plays, we continue to evaluate the potential of our position in a number of plays emerging in our historical areas of operations. In Canada, our exploration efforts are ongoing, as we target oil and liquids-rich opportunities across our more than 4 million net acres. In aggregate, we completed 19 exploration wells and tied 10 of them into production in the third quarter. The best results we saw in the quarter in the Cardium. In the third quarter, we brought three Cardium oil wells online in the very your area of Central Alberta. Average 30-day IP rates of for these wells were 770 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We are currently completing two additional wells in the area. 
Another encouraging result from our third quarter exploration program in Canada came from our Viking light oil play at Saskatchewan. We completed four wells in the third quarter, with 30-day IP rates of up to 70 barrels per day. These are shallow wells and we would anticipate cost of roughly $1 million per well in the development phase of this play. While we are still working to optimize our drilling and completion approach, we are encouraged by these early results. I'll remind you, we own 100% of the surface and minerals in a very large acreage position, with more than 1,000 potential drilling locations. 
Also in Canada, we brought two see white oil wells on the Swan Hills area, with average 30-day IPs of 300 barrels per day. We have an inventory of more than 160 undrilled a three-point locations and plan to drill three additional wells in the fourth quarter. Of the 10 exploration wells brought online in Canada during the quarter, nine were successful. So while it's still very early in the process, we are excited about the results we have seen. 
In summary, all of our key development projects are delivering excellent results and we continue to take important steps and evaluating the deep inventory of expiration opportunities across our portfolio. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff Agosta for the financial review and outlook. Jeff?"

This morning, I will take you through a brief review of the key drivers that shaped our strong third quarter financial results.

This morning, I will take you through a brief review of the key drivers that shaped our strong third quarter financial results. I plan to limit my comments to items that require additional commentary or outside our forecasted guidance range. 
The first item I would like to cover is our production. In the third quarter, we produced 60.8 million oil equivalent barrels or approximately 661,000 equivalent barrels per day. This result was just above the midpoint of the forecast we provided on our second quarter call. And as John said, it represents an 8% increase in production over the year-ago quarter. 
On the liquids side of the business, we again delivered robust growth. For the quarter, our oil and natural gas liquids production increased by 17% over the third quarter of 2010 to an average of 226,000 barrels per day. Strong year-over-year oil growth from the Permian basin and Jackfish combined with liquids growth in the Cana and Barnett drove this impressive performance. 
Looking to the remainder of the year, we remain on track to deliver full-year production of 238 million to 240 million equivalent barrels. When compared to our North American onshore production in 2010, this represents top-line production growth of about 7% to 8%, driven by liquids growth in the high teens. 
With the Cana plant starting back up, we expect Q4 production to increase to a range of 665,000 to 675,000 BOE per day. 
Given our growth in oil and natural gas liquids production and the current weakness in natural gas prices, nearly 60% of our third quarter upstream sales revenue came from liquids. 
Regional oil prices remained strong during the quarter, and petrochemical demand pushed NGL realization higher. Our E&P revenues were again supplemented by cash settlements from our attractively-priced hedges. In total, cash settlements increased revenues by $96 million in the third quarter and boosted our company-wide price realizations by $1.58 per BOE. 
Not only were our upstream revenues strong, but our marketing and midstream operations made another strong contribution. We generated $138 million of operating profit in the third quarter which represents an 11% increase over the third quarter of 2010. To put this into perspective, our marketing image operating profit enhanced our company-wide margins by $2.27 per BOE. Based on our results for the first nine months, we expect full year 2011 operating profit to be in the top half of our guidance range of $515 million to $545 million. 
Shifting to expenses, in the third quarter, we were successful in partially mitigating the impact of industry inflation. Expenses in most categories showed a moderate increase, but were generally in line with our expectations. In aggregate, our pretax cash costs totaled only $13.56 per barrel for the quarter or about 2% higher than last quarter. This continues to give us a very competitive cost structure within the industry. We remain well-positioned and a low-cost producer and expect to continue to generate full cycle margins that are among the best in our peer group. 
Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, we remain comfortable with the expense forecast provided in our August 8-K. One noteworthy item for those of you who model our results, is that fourth quarter G&A expense will include approximately $20 million of non-cash expense due to the issuance of annual equity compensation. Including this non-cash expense, we expect fourth quarter G&A expenses to range between $170 million and $180 million. 
Looking briefly at income taxes, for the third quarter, we reported income tax expense from continuing operations of $498 million or 32% of pretax income. After backing out the impact of special items typically excluded from analyst estimates, you get an adjusted tax rate of 35%. This is made up of a current tax rate of negative 12% and deferred taxes of 47%. This atypical distribution current deferred taxes was driven by a change in our estimate for a full year taxable income. The cumulative impact of this change was recorded in the third quarter. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we would expect our overall tax rate to range between 30% and 35%, with essentially the entire amount being deferred. Going to the bottom line, non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations totaled $640 million or $1.54 per diluted share. Strong liquids production and pricing, coupled with our reduced share count drove our adjusted earnings from continuing operations up by 18% per diluted share over the year-ago quarter. As John mentioned earlier, this result exceeded the first call mean by $0.09. 
As most of you are aware, in May of last year, we commenced a program to repurchase $3.5 billion of our common stock. As of today, we have repurchased $3.4 billion and we expect to conclude the buyback program in the fourth quarter. 
We have a history of buying back shares when we believe it is the best use of our capital. Since 2004, we have repurchased 114 million shares, reducing our outstandings by approximately 20%. 
In conjunction with finalizing our 2012 capital plans, we will determine what role, if any additional share repurchases will play in our 2012 capital allocation. 
I would like to conclude with a quick review of our financial position. In the third quarter, cash flow before balance sheet changes totaled $1.9 billion. On a per-share basis, cash flow from continuing operations increased 26% over the third quarter of 2010. During the quarter, we comfortably funded all of our capital demands and returned nearly $800 million to our shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and dividend payments. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of over $6.8 billion and a net debt to cap ratio of 10%. 
As we have discussed in previous calls, we currently have more than $6.6 billion of cash and short-term investments outside the United States. If a more favorable tax situation develops for the repatriation of these funds or if we deploy the proceeds into Canada, we can reduce our tax expense by up to $900 million. Until we have better visibility into these opportunities, we plan to keep this cash outside the U.S. 
Given our short-term borrowing rates of less than 30 basis points, it is certainly worth our time to be patient and observe how opportunities, including the repatriation legislation of all. Regardless of where our cash balances reside, we clearly possess a great deal of financial strength from flexibility. At this point, I will turn the call back over to John."

But what we're doing here Brian with the -- with our joint venture as something we've not typically done, we wouldn't be. It doesn't make sense to us to take a development project, for example, and joint venture it because we have pretty low cost of capital. But we're doing this for different reasons. We have some acreage positions that are clearly exploratory in nature. And as we said bringing in a partner to try to diversify some of that risk and at the same time improve our capital efficiency in the future just seems to make a lot of sense for us. So there are a lot of reasons for us to be doing this. If you kind of look at it, we're looking at these five new venture plays and if you think about where we had in the Exploration business drilling wells, it's like five couple of hundred million dollars or more exploratory wells and we would always brought a partner in, not for the cash flow management as much as for the risk diversification given the Exxon's of the world tend to do that. So that's the rationale behind the exploring of this joint venture. Maybe I can have Dave address the question on some of these land positions."

We have been conducting the data room and as John said in his comments, prepared comments, we've had outstanding interest from the companies who have reviewed our acreage position. So we feel there's whether we like it, there's a lot of independent confirmation from other people out there that we have a great acreage position. Having said that, it is possible that with good results on or continuing good results on some of these, we may incrementally add some acreage on some of these plays, but that's really only going to be driven by the well results that we see.

266510,127127540,183166,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2011",2011-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter of 2011 was our first full quarter following the completion of our repositioning. As a company focused entirely on North America, Devon delivered a very solid third quarter performance. Let m",1087,"Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter of 2011 was our first full quarter following the completion of our repositioning. As a company focused entirely on North America, Devon delivered a very solid third quarter performance. Let me begin by highlighting some of our results. 
Our third quarter adjusted net earnings from continuing operations of $1.54 per diluted share increased 18% over the year-ago quarter and exceeded the first call mean by $0.09. Our cash flow from continuing operations of $4.19 per diluted share increased 26% over the year-ago quarter and surpassed the first call mean by more than 20%. For the third quarter, we increased North American onshore production 8% over the year-ago quarter, driven by a 17% increase in oil and natural gas liquids production. With strong growth in liquids production and a focus on controlling costs, Devon's pretax cash margin increased to more than $26 per barrel equivalent in the quarter. Also during the third quarter, we repurchased 10.8 million shares for $697 million, remaining on track to complete our $3.5 billion stock repurchase program by year end. And with $6.8 billion in cash and a net debt-to-cap ratio of 10%, our balance sheet remains in terrific shape. 
In addition to the development drilling that's driving our current production growth, we're continuing to actively evaluate the oil and liquids potential on our 1.2 million net acres in 5 high potential new venture plays. This includes our positions in the Tuscaloosa, the Mississippian, the Niobrara, the Ohio Utica and the Michigan Basin. Our 40-well program across those 5 plays is well underway. We have drilled our first wells in each of the plays and have additional wells in various stages of completion. While it's still early on, we've been very encouraged with our results as well as those from industry peers near some of our positions. 
To improve the risk/reward profile of these new venture plays, we've been conducting a data room process to bring in a partner. We're clearly not pursuing this because we need the money. Given the strength of our balance sheet, we could easily pursue all of these opportunities simultaneously, with 100% ownership. However, we see many advantages to bringing in an exploration partner. 
First, the joint venture could improve our capital efficiency, both by recovering the costs associated with establishing the acreage positions and by providing a reduction of our capital requirements in the future. 
Second, the joint venture would allow us to accelerate the derisking and commercialization of these new venture positions. 
And third, the joint venture could allow us the opportunity to seek exposure in more new play types with less risk. So a joint venture presents us with the opportunity for accelerated commercialization, improved capital efficiency and risk mitigation. 
Given that we're currently engaged in this data room process and still adding to our positions, we're not going to report specific well results in our new venture activities today. However, I can tell you that the indications of interest we have seen from potential partners have been very strong. 
Now before I turn the call over to Dave, I would like to address the subject of a number of recent questions concerning our capital outlook for next year. Although we're still in the process of finalizing our 2012 capital budget, our philosophy remains steadfast: We remain fully committed to optimizing value by maximizing growth on a per-share basis adjusted for debt. In order to achieve that goal, we remain keenly focused on exercising capital discipline, maximizing our full cycle returns and maintaining a high degree of financial strength and flexibility. Based on this philosophy, we will not compromise our per-share results for top line growth by funding projects with low rates of return. Instead, we will strive to optimize the allocation of capital among our alternatives of investing in our oil and liquids-rich opportunity base, capturing additional resource and repurchasing our shares. Of course, the relative attractiveness of these various options changes with movements on Devon's stock price, our borrowing costs and our outlook for commodity prices and industry costs. 
Since we've not finalized our 2012 E&P capital budget, I cannot provide specific capital guidance. However, I will provide some directional comments. In 2012, we expect to implement a drilling program with activity levels similar to 2011. Our focus in 2012 will be on developing the high-margin oil and liquids opportunities in our existing portfolio and accelerating the evaluation of the many new plays that we have captured. 
Our preliminary 2012 capital budget does not contemplate a repeat of the roughly $700 million of acreage acquisitions that we are making in 2011. And therefore, in total, we expect our capital outlay in 2012 to be less than 2011. 
The majority of our 2012 capital will be focused on core development projects. In Canada, we expect to begin construction on the third 35,000-barrel per day phase of Jackfish in the first quarter of 2012. In the Barnett and Cana, we will continue the aggressive development of our inventory of thousands of undrilled locations in the liquids-rich portions. Furthermore, in 2012, we'll be expanding our gas processing plants in each of these plays to keep pace with our growth and capture additional value. In the Permian, we will continue investing in our reliable development plays, including the Wolfberry, the Delaware and the Bone Spring. And in addition to investing in these low-risk development plays, we will continue to actively evaluate our acreage positions established through our greenfields new ventures. These exploration plays, coupled with the emerging plays that we're just beginning to evaluate in the Permian and in Western Canada, hold tremendous future potential for Devon. 
We strongly believe that the Devon's stock creates a differentiating opportunity for investors in the E&P space. Our deep and diverse inventory of oil and liquids-rich opportunities provides us with great flexibility in allocating capital based on market conditions. Our superior financial strength allows us to consistently invest in our business based on our long-term outlook regardless of the near term macro economic backdrop. We remain intently focused on optimizing margins and continuing to position ourselves as a low-cost producer. And finally, we maintain a disciplined approach of balancing resource development with resource capture to optimize the value of our entire portfolio. All of these factors position Devon to deliver competitive growth in cash flow and production per share. 
So at this point, I'll turn the call over to Dave Hager for a review of our quarterly operating highlights. Dave?"
266510,127127540,183166,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2011",2011-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I will begin with a quick recap of 2011 capital expenditures for our exploration and development activities.

I will begin with a quick recap of 2011 capital expenditures for our exploration and development activities. 
E&P spending was $1.6 billion for the third quarter, including $250 million of undeveloped acreage acquisitions. This brings our E&P capital through the first 9 months to $4.7 billion. We expect fourth quarter expenditures for exploration and development to be approximately $1.5 billion. While this would take us outside our guidance range for E&P spending, it is partially offset by our midstream capital, which should fall well below the midpoint of our guidance range. Consequently, we expect our total capital expenditures for 2011 to come in near the top end of our guidance range. 
Our 2011 E&P capital program is delivering outstanding results. Our cornerstone development areas including the Barnett, Cana, the Permian and Jackfish are all performing very well. We also continue to move forward with evaluating and derisking the upside potential in our various emerging and new venture plays. 
So let's take a closer look at some of the third quarter highlights in these areas. 
Starting with our thermal oil projects in Eastern Alberta. Jackfish continues to deliver industry-leading performance. During the third quarter, Jackfish 1 production averaged 32,000 barrels per day, net of royalties, and continued its trend of excellent plant reliability and efficiency. 
At Jackfish 2, we continue to be very pleased with the ramp up of production. In the third quarter, our net production averaged 4,000 barrels per day. And in October, it averaged almost 9,000 barrels per day, exceeding planned volumes. 
Review of our regulatory application for Jackfish 3 is nearing completion. Pending approval, we will begin construction in the first quarter of next year, with plant start-up targeted for late 2014. Devon operates all 3 Jackfish projects and owns 100% working interest in each. 
At our Pike joint venture, our 2011, 2012 winter drilling and seismic program will begin later this month. We plan to drill roughly 140 stratigraphic wells and shoot approximately 50 square miles of seismic this winter. The program will focus on confirming the resource potential for a third 35,000-barrel per day project in the Pike 1 Complex. This will bring the identified resource at Pike up to roughly 900 million barrels gross, which translates to gross production potential of over 100,000 barrels per day. Devon operates Pike and owns a 50% working interest. Ultimately, we believe the Pike acreage can support the equivalent of 4 or 5 Jackfish-sized projects. In aggregate, between Jackfish and Pike, we expect to drive our net thermal oil production to between 150,000 and 175,000 barrels per day by 2020.
Moving now to the Permian basin. We currently have 19 operated rigs pursuing targets in numerous play types across the basin. Our third quarter Permian oil and liquids production increased 17% over the year-ago quarter. In total, our Permian production averaged 50,000 equivalent barrels per day in the third quarter with 75% of that being oil and natural gas liquids. 
In our Wolfberry light oil play in the Permian, we currently have 4 operated rigs running as we continue the evaluation and development of our 160,000 net acres. Our net Wolfberry production climbed to a record 9,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter. 
While we are currently developing the Wolfberry on 40-acre spacing, we have a 20-acre infill pilot program underway. We brought our first 220-acre Wolfberry infill wells online during the third quarter with encouraging results. The remaining infill wells in the pilot program are currently drilling, as well as our first horizontal well in the Wolfberry development area. The additional potential represented by 20-acre well spacing and horizontal Wolfcamp wells in certain areas provide upside to our current inventory of more than 850 net risk Wolfberry locations. 
Moving to the Bone Springs oil play also in the Permian. We currently have 8 operated rigs running. We continue to see outstanding results from our horizontal program on both the New Mexico and Texas sides of the play. With average EURs ranging from 400,000 to 600,000 barrels equivalent and well cost between $5 million and $8 million, most of these wells are generating rates of return in excess of 50% based on the current strip pricing. 
In the third quarter, we completed 11 Bone Springs wells with 30-day average IP rates of 540 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Production from our Bone Springs horizontal program has increased 300% to almost 5,000 equivalent barrels per day since the beginning of the year. 
Elsewhere in the Permian, we continue to run 2 rigs, targeting the conventional Delaware oil formation. We drilled 7 wells and completed 4 of them during the third quarter. The 30-day IP rates for the completed wells averaged nearly 400 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Like the Bone Springs, these wells offer outstanding returns based on strip pricing. We have approximately 125 net risk locations remaining in the Delaware. 
Also in the Permian, we increased our Wolfcamp Shale oil position in the Midland Basin during the quarter, to approximately 92,000 net acres. We brought our first horizontal wells online during the quarter and are very pleased with the results. Much of our acreage is located in the area where current industry activity is concentrated, and our initial results indicate that this acreage is commercially viable. We plan to drill 8 Wolfcamp Shale wells this year, with 6 or 7 completed and online by year end. 
Moving north to the Texas Panhandle in the Granite Wash play, we continue to see solid results from our Cherokee and Granite Wash oil wells. We brought 10 operated Granite Wash wells online during the third quarter. The 30-day IP rates from these wells averaged over 1,250 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 180 barrels of oil and 405 barrels of natural gas liquids per day. 
We were also drilling our first wells in the area to test the Atoka Wash and Caldwell zones, which provide upside to our Granite Wash position. 
Moving now to the Cana Woodford Shale in Western Oklahoma. Reconstruction of our Cana gas processing plant is now complete. We began processing gas in late October and are currently running about 138 million cubic feet per day through the facility. Ramp-up will continue over the next several weeks as we expect to reach the plant's [indiscernible] capacity of 200 million a day in September. 
We have also started work on a planned expansion at Cana. This will increase the capacity of the Cana plant to 350 million a day with liquids extraction capacity of more than 30,000 barrels per day. The expansion allows us to keep pace with our growing Cana Woodford Shale volumes and roughly doubles our liquids extraction capacity in Cana. We expect the increase in capacity to be operational in the fourth quarter of next year. 
On the drilling front, we ended the quarter -- the third quarter with 17 operated rigs running in the Cana, 6 rigs fewer than in the previous quarter. We have achieved drilling efficiencies that allow us to now maintain the pace of our Cana program with fewer rigs. Accordingly, we made the decision in third quarter to release 2 rigs. In addition, while awaiting the recommissioning of our Cana plant, we elected to sublease 4 additional rigs to another company for the remainder of the year. With the Cana plant coming back online, we are confident in achieving our year-end exit rate target of 275 million cubic feet equivalent per day, net to Devon's interest. 
In spite of the planned operation or interruption, excuse me, our third quarter net Cana production increased 6% over the second quarter to a record 200 million cubic feet equivalent per day including more than 8,100 barrels per day of liquids.
Shifting to the Barnett Shale field in North Texas. We currently have 12 operated rigs running. In the third quarter, we brought 77 Barnett wells online. We are continuing to see outstanding results from our Barnett program in the liquids-rich portion of the play. Our net Barnett  production increased to a record 1.3 Bcf equivalent per day, including 46,000 barrels per day of liquids. 
Upon completion of our Bridgeport planned expansion in the first quarter of 2013, we would expect to see our net volumes climb to an all-time record of more than 1.4 Bcf equivalent per day with our current 12-rig program. 
On the exploration front, in addition to the progress that John mentioned in the other new ventures plays, we continue to evaluate the potential of our position in a number of plays emerging in our historical areas of operations. In Canada, our exploration efforts are ongoing as we target oil and liquids-rich opportunities across our more than 4 million net acres. In aggregate, we completed 19 exploration wells and tied 10 of them into production in the third quarter. 
The best results we saw were in the Cardium. In the third quarter, we brought 3 Cardium oil wells online in the Ferrier Area of Central Alberta. Average 30-day IP rates from these wells were 770 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We are currently completing 2 additional wells in the area. 
Another encouraging result from our third quarter exploration program in Canada came from our Viking light oil play at Saskatchewan. We completed 4 wells in the third quarter with 30-day IP rates of up to 70 barrels per day. These are shallow wells, and we would anticipate cost of roughly $1 million per well in the development phase of this play. While we're still working to optimize our drilling and completion approach, we are encouraged by these early results. I'll remind you that we own 100% of the surface and minerals in a very large acreage position with more than 1,000 potential drilling locations. 
Also in Canada, we brought 2 Slave point oil wells on in the Swan Hills area, with average 30-day IPs of 300 barrels per day. We have an inventory of more than 160 undrilled Slave Point locations and plan to drill 3 additional wells in the fourth quarter. Of the 10 exploration wells brought online in Canada during the quarter, 9 were successful. So while it's still very early in the process, we are excited about the results we have seen. 
In summary, all of our key development projects are delivering excellent results and we continue to take important steps in evaluating a deep inventory of exploration opportunities across our portfolio. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff Agosta for the financial review and outlook. Jeff?"

This morning, I will take you through a brief review of the key drivers that shaped our strong third quarter financial results. I plan to limit my comments to items that require additional commentary or outside our forecasted guidance range. 
The first item I would like to cover is our production. In the third quarter, we produced 60.8 million oil equivalent barrels or approximately 661,000 equivalent barrels per day. This result was just above the midpoint of the forecast we provided on our second quarter call. And as John said, it represents an 8% increase in production over the year-ago quarter. 
On the liquids side of the business, we again delivered robust growth. For the quarter, our oil and natural gas liquids production increased by 17% over the third quarter of 2010 to an average of 226,000 barrels per day. Strong year-over-year oil growth from the Permian Basin and Jackfish, combined with liquids growth in the Cana and Barnett, drove this impressive performance. 
Looking to the remainder of the year, we remain on track to deliver full year production of 238  to 240 million equivalent barrels. When compared to our North American onshore production in 2010, this represents top line production growth of about 7% to 8%, driven by liquids growth in the high teens. With the Cana plant starting back up, we expect Q4 production to increase to a range of 665,000 to 675,000 BOE per day. 
Given our growth in oil and natural gas liquids production and the current weakness in natural gas prices, nearly 60% of our third quarter upstream sales revenue came from liquids. 
Regional oil prices remained strong during the quarter, and petrochemical demand pushed NGL realizations higher. Our E&P revenues were again supplemented by cash settlements from our attractively priced hedges. In total, cash settlements increased revenues by $96 million in the third quarter and boosted our company-wide price realizations by $1.58 per BOE. 
Not only were our upstream revenues strong, but our marketing and midstream operations made another strong contribution. We generated $138 million of operating profit in the third quarter, which represents an 11% increase over the third quarter of 2010. To put this into perspective, our marketing and midstream operating profit enhanced our company-wide margins by $2.27 per BOE. Based on our results for the first 9 months, we expect full year 2011 operating profit to be in the top half of our guidance range of $515 million to $545 million. 
Shifting to expenses. In the third quarter, we were successful in partially mitigating the impact of industry inflation. Expenses in most categories showed a moderate increase, but were generally in line with our expectations. In aggregate, our pretax cash costs totaled only $13.56 per barrel for the quarter or about 2% higher than last quarter. This continues to give us a very competitive cost structure within the industry. We remain well positioned as a low-cost producer and expect to continue to generate full cycle margins that are among the best in our peer group. 
Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, we remain comfortable with the expense forecast provided in our August 8-K. One noteworthy item for those of you who model our results, is that fourth quarter G&A expense will include approximately $20 million of noncash expense due to the issuance of annual equity compensation. Including this noncash expense, we expect fourth quarter G&A expenses to range between $170 million and $180 million. 
Looking briefly at income taxes. For the third quarter, we reported income tax expense from continuing operations of $498 million or 32% of pretax income. After backing out the impact of special items typically excluded from analyst estimates, you get an adjusted tax rate of 35%. This is made up of a current tax rate of negative 12% and deferred taxes of 47%. This atypical distribution of current and deferred taxes was driven by a change in our estimate for a full year taxable income. The cumulative impact of this change was recorded in the third quarter. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we would expect our overall tax rate to range between 30% and 35%, with essentially the entire amount being deferred. 
Going to the bottom line. Non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations totaled $640 million or $1.54 per diluted share. Strong liquids production and pricing, coupled with our reduced share count, drove our adjusted earnings from continuing operations up by 18% per diluted share over the year-ago quarter. As John mentioned earlier, this result exceeded the first call mean by $0.09. 
As most of you are aware, in May of last year, we commenced a program to repurchase $3.5 billion of our common stock. As of today, we have repurchased $3.4 billion, and we expect to conclude the buyback program in the fourth quarter. 
We have a history of buying back shares when we believe it is the best use of our capital. Since 2004, we have repurchased 114 million shares, reducing our outstandings by approximately 20%. 
In conjunction with finalizing our 2012 capital plans, we will determine what role, if any, additional share repurchases will play in our 2012 capital allocation. 
I would like to conclude with a quick review of our financial position. In the third quarter, cash flow before balance sheet changes totaled $1.9 billion. On a per-share basis, cash flow from continuing operations increased 26% over the third quarter of 2010. During the quarter, we comfortably funded all of our capital demands and returned nearly $800 million to our shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and dividend payments. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of over $6.8 billion and a net debt-to-cap ratio of 10%. 
As we have discussed in previous calls, we currently have more than $6.6 billion of cash and short-term investments outside the United States. If a more favorable tax situation develops for the repatriation of these funds or if we deploy the proceeds into Canada, we can reduce our tax expense by up to $900 million. Until we have better visibility into these opportunities, we plan to keep this cash outside the U.S. 
Given our short-term borrowing rates of less than 30 basis points, it is certainly worth our time to be patient and observe how opportunities, including the repatriation legislation, evolve. Regardless of where our cash balances reside, we clearly possess a great deal of financial strength and flexibility. 
At this point, I will turn the call back over to John."

But what we're doing here, Brian, with the -- with our joint venture -- as you know, it's something we've not typically done and we wouldn't be -- it doesn't make sense to us to take a development project, for example, and joint venture it because we have pretty low cost of capital. But we're doing this for different reasons. We have some acreage positions that are clearly exploratory in nature. And as we said, bringing in a partner to try to diversify some of that risk and at the same time improve our capital efficiency in the future just seems to make a lot of sense for us. So there are a lot of reasons for us to be doing this. The way I kind of look at it, if you look at these 5 new venture plays and you think about when we're in the exploration business drilling wells, it's like 5 couple of hundred million dollar or more exploratory wells and we would always brought a partner in, not for the cash flow management as much as for the risk diversification. And thankfully, even the Exxons of the world tend to do that. So that's the rationale behind the exploring of this joint venture.

But more specifically on the acreage, we're very, very happy with the acreage position we have. We have been conducting the data room and as John said in his comments -- prepared comments, we've had outstanding interest from the companies who have reviewed our acreage position, so we feel there's -- not only do we like it, there's a lot of independent confirmation from other people out there that we have a great acreage position. Having said that, it is possible that with good results on or continuing good results on some of these, we may incrementally add some acreage on some of these plays. But that's really only going to be driven by the well results that we see. That's one of the reasons we don't want to go into too much detail on what we're seeing right now because there is some acreage available in some of these plays and we'll be driven by the success of the plays.

But -- and again David, I'll say that one of our objectives here -- and this is a little bit different joint venture. Most of the joint ventures that you've seen in the business so far have been play-specific. This is one that covers a lot of different plays and has some unique characteristics from that point of view because it does align both parties with pursuing the ones that make the most sense. We may find that some, as we develop them, we want to sell and put that money into other opportunities within that joint venture and would be very well aligned with our joint venture and would be very well aligned with our joint partner on that. So I think there's a lot of flexibility. It's early stages in terms of what the exactly a deal like that would like, but it gives us a lot of flexibility to develop these opportunities on a fairly accelerated basis."

So we certainly compare their rates of return in Cana to those in Permian and those in Canada so we have a good understanding and make sure we're putting capital in the right places. The Cana, the returns do vary somewhat. I'd say particularly the core of Cana where we're currently even conducting the downspacing pilot project, a series of those, those liquids-rich returns are extremely strong. And we're still booked at 5 wells per section in the core of Cana and we see the opportunities of downspacing, we could go to 8 to 10 wells per section. And we frankly want to drill it on one well per section right now in most areas, so we have a lot of liquids-rich opportunities remaining in Cana. Some of the areas do get somewhat leaner. And as you would expect, as you get leaner, then the returns diminish somewhat, but we're careful that we're concentrating our capital in the highest return parts of the plays that complete on a portfolio-wide basis."

The third quarter of 2011 was our first full quarter following the completion of our repositioning. As a company focused entirely on North America, Devon delivered a very solid third quarter performance. Let me begin by highlighting some of our results. 
Our third quarter adjusted net earnings from continuing operations of $1.54 per diluted share increased 18% over the year-ago quarter and exceeded the first call mean by $0.09. Our cash flow from continuing operations of $4.19 per diluted share increased 26% over the year-ago quarter and surpassed the first call mean by more than 20%. For the third quarter, we increased North American onshore production 8% over the year-ago quarter, driven by a 17% increase in oil and natural gas liquids production. With strong growth in liquids production and a focus on controlling costs, Devon's pretax cash margin increased to more than $26 per barrel equivalent in the quarter. Also during the third quarter, we repurchased 10.8 million shares for $697 million, remaining on track to complete our $3.5 billion stock repurchase program by year end. And with $6.8 billion in cash and a net debt-to-cap ratio of 10%, our balance sheet remains in terrific shape. 
In addition to the development drilling that's driving our current production growth, we're continuing to actively evaluate the oil and liquids potential on our 1.2 million net acres in 5 high potential new venture plays. This includes our positions in the Tuscaloosa, the Mississippian, the Niobrara, the Ohio Utica and the Michigan Basin. Our 40-well program across those 5 plays is well underway. We have drilled our first wells in each of the plays and have additional wells in various stages of completion. While it's still early on, we've been very encouraged with our results as well as those from industry peers near some of our positions. 
To improve the risk/reward profile of these new venture plays, we've been conducting a data room process to bring in a partner. We're clearly not pursuing this because we need the money. Given the strength of our balance sheet, we could easily pursue all of these opportunities simultaneously, with 100% ownership. However, we see many advantages to bringing in an exploration partner. 
First, the joint venture could improve our capital efficiency, both by recovering the costs associated with establishing the acreage positions and by providing a reduction of our capital requirements in the future. 
Second, the joint venture would allow us to accelerate the derisking and commercialization of these new venture positions. 
And third, the joint venture could allow us the opportunity to seek exposure in more new play types with less risk. So a joint venture presents us with the opportunity for accelerated commercialization, improved capital efficiency and risk mitigation. 
Given that we're currently engaged in this data room process and still adding to our positions, we're not going to report specific well results in our new venture activities today. However, I can tell you that the indications of interest we have seen from potential partners have been very strong. 
Now before I turn the call over to Dave, I would like to address the subject of a number of recent questions concerning our capital outlook for next year. Although we're still in the process of finalizing our 2012 capital budget, our philosophy remains steadfast: We remain fully committed to optimizing value by maximizing growth on a per-share basis adjusted for debt. In order to achieve that goal, we remain keenly focused on exercising capital discipline, maximizing our full cycle returns and maintaining a high degree of financial strength and flexibility. Based on this philosophy, we will not compromise our per-share results for top line growth by funding projects with low rates of return. Instead, we will strive to optimize the allocation of capital among our alternatives of investing in our oil and liquids-rich opportunity base, capturing additional resource and repurchasing our shares. Of course, the relative attractiveness of these various options changes with movements on Devon's stock price, our borrowing costs and our outlook for commodity prices and industry costs. 
Since we've not finalized our 2012 E&P capital budget, I cannot provide specific capital guidance. However, I will provide some directional comments. In 2012, we expect to implement a drilling program with activity levels similar to 2011. Our focus in 2012 will be on developing the high-margin oil and liquids opportunities in our existing portfolio and accelerating the evaluation of the many new plays that we have captured. 
Our preliminary 2012 capital budget does not contemplate a repeat of the roughly $700 million of acreage acquisitions that we are making in 2011. And therefore, in total, we expect our capital outlay in 2012 to be less than 2011. 
The majority of our 2012 capital will be focused on core development projects. In Canada, we expect to begin construction on the third 35,000-barrel per day phase of Jackfish in the first quarter of 2012. In the Barnett and Cana, we will continue the aggressive development of our inventory of thousands of undrilled locations in the liquids-rich portions. Furthermore, in 2012, we'll be expanding our gas processing plants in each of these plays to keep pace with our growth and capture additional value. In the Permian, we will continue investing in our reliable development plays, including the Wolfberry, the Delaware and the Bone Spring. And in addition to investing in these low-risk development plays, we will continue to actively evaluate our acreage positions established through our greenfields new ventures. These exploration plays, coupled with the emerging plays that we're just beginning to evaluate in the Permian and in Western Canada, hold tremendous future potential for Devon. 
We strongly believe that the Devon's stock creates a differentiating opportunity for investors in the E&P space. Our deep and diverse inventory of oil and liquids-rich opportunities provides us with great flexibility in allocating capital based on market conditions. Our superior financial strength allows us to consistently invest in our business based on our long-term outlook regardless of the near term macro economic backdrop. We remain intently focused on optimizing margins and continuing to position ourselves as a low-cost producer. And finally, we maintain a disciplined approach of balancing resource development with resource capture to optimize the value of our entire portfolio. All of these factors position Devon to deliver competitive growth in cash flow and production per share. 
So at this point, I'll turn the call over to Dave Hager for a review of our quarterly operating highlights. Dave?"

I will begin with a quick recap of 2011 capital expenditures for our exploration and development activities.

I will begin with a quick recap of 2011 capital expenditures for our exploration and development activities. 
E&P spending was $1.6 billion for the third quarter, including $250 million of undeveloped acreage acquisitions. This brings our E&P capital through the first 9 months to $4.7 billion. We expect fourth quarter expenditures for exploration and development to be approximately $1.5 billion. While this would take us outside our guidance range for E&P spending, it is partially offset by our midstream capital, which should fall well below the midpoint of our guidance range. Consequently, we expect our total capital expenditures for 2011 to come in near the top end of our guidance range. 
Our 2011 E&P capital program is delivering outstanding results. Our cornerstone development areas including the Barnett, Cana, the Permian and Jackfish are all performing very well. We also continue to move forward with evaluating and derisking the upside potential in our various emerging and new venture plays. 
So let's take a closer look at some of the third quarter highlights in these areas. 
Starting with our thermal oil projects in Eastern Alberta. Jackfish continues to deliver industry-leading performance. During the third quarter, Jackfish 1 production averaged 32,000 barrels per day, net of royalties, and continued its trend of excellent plant reliability and efficiency. 
At Jackfish 2, we continue to be very pleased with the ramp up of production. In the third quarter, our net production averaged 4,000 barrels per day. And in October, it averaged almost 9,000 barrels per day, exceeding planned volumes. 
Review of our regulatory application for Jackfish 3 is nearing completion. Pending approval, we will begin construction in the first quarter of next year, with plant start-up targeted for late 2014. Devon operates all 3 Jackfish projects and owns 100% working interest in each. 
At our Pike joint venture, our 2011, 2012 winter drilling and seismic program will begin later this month. We plan to drill roughly 140 stratigraphic wells and shoot approximately 50 square miles of seismic this winter. The program will focus on confirming the resource potential for a third 35,000-barrel per day project in the Pike 1 Complex. This will bring the identified resource at Pike up to roughly 900 million barrels gross, which translates to gross production potential of over 100,000 barrels per day. Devon operates Pike and owns a 50% working interest. Ultimately, we believe the Pike acreage can support the equivalent of 4 or 5 Jackfish-sized projects. In aggregate, between Jackfish and Pike, we expect to drive our net thermal oil production to between 150,000 and 175,000 barrels per day by 2020.
Moving now to the Permian basin. We currently have 19 operated rigs pursuing targets in numerous play types across the basin. Our third quarter Permian oil and liquids production increased 17% over the year-ago quarter. In total, our Permian production averaged 50,000 equivalent barrels per day in the third quarter with 75% of that being oil and natural gas liquids. 
In our Wolfberry light oil play in the Permian, we currently have 4 operated rigs running as we continue the evaluation and development of our 160,000 net acres. Our net Wolfberry production climbed to a record 9,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter. 
While we are currently developing the Wolfberry on 40-acre spacing, we have a 20-acre infill pilot program underway. We brought our first 220-acre Wolfberry infill wells online during the third quarter with encouraging results. The remaining infill wells in the pilot program are currently drilling, as well as our first horizontal well in the Wolfberry development area. The additional potential represented by 20-acre well spacing and horizontal Wolfcamp wells in certain areas provide upside to our current inventory of more than 850 net risk Wolfberry locations. 
Moving to the Bone Springs oil play also in the Permian. We currently have 8 operated rigs running. We continue to see outstanding results from our horizontal program on both the New Mexico and Texas sides of the play. With average EURs ranging from 400,000 to 600,000 barrels equivalent and well cost between $5 million and $8 million, most of these wells are generating rates of return in excess of 50% based on the current strip pricing. 
In the third quarter, we completed 11 Bone Springs wells with 30-day average IP rates of 540 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Production from our Bone Springs horizontal program has increased 300% to almost 5,000 equivalent barrels per day since the beginning of the year. 
Elsewhere in the Permian, we continue to run 2 rigs, targeting the conventional Delaware oil formation. We drilled 7 wells and completed 4 of them during the third quarter. The 30-day IP rates for the completed wells averaged nearly 400 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Like the Bone Springs, these wells offer outstanding returns based on strip pricing. We have approximately 125 net risk locations remaining in the Delaware. 
Also in the Permian, we increased our Wolfcamp Shale oil position in the Midland Basin during the quarter, to approximately 92,000 net acres. We brought our first horizontal wells online during the quarter and are very pleased with the results. Much of our acreage is located in the area where current industry activity is concentrated, and our initial results indicate that this acreage is commercially viable. We plan to drill 8 Wolfcamp Shale wells this year, with 6 or 7 completed and online by year end. 
Moving north to the Texas Panhandle in the Granite Wash play, we continue to see solid results from our Cherokee and Granite Wash A wells. We brought 10 operated Granite Wash wells online during the third quarter. The 30-day IP rates from these wells averaged over 1,250 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 180 barrels of oil and 405 barrels of natural gas liquids per day. 
We were also drilling our first wells in the area to test the Atoka Wash and Caldwell zones, which provide upside to our Granite Wash position. 
Moving now to the Cana Woodford Shale in Western Oklahoma. Reconstruction of our Cana gas processing plant is now complete. We began processing gas in late October and are currently running about 138 million cubic feet per day through the facility. Ramp-up will continue over the next several weeks as we expect to reach the plant's inlet capacity of 200 million a day in September. 
We have also started work on a planned expansion at Cana. This will increase the capacity of the Cana plant to 350 million a day with liquids extraction capacity of more than 30,000 barrels per day. The expansion allows us to keep pace with our growing Cana Woodford Shale volumes and roughly doubles our liquids extraction capacity in Cana. We expect the increase in capacity to be operational in the fourth quarter of next year. 
On the drilling front, we ended the quarter -- the third quarter with 17 operated rigs running in the Cana, 6 rigs fewer than in the previous quarter. We have achieved drilling efficiencies that allow us to now maintain the pace of our Cana program with fewer rigs. Accordingly, we made the decision in third quarter to release 2 rigs. In addition, while awaiting the recommissioning of our Cana plant, we elected to sublease 4 additional rigs to another company for the remainder of the year. With the Cana plant coming back online, we are confident in achieving our year-end exit rate target of 275 million cubic feet equivalent per day, net to Devon's interest. 
In spite of the planned operation -- or interruption, excuse me, our third quarter net Cana production increased 6% over the second quarter to a record 200 million cubic feet equivalent per day including more than 8,100 barrels per day of liquids.
Shifting to the Barnett Shale field in North Texas. We currently have 12 operated rigs running. In the third quarter, we brought 77 Barnett wells online. We are continuing to see outstanding results from our Barnett program in the liquids-rich portion of the play. Our net Barnett production increased to a record 1.3 Bcf equivalent per day, including 46,000 barrels per day of liquids. 
Upon completion of our Bridgeport planned expansion in the first quarter of 2013, we would expect to see our net volumes climb to an all-time record of more than 1.4 Bcf equivalent per day with our current 12-rig program. 
On the exploration front, in addition to the progress that John mentioned in the other new ventures plays, we continue to evaluate the potential of our position in a number of plays emerging in our historical areas of operations. In Canada, our exploration efforts are ongoing as we target oil and liquids-rich opportunities across our more than 4 million net acres. In aggregate, we completed 19 exploration wells and tied 10 of them into production in the third quarter. 
The best results we saw were in the Cardium. In the third quarter, we brought 3 Cardium oil wells online in the Ferrier Area of Central Alberta. Average 30-day IP rates from these wells were 770 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We are currently completing 2 additional wells in the area. 
Another encouraging result from our third quarter exploration program in Canada came from our Viking light oil play at Saskatchewan. We completed 4 wells in the third quarter with 30-day IP rates of up to 70 barrels per day. These are shallow wells, and we would anticipate cost of roughly $1 million per well in the development phase of this play. While we're still working to optimize our drilling and completion approach, we are encouraged by these early results. I'll remind you that we own 100% of the surface and minerals in a very large acreage position with more than 1,000 potential drilling locations. 
Also in Canada, we brought 2 Slave Point oil wells on in the Swan Hills area, with average 30-day IPs of 300 barrels per day. We have an inventory of more than 160 undrilled Slave Point locations and plan to drill 3 additional wells in the fourth quarter. Of the 10 exploration wells brought online in Canada during the quarter, 9 were successful. So while it's still very early in the process, we are excited about the results we have seen. 
In summary, all of our key development projects are delivering excellent results and we continue to take important steps in evaluating a deep inventory of exploration opportunities across our portfolio. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff Agosta for the financial review and outlook. Jeff?"

This morning, I will take you through a brief review of the key drivers that shaped our strong third quarter financial results. I plan to limit my comments to items that require additional commentary or outside",1087,"Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will take you through a brief review of the key drivers that shaped our strong third quarter financial results. I plan to limit my comments to items that require additional commentary or outside our forecasted guidance range. 
The first item I would like to cover is our production. In the third quarter, we produced 60.8 million oil equivalent barrels or approximately 661,000 equivalent barrels per day. This result was just above the midpoint of the forecast we provided on our second quarter call. And as John said, it represents an 8% increase in production over the year-ago quarter. 
On the liquids side of the business, we again delivered robust growth. For the quarter, our oil and natural gas liquids production increased by 17% over the third quarter of 2010 to an average of 226,000 barrels per day. Strong year-over-year oil growth from the Permian Basin and Jackfish, combined with liquids growth in the Cana and Barnett, drove this impressive performance. 
Looking to the remainder of the year, we remain on track to deliver full year production of 238  to 240 million equivalent barrels. When compared to our North American onshore production in 2010, this represents top line production growth of about 7% to 8%, driven by liquids growth in the high teens. With the Cana plant starting back up, we expect Q4 production to increase to a range of 665,000 to 675,000 BOE per day. 
Given our growth in oil and natural gas liquids production and the current weakness in natural gas prices, nearly 60% of our third quarter upstream sales revenue came from liquids. 
Regional oil prices remained strong during the quarter, and petrochemical demand pushed NGL realizations higher. Our E&P revenues were again supplemented by cash settlements from our attractively priced hedges. In total, cash settlements increased revenues by $96 million in the third quarter and boosted our company-wide price realizations by $1.58 per BOE. 
Not only were our upstream revenues strong, but our marketing and midstream operations made another strong contribution. We generated $138 million of operating profit in the third quarter, which represents an 11% increase over the third quarter of 2010. To put this into perspective, our marketing and midstream operating profit enhanced our company-wide margins by $2.27 per BOE. Based on our results for the first 9 months, we expect full year 2011 operating profit to be in the top half of our guidance range of $515 million to $545 million. 
Shifting to expenses. In the third quarter, we were successful in partially mitigating the impact of industry inflation. Expenses in most categories showed a moderate increase, but were generally in line with our expectations. In aggregate, our pretax cash costs totaled only $13.56 per barrel for the quarter or about 2% higher than last quarter. This continues to give us a very competitive cost structure within the industry. We remain well positioned as a low-cost producer and expect to continue to generate full cycle margins that are among the best in our peer group. 
Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, we remain comfortable with the expense forecast provided in our August 8-K. One noteworthy item for those of you who model our results, is that fourth quarter G&A expense will include approximately $20 million of noncash expense due to the issuance of annual equity compensation. Including this noncash expense, we expect fourth quarter G&A expenses to range between $170 million and $180 million. 
Looking briefly at income taxes. For the third quarter, we reported income tax expense from continuing operations of $498 million or 32% of pretax income. After backing out the impact of special items typically excluded from analyst estimates, you get an adjusted tax rate of 35%. This is made up of a current tax rate of negative 12% and deferred taxes of 47%. This atypical distribution of current and deferred taxes was driven by a change in our estimate for our full year taxable income. The cumulative impact of this change was recorded in the third quarter. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we would expect our overall tax rate to range between 30% and 35%, with essentially the entire amount being deferred. 
Going to the bottom line. Non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations totaled $640 million or $1.54 per diluted share. Strong liquids production and pricing, coupled with our reduced share count, drove our adjusted earnings from continuing operations up by 18% per diluted share over the year-ago quarter. As John mentioned earlier, this result exceeded the first call mean by $0.09. 
As most of you are aware, in May of last year, we commenced a program to repurchase $3.5 billion of our common stock. As of today, we have repurchased $3.4 billion, and we expect to conclude the buyback program in the fourth quarter. 
We have a history of buying back shares when we believe it is the best use of our capital. Since 2004, we have repurchased 114 million shares, reducing our outstandings by approximately 20%. 
In conjunction with finalizing our 2012 capital plans, we will determine what role, if any, additional share repurchases will play in our 2012 capital allocation. 
I would like to conclude with a quick review of our financial position. In the third quarter, cash flow before balance sheet changes totaled $1.9 billion. On a per-share basis, cash flow from continuing operations increased 26% over the third quarter of 2010. During the quarter, we comfortably funded all of our capital demands ,and returned nearly $800 million to our shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and dividend payments. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of over $6.8 billion and a net debt-to-cap ratio of 10%. 
As we have discussed in previous calls, we currently have more than $6.6 billion of cash and short-term investments outside the United States. If a more favorable tax situation develops for the repatriation of these funds or if we deploy the proceeds into Canada, we can reduce our tax expense by up to $900 million. Until we have better visibility into these opportunities, we plan to keep this cash outside the U.S. 
Given our short-term borrowing rates of less than 30 basis points, it is certainly worth our time to be patient and observe how opportunities, including the repatriation legislation, evolve. Regardless of where our cash balances reside, we clearly possess a great deal of financial strength and flexibility. 
At this point, I will turn the call back over to John."

But what we're doing here, Brian, with the -- with our joint venture -- as you know, it's something we've not typically done and we wouldn't be -- it doesn't make sense to us to take a development project, for example, and joint venture it because we have pretty low cost of capital. But we're doing this for different reasons. We have some acreage positions that are clearly exploratory in nature. And as we said, bringing in a partner to try to diversify some of that risk and at the same time improve our capital efficiency in the future just seems to make a lot of sense for us. So there are a lot of reasons for us to be doing this. The way I kind of look at it, if you look at these 5 new venture plays and you think about when we're in the exploration business drilling wells, it's like 5 couple of hundred million dollar or more exploratory wells and we would always brought a partner in, not for the cash flow management as much as for the risk diversification.

But more specifically on the acreage, we're very, very happy with the acreage position we have. We have been conducting the data room and as John said in his comments -- prepared comments, we've had outstanding interest from the companies who have reviewed our acreage position, so we feel there's -- not only do we like it, there's a lot of independent confirmation from other people out there that we have a great acreage position. Having said that, it is possible that with good results on or continuing good results on some of these, we may incrementally add some acreage on some of these plays. But that's really only going to be driven by the well results that we see. That's one of the reasons we don't want to go into too much detail on what we're seeing right now, because there is some acreage available in some of these plays and we'll be driven by the success of the plays.

But we continue to see price escalation, primarily on the service side of our business. Drilling rigs and other services have increased about 2% in the third quarter from the second quarter. Overall, we're going to probably see a 10% to 12% increase in cost this year. We expect that we're going to see some pressure on costs, primarily in the service sector as we go into 2012. The biggest areas where we've seen the biggest increase in service costs have been recently in the Permian. They continue to grow fairly rapidly in Canada. And then industry, I think, has seen some pretty strong service costs to South Texas, but Devon's not a big player in South Texas. But they have started winding down a little bit from where we saw in the first half of the year, but they're still increasing primarily in the simulation side in the drilling rigs."

But while we haven't finalized our budget, we'll probably see $200 million in plants, the 2 plants that I mentioned. We have about $75 million to $80 million of what I call maintaining capital that we spend every year on compression and things of that nature. So $305 million this year. My guess is that we're going to be north of $300 million next year, could be a little bit stronger than that depending on where we drill the wells, how much infrastructure is needed, whether we need CO2 removal facilities, additional compression, that type of thing."

Devon's position in the Permian and not unlike, quite frankly, a lot of the other industry participants is that most of that infrastructure is old infrastructure. And most of Devon's acreage with the exception of some of the new acreage that we've acquired there has been committed long term to other midstream parties, and so it really dependent upon them and industry as a whole to move product out of there. So Devon does not see that we're going to put a lot of capital in the Permian basin, although we'll put in some gathering systems. We'll put in some treating facilities. We'll put in some compression. But in terms of large capital expenses, in terms of processing plants or pipelines out of the area, say, down to the Gulf Coast, right now we don't see that, that's a space we'll be in."
