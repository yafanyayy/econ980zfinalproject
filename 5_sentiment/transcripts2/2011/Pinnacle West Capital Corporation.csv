I'd like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and webcast to review our fourth quarter earnings, recent developments and operating performance. Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Don Brandt; our CFO, Jim Hatfield; and Don Robinson, President and Chief Operating Officer of APS is also here with us.
Before I turn the call over to our speakers, I need to cover a few details with you. First, the slides we refer to today are available on our Investor Relations website along with our earnings release, supplemental information on our earnings variances and quarterly operating statistics, the webcast and the Form 8-K we filed this morning.
The slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information. Please note that all of our references to per share amounts today will be after income taxes and based on diluted shares outstanding.
Also, it is my responsibility to advise you that this call and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements, because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements.
Please refer to the forward-looking statements language contained in our 2010 Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC this morning, as well as the MD&A section which identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements.
A replay of this call will be available on our website, www.pinnaclewest.com, for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through February 25.
At this point, I’ll turn the call over to Jim.

The topics I’ll discuss today are outlined on slide 4. First, I’ll review the consolidated fourth quarter results and discuss the main variances from last year’s corresponding quarter.

First, I’ll review the consolidated fourth quarter results and discuss the main variances from last year’s corresponding quarter. Second, I will provide a brief update on the status and outlook for the Arizona economy. Then, I will discuss our full-year results and 2011 earnings guidance. And finally, I’ll close with brief comments on our liquidity and financing.
Slide 5 summarizes our reported and ongoing earnings for the quarter. On a GAAP basis, this year’s fourth quarter, we reported consolidated net income attributable to common share holders of $7 million or $0.07 per share compared with a net loss of $30 million or $0.30 per share for the prior year’s fourth quarter.
Our on going earnings increased $0.22 per share; for the 2010 fourth quarter we have consolidated ongoing earnings of $7 million or $0.06 per share versus an ongoing loss of $16 million or $0.16 per share for the comparable quarter year ago.
A reconciliation of our fourth quarter GAAP earnings per share to our ongoing earnings per share is shown on slide 6. The amounts for both quarters exclude results related to our discontinued real estate operations. My remaining comments on the quarter will focus on our ongoing results.
Turning your attention to slide 7, you will see the variances as that drove the change in quarterly ongoing earnings per share. First, an increase in our regulated electricity segment gross margin added $0.17 per share, compared with those in the prior year’s fourth quarter. Several pluses and minuses comprises that variance and I’ll cover those in detail on the next slide.
Second, continuing favorable resolution of tax matters helped lower our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter, improving earnings by $0.06 per share. We added $0.04 per share as a result of closure of prior reserves. Additionally the new tax act passed in law in December provided an extended R&D tax credit that benefited the fourth quarter by $0.02 per share.
Third, we recorded cost in the fourth quarter of 2009 to expand APS’ low-income assistance funding as part of regulatory settlement. The absence of comparable costs in this year’s fourth quarter improved earnings by $0.03 per share.
Fourth, improved results for APS Energy Services non-regulated energy consulting services business improved earnings by $0.02 per share. And fifth, net impact of miscellaneous items increased earnings by $0.04 per share.
Partially offsetting those positive results were higher operations and maintenance expenses, which decreased earnings by $0.04 per share. The increase largely reflects higher employee benefit costs. This change in O&M excludes expenses related the renewable energy standard or RES and our demand side management and energy efficiency efforts because those costs were offset by reflective rate surcharges. We have provided the amounts of pre-tax expenses related to these efforts by quarter over the last couple of years in the appendix to today’s life.
Finally, higher infrastructure-related costs decreased earnings by $0.06 per share reflecting the increases in property taxes, depreciation and amortization and interest expense partially offset by an increase in capitalized financing cost.
Turning to slide 8 and the composition of the net increase in our regulated electricity gross margin, total regulated gross margin was up $0.17 per share, compared with 2009's fourth quarter. The components of that increase were as follows.
Retail rate increases favorably impacted our quarterly results by $0.16 per share. Of this amount, $0.14 per share related to the net base rate increase and $0.02 per share related to the line extension fees recorded as revenue. Both of these items became effective January 1 of 2010 under APS’ retail regulatory settlement.
Lower fuel costs net of deferrals and improved mark-to-market valuation of fuel contracts improved earnings by $0.03 a share. Weather effects improved earnings by $0.03 per share. To facilitate your analysis, we have added a slide to the appendix to show weather effects compared with normal by quarter over the last couple of years. Lower usage by APS’ retail customers compared with the fourth quarter a year ago decreased our quarterly results by $0.04 per share.
Weather normalized retail kilowatt hour sales were down 1.1% in the quarterly comparison, almost all reflecting the effects of our ACC approved energy efficiency and demand side management programs. Customer growth of one half of 1% over year-ago levels helped offset the decline in kilowatt hour sales. I'll provide more on the state of our Arizona economy momentarily.
And the net effects of miscellaneous gross margin items decreased our results by a penny per share. Turning to slide 9, and looking at our fundamental growth outlook in the Arizona economy, we currently expect annual customer growth to average about 1.7% for 2011 through 2013. Additionally, we expect our average annual weather normalized retail sales and kilowatt hours to be relatively flat from 2011 through 2013, primarily due to APS's energy efficiency programs offsetting a modest recovery in the economy.
In the fourth quarter of this year, we continue to see signs of stability in the Arizona economy. As shown on slide 9, aside from a brief surge in the middle of 2010, month- over-month non-farm job growth has returned to its highest level since the middle of 2006. Likewise, we also see a return to more substantial income growth as measured by the personal income tax withholding trend. By this measure, year-over-year income growth is setting its best marks in almost three and a half years.
Mainly unemployment remains high in the metro-Phoenix area and around the state, and we have a longer way to go to recoup the jobs we lost in the recession but we are encouraged by the trajectory of these recent trends. The economic growth story appears to be additionally confirmed by the real estate trends. Housing prices in the metro-Phoenix at bottom in early 2009 and settled into a narrow range since then, reflecting almost two years of relatively stable and slow absorption of vacant commercial floor space has begun. Excess housing in the Phoenix Metro area has also continued to be absorbed as demand for housing continues at low levels but faster than new supply is being added. We expect this situation to continue for at least two to three years.
On the commercial side, vacancy rates likely peaked at very high levels in 2010, but the trends in demand for both office and retail space are positive again after several quarters of decline. As I mentioned in our last quarterly call, we continue to be cautiously optimistic that the Arizona economy has found a bottom and that we can begin a long process of recovery. We expect the economy, both nationally and locally, to improve gradually as we move through 2011.
Importantly, we need to see more robust consumer confidence in order to support a stronger recovery in residential usage patterns ignoring weather effect and the impacts of our energy efficiency programs. And we have only just begun to see signs of improvement in this area. Similarly, commercial and industrial customer usage growth is likely to remain restrained until overall economic growth strengthens a bit more. However, over the long term, we remain confident of Arizona's fundamentals. We expect customer growth and usage to return to stronger levels as the national and state economic environments improve.
Putting this all in context for earnings, let's look at our full year comparison on slide 10. On a GAAP basis for the year 2010 as a whole, we reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $350 million, or $3.27 per share, compared with net income of $68 million or $0.67 per share for 2009. Our ongoing earnings increased $0.78 per share year-over-year, some 33% higher. As a result, from an ongoing earnings perspective, we were pleased to deliver 2010 full year results of $3.08 per share, on higher end of our guidance.
From a financial point of view, 2010 was a solid year but not without challenges. However, weak gross margin was offset by continued cost effectiveness efforts throughout the Company. In my opinion, the Company has done a great job of managing costs with O&M expense essentially flat in 2010 as compared to 2009. This focus on cost effectiveness will continue as growth returns in the future.
Turning to our earnings outlook on slide 11, we expect our consolidated ongoing earnings for 2011 will be between $3.15 per share, which is slightly higher than the range we provided for 2010. For your reference, a list of key assumptions and factors underlying our 2011 outlook is included in the appendix today's slides. Our 2011, forecast includes unexpected contribution from our Arizona Sun program up about $0.03 to $0.04. Don will speak about the Arizona Sun program and its progress to date in a few moments. In regards to 2012 guidance, we intend to provide a forecast sometime in the summer after we file our general retail rate case on June 1.
Now a quick update on our liquidity and financing. We'll reference slide 12. Our capital structure and available liquidity at the end of 2010 is depicted on the slide. APS’ ACC jurisdictional equity ratio at year-end was 53.9%, which is important, given 2010 will be a test year for the upcoming rate case filing. This equity ratio is comparable to the one allowed in APS’ last retail rate case decision.
Pinnacle West common stock issuance in 2010, which resulted in about $250 million of equity proceeds being contributed to APS helped maintain a balanced capital structure at the utility and is consistent with commitments we made in the 2009 regulatory settlement.
For similar reasons, we estimate our next equity issuance will not be until 2012 at the earliest. At year-end, we had about $1.3 billion of available liquidity.
Given our improving cash flow profile, stable credit ratings and solid liquidity position, we feel very comfortable in our ability to fund APS’ capital expenditure program and our ability to access financing markets as necessary. This past Monday APS entered into a $500 million four-year revolving credit facility replacing the revolver that would have otherwise terminated in September of 2011. Looking ahead, this slide also outlines our major expected financing activities for 2011 and 2012.
Switching topics to cash tax benefits, recent federal tax legislation adopted in December extended bonus depreciation through 2012. Qualified property placed into service after September 8th, of 2010 and through 2011 will be eligible for 100% bonus depreciation for federal income tax purposes. In addition, qualified property placed into service in 2012 will be eligible for 50% bonus depreciation.
Bonus depreciation deductions in 2011 and 2012 are expected to generate $450 million to $500 million of cash tax benefits for APS. As a result of expected utilization of tax net operating loss carry-forwards, we anticipate the bonus depreciation cash benefits will be fully realized by APS by the end of 2013 with a majority of the benefit realized in 2012 and 2013. The cash generated is an acceleration of tax benefits that APS would have received otherwise over 20 years.
For some time, we have been talking about cash tax benefits totaling $110 million at the parent Company expects to realize as a result of the SunCor restructuring. Approximately half of this benefit was realized by the parent Company in 2010. However, because of the extension of bonus depreciation, we now estimate the parent will realize the remaining SunCor cash tax benefits around the end of 2013. This concludes my prepared remarks. Now let me turn the call over to Don.

Although the recession has slowed our historically robust growth patterns,",1660,"Thanks, Jim and thank you all for taking the time to join us this morning. Jim has touched on several issues important to our investors including our growth in the Arizona economy. Although the recession has slowed our historically robust growth patterns, Arizona retains many qualities that make it a desirable place to live and do business.
Consequently, we believe that the state's strong growth should return which is an attractive distinguishing feature of our company. Since our last earnings call, we made distinct progress in some areas and continued our track record of operational excellence. Today I'll update you on the following items, our resource acquisition activities, Arizona regulatory developments, and our recent operating performance.
Beginning with resource acquisition activities, I'll first review several renewable resource additions. As you know, renewable energy is a key part of our resource plan. It makes sense for our customers and their communities, the environment, and our shareholders. Arizona regulators are supportive of renewable energy in general and particularly solar. We are on track with plans to significantly increase the amount of renewable energy we provide our customers.
We have a strong emphasis on solar power because Arizona has some of the best solar conditions in the world. Today I'll highlight progress on two major solar initiatives. First, the AZ Sun program. Through this program APS will develop and own 100 megawatts of photovoltaic utility scale solar plants in Arizona with the facilities being placed in service this year through 2014.
The Arizona Corporation Commission has approved constructive rate recovery for the AZ Sun program plants. Since the program's approval last March, we have announced a portfolio of five generation facilities totaling 83 megawatts, with overall estimated capital expenditures of $377 million. This total includes our announcement earlier this week of the 17-megawatt Paloma Solar Plant to be located about 70 miles Southwest of Phoenix at Gila Bend.
We expect the project's committed to date to be placed in operation primarily in 2011 and 2012. Additional procurement initiatives are under way to fill out the balance of the program.
Slide 15 in the appendix contains a summary of the AZ Sun program and the projects committed to date. In addition to AZ Sun, the Solana Generating Station project has also progressed. In December, the plant developer, Abengoa Solar, finalized its Department of Energy loan guarantee financing and broke ground on the solar trough facility.
As a reminder, APS will purchase all of the Solana plant’s output under a 30 year purchase power agreement with Abengoa. If Solana were in operation today it would be the largest solar plant in the world. These projects and other renewable initiatives we have underway are important steps toward advancing Arizona's sustainable energy future.
Now I'll update you on our pending Four Corners plan. Last November, we announced a multi-part plan to address several challenges facing our Four Corners coal-fired plant in Northern New Mexico, a plan that presents a balanced solution to address new environmental regulations. APS has agreed to buy Southern California Edison’s 739 megawatt interest in units four and five, an opportunity that exists because so called Edison has indicated it must exit its interest in the plant by 2016 to comply with California law.
The purchase price of $294 million is substantially less than other generation alternatives, and it is the lowest price per kilowatt paid for U.S. coal capacity since 2005. The acquisition requires approval by Arizona, California and several federal agencies. Furthermore, the transactions are contingent upon extensions of the land lease with the Navajo Nation and the coal supply contract. The land lease extension was approved by the Navajo Nation this past Tuesday and coal contract negotiations are under way. We are targeting closing on the purchase in late 2012 and expect to finance the transaction with a mix of debt and equity.
Pending regulatory approval, we plan to shut down Four Corners units, one, two and three which totaled 560 megawatts and are wholly owned by APS. Because these units are older and less efficient than units four and five, we currently estimate compliance with proposed EPA regulations would be very expensive for them compared with the newer units. The net result of the acquisition and closure is a 179 megawatt increase in our share of the plant.
Importantly, completing these transactions will significantly reduce Four Corners' emissions, including greenhouse gas emissions, as well as reduce the capital investment APS will need to make for environmental compliance at the plant.
We estimate that APS’ environmental capital expenditures for our revised plant share will be about $300 million, far less than the estimated $620 million capital investment required for our current plant interest under proposed EPA rules. Obviously, our proposed transactions would provide significant savings while cost effectively adding reliable base load capacity.
The proposed Four Corners plan provides a number of other benefits for APS customers, the local economy, the environment, and shareholders. The transactions and benefits are outlined on slides 16 and 17 in the appendix to today's slides.
Turning to Arizona regulatory matters, we continue to work with the Arizona Corporation Commission and various stakeholders to further enhance the state's regulatory framework. A number of opportunities exist to continue a dialog, cooperatively addressing the interest of customers, shareholders, and other stakeholders alike.
The Commission has made progress on a number of generic topics affecting the industry. Last year they adopted a resource planning and energy efficiency rules as well as renewable transmission action plan for APS. In December, the commissioners unanimously approved a decoupling policy statement. The effective implementation of which is essential to achieving the state's energy efficiency goals. The policy statement supports a fixed cost revenue per customer methodology, which we and other parties supported. And allows utilities to propose decoupling mechanisms in upcoming retail rate cases.
Other generic dockets are still under way. The topics of these workshops and public meetings include, among other things, ways to streamline the rate case process and line extension policies.
In January, there were changes in the composition of the commission. Derek Pierce, a Republican, recently reelected and continuing to serve on the Commission was elected Chairman. And Brenda Burns, also a Republican, began her four-year term in office. The other three commissioners, Democrats Sandra Kennedy and Paul Newman and Republican Bob Stump continue to serve in their capacities.
We also have been preparing for APS’ 2011 retail rate case filing. To that end on February 1, APS filed a notice with the commission that we intend to file a rate case on June 1. The filing provided the 120 days to the notice to the commission and interested parties to facilitate timely processing and collaboration as agreed to in APS’ 2009 regulatory settlement.
The notice outlined a number of key proposals that APS expects to include in the rate case application. Some of these proposals in the notice include a decoupling mechanism, post-test year plant additions to rate base and an infrastructure tracker. For more detail, a summary of the proposals is provided on slide 18 in the appendix to today's slides.
In addition to participating in the ACC's generic workshops, we have been meeting with various stakeholders to enhance common understanding of regulatory and operational issues. We look forward to continuing this dialog and future progress for our state's regulatory environment.
Looking at our operating performance, our base load nuclear and coal fleet continues to perform very well. During the fourth quarter, we completed a planned refueling and maintenance outage in Palo Verde unit three and during the outage we’ve replaced a reactor vessel head and installed a rapid refueling package, which will help to reduce the time required for future refuelings. This outage lasted 40 days, which was ahead of our schedule. Unit three vessel head replacement completed the program we began in the fourth quarter of 2009 to install this equipment in all three Palo Verde units.
In 2011, we expect each of our two planned refueling outages to last 35 days to 40 days, reflecting the benefits of our recent work, as well as, safe and sound planning and execution.
In 2010 as a whole, Palo Verde produced a site average capacity factor of 91%. Even with the planned extended outages, the nuclear facility had its best production year ever, generating more than 31 million megawatt hours. Palo Verde is the only U.S. generating facility of any kind to ever exceed 30 million megawatt hours in a single year and it did so last year for the sixth time in its history.
And on an individual unit level, unit two was the world's top nuclear generator in 2010. We continue to progress through the license extension process with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
Currently, we expect the NRC will approve the 20-year license extensions for each of the three units during the first half of this year. Looking ahead, the Palo Verde team remains focused on achieving safe, sustainable, top tier performance in all aspects of the plant's operations.
Our coal-fired plants continued their run of top tier performance also. In 2010, our coal fleet posted a capacity factor of 81%, which is well above the most recently available industry average of 65%.
From our shareholders’ perspective, 2010 was a good year as we outperformed both our industry and the broad market. We are very pleased that our total return to shareholders comprised of price appreciation, plus dividends, was 20%, which compares very favorably with the U.S. electric utility average of 4% and the S&P 500 index return of 15%.
In summary, our company's goal is to achieve top tier performance and we constantly work toward that objective in every facet of our business. Going forward, we are strongly committed to maintaining operational excellence and achieving superior financial results by concentrating on our core electric utility business.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, at this time, we would be pleased to take any questions.

I'd like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and webcast to review our first quarter earnings, recent developments and operating performance. Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Don Brandt; and our CFO, Jim Hatfield. Don Robinson, who is President and Chief Operating Officer of APS, is also here with us.
Before I turn the call over to our speakers, I need to cover a few details with you. First, the slides we refer to today are available on our Investor Relations website along with our earnings release, supplemental information on our earnings variances and quarterly operating statistics, the webcast and the Form 8-K filed this morning. The slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information.
Please note that all of our references to per share amounts today will be after income taxes and based on diluted shares outstanding. Also, it is my responsibility to advise you that this call and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements. Because the actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements.
Please refer to the forward-looking statements contained in our 2010 Form 10-Q, which was filed this morning, as well as the MD&A section, which identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. A replay of this call will be available on our web site, www.pinnaclewest.com for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through May 6.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Jim.

The topics I will discuss today are outlined on slide four. First, I'll review the consolidated first quarter results and discuss the main variances from last year’s corresponding quarter.

First, I'll review the consolidated first quarter results and discuss the main variances from last year’s corresponding quarter. Second, I'll provide a brief update on the status and outlook for the Arizona economy. Third, I'll discuss our 2011 earnings guidance and lastly, I will close with brief comments on our financing activities in these.
Slide five summarizes our reported and on-going earnings for the quarter. On a GAAP basis for this year’s first quarter, we reported a consolidated net loss attributable to common shareholders of $15 million or $0.14 per share compared with a net loss of $6 million or $0.06 per share for the prior year's first quarter.
Our on-going earnings decreased $0.21 per share for the 2011 first quarter. We’ve consolidated on-going loss of $15 million or $0.14 per share versus on-going earnings of $7 million or $0.07 per share for the comparable quarter a year ago.
Slide six contains a reconciliation of our first quarter GAAP EPS to our ongoing earnings. The amounts for both quarters exclude the results related to our discontinued operations substantially comprised of the operations of our real estate business on core. My remaining comments on the quarter will focus on on-going results.
Moving to slide seven, you will see the variances that drove the change in quarterly on-going EPS. First, an increase in our regulated electricity segment gross margin added $0.04 per share compared with the prior year first quarter. Several pluses and minuses comprise this net variance and I will cover those items in more detail on the next slide.
Second, higher operations on maintenance expenses decreased earnings by $0.10 per share. The increase largely reflects higher duration cost primarily due to the plan timing and scope of maintenance at two of our gas-fired, combined-cycle generation plants.
I’ll give additional detail on the timing of O&M for our planned outages in a few moments. This change in O&M excludes expenses related to the renewable energy standard or RES and similar regulatory programs, which are offset by comparable revenue amounts. Also we have excluded $0.16 per share of expenses related to settlement in this year’s first quarter of certain prior period transmission rights away associated with the Four Corners Power Plant. These costs were offset by revenue to be received from Southern Calif. Edison with (inaudible) related transmission line from APS. So there is no financial impact from the settlement.
Third, favorable resolution of tax matters in a prior period, which did not recur in the first quarter of 2011 decreased earnings by $0.08 per share.
Fourth, higher infrastructure costs decreased earnings by $0.06 per share reflecting increases in property taxes and depreciation. Finally, the net impact of all other items decreased earnings by a $0.01 per share.
Turning to slide eight, composition of the net increase in our regulated electricity gross margin. Total regulated segment gross margin was up 4% per share compared with 2010 quarter. The components of that increase were as follows. Higher usage by APS' customers compared with the first quarter a year ago increased our quarterly results by $0.03 per share.
Weather-normalized retail kilowatt-hour sales were up 1.2% in the quarterly comparison after reflecting the effects of our ACC approved energy efficiency and demand-side management programs. This was the first time since the third quarter of 2008; we have had higher overall retail kilowatt-hour sales in the first time since the fourth quarter 2007 that our residential customer's average usage has increased. Also we had 0.4% customer growth in the quarter in addition to higher usage per customer. I'll provide more on the State of the Arizona economy momentarily.
Weather effects improved earnings by $0.03 per share. This year's first quarter was cooler than normal with residential heating degree-days higher than normal by 17%. Higher line extension fees recorded as revenues increased gross margin by $0.01 per share. The net effect of lower transmission rate and other items decreased our results by $0.03 per share.
Moving to slide nine, I want to discuss the timing on an annual basis for planned O&M for fossil generation outages for this year and last year. O&M as we indicated earlier was impacted primarily by planned outages at two of our gas-fired, combined-cycle power plants.
On the slide, you see the spread of our O&M expense for overall of the fossil fleet in 2010 as compared to the expected expense for 2011. We anticipate our spin on overalls in 2011 will be about the same as in 2010.
With that said, we plan and successfully executed on about half of our overall dollars in the first quarter of 2011, compared to 20% during the same period in 2010. So while the year-over-year comparison for the quarter get you one impression, we're actually on track with operating expenses for 2011 and we plan no change to guidance.
Turning to slide 10, and looking at our fundamental growth outlook in Arizona economy, in the first quarter of this year, we continue to see signs of stability in the Arizona economy. As shown on the side, month-over-month, non-farm job growth has continued at a slow positive pace.
On a more encouraging note, we have seen stronger consumer spending as reflected in an increased rate of growth for Arizona retail sales. While these trends indicate that the Arizona economy has headed in the right direction, we must remain cognizant of the significant headwinds that continue. Unemployment remains high and they can see rates in housing and commercial real estate have only just begun to retreat from their peaks of last year.
We believe the situation will continue to restrain new construction and higher levels of growth for at least two to three years. Over the long-term though, we remain confident in Arizona’s fundamentals. We expect customer growth in usage to return to stronger levels as the national and state economic environments improve. Although, we experienced growth in both customers and usage per customer in the first quarter, I will now not jump to any conclusions that we have started a significant upward growth trend. In 2011, we expect growth in customers in kilowatt-hour sales of about 1%.
Looking at the next several years, we expect annual customer growth to average about 1.7% for 2011 through 2013. Additionally, we expect our average annual weather normalized retail sales in kilowatt-hours to be relatively flat in 2011 through 2013, primarily due to APS’ energy efficiency programs offsetting a modest recovery in the economy.
So turning to our earnings outlook, I would point you to slide 11. In terms of results year-to-date, we are on track to meet and we are affirming our consolidated ongoing earnings guidance for 2011 of $3 to $3.15 per share. For your reference, a list of key assumptions and factors underlying our 2011 outlook is included in the appendix in today’s slides.
Additionally, as we stated in our prior call the 2011 outlook includes an expected contribution from our AZ Sun Program of about $0.03 to $0.04 per share. In terms of 2011, we intend to share with you the major drivers for 2012 sometime after our general rate case is filed with the commission on June 1 of this year. However, we will not provide 2012 earnings guidance while the rate case is pending.
Before I turn the call over to Don, I want to comment on liquidity. APS in the first quarter with no short-term debt outstanding and has ample liquidity. As a result, we are comfortable with our ability to plan APS’ capital expenditure program with no new equity until 2012 at the earliest.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Don Brandt. Don?

Since our last earnings call we made distinct progress in key areas and continued our track record of operation excellence. Today, I'll address four areas, one, our renewable and other generation investments; two, environmental compliance; three, rate regulation matters; and finally, four, recent operating performance.
Beginning with renewable resources in our AZ Sun development activities, we are on track with plans to significantly increase the amount of renewable energy we provided our customers. Investing in these resources make sense for our customers, their communities, the environment and our shareholders.
We have a strong emphasis on a solar power because Arizona has some of the best solar conditions in the world. Since the beginning of the year, our most noteworthy progress related to renewable energy has been on APS' AZ Sun Program. The company has planned to develop and own 100 megawatts of photovoltaic utility scale solar plants in Arizona.
The appendix to our slides today contains a summary of the AZ Sun Program and the projects committed today. We have announced projects with a total deliverable capacity of 83 megawatts and an estimated capital investment of $384 million. Additional procurement initiatives are underway to fill out the remaining 17 megawatts of the program. Construction and other development activities are now under way and we expect to place the first 45 megawatts of the AZ Sun Program in service for customers later this year.
Turning to the status of our Four Corners plan and other environmental compliance matters, last quarter, I discussed our multi-part plant to address several challenges facing over Four Corners coal-fired plant in northwestern New Mexico. The plan presents a creative solution to address new environment regulations and maintains our well-balanced resource portfolio. A summary of the plan is included in the appendix to our slides.
To recap the plan, APS has agreed to buy Southern California Edison's 739 megawatt interest in units 4 and 5 of Four Corners. This opportunity exists because So Calif. Edison has indicated it must exit its interest in the plant by 2016 to comply with California law. The purchase price is $294 million. The parties target closing on the transaction in late 2012.
If the purchase transaction moves forward as planned, we intend to shutdown Four Corners units1, 2 and 3, which totaled 560 megawatts in size and are wholly owned by APS. These units are older and less efficient than units 4 and 5 in compliance with new regulations issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency would be very expensive for them.
The net result of the anticipated acquisition and closure is 179 megawatt increase in APS' share with Four Corners. We estimate that APS' capital expenditures for environmental compliance for our revised plant share will be about $300 million, cost primarily incurred to install selective catalytic reduction equipment or SCRs as they're called on units four and five as the EPA's proposed rules would require.
These expenditures are far less in what APS would make if it were instead to bring our existing interest in all five of the plants units in the compliance with the proposed EPA rules. An approach that would require capital investments (inaudible) an estimated $620 million. The acquisition requires approval by Arizona, California and federal regulators and other government agencies. It is also contingent upon the extensions of the land lease with Navajo Nation and the coal supply contract.
During the first quarter, we made progress towards such approvals on several fronts. The land lease extension through 2041 was approved by the Navajo Nation and now awaits final approval by the U.S. Department of the Interior. The deadline by which other participants must have exercised or write a first refusal to purchase a portion of Southern California Edison's share has passed and APS remains the one - excuse me, the only purchaser. The Arizona Corporation Commission has scheduled a hearing on the matter to begin on July 14 and coal contract negotiations also continue.
We believe our plan has substantial merits economically, environmentally and socially. Our proposal clearly provides significant savings, given that the purchase price plus environmental compliance cost combined for APS' revised share are less than the cost of environmental compliance for APS' existing ownership in the plant. Our plan has substantial benefits in other important areas as well. We remain hopeful that APS in Southern California Edison will obtain the requisite approvals in a timely manner.
Now, let me touch for a few minutes on other EPA compliance developments. In March, the EPA proposed rules to regulate mercury and certain other air emissions at coal-fired power plants. The proposed rules were inline with our expectations and we anticipate that they will be finalized in late 2011. All APS-owned plants except Four Corners units 1, 2 and 3 and one unit at Cholla power plant are equipped with scrubbers and bag houses and thus able to comply with the proposed rule.
We currently estimate that installation scrubbers at Cholla will cost about $89 million and will be completed by 2015. Also in March, the EPA proposed a rule on cooling water intake structures at existing power plants, which is sometimes referred to as the Section 316(b) rule. The proposed rule is subject to a 90-day public comment period and we expect that a final rule will be issued in mid-2012 of APS' existing power plants only Four Corners and Navajo would be impacted by this rule, if finalized. And we are now analyzing the nature of the impacts on potential cost of compliance.
Turning to rate regulation matters now, we continue our work with the Arizona Corporation Commission and stakeholders in an effort to gain common understanding on various regulatory and operational issues and the fine solutions that balanced the interests of customers, shareholders and other stakeholders alike.
We look forward to continuing this dialogue and making further progress with respect to our states regulatory environment. We've also been preparing for APS' 2011 retail rate case filing. As a noted on our last call APS filed a notice on February 1 with the Arizona Corporation Commission indicating that we intend to file our rate case on June 1. The primary objectives of our rate case filings will be to recover costs in investments. We have made to serve our customers and to build upon the support of regulatory mechanisms established in APS' 2009 regulatory settlement.
Required by the settlement, the 120-day notice filing was design to inform stakeholders is a key proposal that APS likely will include in its upcoming rate case and to facilitate timely resolution of the proceeding. Some of the proposals in the notice include a decoupling mechanism, post test year plant additions to rate base and an infrastructure tracking adjusted mechanism to recover future generation and environmental capital cost.
For your convenience the summary of the proposals is provided in the appendix to our slides.
Earlier this month, we made our 2011 filings for rate changes related to transmission services. The total adjustments to our transmission rate will be $44 million calculated pestilence to the formal rate approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Of these amounts, $6 million relates to wholesale transactions with other utilities and will become effective on June 1. We have filed an application with the ACC requesting that the $38 million related to transmission services for APS’ retail customer that become effective on July 1.
Looking at our operating performance, our base load coal and nuclear continues to perform well. Our coal-fired plants continue their top tier performance. In the first quarter, our coal fleet posted a capacity factor of 78%, which is well above the most recently available industry average of 65%.
During the first quarter, our Palo Verde nuclear facility operated at a 99% capacity factor. Unit 2 is currently in a plan refuelling outage that began on April 2. We plan two refuelling outages in 2011 to last 35 to 40 days each, a time frame that reflects sound, planning and execution as well as the benefits of our work over the past two years installing rapid refuelling packages and replacing reactor vessel heads.
On April 21, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved 20-year license extension for each of Palo Verde's three units. This was a major achievement that will result in significant cost savings and other benefits for APS' customers and the entire southwest from the United States over the extended lifetime of plant.
Obviously, the nuclear industry is at the top of many minds following the recent tragic events in Japan. So a few comments on this subject remitted today. We strongly believe that Palo Verde is safe and that there are key differences between our plant and the Japanese situation, including less susceptibility to external events like earthquakes and Tsunamis.
However, we and the rest of the U.S. nuclear fleet have been carefully studying the developments in Japan. We’re keenly aware that there will be lessons learned from that event that will strengthen the safety of our nation's nuclear fleet. As the operator of the largest nuclear plant in the United States our mission for Palo Verde is just operate safely and efficiently for the long-term.
Turning to the quality of our customer service. In February, J.D. Power and Associates released results of its 2010 business customer survey. I'm pleased that APS continues its record of performance, excellence and overall customer satisfaction. In the most recent results, APS ranked fourth nationally among 45 large investor-owned electric utilities. More specific to our region, we were rated second among 10 investor-owned utilities in the West.
We also recently received recognition for achievements in other areas. Specifically for the second consecutive year APS was awarded the EPA's highest honor for continued leadership and protect the environment through energy-efficiency programs. The energy stars sustained excellence award recognized two APS home programs for promoting energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
In addition, Pinnacle West was ranked 15 in Corporate Responsibility magazine’s 2011 list of 100 Best Corporate Citizens. This award was especially meaningful to us because it recognized our performance in many environmental, social and governance areas.
To wrap it up, our company's goal is to achieve top-tier performance and we constantly work toward that objective in every facet of our business. Going-forward, we are committed to maintaining operational excellence in achieving superior financial results by concentrating on our core electric utility business.
That concludes our prepared remarks today. And operator at this time, we'd pleased to take any questions.

Before I turn the call over to our speakers, I need to cover a few details with you. First, the slides we refer to today are available on our Investor Relations website along with our earnings release, supplemental information on our earnings variances and quarterly operating statistics, the webcast and the Form 8-K filed this morning. Please note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information. Also all of our references to per share amount will be after income taxes and based on diluted shares outstanding.
It is my responsibility to advise you that this call and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements.
Our second quarter of 2011 Form 10-Q was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for the forward-looking statements as well as the MD&A section, which identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. A replay of this call will be available on our website, for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through August 9.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Jim.

First, I'll review the consolidated second quarter results and discuss the main variances from last year’s corresponding quarter. Second, I'll provide a brief update on the status and outlook for the Arizona economy. Third, I'll discuss our 2011 earnings guidance, and lastly, I will close with brief comments on our credit ratings, liquidity and financing activities.
Slide five summarizes our reported and ongoing earnings for the quarter. On a GAAP basis for this year second quarter, we reported a consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $87 million or $0.79 per share compared with net income of $115 million or $1.7 per share for the prior year second quarter.
Our on-going earnings decreased $0.04 per share. For the 2011 second quarter, we’ve consolidated ongoing earnings of $86 million or $0.78 per share versus ongoing earnings of $89 million or $0.82 per share for the comparable quarter a year ago.
Slide six contains a reconciliation of our second quarter GAAP earnings per share to our ongoing earnings. The amounts for both quarters exclude the results related to our discontinued operations. The discontinued operations amounts relate primarily to APS energy services. My remaining comments on the quarter will focus on the ongoing results.
Moving to slide seven, you see the variances that drove the change in quarterly ongoing earnings per share. First, an increase in our regulated electricity segment gross margin added $0.01 per share compared with the prior year second quarter. Several pluses and minuses comprise this net variance and I will cover those items in more detail on the next slide.
Second, lower operations on maintenance expenses improved earnings by $0.03 per share. The decrease largely reflects lower generation cost related to the timing and scope of planned outages at our fossil-fueled generating plants. This change in O&M excludes expenses related to the renewable energy standard or RES energy efficiency, demand-side management and similar regulatory programs, which are offset by comparable revenue amounts.
Third, higher infrastructure related costs decreased earnings by $0.07 per share, reflecting increases in property taxes of $0.05 per share and depreciation of $0.02 per share.
The property tax increase relates to higher property tax rate in 2011 versus 2010, as Counties raised rates to adjust their lower residential assessed valuations.
As Arizona’s largest property tax payer, APS has been significantly impacted by this property tax rate shift.
Higher depreciation and amortization related to plant additions decreased earnings by $0.02 per share. And finally, the net impact of all other items decreased earnings by a penny per share.
Just to comment on property taxes. Since 2008, we have seen assessed real estate values decline by approximately 20%. Therefore, counties increased tax rates to balance their budget. The net result to APS is a double-whammy of stable utility assessed values and higher rates.
Also point out that property taxes are in 18 to 24 months lagging indicator and the declining real estate values of 2008 and 2009 are just now being reflected in property tax rates.
Turning to slide eight, in the composition of net increase in our regulated electricity gross margin, total regulated segment gross margin was up $0.01 per share compared with the 2010 quarter. The components of that increase were as follows: Higher usage by APS's customers increased our quarterly results by $0.02 per share compared with the second quarter a year-ago. Total weather normalized retail kilowatt-hour sales were up 0.7% in the quarterly comparison after reflecting the effects of our ACC approved energy efficiency and demand side management programs.
The increased retail sales reflect 0.3% customer growth as well as higher average usage per customer primarily by residential customers. I'll provide more information on the Arizona economy momentarily.
Our line extension fees recorded as revenues increased gross margin by $0.01 per share. The net effect of other miscellaneous items improved gross margin by a penny per share. Milder weather in this year’s second quarter decreased earnings by $0.02 per share compared with the same period a year-ago.
Although the quarter-over-quarter comparison was minor, it was one of the central issues for our quarterly results, since last year’s second quarter reflected $0.15 per share from milder than normal weather. Of course, we always provide guidance on weather-normalized basis.
Now I’ll discuss some weather indicators in more detail on the next slide. The last item impacting gross margin, but the net effect of lower transmission rates of a penny per share, which reflect the impact of the retail transmission cost adjustor rate decrease that became effective August 1st of 2010.
On slide nine, we have summarized some of the relevant weather indicators for the quarterly comparison, a combination of mild temperatures and dry weather negatively impacted our second quarter results by $0.17 per share compared to normal, and that’s as previously reduced our quarterly earnings by $0.02 per share compared with last year's second quarter.
We recorded 375 residential cooling-degree days for the 2011 second quarter, which was 27% below normal, and about 2% below last year's second quarter. For this year's May and June combined, we had the lowest number of cooling-degree days since 1999 with only about half the number of days that normally are above 105 degrees.
In addition, for the second quarter of this year, we had the second-lowest average humidity recorded in the last 20 years, averaging 14% compare with normal humidity of 18%, this dry period translated into 50% more days than normal with average humidity below 15%.
Unlike last year, for July the mild trend continued with no real hot stretch of weather in a month, coupled with only half the number of days above a 110 degrees versus normal. Therefore our [revised] guidance has incorporated the negative impact of July weather as well. For your reference, we have included a slide and appendix that contains quarterly pre-tax, gross margin, effects of weather variances versus normal for the past couple of years.
Turning to Slide 10, and looking at our fundamental growth outlook in Arizona economy. Economic growth in Arizona continued to improve in the second quarter, although modestly. As shown on Slide 10, month-over-month non-farm job growth has remained choppy, but positive as businesses began adding more temporary help and we saw some expansion in the manufacturing and financial services sectors.
Second quarter job growth in Arizona was 2% above the national average of 1.4%. Additionally consumer spending rebalanced significantly, reflecting some recovery from extraordinarily large pullback we observed during 2008, 2009.
While these trends indicate that the Arizona economy is headed in the right direction, we must remain cognizant of the significant headwinds that continue. Unemployment remains high, and vacancy rates and housing and commercial real estate have only just begun to retreat from their peaks of last year.
Despite lagging residential valuations for tax purposes, we’ve seen fairly stable home price in the Metro Phoenix since early 2009, and viewed as an indication at new housing supplies and balance with demand, although a very low levels for both.
Weak demand for housing is mirrored in the commercial segment, as well, where gains in occupancies for retail and office space are marginal at best. We believe that this situation will continue to restrain new construction and higher levels of growth for at least two to three years.
Over the long-term though, we remain confident in Arizona’s fundamentals. We expect customer growth in usage to return to stronger levels as the national and state economic environments improve. Although, we experienced growth in both customers and usage per customer in the second quarter, we view these changes are short-term in nature and a relaxation from the recession related conservation for the past two years.
Looking at the next several years, we currently expect annual customer growth to average about 1.3% from 2011 to 2013, while our average annual weather normalized retail sales in kilowatt-hours will be relatively flat from 2011 to 2013, primarily due to APS’ energy efficiency programs offsetting a modest recovery in the economy.
Now turning to our earnings outlook, I’d point you to Slide 11. We expect our consolidated ongoing earnings for 2011 will be in the range of $2.75 to $2.90 per share. As previously discussed this revision to guidance is driven almost entirely by mild weather in the first several months of the year. If not for the impact of weather, we would not have revised guidance for 2011 at this time.
Our 2011 updated outlook assumes actual weather for the first several months, a normal weather patterns for the remainder of the year. Also we updated our expense estimates for a higher estimated property taxes, partially offset by lower estimated interest expense. For your reference an updated list of key assumptions of factors underlying our revised 2011 outlook is included in the appendix of today’s slides.
On Slide 12, you see our current credit rates. On June 21 Standard & Poor raised its corporate credit ratings on APS and the parent company as well as APS’s senior unsecured debt rating to BBB up from BBB minus. Also S&P raised its short-term commercial paper range for both entities to A2, up from A3 while maintaining its positive outlook.
S&P’s rating in increase was a reflection of several important components. The companies improved financial performance evidenced by stronger credit metrics, the prospect of improving regulatory relationships, our focus on cost control during the rate moratorium, and our steady non-core assets to focus on our regulated operations. We are pleased that S&P recognizes the progress we have made today. However it is imperative that we continue to execute operationally and financially.
I want to comment on our liquidity and financing. APS ended the second quarter with no short-term debt outstanding and has ample liquidity. Also the rain improvement provide APS and the parent company better access to short-term funding, as well as the debt capital markets.
Regarding financings, we have $400 million of APS unsecured notes due October 15 this year. We will look to refinance all or portion of these notes in the upcoming months. To close my remarks today, we continue to be comfortable with our ability to fund APS capital expenditure program with no new equity needed until 2012 at the earliest.
And with that I’ll turn the call over to Don. Don?

Since our last earnings call, we made distinct progress in key areas and continued our track record of operation excellence. Today, I'll update you on the following topics. One, Arizona regulatory developments. Two, our renewable and other generation investments. And three, our recent operating performance.
We know Arizona regulations and APS recently filed retail rate case are top of mind for investors and analyst. So I’ll start with those topics. Progress is been made in Arizona’s regulatory environment, and we appreciate the opportunity to continue working with the Arizona Corporation Commission and various stakeholders to further enhance the states regulatory framework to address several regulatory and operational issues and find solutions that balance the interest of customers, shareholders and other stakeholders alike. With this goal in mind, we look forward to continuing this dialogue in our ongoing state regulatory proceedings.
On June 1, APS filed the general retail rate case; the key provisions of the case were in line with expectations set for stakeholders through APS’s 120 day notice filed back in February. Today I’ll highlight the key request of the case and their benefits. For your reference these items as well as key underlying assumptions are summarized in the appendix to today’s slide [deck].
The rate case provisions contain a number of benefits for our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders. The requested regulatory treatment would build upon the constructive regulatory framework established in the 2009 settlement and would provide the financial support APS needs to achieve Arizona’s ambitious energy goals.
Through the rate application, APS has requested a $95 million net base rate increase effective July 1 of 2012. The proposed rate changes include, a non-fuel base rate increase of $194 million, a fuel related base rate decrease of $144 million attributable to the transfer of lower commodity costs from the power supply adjustor to base rates, and a $45 million base rate increase attributable to the transfer of revenues from the Renewable Energy Surcharge to base rates. This change relates primarily to AZ Sun projects that will be placed in service prior to new base rates becoming effective.
The net effect of these proposed changes on the average retail customer bill would be an increase of approximately 6.6%.
Slide 17 in the appendix shows the key financial assumptions underpinning the rate request, including updated rate base, cost of capital and fuel prices. Other key provisions of the rate case request would continue constructive regulatory treatment and mitigate regulatory lag.
Post test-year plant additions would be added to rate base through the date new rates would become effective. These additions totaled $250 million for AZ Sun and other solar projects, and $161 million for all other projects.
This 18-month catch up is consistent with the methodology used in the 2009 settlement. APS also proposes to implement two new recovery mechanisms that would modernize the rate-setting process and adjust electricity rates between general base rate applications.
The first of these is a decoupling mechanism using a revenue-per-customer method. This mechanism would update APS's rates to address recovery of the company's fixed costs in an environment of lower energy sales caused by energy efficiency programs and renewable distributed generation.
The second mechanism proposed is a generation and environmental infrastructure tracker. This mechanism would update APS's rates for costs associated with environmental compliance investments, as well as generation additions and generation efficiency projects needed to serve APS's customers' expanding energy needs.
APS has requested its power supply adjustor be modified to allow full pass-through of all fuel and purchase power changes, increases and decreases instead of the current 90/10 sharing provisions.
In addition, APS requested that the second 50 Megawatts of the AZ Sun program be recovered through the RES until it's included in base rates. This request is consistent with the 2009 regulatory settlement and was the approved treatment for the first 50 Megawatts of the program.
The Commission Administrative Law Judge has set a procedural schedule for the rate case proceedings. In short, the schedule provides two possible tracks for processing the request. Under both tracks, the ACC staff and interveners would file their direct testimony on November 18, on all matters except cost of service and rate design, and then on December 2 on those typical topics, and the hearing would begin on January 16.
However, the details of the tracks are different. One track assumes APS and the Commission staff and other parties pursue settlement discussions and settle the case. Under this schedule, the parties would enter into settlement discussions at November 30, with the goal of filing a settlement agreement with the Commission by late December. Testimony supporting or opposing the settlement would be filed on January 11.
The other track assumes that no settlement is reached and the parties proceed to litigation. Under that scenario APS would file rebuttal testimony on December 23. The schedules are noteworthy in that they demonstrate support for collaboration among the parties, and improve streamlining and efficiency of the regulatory process. They also are noteworthy in that they are designed to allow for final ACC decision by July 1 of 2012, consistent with APS's 2009 regulatory settlement.
In a separate application filed with the commission on May 20, APS requested changes to its line extension policy to a lot - line extension policy to allow a new customers and opportunity to avoid certain new construction costs. As requested the policy change would be effective with the decision on the general retail rate case. A procedural schedule for ACC consideration of this request has yet to be established.
As I discussed during our last conference call, in April, we made our 2011 filings for rate changes related to transmission services. The total adjustment to our annual transmission rates effective this year is a $44 million increase, calculated pursuant to the formula rate making procedures, previously approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
Of this amount $6 million relates to wholesale transactions with other utilities and that became effective June 1. On June 21, the Arizona Commission approved our request to allow the $38 million balance of the adjustment related to transmission services for APS's retail customers to pass-through the company's transmission cost adjustor, effective July 1.
Turning to renewable resources and our AZ Sun development activities. We're on track with plans to significantly increase the amount of renewable energy APS provides. Investing in these resources makes sense for our customers, our communities, the environment and our shareholders.
We play strong emphasis on solar power because Arizona has some of the best solar conditions in the world. Solid progress continues on APS’s AZ Sun program, the company’s plan to develop and own utility-scale photovoltaic plants in Arizona.
We now propose that there will be two phases to this program. The first 100 megawatt phase, which was approved in 2010 by the commission, and a second, 100 megawatt phase, which was proposed as part of the APS’s 2012 RES implementation plan, that was filed with the Arizona Commission on July 1.
I'll provide an update on phase one. Then I’ll outline what we have proposed for phase two. For your reference, the appendix to our slides today contains summaries of both phases of the AZ Sun Program. For phase one, to-date we've announced projects for the total capacity of 83 megawatts and an estimated capital investment of $384 million.
Construction and other development activities are progressing as planned, and we expect to place the first 45 megawatts of the AZ Sun Program in service for customers later this year. One of the plants has begun delivering energy to the gird as portions of the plant are wired and tested, and a second facility has nearly all the solar modules in place, as crews continue to wire the collection system.
Procurement initiatives are underway to fill out the last 17 megawatts of phase one. We expect projects for the remainder of phase one to come on line in 2012 and 2013. Based on our success to-date with the first 100 megawatts of AZ Sun. APS has requested that the commission approve phase two of AZ Sun is part of the company's 2012 RES implementation plan.
Phase two includes an additional 100 megawatts of utility-scale photovoltaic plants representing a potential capital investment about to $475 million. We estimate the facilities would be placed in service in the 2013 through 2015 timeframe. Further, we have requested regulatory treatment for the facilities through the Renewable Energy Surcharge until the plants are recovered through base rates. This approach is consistent with the first 50 megawatts of Phase I.
Assuming the ACC's consideration follows the timing of previous year's RES Implementation plans; we expect a decision from the commission on the 2012 plan around the end of this year. We're excited about the AZ Sun Program and our other renewable energy initiatives. They are important steps towards advancing Arizona's sustainable energy future.
Now turning to the status of our Four Corners plan. During our last two conference calls, we discussed our multipart plan to address several challenges facing our Four Corners coal-fired plant in Northwestern Mexico.
The plant presents a creative solution to address new environmental regulations and maintains our well-balanced resource portfolio. A summary of the plan is included in the appendix to our slides.
To recap the plan, APS has agreed to buy Southern California Edison's 739 megawatt interest in Units 4 to 5 for $294 million. The parties target closing the transaction in late 2012. If the purchase transaction moves forward as planned, we intend to shut down Four Corners Units 1, 2 and 3, which total 560 megawatts in size and are wholly owned by APS.
These units are smaller and less efficient than Units 4 and 5 and are not as well situated as the two larger units to bear the compliance costs associated with new regulations issued by the U.S. EPA. The net result of the anticipated acquisition enclosure is a 179 megawatt increase in the APS's share of Four Corners.
We estimate APS's capital expenditures for environmental compliance for our revised share of the plant would be about $300 million. These expenditures would be far less than the estimated $620 million APS would need to spend if instead it were to bring our existing interests in all five plants, units into compliance with the proposed EPA rules.
The acquisition requires approval by Arizona, California and federal regulators and other government agencies. It also is contingent upon extensions of the land lease with the Navajo Nation and the coal supply contract.
We've made progress on our plan on several fronts. First, the land lease extension through 2041 has been approved by the Navajo Nation. Second, the Arizona Corporation Commission began a hearing on the matter on July 14th and 15th and the hearing will resume on August 8th. And third, coal contract negotiations are underway.
We feel, we believe our plan has substantial merits economically, environmentally and socially. Our proposal clearly provide significant savings, given that the combined purchase price and environmental compliance costs for APS’s revised share would be less than environmental compliance cost per APS’s existing ownership in the plan. Our plan has substantial benefits in other important areas as well. We remain optimistic that APS and Southern California Edison will obtain the requisite approvals in a timely manner.
Now turning to our power plant performance for a few moments. Our base load coal and nuclear fleet continues to perform well. Our coal-fired plants continued their top tier performance. In the second quarter, our coal fleet posted a capacity factor 78%, which is well above the most recently available industry average of 68%.
During the second quarter, our Palo Verde nuclear facility operated at an 87% capacity factor, reflecting the plan Unit 2 refueling outage during that timeframe, which was completed in 35 days as planned. We have another refueling outage scheduled for this fall in Unit 1, which we expect to be completed in about the same amount of time. These refueling outage durations reflect sound planning and execution, the benefits of our work over the past couple of years, improving outage management and installing rapid refueling packages and replacing reactor vessel heads in each of the plan’s three units.
Now turning to the quality of our customer service. Last month, J.D. Power and Associates released the results of its 2011 residential customer survey. I am pleased that APS continues its record of excellent performance and overall customer satisfaction. In eight of the last nine years, APS has been ranked by residential, our business customers in the top 10 nationally among all large segment utilities in overall customer satisfaction.
In the most recent results, APS ranked fourth nationally among 55 large investor-owned electric utilities. More specific to our region, we were rated third among the 10 investor-owned utilities in the West. In addition to the overall customer satisfaction index, APS ranked in the top 10 nationally on five of the six components of customer satisfaction as defined by J.D. Power.
Finally regarding our non-utility operations, we continue to focus on our core utility operations and streamlining the company. Toward that end, Pinnacle West is negotiating the potential sale of our competitive energy services subsidiary, APS Energy Services. As a result, APS Energy Services was classified as a discontinued operation as of June 30th.
In summary, our company's goal is to achieve top-tier performance and we constantly work toward that objective in every facet of our business. Going forward, we are committed to maintaining operational excellence and achieving superior financial results by concentrating on our core electric utility business.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, at this time, we would be pleased to take any questions.

Before I turn the call over to our speakers, I need to cover a few details with you. First, the slides we refer to you today are available on our Investor Relations website, along with our earnings release, supplemental information on our earnings variances and operating statistics, the webcast and the Form 8-K filed this morning. Please note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information. Also, all of our references to per-share amounts will be after income taxes and based on diluted shares outstanding. 
It is my responsibility to advice you that this call and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and the Company assumes no obligation to update these statements. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. Our third quarter 2011 Form 10-Q was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statement cautionary language, as well as the MD&A section, which identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements.
A replay of this call will be available on our website for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through November 8.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Jim."
296957,141879794,208770,"Pinnacle West Capital Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2011",2011-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Pinnacle West Capital Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Becky. The topics I will discuss today are outlined on Slide 4. First, I will review the consolidated third quarter results and discuss the main variances from last year's corresponding quarter. Second, I will provide a brief update on the stat",1352,"Thank you, Becky. The topics I will discuss today are outlined on Slide 4. First, I will review the consolidated third quarter results and discuss the main variances from last year's corresponding quarter. Second, I will provide a brief update on the status and outlook for the Arizona economy. Third, I will discuss our 2011 earnings guidance, and lastly, I will close with brief comments on our liquidity and financing activities.
Slide 5 summarizes our reported and ongoing earnings for the quarter. On a GAAP basis for this year's third quarter, we reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $255 million or $2.32 per share compared with net income of $234 million or $2.14 per share for the prior year's third quarter. Our ongoing earnings increased $0.18 per share. For the 2011 third quarter, we have consolidated ongoing earnings of $246 million or $2.24 a share versus ongoing earnings of $224 million or $2.06 per share for the comparable quarter a year ago.
Slide 6 contains a reconciliation of our third quarter GAAP earnings per share to our ongoing earnings. The amount for both quarters exclude results related to our discontinued operations. The discontinued operations' amounts relate primarily to the APS Energy Services and real estate activities. My remaining comments on the quarter will focus on ongoing results.
Moving to Slide 7, you see the variances that drove the change in quarterly ongoing earnings per share. First, an increase in our regulated electricity segment gross margin added $0.10 per share compared with the prior year's third quarter. Several pluses and minuses comprise this positive net variance, and I will cover those items in more detail on the next slide.
Second, lower operations and maintenance expenses improved earnings by $0.10 per share. The decrease largely reflects lower benefit costs, as well as lower generation costs related to the timing and scope of plant maintenance in our generation plants. Our expectation for 2011 total annual fossil generation plant outage O&M cost is to be generally flat to 2010's annual comparable O&M cost. This change in O&M excludes expenses related to the Renewable Energy Standard, or RES, energy efficiency and similar regulatory programs, which are offset by comparable revenue amounts. 
Third, lower property taxes increased earnings by $0.02 per share. As we discussed last quarter, we were seeing higher property taxes in 2011, as counties raised business tax rates to adjust for lower residential-assessed valuations. However, when we received the new property tax bills in September, they were lower than we had estimated, so we reduced the amounts we recorded. Finally, the net impact of all other items decreased earnings by $0.04 per share.
Turning to Slide 8 and the composition of net increase in our regulated electricity gross margin. Total regulated segment gross margin was up $0.10 per share compared with the 2010 quarter. The main components of that increase were as follows. Unusually hot weather was a positive contributor to our quarterly results and increased earnings by $0.10 per share when compared with the same period a year ago. We had some record-breaking temperatures, particularly in August. We recorded 1,383 residential cooling degree days for the 2011 third quarter, which was 13% above normal and about 6% above last year's third quarter, which was also favorable. Overall, the quarter was the hottest on record. For your reference, we have included a slide in the appendix that contains quarterly pretax gross margin effects of weather variances versus normal for the past couple of years.
The net effect of higher retail transmission revenues increased our results by $0.04 per share. The retail transmission cost adjustor rate increase that became effectively July 1 of this year raised our quarterly revenue by $0.08 per share. However, in the third quarter, we booked in an adjustment to our formula rates. This catch-up adjustment reduced the quarterly results by $0.04 per share. Higher fuel cost, net of the PSA deferral, decreased our results by $0.02 per share, and the net effect of other miscellaneous items decreased our gross margin by $0.02 per share.
Turning to Slide 9 and looking at our fundamental growth outlook and the Arizona economy. Economic growth in Arizona continued to improve in the third quarter, although modestly. As show on Slide 9, month-over-month non-job -- non-farm job growth reached its fastest growth since the beginning of the economic recovery, although growth remains uneven. An improving trend and one which could provide some near-term support to the Arizona economy over the next year is a recent rebound in construction employment, which is embedded in this growth. 
Over the last quarter, construction employment has increased in -- at an annualized rate of 7%, reflecting new investment in nontraditional sectors like solar generation facilities at a time when residential and commercial construction activity has remained flat. While not sufficient in and of itself to sustain a more broad-based economic recovery, this modest increment should help partially bridge the gap until a significant excess capacity in residential and commercial markets is largely absorbed. At the same time, consumer spending remains solidly in the 5% to 10% growth range, reflecting continued recovery from the extraordinarily large pullback we observed 2008 and 2009.
While these trends indicate that the Arizona economy is heading in the right direction, we must remain cognizant of the significant headwinds that continue. Unemployment remains high and vacancy rates in housing and commercial real estate have only just begun to retreat from their peaks of last year. 
Despite lagging residential valuations for tax purposes, we have seen fairly stable home prices in Metro Phoenix since early 2009 and view it as an indication that new housing supply is in balance with demand, although at very low levels for both. Weak demand for housing is mirrored in the commercial segment as well, where gains in occupancy for retail and office space are marginal, at best. We believe that this situation will continue to restrain new construction and higher levels of growth for at least 2 to 3 years. Over the long term though, we remain confident in Arizona's fundamentals. We expect customer growth and usage to return to stronger levels as the national and state economic environments improve.
Looking at the next several years, we currently expect annual customer growth to average about 1% for 2011 through 2013. Additionally, we expect our average annual weather-normalized retail sales in kilowatt hours to be relatively flat from 2011 through 2013, primarily due to APS's energy efficiency programs offsetting a modest recovery in the economy.
Now turning to our earnings outlook, I point you to Slide 10. We continue to expect our consolidated ongoing earnings for 2011 will be in the range of $2.75 to $2.90 per share. However, primarily due to weather's contribution this quarter, we expect our 2011 performance will be near the top of the range. Our 2011 updated outlook assumes actual weather for the first 9 months and normal weather patterns for the remainder of the year. It also assumes moderating electricity gross margins, with retail customer growth of about 1% and weather-normalized growth in retail's electric sales of about 1%. For your reference, an updated list of key assumptions and factors underlying our revised 2011 outlook is included in the appendix to today's slides.
Lastly, I want to comment on our liquidity and financing. APS ended the third quarter with no short-term debt outstanding and has ample liquidity. Our higher credit rating since June have provided APS and the parent company improved access to short-term funding, as well as the debt capital markets, as evidenced by APS's recent financing. In August, APS issued $300 million of 30-year senior unsecured notes at 5.05%. Net proceeds from the sale of these notes were used, along with cash on hand, to repay $400 million APS's outstandings unsecured senior notes at 6 3/8% that matured on October 15.
To close my remarks today, we continue to be comfortable with our ability to fund APS's capital expenditure program with no new equity needed until 2012 at the earliest.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Don. Don?"

I know it's a busy day for you, and we all look forward to seeing most of you next week at EEI.  Since our last earnings call, we've made distinct progress in key areas and continued our track record",1442,"Thanks, Jim, and thank you all for joining us today. I know it's a busy day for you, and we all look forward to seeing most of you next week at EEI.  
Since our last earnings call, we've made distinct progress in key areas and continued our track record of operational excellence. Today, I'll update you on the 4 following topics: one, APS's pending general retail rate case and other Arizona regulatory developments; two, our investments in renewable resources and other generation; three, our recent operating performance; and four, the sale of our unregulated energy services subsidiary.
We know Arizona regulation and APS's recently filed retail rate case are top of mind for most of you. As I've discussed on our last call, APS filed a general retail rate case on June 1 of this year. Through the rate application, APS requested a $95 million net base rate increase effective July 1 of 2012. Details of the request, as well as key underlying assumptions, are outlined in the appendix to today's slides. 
The rate case proposals contain a number of benefits for our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders. The requested regulatory treatment would build upon the constructive regulatory framework established in the 2009 settlement and would provide the financial support APS needs to achieve Arizona's ambitious energy goals. Since the case was filed, we have continued to communicate with the Arizona Corporation Commission staff and interveners regarding the details of the case and its intent. 
Upcoming key dates in this proceeding are as follows: first, the ACC staff and interveners will file their direct testimony on all matters, except rate design, on November 18 and the remaining direct testimony on December 2; second, the parties plan to enter into formal settlement discussions on November 30 with the goal of filing a settlement agreement with the Commission by December 23; third, if a settlement is not reached and the parties proceed to litigation, APS will file its rebuttal testimony on December 23; and fourth, whether or not the case settles, the hearing on the rate application is scheduled to begin on January 19. The procedural schedule is noteworthy, and it is designed to allow for a final ACC decision by July 1 of 2012, a date consistent with APS's rate application and 2009 regulatory settlement.  
Several ACC decisions over the last few years signal progress in Arizona's regulatory environment. We appreciate the opportunity to continue working with the commission and various stakeholders to further enhance the state's regulatory framework, address several regulatory and operational issues and find solutions that balance the interest of customers, shareholders and other stakeholders alike. We look forward to working toward that goal in our ongoing state regulatory proceedings.
Turning to renewable resources and our AZ Sun development activities. We're on track with plans to significantly increase the amount of renewable energy that APS provides for our retail customers. In doing so, we place strong emphasis on solar power, because Arizona has some of the best solar conditions in the world. The AZ Sun program is APS's plan to develop and own utility-scaled photovoltaic plants in Arizona.
The first phase of the program, which includes 100 megawatts of solar resources, is nearing completion. As a part of that first phase, in the past 2 months, we have placed 2 17-megawatt power plants in the commercial operations, the Paloma plant and the Cotton Center plant, each located in Gila Bend, Arizona, a town about 35 miles southwest to Phoenix. Together, these plants add 34 megawatts of solar capacity to the APS generation mix. We expect another 11 megawatt solar plant to come online later this year at the Hyder facility in southwestern Arizona. Thus, we plan to have a total of 45 megawatts of AZ Sun projects in operation by year-end.
Construction and other development activities are underway at 3 sites for an additional 38 megawatts. These facilities are expected to be in service in 2012 and 2013. Procurement activities are in process for the balance of capacity needed to complete the first phase of the AZ Sun program. 
APS has also proposed a second phase of the AZ Sun program as part of its 2012 RES implementation plan filed with the Arizona commission on July 1 of this year. In Phase 2, APS would place another 100 megawatts of utility-scaled plants in service in the 2013 to 2015 timeframe, with a potential capital investment of up to $475 million. We've requested constructive regulatory treatment for the facilities through the renewable energy surcharge, until the plants are recovered to base rates, consistent with the treatment afforded our 2009 regulatory settlement.
Last week, the Arizona Corporation Commission staff issued its recommendation on the 2012 RES implementation plan, which included approval of Phase 2 of the AZ Sun program and our requested regulatory treatment. Assuming the commissioner's consideration follows the timing related to previous year's RES implementation plans, we expect a decision from the Commission on the 2012 plan around the end of this year. For your reference, the appendix to our slide today contains summaries of both phases of the AZ Sun program. We're excited about the AZ Sun program and our other renewable energy initiatives. They're important steps toward advancing Arizona's sustainable energy future.  
Turning to the status of our Four Corners plant. Last November, we announced our multipart plan to address several challenges facing our Four Corners coal-fired plant in northwestern New Mexico. The plan presents a creative solution to address new environmental regulations and maintains our well-balanced resource portfolio. We believe our plan has substantial merits economically, environmentally and socially. A summary of the plan is included in the appendix to our slides.
In short, the plan includes: APS buying Southern California Edison's 739-megawatt interest in Units 4 and 5, which is targeted for closing in the second half of 2012; shutting down Units 1, 2 and 3, which are wholly owned by APS, in total 560 megawatts in size; and capital expenditures for environmental compliance on APS's expanded share of Units 4 and 5, which would be far less than the amount APS would need to spend if it were instead to bring our existing interest in all 5 plant units into compliance with proposed EPA rules.
The acquisition requires approval by Arizona and California and federal regulators and other government agencies. In Arizona, the Corporation Commission completed a hearing on the matter on September 1, and the parties have completed post-hearing briefs. We're awaiting a recommendation from the administrative law judge before the matter is brought before the commission for a vote. We remain optimistic that APS and Southern California Edison will obtain rulings from their respective commissions in a timely manner. Our acquisition is also conditioned upon the execution of a new coal supply agreement, which is currently in negotiation, as well as expiration of the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period and other typical closing conditions.
Looking at our power plant performance, our baseload coal and nuclear fleet continues to perform very well. Our coal-fired plants continue their top tier performance. In the third quarter, our coal fleet posted a capacity factor of 87%, which is well above the most recently available industry average of 68%. During the third quarter, our Palo Verde nuclear facility operated at a 96% capacity factor. Currently, Unit 1 is in a planned refueling outage, which we expect to be completed early this month, reflecting a schedule of approximately 33 days.
Turning to the overall quality of our operation. We are pleased that 2 prominent organizations recognized our company's sustainability and corporate response building efforts during the third quarter of this year. First, Pinnacle West was named to the Dow Jones North American Sustainability Index for the seventh straight year, and furthermore, our company was 1 of only 12 electric utilities included in the index. Second, Pinnacle West was the top-ranked utility in Corporate Responsibility Magazine's list of the 100 Best Corporate Citizens and ranked 15th best overall.
Finally, regarding our non-utility operations. We continue to focus on our core utility business and streamlining the company. Toward that end, in August, we sold our competitive energy services subsidiary, APS Energy Services, for an after-tax gain of $10 million.
In summary, our company aims to achieve top tier performance, and we constantly work toward that objective in every facet of our business. Going forward, we are committed to maintaining operational excellence and achieving superior financial results by concentrating on our core electric utility business and proactively managing the challenges facing our industry.
This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, at this time, we'd be pleased to take any questions."
