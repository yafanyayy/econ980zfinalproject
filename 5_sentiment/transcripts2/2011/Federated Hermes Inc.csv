I will start with a brief review of Federated's recent business performance before turning the call over to Tom to discuss our financials.
Looking first at cash management, Money Market assets were up $15 billion from the prior quarter, with about $3 billion of this coming from the completion of the SunTrust Money Market acquisition. As you can see by looking at the average assets, inflows came in later in the quarter as we've seen at other year ends. So far in January, Money Market assets are down slightly. While market conditions continue to be challenging, our cash management business remains well-positioned, strong and stable.
The fourth quarter saw an uptick in Money Fund Yield waivers to just the beyond the high side of our population us quarter. Tom will comment on the waiver impact in his remarks. We continue to expect that these waivers will not change much until a clear path to higher short-term rates and Fed increases emerges. Debbie will talk about our rate outlook a bit later. 
Our Money Market fund share at the end of the year was about 8.8%. This compares to about 8.5% at year-end '09 and year-end '08, and about 7% in '07 and about 5% at the beginning of the year 2000. On the regulatory front, Federated and many others have responded to the SEC's request for comments to options discussed in the President's working group report. In our view, the changes made in 2010 to Rule 2a-7 which are still being implemented by the industry of further strengthen the framework that has worked exceptionally well for over 30 years. We believe it would be appropriate to allow these measures to be fully implemented and evaluated over a longer time frame before considering this option of additional regulatory changes. 
We continue to support the liquidity bank measure what was proposed by the industry through the ICI Working Group. We see this as an option that will enhance money fund resiliency by offering a source of additional liquidity or high-quality investments, but importantly, does not socialize credit risk and does not provide for a guarantee on the money funds which we believe is neither practical nor necessary.
Turning to other products, we have a variety of equity funds with solid records that we expect to gather assets as the market conditions continue to improve. Gross and net sales in the fourth quarter were strongest in our strategic value dividend fund, which is well-positioned as investors increasingly look for income from equity investments. The Kaufmann Large Cap Fund recently marked its three year anniversary and with its strong performance, achieved strong ratings and positive flows. The Kaufmann Small-cap fund also had positive flows during the fourth quarter. 
Our International group has produced a very solid performance over the last year. We saw positive flows into the international leaders and international strategic value funds in the fourth quarter. On the value side, the Clover Small Value Fund has performed well and has produced positive flows in the fourth quarter. 
While our growth equity fund sales increased about 7% in the fourth quarter from the prior quarter, flows were negative due mainly to outflows in the Prudent Bear fund. We position this fund as an overall enhancement to a portfolio over market cycles, and we believe that this is how most of the shareholders use the fund. Yet, we have seen that the fund tends to acquire assets in down markets that experienced outflows in up markets.  This fund had inflows of $216 million in the third quarter and then moved to outflows of $295 million in the fourth quarter for a swing of over $500 million. 
By looking at the first quarter results for the first few weeks, equity flows had been modestly negative. Within equity separate accounts, outflows were largely due to net redemptions in Quant products, the MBT, SMA and institutional accounts. We won the small-cap growth additional mandate that we expect to find the next quarter with about $120 million.
Looking at bond funds, our growth sales were up slightly in Q4, while net sales decreased from Q3 consistent with industry trends. However, our total return bond fund showed higher growth and net sales compared to Q3, and our high yield funds remained in positive flows. 
Ultrashort products swung from positive in the third quarter to slightly negative in the fourth quarter. On the mutiny bond side, growth sales were higher in Q4 than Q3, but we saw negative flows in the group compared to the positive flows in Q3.
Bond flows are negative in the first couple of weeks of January due in part to a $200 million redemption from total return bond fund from a client reaching its fund asset concentration limit. We've also seen a pickup in mini bond fund redemption. In fixed income separate accounts, we had a solid quarter of net inflows over $800 million, and we expect about $350 million of new assets to fund in the first quarter.
Turning to fund investment performance and looking at year-end Lipper rankings for Federated Equity funds, 25% weighted assets were in the first or second quartile over the last year; 21%, three years; 65%, five years and 83%, 10 years. For bond fund assets of the comparable first and second quartile percentages are 31%, one year; 65%, three years; 74%, five years; and 66%, 10 years.
As of January 26, our managed assets were approximately $356 billion, including $274 billion in money markets, $31 billion in equities and $51 billion in fixed income including our liquidation portfolio. Money market mutual fund assets stand at about $241 billion. So far in January, our money fund assets have ranged between $236 billion and $245 billion and have averaged right about $241 billion. 
Regarding acquisitions, we continue to look for an alliance to further advance our business outside the U.S. as a component of our strategy to expand globally. We remain active in looking for consolidation deals, including money market business. As always, we cannot predict the probability or timing of any potential deals.

As mentioned in the press release, our results this quarter were impacted by a non-cash impairment charge. Operating income was up from Q3 by $4 million, excluding the $3.2 million impairment charge, it would have been up by $7.2 million",501,"Thank you, Chris. As mentioned in the press release, our results this quarter were impacted by a non-cash impairment charge. Operating income was up from Q3 by $4 million, excluding the $3.2 million impairment charge, it would have been up by $7.2 million. EPS of $0.45 would've been $0.47 excluding the impairment charge up from $0.42 for Q3. 
Money fund yield waivers reduced revenues by about $6 million more in Q4 that in Q3, with about $5 million of this offset by lower related distribution expense. These waivers reduced operating income by $12.3 million for the quarter compared to $11.2 million in the prior quarter. Based on current market conditions and asset levels, we expect these waivers to reduce operating income by about the same amount in the first quarter. We do not expect the impact from waivers to change materially from this level until the market begins to factor in the potential for Fed increases and then again, when the Fed actually begins to increase interest rates. As Chris said, Debbie will comment and give our rate outlook in a few minutes. 
Looking forward, we estimate that gaining another 10 basis points in gross yields will likely reduce the impact of these waivers by about 1/3 from the current level, and a 25 basis point increase would reduce the impact by about 2/3.
Turning to expenses, compensation and related expense was down by $5 million from Q3. Late in the fourth quarter the Board of Directors approved a change to the Executive Compensation Program for 2010 that resulted in a greater percentage of incentive compensation to be paid in the form of restricted stock and previously estimated. The computation expense from the restricted stock program will be recorded over the next three years as the stock is met. This change was made only for 2010 and made up the majority of the reduction in comp compared to Q3.
For Q1, we currently expect compensation and related expense will be in a range of $64 million to $66 million. Of course, there are a number of factors that could move Q1 computation outside this estimate.
Distribution expense was flat despite higher money market fund assets due to higher yield waivers. The impairment charge recorded was due to a decrease in the fair value of certain assets from the acquisition on NDP Advisers, our quantitative equity group. We have approximately $3.5 million in remaining book value in the amortizable assets from this acquisition. 
Looking at our balance sheet, cash and marketable securities totaled $334 million at year-end. This combined with the expected additional cash flows from operations and availability under present debt facilities provides us with significant liquidity to be able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities when they arrive, as well as the ability to fund related contingent payments, share repurchases, dividends, new product fees and other investments, capital expenditures and debt repayments.
Before we open up the call for questions, Debbie, could you please comment on Fed interest rate outlook?"

We are still in the range of 0.25 on the target basis in case anybody missed the announcement this week. The yield curve for money market securities has begun to two to three basis points at this time. It ranges from 20 basis points on average on an overnight basis. That's about 80 basis points for one year paper. So again, slightly steeper as that curve and in the 75 to  78 basis points area a quarter ago. 
Our outlook is still that we will not see actual Fed increases until later in the second half of 2011. But we do continue to expect some yield improvement beginning probably in the summer of 2011, based on what will be an expectation of increasing rates and a steeper yield curve that infuses that point. We have begun to reduce the average maturity of our money market funds in anticipation of that steeper yield curve which we feel is more imminent today that it might have been at all during the 2010  time period. We think also that the credit situation in the marketplace is improving, and that also should play through to a bit of a steeper and more positively developed yield curve as the year goes on. And from a regulatory perspective, Chris mentioned the PWT but there a whole host of other regulations and implications from the FDIC, Moody's and others that are developing in a pretty positive sense for the industry and for Federated money market funds franchise in particular. We continue to work diligently on these topics."

We're basing that on some of the strength we are seeing in the economy today. We continue to see it gather a little bit of steam. Importantly, looking at the affluent the comments what is not seen as much strength as the Fed would like to see is the employment situation. That's obviously the one that the big monitoring item at this point. And we continue to see improvements, there but not to the degree that the Fed would like. 3Q seems to be a focus of the Fed, and that is one that I think is probably a look at more positive in the context of when we might see a rate hike begin to develop in that a good portion of the programs behind us at this point. And although the beginning of it with some resistance from the bond fund perspective with increasing longer-term rates initially, that seems to have developed the little bit more positive of a sense that that is probably a little bit more comfortable with that side of the equation. And as such, with the economy continuing to make improvements on most funds, including the employment fund although not as much as one. We're still working towards the end of the second half of 2011 at this point."

Any time you require a payment into, in this case, a liquidity bank, you could have that effect.

But overall, I think the comment that while the most important factor is the ability to control redemptions, what I said on that is when a person or an individual or a company can run a money market fund almost indefinitely if they can pull all the redemptions. There are a lot more important factors, and so I'm not trying to quarrel with you about the words, but I want to clear that up as well. So we are strongly in favor of that liquidity bank, and yes, there could be some effect on people who don't want to put any money up at all.

One of our attorneys here, Gene Maloney, has done an extensive work on this with the regulators and with various of our clients.

Remember, that a lot of our business grew out of our relationship with trust departments that was started in the '70s and has continued through these many decades.

I can't predict how it's going to come out. There's a nice, big, fat proposal that came out this week. But this has gone back and forth, both through Dodd-Frank and through his latest iteration.

That was announced being that wound on sooner. This is with regard obviously to the debt dealing, which will eventually get fixed and then the supplemental financing will be reintroduced. But in that interim time, as that supplemental financing program is wound down, there will be less collateral in the marketplace and what will end up seeing in our short-term rates on an overnight basis likely going lower and as you know also with regard to treasuries in the marketplace. So we do think that will have a definitive impact. We've seen it happen before. The expectation is that it will happen again. And the question is what is the time frame involved. Will it last for a week? Does it last for a month? How long before the debt dealing gets fixed and it kind of returns to the normal level? With regard to the FDIC we think that's much, much more intangible at this point as there are many variations and questions about how the assessments will be levied. And as such, we really don't feel like at this point there's a quantifiable impact. If I were quoted to saying five basis points, somebody took that out of context.

And so if that happens, then that will be another whole press and it will be one where we think Federated will be the indispensable party in order to help explain how that goes. Now frankly, a lot of what's been going on, if you remember by analogy, when Y2K came along and everybody had a complaint about fixing all their computers, and then it turns out that doing the house cleaning was pretty good, this whole regulatory overlay has given us the opportunity to get in with clients and get to studying things. For example, the thread on 12 B-1 one which we don't see really happening right now, but it gives us opportunity to get in with the best clients on ways that don't show up in distribution activity because you have your defense on the field.

I will start with a brief review of Federated's recent business performance before turning the call over to Tom to discuss our financials.Looking first at cash management, Money Market assets were up to $15 bil",1024,"Well and thank you, Ray, and good morning. I will start with a brief review of Federated's recent business performance before turning the call over to Tom to discuss our financials.
Looking first at cash management, Money Market assets were up to $15 billion from the prior quarter, with about $3 billion of this coming from the completion of the SunTrust Money Market acquisition. As you can see, by looking at the average assets, inflows came in later in the quarter as we've seen at other year ends. So far in January, Money Market assets are down slightly. While market conditions continue to be challenging, our cash management business remains well-positioned, strong and stable.
The fourth quarter saw an uptick in money fund yield waivers to just the beyond the high side of our calculation last quarter. Tom will comment on the waiver impact in his remarks. We continue to expect that these waivers will not change much until a clear path to higher short-term rates and Fed increases emerges. Debbie will talk about our rate outlook a bit later. 
Our Money Market fund share at the end of the year was about 8.8%. This compares to about 8.5% at year-end '09 and year-end '08, and about 7% for '07 and about 5% at the beginning of the year 2000. On the regulatory front, Federated and many others have responded to the SEC's request for comments to the options discussed in the President's working group report. In our view, the changes made in 2010 to Rule 2a-7, which are still being implemented by the industry have further strengthened the framework that has worked exceptionally well for over 30 years. We believe it would be appropriate to allow these measures to be fully implemented and evaluated over a longer time frame before considering this option of additional regulatory changes. 
We continue to support the liquidity bank measure that was proposed by the industry through the ICI Working Group. We see this as an option that will enhance money fund resiliency by offering a source of additional liquidity or high-quality investments, but importantly, it does not socialize credit risk and does not provide for a guarantee on money funds, which we believe is neither practical nor necessary.
Turning to other products, we have a variety of equity funds with solid records that we expect to gather assets as the market conditions continue to improve. Gross and net sales in the fourth quarter were strongest in our strategic value dividend fund, which is well-positioned as investors increasingly look for income from equity investments. The Kaufmann Large Cap Fund recently marked its three-year anniversary and with its strong performance, achieved strong ratings and positive flows. The Kaufmann Small Cap fund also had positive flows during the fourth quarter. 
Our International group has produced a very solid performance over the last year. We saw positive flows into the international leaders and international strategic value funds in the fourth quarter. On the value side, the Clover Small Value Fund has performed well and has produced positive flows in the fourth quarter. 
While our gross equity fund sales increased about 7% in the fourth quarter from the prior quarter, flows were negative due mainly to outflows in the Prudent Bear fund. But we position this fund as an overall enhancement to a portfolio over market cycles. And we believed that this is how most of the shareholders use the fund. Yet, we have seen that the fund tends to acquire assets in down markets that experienced outflows in up markets.  This fund had inflows of $216 million in the third quarter and then moved to outflows of $295 million in the fourth quarter for a swing of over $500 million. 
By looking at the first quarter results for the first few weeks, equity flows had been modestly negative. Within equity separate accounts, outflows were largely due to net redemptions in Quant products, MBT, SMA and institutional accounts. We won the small-cap growth institutional mandate that we expect to fund next quarter with about $120 million.
Looking at Bond Funds, our gross sales were up slightly in Q4, while net sales decreased from Q3 consistent with industry trends. However, our Total Return Bond Fund showed higher gross and net sales compared to Q3, and our high-yield funds remained in positive flows. 
Ultrashort products swung from positive in the third quarter to slightly negative in the fourth quarter. On the muni bond side, gross sales were higher in Q4 than Q3, but we saw negative flows in the group compared to the positive flows in Q3. Bond flows are negative in the first couple of weeks of January due in part to a $200 million redemption from Total Return Bond Fund from a client reaching its fund asset concentration limit. We've also seen a pickup in muni bond fund redemption. In fixed income separate accounts, we had a solid quarter of net inflows over $800 million, and we expect about $350 million of new assets to fund in the first quarter.
Turning to fund investment performance and looking at year-end Lipper rankings for Federated equity funds, 25% of rated assets are in the first or second quartile over the last year; 21%, three years; 65%, five years and 83%, 10 years. For Bond Fund assets of the comparable first and second quartile percentages are 31%, one year; 65%, three years; 74%, five years; and 66%, 10 years.
As of January 26, our managed assets were approximately $356 billion, including $274 billion in money markets, $31 billion in equities and $51 billion in fixed income including our liquidation portfolio. Money Market mutual fund assets stand at about $241 billion. So far in January, our money fund assets have ranged between $236 billion and $245 billion and have average right about $241 billion. 
Regarding acquisitions, we continue to look for an alliance to further advance our business outside the U.S. as a component of our strategy to expand globally. We remain active in looking for consolidation deals, including money market business. As always, we cannot predict the probability or timing of any potential deals.

As mentioned in the press release, our results for this quarter were impacted by a non-cash impairment charge. Operating income was up from Q3 by $4 million, excluding the $3.2 million impairment charge, it would have been up by $7.2 mil",503,"Thank you, Chris. As mentioned in the press release, our results for this quarter were impacted by a non-cash impairment charge. Operating income was up from Q3 by $4 million, excluding the $3.2 million impairment charge, it would have been up by $7.2 million. EPS of $0.45 would have been $0.47, excluding the impairment charge up from $0.42 for Q3. 
Money fund yield waivers reduced revenues by about $6 million more in Q4 that in Q3, with about $5 million of this offset by lower related distribution expense. These waivers reduced operating income by $12.3 million for the quarter compared to $11.2 million in the prior quarter. Based on current market conditions and asset levels, we expect these waivers to reduce operating income by about the same amount in the first quarter. We do not expect the impact from waivers to change materially from this level until the market begins to factor in the potential for Fed increases, and then again, when the Fed actually begins to increase interest rates. As Chris said, Debbie will comment and give our rate outlook in a few minutes. 
Looking forward, we estimate that gaining another 10 basis points in gross yields will likely reduce the impact of these waivers by about 1/3 from the current level, and a 25 basis point increase would reduce the impact by about 2/3.
Turning to expenses. Compensation and related expense was down by $5 million from Q3. Late in the fourth quarter the Board of Directors approved a change to the Executive Compensation Program for 2010 that resulted in a greater percentage of incentive compensation to be paid in the form of restricted stock and previously estimated. The computation expense from the restricted stock program will be recorded over the next three years as the stock vest. This change was made only for 2010 and made up the majority of the reduction in comp compared to Q3.
For Q1, we currently expect compensation and related expense will be in a range of $64 million to $66 million. Of course, there are a number of factors that could move Q1 compensation outside of this estimate. Distribution expense was flat despite higher Money Market fund assets due to higher-yield waivers. The impairment charge recorded was due to a decrease in the fair value of certain assets from the acquisition on MDT Advisers, our quantitative equity group. We have approximately $3.5 million in the remaining book value in the amortizable assets from this acquisition. 
Looking at our balance sheet, cash and marketable securities totaled $334 million at year-end. This combined with the expected additional cash flows from operations and availability under present debt facilities provides us with significant liquidity to be able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities when they arise, as well as the ability to fund related contingent payments, share repurchases, dividends, new product fees and other investments, capital expenditures and debt repayments.
Before we open up the call for questions, Debbie, could you please comment on Federated's  interest rate outlook?"

We still are in a range of 0% to 0.25% on the Fed Fund's target, just in case anybody missed the FOMC announcement this week. The yield curve for money market securities has begun to steepen our target [ph] maybe two to three basis points at this time. It ranges from 20 basis points on average, on an overnight basis that's about 80 basis points for one year paper. So again, slightly steeper as that curve ended in the 75 to 78 basis points area a quarter ago. 
Our outlook is still that we will not see actual Fed increases until later in the second half of 2011. But we do continue to expect some yield improvement beginning probably in the summer of 2011, based on what will be an expectation of increasing rates and a steeper yield curve that infuse at that point. We have begun to reduce the average maturity of our money market funds in anticipation of that steeper yield curve, which we feel is more imminent today than it might have been at all during the 2010 time period. We think also that the credit situation in the marketplace is improving, and that also should play through to a bit of a steeper and more positively developed yield curve as the year goes on. And from a regulatory perspective, Chris mentioned the PWG but there are whole host of other regulations and implications from FSOC [Financial System Oversight Council], the FCIB [Finance, Credit and International Business], Moody's and others  that are developing in a pretty positive sense for the industry and for Federated Money Market funds franchise in particular.

We're basing that on some of the strength we are seeing in the economy. Today, we've continued to see it gather a little bit of steam. Importantly, looking at the FOMC comments, what has not deemed as much strength as the Fed would like to see is the employment situation. That's obviously the one that the big monitoring item at this, point. And we continue to see improvements there, but not to the degree that the Fed would like. 3Q seems to be also a focus of the Fed, and that's one that I think is probably a little more positive in the context of when we might see a rate hike begins to develop in that -- a good portion of the program is behind us at this point. And although the beginning of it met with some resistance from the Bond Fund perspective with increasing longer-term rates initially, that seems to have developed being a little bit more positive of a sense, at this point, if I think the Fed is probably a little bit more comfortable with that side of the equation. And as such, with the economy continuing to make improvements on most funds, including the employment fund although not as much as one agrees. We're still working towards the end of the second half of 2011 at this point."

So that part of it, everyone will be playing with the same rates in order to be a participant in the liquidity bank. So that kind of a factor is not much. But overall, I think the comment that while the most important factor is the ability to control redemptions, what I said on that is that a person or an individual or a company can run a money market fund almost indefinitely if they can pull all the redemptions. There are a lot more important factors, and so I'm not trying to quibble with you about the words, but I wanted to clear that up as well. So we are strongly in favor of that liquidity bank. And yes, there could be some effect on people who don't want to put any money up at all. But we think it's worth it because of the advantages of such a liquidity bank."

In fact, a little bit more tangible and predictable let's say that, that was announced being wound down sooner. This is with regard, obviously, to the debt ceiling, which will eventually get fixed, and then, the supplemental financing will be reintroduced. But in that interim time, as that supplemental financing program is wound down, there will be less collateral in the marketplace. And what we'll end up seeing are short-term rates, on an overnight basis, likely going lower, and as you know, also, with regard to treasuries in the marketplace. So we do think that will have a definitive impact. We've seen it happen before. The expectation would be it happens again. The question is, ""What's the time frame involved? Does it last for a week? Does it last for a month? How long before the debt ceiling gets fixed and just kind of returns to a normal level?"" With regard to the FDIC we think that's much, much more intangible at this point. There are many variations and questions about how the assessments will be levied. And as such, we really don't feel as though that at this point there's a quantifiable impact.

And we're liking how we're seeing that work out, especially because that product, the strategic value dividend product, look pretty good on that front. We're seeing also life on the broker-dealer side for the same reasons. But also inside some of the old distribution, where it's basically back or it hasn't really changed from blocking and tackling. The movement that we talked about earlier of into fiduciary, if that really switches on, then many of our clients are going to need to come to us for discussion and aptitudes and training on how to deal with this new concept. And so if that happens, then that'll be another whole press, and it will be one where we think Federated will be the indispensable party in order to help explain how that goes. Now frankly, a lot of what's been going on, if you remember by analogy, when Y2K came along and everybody had a complaint about fixing all their computers, and then it turns out that doing the housecleaning was pretty good, this whole regulatory overlay has given us the opportunity to get in with clients and get to studying things. For example, the threat on 12b-1, which we don't see really happening right now, but it gives us opportunity to get in with the best clients on ways that don't show up as a distribution activity because you have your defense on the field, but yet, it moves into positive-type discussions. So it's trying to make a little bit of lemonade out of the lemons that we've been dealing with.

Yes, you're going to have better performance and that'll tend to help with that, so we just set that one aside. The counseling of our wholesalers is a different issue. Some of the clients that we have, the intermediaries are looking it up to fill sandboxes or to provide the sandboxes that they play in. And then others are looking for a more of a total concept like total return bond funds. It depends on which branch of advisory you're talking about. And our wholesalers who's dealing with some who's looking at us at supplying different sandboxes for them to make the decisions, they are defending the efficacy of each one of those sandboxes and showing how they work and exactly the kinds of stories that I would tell you on mid-cap Kaufmann Fund. And if they're looking for a large-cap growth fund, then obviously, the Kaufmann is a good entry. So that's what it depends -- it's not exactly a deal where we sit up on Mount Olympus and try and direct the salesmen, who are the wholesalers, as to what has to happen.

I will start with a brief review of Federated's recent business performance before turning the call over to Tom to discuss our financials.
Looking first at cash management, Money Market assets were up to $15 billion from the prior quarter, with about $3 billion of this coming from the completion of the SunTrust Money Market acquisition. As you can see, by looking at the average assets, inflows came in later in the quarter as we've seen at other year ends. So far in January, Money Market assets are down slightly. While market conditions continue to be challenging, our cash management business remains well positioned, strong and stable.
The fourth quarter saw an uptick in money fund yield waivers to just the beyond the high side of our calculation last quarter. Tom will comment on the waiver impact in his remarks. We continue to expect that these waivers will not change much until a clear path to higher short-term rates and Fed increases emerges. Now Debbie will talk about our rate outlook a bit later. 
Our Money Market fund share at the end of the year was about 8.8%. This compares to about 8.5% at year-end '09 and year-end '08, and about 7% for '07 and about 5% at the beginning of the year 2000. On the regulatory front, Federated and many others have responded to the SEC's request for comments to the options discussed in the President's working group report. In our view, the changes made in 2010 to Rule 2a-7, which are still being implemented by the industry, have further strengthened the framework that has worked exceptionally well for over 30 years. We believe it would be appropriate to allow these measures to be fully implemented and evaluated over a longer time frame, before considering this option of additional regulatory changes. 
We continue to support the liquidity bank measure that was proposed by the industry through the ICI Working Group. We see this as an option that will enhance money fund resiliency by offering a source of additional liquidity or high-quality investments; but importantly, it does not socialize credit risk and does not provide for a guarantee on money funds, which we believe is neither practical nor necessary.
Turning to other products, we have a variety of equity funds with solid records that we expect to gather assets as the market conditions continue to improve. Gross and net sales in the fourth quarter were strongest in our strategic value dividend fund, which is well positioned as investors increasingly look for income from equity investments. The Kaufmann Large Cap Fund recently marked its three-year anniversary and with its strong performance, achieved strong ratings and positive flows. The Kaufmann Small Cap fund also had positive flows during the fourth quarter. 
Our International group has produced a very solid performance over the last year. We saw positive flows into the international leaders and international strategic value funds in the fourth quarter. On the value side, the Clover Small Value Fund has performed well and has produced positive flows in the fourth quarter. 
While our gross equity fund sales increased about 7% in the fourth quarter from the prior quarter, flows were negative, due mainly to outflows in the Prudent Bear fund. But we position this fund as an overall enhancement to a portfolio over market cycles. And we believed that this is how most of the shareholders use the fund. Yet, we have seen that the fund tends to acquire assets in down markets that experience outflows in up markets.  This fund had inflows of $216 million in the third quarter and then moved to outflows of $295 million in the fourth quarter, for a swing of over $500 million. 
By looking at the first quarter results for the first few weeks, equity flows have been modestly negative. Within equity separate accounts, outflows were largely due to net redemptions in Quant products, MBT, SMA and institutional accounts. We won the small-cap growth institutional mandate that we expect to fund next quarter with about $120 million.
Looking at Bond Funds, our gross sales were up slightly in Q4, while net sales decreased from Q3 consistent with industry trends. However, our Total Return Bond Fund showed higher gross and net sales compared to Q3, and our high-yield funds remained in positive flows. 
Ultrashort products swung from positive in the third quarter to slightly negative in the fourth quarter. On the muni bond side, gross sales were higher in Q4 than Q3, but we saw negative flows in the group compared to the positive flows in Q3. Bond flows are negative in the first couple of weeks of January, due in part to a $200 million redemption from Total Return Bond Fund from a client reaching its fund asset concentration limit. We've also seen a pickup in muni bond fund redemption. In fixed income separate accounts, we had a solid quarter of net inflows over $800 million, and we expect about $350 million of new assets to fund in the first quarter.
Turning to fund investment performance and looking at year-end Lipper rankings for Federated equity funds: 25% of rated assets are in the first or second quartile over the last year; 21%, three years; 65%, five years; and 83%, 10 years. For Bond Fund assets of the comparable first and second quartile percentages are 31%, one year; 65%, three years; 74%, five years; and 66%, 10 years.
As of January 26, our managed assets were approximately $356 billion, including $274 billion in money markets, $31 billion in equities and $51 billion in fixed income, including our liquidation portfolio. Money Market mutual fund assets stand at about $241 billion. So far in January, our money fund assets have ranged between $236 billion and $245 billion and have averaged right about $241 billion. 
Regarding acquisitions, we continue to look for an alliance to further advance our business outside the U.S. as a component of our strategy to expand globally. We remain active in looking for consolidation deals, including money market business. As always, we cannot predict the probability or timing of any potential deals.

As mentioned in the press release, our results for this quarter were impacted by a non-cash impairment charge. Operating income was up from Q3 by $4 million. Excluding the $3.2 million impairment charge, it would have been up by $7.2 million. EPS of $0.45 would have been $0.47, excluding the impairment charge up from $0.42 for Q3. 
Money fund yield waivers reduced revenues by about $6 million more in Q4 than in Q3, with about $5 million of this offset by lower related distribution expense. These waivers reduced operating income by $12.3 million for the quarter, compared to $11.2 million in the prior quarter. Based on current market conditions and asset levels, we expect these waivers to reduce operating income by about the same amount in the first quarter. We do not expect the impact from waivers to change materially from this level until the market begins to factor in the potential for Fed increases and then, again, when the Fed actually begins to increase interest rates. As Chris said, Debbie will comment and give our rate outlook in a few minutes. 
Looking forward, we estimate that gaining another 10 basis points in gross yields will likely reduce the impact of these waivers by about 1/3 from the current level, and a 25 basis point increase would reduce the impact by about 2/3.
Turning to expenses. Compensation and related expense was down by $5 million from Q3. Late in the fourth quarter, the Board of Directors approved a change to the Executive Compensation Program for 2010 that resulted in a greater percentage of incentive compensation to be paid in the form of restricted stock than previously estimated. The computation expense from the restricted stock program will be recorded over the next three years as the stock vest. This change was made only for 2010 and made up the majority of the reduction in comp compared to Q3.
For Q1, we currently expect compensation and related expense will be in a range of $64 million to $66 million. Of course, there are a number of factors that could move Q1 compensation outside of this estimate. Distribution expense was flat despite higher Money Market fund assets, due to higher-yield waivers. The impairment charge recorded was due to a decrease in the fair value of certain assets from the acquisition on MDT Advisers, our quantitative equity group. We have approximately $3.5 million in the remaining book value in the amortizable assets from this acquisition. 
Looking at our balance sheet, cash and marketable securities totaled $334 million at year end. This combined with the expected additional cash flows from operations and availability under present debt facilities provides us with significant liquidity to be able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities when they arise, as well as the ability to fund related contingent payments, share repurchases, dividends, new product fees and other investments, capital expenditures and debt repayments.
Before we open up the call for questions, Debbie, could you please comment on Federated's  interest rate outlook?"

We still are in a range of 0% to 0.25% on the Fed Fund's target, just in case anybody missed the FOMC announcement this week. The yield curve for money market securities has begun to steepen a tad bit, maybe two to three basis points at this time. It ranges from 20 basis points, on average, on an overnight basis, that's about 80 basis points for one year paper. So again, slightly steeper as that curve ended in the 75 to 78 basis points area a quarter ago. 
Our outlook is still that we will not see actual Fed increases until later in the second half of 2011. But we do continue to expect some yield improvement beginning, probably, in the summer of 2011, based on what will be an expectation of increasing rates and a steeper yield curve that infuse at that point. We have begun to reduce the average maturity of our money market funds in anticipation of that steeper yield curve, which we feel is more imminent today than it might have been at all during the 2010 time period. We think also that the credit situation in the marketplace is improving, and that also should play through to a bit of a steeper and more positively developed yield curve as the year goes on. And from a regulatory perspective, Chris mentioned the PWG but there are whole host of other regulations and implications from FSOC [Financial System Oversight Council], the FCIB [Finance, Credit and International Business], Moody's and others  that are developing in a pretty positive sense for the industry and for Federated Money Market funds franchise, in particular. We continue to work diligently on these topics."

We're basing that on some of the strength that we are seeing in the economy, today. We've continued to see it gather a little bit of steam. Importantly, looking at the FOMC comments, what has not deemed as much strength as the Fed would like to see is the employment situation. That's obviously the one that the big monitoring item at this point. And we continue to see improvements there, but not to the degree that the Fed would like. 3Q seems to be also a focus of the Fed, and that's one that I think is probably a little bit more positive in the context of when we might see a rate hike begins to develop in that -- a good portion of the program is behind us at this point. And although the beginning of it met with some resistance from the Bond Fund perspective, with increasing longer-term rates initially, that seems to have developed being a little bit more positive of a sense, at this point, if I think the Fed is probably a little bit more comfortable with that side of the equation. And as such, with the economy continuing to make improvements on most funds, including the employment fund, although not as much as wanted. We're still working towards the end of the second half of 2011, at this point."

There are a lot more important factors, and so I'm not trying to quibble with you about the words, but I wanted to clear that up, as well. So we are strongly in favor of that liquidity bank.

One of our attorneys here, Gene Maloney, has done an extensive work on this, with the regulators and with various of our clients. And whichever way this ends up going, we think we'll be fine with Federated. A lot of clients look at the whole picture and say, ""Okay, what is the relationship I have with my intermediary?"" And however those rules get characterized, we will be there ready, willing and able to help them solve their challenges or respond to regulatory concerns. Remember that a lot of our business grew out of our relationship with trust departments that was started in the '70s and has continued through these many decades. And, therefore, there's a very strong heritage of understanding and dealing with fiduciary requirements that are obviously broader than suitability requirements. I can't predict how it's going to come out. There's a nice, big, fat proposal that came out this week, but this has gone back and forth, both through Dodd-Frank and through this latest iteration. And it's really tough to predict exactly how it will come out, but we don't think it will hurt us, no matter which way it comes out."

In fact, a little bit more tangible and predictable, let's say that, that was announced being wound down sooner. This is with regard, obviously, to the debt ceiling, which will eventually get fixed, and then, the supplemental financing will be reintroduced. But in that interim time, as that supplemental financing program is wound down, there will be less collateral in the marketplace. And what we'll end up seeing are short-term rates, on an overnight basis, likely going lower, and, as you know, also, with regard to treasuries in the marketplace. So we do think that will have a definitive impact. We've seen it happen before. The expectation would be it happens again. The only question is, ""What's the time frame involved? Does it last for a week? Does it last for a month? How long before the debt ceiling gets fixed and just kind of returns to a normal level?"" With regard to the FDIC we think that's much, much more intangible at this point, that there are many variations and questions about how the assessments will be levied. And as such, we really don't feel as though that at this point there's a quantifiable impact. If I were quoted to saying five basis points, somebody definitely took that out of context. And at this point, we're really not offering any kinds of guidance there, but don't think it's meaningful in any way."

And then others are looking for a more of a total concept like total return bond funds. It depends on which branch of advisory you're talking about. And our wholesaler, who's dealing with someone who's looking at us at supplying different sandboxes for them to make the decisions, they are defending the efficacy of each one of those sandboxes and showing how they work and exactly the kinds of stories that I would tell you on mid-cap Kaufmann Fund. And if they're looking for a large-cap growth fund, then obviously, the Kaufmann is a good entry.

I will start with brief review of Federated recent business performance before turning the call over to Tom to discuss our financials. Looking at cash management, Money Market average assets increased from the prior quarter for both our funds and our separate account. As mentioned last call, expected outflows early in Q1 mainly from flows that came in late in the year led to lower period-end fund assets. Growth in average money fund assets was mainly from Wealth Management entrust channel while Money Market separate accounts growth reflected tax seasonality. While market conditions remain challenging, our cash management business is strong and stable with our market share steady at around 8.8%. Debbie will comment later on the recent market conditions, which have further impacted yields and fee waivers, which Tom will also address. 
On the regulatory front, money fonts continue to be an active topic of discussion, Federated and others support the liquidity bank proposal advanced by the industry through the ICI. These enhancements would compliment that new liquidity provision of 287 and would not socialize credit risk. We do not agree with suggested that favor bank-wide regulation or bank-wide capital requirements, which will argue or fall off the point and are more likely produce significant harm that enhanced the resiliency of money funds and important stated objective. In terms of the potential systemic risk designation, we don't believe that we will nor should be designated and have submitted commentary and support for our opinions to the regulators. 
Looking now at our equity business. We are focused on a series of strategies that have solid performance, characteristics and are well suited to meet the particular demand in the market. Leading in this area, strategic value dividend, strategy that continues to produced strong flows and expanded distribution opportunities for both mutual funds and separate accounts. We added an international version of this strategy in mid-2008 and it has achieved a strong 1 year and quarter results ranking in the top 3% of its peer group. The Clover Small Value Strategy has a solid 3 and 5 year results. This is a scenario that we see good growth opportunity in part because other successful products in this space in the marketplace have closed to new investors. At the other end of cap spectrum, the cost and large cap fund also has a strong 3-year record and is garnering solid flows. And international leaders and Intercontinental funds have positive flows in Q1, InterContinental recently received the Lipper Fund Awards for its category leading 10-year consistent return results. The Federated Emerging Market Debt Fund was also recognized as the leading fund on the same basis for his 3-year record. Why we usually direct our comments to longer-term performance records, with the difficulties that strategies across the industry including our experience from the last couple of years, we did want to know that our MDT quarantine have a very strong performance in the first quarter. The primary strategy all cut core brought its record to the top 4 for the 1-year period and had a top 1% ranking quarter in the first quarter. All 7 of the MDT Managed Accounts strategy meet their benchmarks in the first quarter and 6 or 7 have outperformed since inception. Negative equity fund closed in Q1 and in the first couple of weeks of Q2, are due mainly to our alternative strategies, which are market off in Prudent Bear and to the Kaufmann fund. Looking at early Q1 results for the first, I mean, early Q2 results for the first few weeks, equity fund flows have been modestly negative. As regards to the Kaufmann Fund, 1 short comment. Their approach continues to be the focus on high-quality growth company and the use of extensive proprietary research and a bottom-up style with high conviction and low turnover. It is very much a long-term approach. 
Turning to the fixed income strategy. The capital preservation fund led results for both gross and net sales and I'll comment further on that shortly. High yield fund and our strategic income blended product were among a series of funds that has positive flows. Our Total Return Bond Fund had outflows due mainly to the redemption we mentioned on our last call from a client who reached their maximum fund concentration level. We also saw fund closed in municipal Bond Fund. We are continuing to look, we are looking for good results from 2 recently launched products. Our unconstrained Bond Fund and our floating-rate strategic income fund. Bond Fund flows are negative in the first couple of weeks of April. The unibond funds continue to have net outflows. We have also seen some clients reducing their fixed income allocation as a part of rerisking strategy. This led to a few lumpy outflows in the first quarter and a $200 million redemption this month in Total Return Bond Fund. 
Turning to fund performance. And looking at the quarter end Lipper rankings were Federated equity funds 22% of the assets are rated for the first or second quartile over the last year, 16% over the years, 26% over 5 years and 84% over 10 years. For Bond Fund assets the comparable first and second quarter percentages are 35% 1 year, 51% 3 years, 70% for 5 years and 68% for 10 years. Looking at MorningStar rated fund. 20% of the rated equity assets are in foreign five star product as of 3/31. And 2/3 are in 3 4 and five-star product. Interestingly, 96% of our international equity assets are in the top 2 quartiles for the first year, 1 year and 21% for 3 years, 78% for 5 years and 78% also for 10 years. At quarter end, we had 11 equity funds with top quartile 1-year performance including our strategic dividend, domestic and international, asset allocation, InterContinental and International Leaders Fund along with the several of the MDT funds. We also had half a dozen funds with top quartile 3-year records and 9 funds of top 5-year records. Plenty of excellent products that is selling in the marketplace.
As a April 27, our managed assets were $353 billion including $268 billion in Money Market, $32 billion in equity, $50 billion in fixed income, which includes our liquidation portfolio. Money Market mutual fund assets stand at about $237 billion. So far in April, our money fund assets have ranged between $235 billion and $245 billion and the average has been about $239 billion. 
As regards to distribution, our Retirement business, which we have been investing in by adding sales staff in the DCIO area, is strong and growing. As mentioned, we added $1.2 billion into the capital preservation fund in Q1 by competing successfully in a high level RSP process with 1 of our major distributors. As a result, we have gained product position in about 700 new retirement plans with an estimated 100,000 participants. We expect these assets to grow each quarter based on regular plan contribution and we're also working to gain additional accounts and to grow the new accounts by adding new strategies into these plans. Excluding these conversions, we saw a 4% increase in Q1 to fund contribution growth sales compared to the first quarter of 2010. Now generally across our channels, we see modest rerisking activity as our client are looking to take on more risk. They're moving cautiously. In this environment, strategic value dividend offers a solid step-out strategy by providing equity exposure supported by a solid base of dividend. 
Flow improvement in equity separate accounts was driven by higher sales of the strategic value dividend strategy and by lower redemptions in the MDT strategy. As a result, we saw positive flows in first quarter equity separate accounts after running negative in 2010. Fixed income separate account flows continue to be positive and we see the potential for $502 billion of new flows in this area over the next couple of quarters. We enhanced our product marketing effort in the first quarter with the launch of a campaign designed to initially promote the strategic value of strategy through a series of Web and print ad. We also recently launched a redesigned website to showcase the insights of our investment professionals and better deliver product and market information and tools to our clients. Regarding acquisitions. We are focused on developing an alliance to further advance our business outside of the United States. We are also actively seeking consolidation deal and recently announced an agreement to transition $515 million from the equity trust fund in Q3. These were from FDL Financial Group in Iowa. Obviously, we cannot predict the probability or timing of any other potential deals. But we are active in our analysis and focusing on developing further of these types of Alliances. Now I would like to turn it over to Tom to discuss our financials."

These expense was $18.2 million pretax nearly all in professional service fees. Money fund yields reduced pretax income by $13.1 million for the quarter compared to $12.1 million in the prior quarter, the line item impacted are covered in the press release. Based on current market conditions and asset levels, these waivers would reduced income by approximately $17.5 million in the second quarter. Lower short-term interest rates in particular for repurchase agreement impacted these waivers so far in April. Looking forward, we estimate that gaining 10 basis points in gross yields will likely reduce the impact of these waivers by about 1/3 from the current level and a 25 basis point increase would reduce the impact by about 2/3. 
Looking at revenue, the decrease from the prior quarter was due mainly to 2 fewer days in the first quarter, which impacted the number by approximately $6.9 million and to higher money fund yields waivers has averaged asset actually increased for Money Market equity and fixed income on liquidation portfolios decreased. Turning to operating expenses. Compensation and related expenses in Q1 was in line with the estimate we gave last quarter. Q1 included a credit of approximately $2 million of prior-year incentive compensation. Distribution expense was down due mainly to higher money fund yields waivers and was also impacted by fewer days, which cost a reduction of approximately $2.5 million. 
Looking at our balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities totaled $317 million at quarter end. This combined with expected additional cash flows from operations and availability under present debt facilities provides debt with significant liquidity to be able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities as well as the ability to fund related contingent payment, share repurchases dividend, new product, other investments, capital expenditures and debt repayment. We would now like to ask Debbie Cunningham to comment on Federated interest rate outlook."

Our interest rate outlook has actually not change too much from the past 2 quarters. But it has been impacted in the short-term session by some of the regulatory changes that have just come into fruition. Namely for April 1, from the beginning of April 1, what we've seen on the FDIC assessment based changes is lower overnight fund rate, which are the driver for lower overnight sent in the marketplace. What has essentially in 2010 was an average rate that was probably in the low to mid-20s, in the first quarter became somewhere in the neighborhood of the mid-to-high teens and looking forward into the second quarter of 2011, it will be likely in the high single-digit area. As such, that will impact how the overall portfolios to some degree are aligned on the composition basis with less in the space that is required, that will be impacted by that overnight rate in the FDIC assessment changes. Having said that though, liquidity is the main characteristic of the Money Market fund and as such, we will continue to keep margin out in liquidity product going forward. So overnight rates are impacted in the first quarter slightly but it will be more so in the second quarter by these FDIC charges assessment. On an outlook basis however, for the overall occurrence for Money Market asset, has actually seen a little bit of improvement and a few more people that were in the rate raising environment for 2013 and late 2012 have moved much closer to our end of the estimation, which is the end of 2011. We do believe and confirmed by Fed Chairman Bernanke earlier in the week that the overall queueing process will be completed. So we'll continue to see the purchase of treasury securities out of the marketplace to the level that mentioned and for the amount of time that was mentioned soon that will change and it will be something that at the end of June beginning of July, were turning into something that is really an overall level that becomes much more characteristics of rising rate environment. So rising rate what we would start to see and expect and be it on Q3 and I call it quantitative basis beginning in the third quarter. So we do think that Fed will start on basis putting some of their securities back out into the marketplace beginning in the third quarter and that will then lead to something that is eventual through tightening increase in the Fed funds rate by the end of the year 2011."

I believe the Fed to do that unwind from at least a temporary basis with the number of adversary for counter parties that they have in the marketplace. Obviously they're not just talking about the dealer they're primary dealers anymore. They got I think at the end of the day, they're going to have somewhere around 80 ton of counter parties from a Money Market funds standpoint. And as such, they have lots of and I think what they're doing in the funds is there's a lot of demand for that collateral. So although it's temporary in nature, it's reverse repo is not actually putting those securities back out in the marketplace on sale basis on profit sale basis. I do believe that, that they will head down the path of beginning that process and once they do, they're going to find very happy recipients of it in the marketplace. And as such, that will encourage them to continue selling. The other side of the equation for markets that leads us to still on end of the year 2011 is just strengthen in the economic picture that we've seen. Although GDP in the first quarter is going to be less than what may have been accepted. Full growth is still something that from a Money Market perspective is almost So we really think that slow growth and slow tightening process is something that will the from the marketplace certainly off the lows that we're in right now and have been in for the past 2.5 years. I actually think that as it begin and as the Feds sees sort of the demand for it and recipients in the marketplace as being very positive, that leads us to the conclusion where we are, which is we think it will be in the second half of 2011."

The FDIC assessment charges are something that  they didn't just happen everybody knew it's going to happen.  The market was very wrong about what the impact would be. And the reason for that is the Fed acceptance changes  is not really changing the amount of in phase. The amount of money that was coming into the FDIC  fund. Instead what they were doing was repositioning it so that more of it would be paying larger banks and less by smaller banks. So the focus on the marketplace when looking at the impact. Last quarter basically and the quarter before that was one of the big banks. So people are looking at JPMorgan, Citi and 2 of the impacts on those banks would be in there and therefore that impacts on the marketplace. And that was sort of what was built into the expectation. What was really an and underestimated was the power of the smaller banks in this equation. Many, many smaller banks, tens and thousand of smaller banks who traditionally had put retail -- had put collateral out into the retail marketplace  on a daily basis is keeping that supply at a level that it was. The side of that is because of the assessment changes and the impact on their fee process, it no longer was a profitable thing and couldn't even breakeven and deal with that. So the immediate impact on April 1 was for a sizable amount, again on an individual bank by bank basis it would have been of being different but on a collective basis, the impact of the size of the withdrawal pretty much collectively of those smaller back from putting that collateral into the marketplace is what caused  the rates to plummet. Now they plummeted too far and what you  essentially saw was something that a retreat back to a fairly normal level. The form that  in front assessed by the FDIC was being impacted in a very positive way because they were getting such great funding rates, so that has kind of level that sells but what you're seeing on that Fed funds rate, 9 basis points is effectively what I would say in my commentary earlier that we had been in the low to mid-20s in  most of 2010, first quarter we were in the mid-to-high  teens and the expectation for this quarter is in the single digit, high single-digit area. Now there are 2 things that is exacerbating this, which make it a little bit worse at this point. Number 1 is balanced budget issue and the elimination on the supplementary financing bill. And the withdrawal of that collateral from the marketplace because of that and potential for hitting that. So those negotiations continue to go forward and hopefully as they come to an end  and will successful end. There's discussion about bringing that supplemental financing bill back into the marketplace,  which would produce more supply, which would be good then which would cause rates to go up in that sector. The other side of the equation is itself.  So that has a definitive end to it at the end of June. 1 said stock buying basically all the 2 to 10-year treasury out of the market place that are holding them on their balance sheet where we get use of them. That will again create supply but it is something that I'm looking as not a second quarter item. We're looking to those sort of exacerbation items not being corrected if you will."

What drives those numbers in view of our size of 32 billion in equity and a 7-plus billion dollar in the kaufmann Fund. For the Kaufmann Fund assets move from 1 category to another, that really tilts those figures. So that's 1 point. Now as regards to the kaufmann Fund on that point, we remain committed to the fact that this group is excellent investors in selecting good stocks over the long haul. The 1 fact I'll give you reviews of our independent directors and others is that there've been that there've been 22 rolling 3-year performance period since they started the fund. And of those 22 rolling 3-year period, 14 of them have found the kaufmann Fund in the first quartile. While they've been in the fourth quartile 4 times and in the third quartile, 3 times. And almost never in the second quartile. And what's going on here is that this team is dedicated to finding stocks they believe in for the long haul. And it's also reminiscent of the time when we bought the funded '01 coming off some relative top performance in the late '90s and 2000 and they snapped back quickly after the '01 technology breakdown. So this is just the way that the Kaufmann  Fund does their investing and the way it impacts our overall performance of profile. So we are certainly not looking for making any other changes there. 1 item that was announced earlier this morning was that we did have to change in senior portfolio managers capital appreciation fund with Jimmy joining Dean and now running that fund and that group into the future. And then the other factor, which we mentioned is the MDT and I don't have to repeat all of the articles you read about what's happened to managers and the spring back that's happened so far this year that I would cover in the remarks. So that's pretty much a quick synopsis on your second question."

I will start with a brief review of Federated's recent business performance before turning the call over to Tom to discuss our financials. Looking at cash management, Money Market average assets increased from the prior quarter for both our funds and our separate accounts. As mentioned in the last call, expected outflows early in Q1, mainly from flows that came in late in the year, led to lower period-end fund assets. Growth in average money fund assets was mainly from wealth management and trust channel, while Money Market's separate accounts growth reflected tax seasonality. While market conditions remained challenging, our cash management business is strong and stable, with our market share steady at around 8.8%. Debbie will comment later on the recent market conditions, which have further impacted yields and fee waivers, which Tom will also address. 
On the regulatory front, money funds continue to be an active topic of discussion, Federated and others support the liquidity bank proposal advanced by the industry through the ICI. This enhancement would compliment that new liquidity provision of 2a-7 and would not socialize credit risk. We do not agree with suggestions that favor bank-wide regulation or bank-wide capital requirements, which in our view are far off the point and are more likely to do significant harm than enhance the resiliency of money funds, an important stated objective. In terms of the potential for a systemic risk designation, we don't believe that we will nor should be designated, and have submitted commentary in support for our opinions to the regulators. 
Looking now at our Equity business. We are focused on a series of strategies that have solid performance characteristics and are well suited to meet the particular demands in the market. Leading in this area is strategic value dividend, a strategy that continues to produced strong flows and expanded distribution opportunities for both mutual funds and separate accounts. We added an international version of this strategy in mid-2008 and it has achieved a strong one-year and quarterly results ranking in the top 3% of its peer group. The Clover Small Value strategy has solid 3 and 5-year results. This is an area that we see as good growth opportunity, in part because other successful products in this space in the marketplace have closed to new investors. At the other end of the cap spectrum, the costs in large cap funds also has a strong 3-year record and is garnering some solid flows. The International Leaders and InterContinental Funds had positive flows in Q1. InterContinental recently received the Lipper Fund Award for its category leading 10-year consistent return results. The Federated Emerging Market Debt Fund was also recognized as the leading fund on the same basis for its 3-year record. 
While we usually direct our comments to longer-term performance records, with the difficulties that quant strategies across the industry including ours, experienced over the last couple of years, we did want to note that our MDT quant team had very strong performance in the first quarter. The primary strategy, all-cap core, brought its record to the top quartile for the one-year period, and had a top 1% ranking quarter for the first quarter. All 7 of the MDT managed accounts strategies beat their benchmarks in the first quarter, and 6 of 7 have outperformed since inception. Negative equity fund closed in Q1 and in the first couple of weeks of Q2, are due mainly to our alternative strategies, which are market ops and Prudent Bear, and to the Kaufmann fund. Looking at early Q1 results for the first -- I mean, early Q2 results for the first few weeks, equity fund flows have been modestly negative. As regards to Kaufmann Fund, one short comment. Their approach continues to be the focus on high-quality growth companies and to use of extensive proprietary research and a bottoms-up style, with high conviction and low turnover. It is very much a long-term approach. 
Turning to the fixed income strategies. The Capital Preservation Fund led results for both gross and net sales, and I'll comment further on that shortly. High-yield funds and our strategic income blended product were among a series of funds that had positive flows. Our Total Return Bond Fund had outflows due mainly to the redemption we mentioned on our last call from a client who reached their maximum fund concentration level. We also saw outflows in municipal Bond Fund. We are continuing to look -- we are looking for good results from 2 recently launched products: our Unconstrained Bond Fund and our Floating Rate Strategic Income Fund Bond Fund flows are negative in the first couple of weeks of April. The Uni Bond Funds continue to have net outflows. We have also seen some clients reducing their fixed income allocation as a part of re-risking strategies. This led to a few lumpy outflows in the first quarter and a $200 million redemption this month in Total Return Bond Fund. 
Turning to fund performance and looking at the quarter-end Lipper rankings where Federated's equity funds 22% of the assets are rated in the first or second quartile over the last year, 16% over 3 years, 26% over 5 years and 84% over 10 years. For Bond Fund assets, the comparable first and second quarter percentages are 35%, 1 year; 51%, 3 years; 70% for 5 years; and 68% for 10 years. Looking at Morningstar-rated fund, 20% of the rated equity assets are in foreign 5-star product as of 3/31. And 2/3 are in 3, 4 and 5-star product. Interestingly, 96% of our international equity assets are in the top 2 quartiles for the first year, one year, and 21% for 3 years, 78% for 5 years and 78% also for 10 years. At quarter end, we had 11 equity funds with top quartile one-year performance including our strategic dividend, domestic and international, asset allocation, InterContinental and International Leaders Funds, along with several of the MDT funds. We also had 1/2 a dozen funds with top quartile 3-year records, and 9 funds with top 5-year records, plenty of excellent products that is selling in the marketplace.
As of April 27, our managed assets were $353 billion including $268 billion in Money Market, $32 billion in equities, $53 billion in fixed income, which includes our liquidation portfolios. Money Market mutual fund assets stand at about $237 billion. So far in April, our money fund assets have ranged between $235 billion and $245 billion, and the average has been about $239 billion. 
As regards to distribution, our Retirement business, which we have been investing in by adding sales staff in the DCIO area, is strong and growing. As mentioned, we added $1.2 billion into the capital preservation fund in Q1 by competing successfully in a high level RFP process with one of our major distributors. As a result, we have gained product position in about 700 new retirement plans, with an estimated 100,000 participants. We expect these assets to grow each quarter based on regular plan contributions, and we're also working to gain additional accounts and to grow the new accounts by adding new strategies into these plans. Excluding these conversions, we saw a 4% increase in Q1 to find contribution growth sales compared to the first quarter of 2010. Now generally across our channels, we see modest re-risking activity as our clients are looking to take on more risk. They're moving cautiously. In this environment, strategic value dividend offers a solid step-out strategy by providing equity exposure supported by a solid base of dividends. 
Flow improvement in equity separate accounts was driven by higher sales of the strategic value dividend strategy and by lower redemptions in the MDT strategies. As a result, we saw positive flows in first quarter equity separate accounts after running negative in 2010. Fixed income separate account flows continued to be positive, and we see the potential for $500 million to $1 billion of new flows in this area over the next couple of quarters. We enhanced our product marketing effort in the first quarter with the launch of a campaign designed to initially promote the strategic value -- a strategy through a series of web and print ads. We also recently launched a redesigned website to showcase the insights of our investment professionals and better deliver product and market information and tools to our clients. Regarding acquisitions, we are focused on developing an alliance to further advance our business outside the United States. We are also actively seeking consolidation deals, and recently announced an agreement to transition $515 million from the equity trust funds in Q3. These were from FBL Financial Group in Iowa. Now obviously, we cannot predict the probability or timing of any other potential deals. But we are active in our analysis and focusing on developing further of these types of alliances. Now I would like to turn it over to Tom to discuss our financials."

Excluding the $0.11 of litigation settlement and related expense, EPS of $0.32 would have been $0.43. This expense was $18.2 million pretax, nearly all in professional service fees.

This expense was $18.2 million pretax, nearly all in professional service fees. Money fund yield waivers reduced pretax income by $13.1 million for the quarter compared to $12.1 million in the prior quarter. The line items impacted are covered in the press release. Based on current market conditions and asset levels, these waivers would reduce income by approximately $17.5 million in the second quarter. Lower short-term interest rates, in particular for a repurchase agreement, impacted these waivers so far in April. Looking forward, we estimate that gaining 10 basis points in gross yields will likely reduce the impact of these waivers by about 1/3 from the current level, and a 25-basis point increase would reduce the impact by about 2/3. 
Looking at revenues, the decrease from the prior quarter was due mainly to 2 fewer days in the first quarter, which impacted the number by approximately $6.9 million, and to higher money fund yield waivers as average assets actually increased for Money Market equity, and fixed income on liquidation portfolios decreased. Turning to operating expenses. Compensation and related expenses in Q1 was in line with the estimate we gave last quarter. Q1 included a credit of approximately $2 million of prior-year incentive compensation. Distribution expense was down due mainly to higher money fund yield waivers and was also impacted by fewer days, which caused a reduction of approximately $2.5 million. 
Looking at our balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities totaled $317 million at quarter end. This combined with expected additional cash flows from operations, and availability under present debt facilities provide debts with significant liquidity to be able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities, as well as the ability to fund related contingent payments, share repurchases dividends, new products, other investments, capital expenditures and debt repayments.

Our interest rate outlook has actually not changed too much from the past 2 quarters. But it has been impacted in the short-term, fashioned by some of the regulatory changes that have just come into fruition. Namely for April 1 -- from the beginning of April 1, what we've seen on an FDIC assessment-based change is lower overnight set fund rate, which are the driver for lower overnight repo rates than in the marketplace. What has -- what essentially -- in 2010 was an average repo rate that was probably in the low to mid-20s. In the first quarter it became somewhere in the neighborhood of the mid-to-high teens. And looking forward into the second quarter of 2011, it will be likely in the high single-digit area. As such, that will impact how the overall portfolios, to some degree, are aligned on the composition basis with less in the space that is required to -- that will be impacted by that overnight rate and the FDIC assessment changes. Having said that though, liquidity is the main characteristic of Money Market funds. And as such, we will continue to keep margin out in liquidity products going forward. So overnight rates are impacted in the first quarter slightly, but it will be more so in the second quarter by these FDIC charge assessments. On an outlook basis, however, for the overall cur [ph] for Money Market assets has actually seen a little bit of improvement, and a few more people that were in the rate-raising environment for 2013 and late 2012 have moved much closer to our end of the estimation, which is the end of 2011. We do believe, and obviously that was confirmed by Fed Chairman Bernanke, yes, earlier in the week that the overall queue-in-queue process will be completed. So we'll continue to see the purchase of treasury securities out of the marketplace to the level that was mentioned and for the amount of time that was mentioned. But soon that will change and it will be something that at the end of June, beginning of July, we're turning into something that is really an overall level that becomes much more characteristic of a rising-rate environment. So rising rates are what we would start to see and expect, and be it on QT, I'll call it quantitative tightening basis beginning the third quarter. So we do think that the Fed will start on a reverse retail basis, putting some of their securities back out into the marketplace beginning in the third quarter and that will then lead to something that is eventual through tightening buying increase in the Fed funds rate by the end of the year of 2011."

It seems like the market has actually been pushing that out, that fund future for December have actually come down quite a bit in terms of the likelihood of a rate hike. I'm just curious. It seems like there's a bit of a difference there."

And absolutely what we're -- we're convinced that the point is that the Fed is going to tread lightly on some of the market perspective. And Q2 is something -- well, to begin with, with something that was -- was and continues to be a grand experiment. And in the context of unwind that grand experiment will continue. Having said that, as market -- as a market that is starved for collateral, i.e. repo, FDIC changes, lower amounts of collateral available because much of it is sitting on the balance sheet of the Fed. The Fed will be encouraged as soon as their process is concluded on the purchase side of the equation. I believe they're set, they're ready to do the unwind coursing on the -- from at least a temporary basis with the number of adversary co-counterparties that they have in the marketplace. Obviously they're not just talking about dealing with the primary dealers anymore. They've got -- I think at the end of the day, they're going to have somewhere around 80-some counterparties from a Money Market fund standpoint, and as such they have lots of capacity. And I think what they're going to find is there's a lot of demand for that collateral. So although it's temporary in nature, it's reverse repo. It's not actually putting those markets -- to putting those securities back out into the marketplace on a sale basis, on a profit sale basis. I do believe that they will head down the path of beginning that process. And once they do, they're going to find very happy recipients of it in the marketplace. And as such, that will encourage them to continue going. The other side of the equation from our perspective that leads us to still on end of the year 2011 is just to strengthen the economic picture that we've seen. Although GDP in the first quarter is going to be less than what have maybe been expected, so our growth is still something that from a Money Market perspective is almost nirvana. So we really think that slow growth and slow tightening process is something that will be well risky [ph] from the marketplace, certainly off the lows that we're in right now and have been for the last 2 1/2 years. I actually think that as it begins and as the Feds sees sort of the demand for it and the recipients in the marketplace being very positive, that leads us to the conclusion where we are, which is we think it will be in the second half of 2011."

I mean, the FDIC assessment charges were something that -- they're in -- they're passing on April 1, everybody knew they were going to happen.  The market was very wrong about what the impact would be. And the reason for that is the Fed in -- it isn't accepting changes. It's not really changing the amount of intakes, the amount of money that was coming into the FDIC fund, instead what they were doing was repositioning it so that more of it was being paid by larger banks and less by smaller banks. So the focus on the marketplace when looking at the impacts, last quarter basically and the quarter before that was on the big banks. So people are looking at JPMorgan, [ph] Citi and seeing what the impact on those banks would be in there, then therefore that impacts on the marketplace. And that was sort of what was built into the expectation. What was really overworked and underestimated was the power of the smaller bank in this equation. Many, many smaller banks, tens of dozens of smaller banks who traditionally had put retail out in -- or put collateral out into the retail marketplace on a daily basis, keeping that supply at a level that it was. Aside of that, because of the assessment changes and the impact on their fee process, it no longer was a profitable thing. It couldn't even breakeven in doing that. So the immediate impact on April 1 was for a sizable amount, again on an individual bank-by-bank basis it wouldn't have made it, that wouldn't be any different. But on a collective basis, the impact of the size of the withdrawal, pretty much collectively of those smaller banks from putting that collateral into the marketplace is what caused the rates to plummet. Now they plummeted too far, and what you  essentially saw was something that was a retreat back to a fairly normal level. The foreign banks aren't affected by this, and yet were being impacted in a very positive way because they were getting such great funding rates, so that has kind of leveled itself up back again. But what you're seeing on that Fed funds rate, 9 basis points is effectively what I was saying in my commentary earlier, that we had been in the low to mid-20s in  most of 2010. First quarter we were in the mid-to-high teens and the expectation for this quarter is in the single digit -- the high single-digits area. Now there are 2 things that are exacerbating this, which could make it a little bit worse at this point. Number one is the balanced budget issue and the elimination of the supplementary financing bill, and the withdrawal of that collateral from the marketplace because of the debt ceiling and that potential for hitting that. So if those negotiations continue to go forward, and hopefully as they come to an end that's successful. And there is discussion about bringing that supplemental financing bill back into the marketplace, which would produce more supply, which would be a good thing which would cause rates to go up in that sector. The other side of the equation is queuing to itself. So that has a definitive end to it at the end of June. Once the said stock buying [ph] basically all the 2 to 10-year treasuries out of the market place and holding them on their balance sheet where we get no use of them, that will again create supply. But it is something that I'm looking as not a second quarter item. We're looking to those sort of exacerbation items not being corrected, if you will until the third quarter."

And to be clear there, what we saw was a dimunition in net redemptions in sequential quarters. So those products are still negative from a flow standpoint, but less so. And that improvement would have been around $125 million of improvement. The real story is the growth on the strategic value size and there the improvement in net flows would have been more like $250 million, maybe a little less than that. But we had, if not our best quarter ever, certainly one of the best in terms of both gross and net sales in that product. It's very well positioned in a number of high-quality SMA platforms, and it is clearly a strategy that's resonating with moderate re-risking activity that we see.
And in terms of the second question. What drives those numbers in view of our size of $32 billion in equity and a $7-plus billion in the Kaufmann Fund. When the Kaufmann Fund assets move from one category to another, that really tilts those figures. And so that's one point. Now as regards to Kaufmann Fund on that point, we remain committed to the fact that this group is excellent investors in selecting good stocks over the long haul. The one fact I will give you that we view with our independent directors and others is that there've been 22 rolling 3-year performance periods when since they started the fund. And of those 22 rolling 3-year periods, 14 of them have found the Kaufmann Fund in the first quartile while they've been in the fourth quartile 4 times, and in the third quartile, 3 times and almost never in the second quartile. And what's going on here is that this team is dedicated to finding stocks they believe in for the long haul. And it is also reminiscent of the time when we bought the fund in '01 coming off some relative top performance in the late '90s and 2000s. And they snapped back quickly after the '01 technology breakdown. So this is just the way that, that Kaufmann Fund does their investing and the way it impacts our overall performance profile. So we are certainly not looking at making any other changes there. One item that was announced early this morning was that we did have a change in senior portfolio manager as the Capital Appreciation Fund, with Jimmy Grefenstette joining Dean Kartsonas and now running that fund and that group into the future. And then the other factor which we mentioned is the MDT, and I don't have to repeat all of the articles you've read about what's happened to quant managers and the spring back that's happened so far this year that I went over in the remarks. So that's pretty much a quick synopsis on your second question."

When I look at the revenue change, and this is just sequentially, we just credit the fewer days and in the waivers. And It looks like despite like the overall asset mix, being more favorable in terms of long-term versus Money Market, revenues were a bit lighter. So it looks like maybe within the long-term products, you have some shift going on in terms of different products, different fees. So I guess just in terms of like the fixed income complex, if you can give us an insight on short duration if you're getting inflows there, just what the fee rate on those products are for like versus the overall fixed income average. And then changing in equity just on something like Kaufmann  or Prudent Bear where you see some more volatility versus the overall average, which is more helpful in terms of when we're looking forward, just what the -- where the fee rate's likely to head."

If you look at our equity sales, they're running comfortably above 500 a month on average. And back in '08 and '07, they were in the low 400s a month. So we're looking at that as a pretty good situation. The new products that we've come out with have also give us some enthusiasm. The results to the low duration product and the end constrained bond funds have been pretty good, and that's why we've opened up an advertising campaign.

You have to be careful to maintain the proper spread between government funds, agency funds and prime funds.

So there's no way to recapture any kind of money. Now today when there's hardly any yield available, yes, that makes all of these things little more problematic. But getting them in at this point is probably a worthy idea because in case you get a structure set up for when the rates eventually do go up.

I will start with a brief review of Federated's recent business performance before turning the call over to Tom to discuss our financials. Looking at cash management. Money Markets average assets increased from the prior quarter for both our funds and our separate accounts. As mentioned in the last call, expected outflows early in Q1, mainly from flows that came in late in the year, led to lower period-end fund assets. Growth in average money fund assets was mainly from wealth management and trust channel, while Money Market's separate accounts growth reflected tax seasonality. While market conditions remained challenging, our cash management business is strong and stable, with our market share steady at around 8.8%. Debbie will comment later on the recent market conditions, which have further impacted yields and fee waivers, which Tom will also address. 
On the regulatory front, money funds continue to be an active topic of discussion. Federated and others support the liquidity bank proposal advanced by the industry through the ICI. This enhancement would compliment that new liquidity provision of 2a-7 and would not socialize credit risk. We do not agree with suggestions that favor bank-wide regulation or bank-wide capital requirements, which in our view are far off the point and are more likely to do significant harm than enhance the resiliency of money funds, an important stated objective. In terms of the potential for a systemic risk designation, we don't believe that we will nor should be designated, and have submitted commentary in support for our opinions to the regulators. 
Looking now at our Equity business. We are focused on a series of strategies that have solid performance characteristics and are well suited to meet the particular demands in the market. Leading in this area is strategic value dividend, a strategy that continues to produced strong flows and expanded distribution opportunities for both mutual funds and separate accounts. We added an international version of this strategy in mid-2008 and it has achieved strong one-year and quarterly results ranking in the top 3% of its peer group. The Clover Small Value strategy has solid 3 and 5-year results. This is an area that we see as good growth opportunity, in part because other successful products in this space in the marketplace have closed to new investors. At the other end of the cap spectrum, the costs in large cap funds also has a strong 3-year record and is garnering some solid flows. The International Leaders and InterContinental Funds had positive flows in Q1. InterContinental recently received the Lipper Fund Award for its category leading 10-year consistent return results. The Federated Emerging Market Debt Fund was also recognized as the leading fund on the same basis for its 3-year record. 
While we usually direct our comments to longer-term performance records, with the difficulties that quant strategies across the industry including ours, experienced over the last couple of years, we did want to note that our MDT quant team had very strong performance in the first quarter. The primary strategy, all-cap core, brought its record to the top quartile for the one-year period, and had a top 1% ranking quarter for the first quarter. All 7 of the MDT managed accounts strategies beat their benchmarks in the first quarter, and 6 of 7 have outperformed since inception. Negative equity fund closed in Q1 and in the first couple of weeks of Q2, are due mainly to our alternative strategies, which are market ops and Prudent Bear, and to the Kaufmann fund. Looking at early Q1 results for the first -- I mean, early Q2 results for the first few weeks, equity fund flows have been modestly negative. As regards to Kaufmann Fund, one short comment, their approach continues to be the focus on high-quality growth company and to use of extensive proprietary research and a bottoms-up style, with high conviction and low turnover. It is very much a long-term approach. 
Turning to the fixed income strategies. The Capital Preservation Fund led results for both gross and net sales, and I'll comment further on that shortly. High-yield funds and our strategic income blended product were among a series of funds that had positive flows. Our Total Return Bond Fund had outflows due mainly to the redemption we mentioned on our last call from a client who reached their maximum fund concentration level. We also saw outflows in municipal Bond Funds. We are continuing to look -- we are looking for good results from 2 recently launched products: our Unconstrained Bond Fund and our Floating Rate Strategic Income Fund. Bond Fund flows are negative in the first couple of weeks of April. The Uni Bond Funds continue to have net outflows. We have also seen some clients reducing their fixed income allocation as a part of re-risking strategies. This led to a few lumpy outflows in the first quarter and a $200 million redemption this month in Total Return Bond Fund. 
Turning to fund performance. And looking at the quarter-end Lipper rankings where Federated's equity funds, 22% of the assets are rated in the first or second quartile over the last year, 16% over 3 years, 26% over 5 years and 84% over 10 years. For Bond Fund assets, the comparable first and second quarter percentages are 35%, 1 year; 51%, 3 years; 70% for 5 years; and 68% for 10 years. Looking at Morningstar-rated fund, 20% of the rated equity assets are in foreign 5-star product as of 3/31. And 2/3 are in 3, 4 and 5-star product. Interestingly, 96% of our international equity assets are in the top 2 quartiles for the first year, 1 year, and 21% for 3 years, 78% for 5 years and 78% also for 10 years. At quarter end, we had 11 equity funds with top quartile one-year performance including our strategic dividend, domestic and international, asset allocation, InterContinental and International Leaders Funds, along with several of the MDT funds. We also had 1/2 a dozen funds with top quartile 3-year records, and 9 funds with top 5-year records, plenty of excellent products that is selling in the marketplace.
As of April 27, our managed assets were $353 billion, including $268 billion in Money Market, $32 billion in equities, $53 billion in fixed income, which includes our liquidation portfolios. Money Market mutual fund assets stand at about $237 billion. So far in April, our money fund assets have ranged between $235 billion and $245 billion, and the average has been about $239 billion. 
As regards to distribution, our Retirement business, which we have been investing in by adding sales staff in the DCIO area, is strong and growing. As mentioned, we added $1.2 billion into the capital preservation fund in Q1 by competing successfully in a high level RFP process with one of our major distributors. As a result, we have gained product position in about 700 new retirement plans, with an estimated 100,000 participants. We expect these assets to grow each quarter based on regular plan contributions, and we're also working to gain additional accounts and to grow the new accounts by adding new strategies into these plans. Excluding these conversions, we saw a 4% increase in Q1 to find contribution growth sales compared to the first quarter of 2010. Now generally across our channels, we see modest re-risking activity as our clients are looking to take on more risk. They're moving cautiously. In this environment, strategic value dividend offers a solid step-out strategy by providing equity exposure supported by a solid base of dividends. 
Flow improvement in equity separate accounts was driven by higher sales of the strategic value dividend strategy and by lower redemptions in the MDT strategies. As a result, we saw positive flows in first quarter equity separate accounts after running negative in 2010. Fixed income separate account flows continued to be positive, and we see the potential for $500 million to $1 billion in new flows in this area over the next couple of quarters. We enhanced our product marketing effort in the first quarter with the launch of a campaign designed to initially promote the strategic value -- a strategy through a series of web and print ads. We also recently launched a redesigned website to showcase the insights of our investment professionals and better deliver product and market information and tools to our clients. Regarding acquisitions, we are focused on developing an alliance to further advance our business outside the United States. We are also actively seeking consolidation deals, and recently announced an agreement to transition $515 million from the equity trust funds in Q3. These were from FBL Financial Group in Iowa. Now obviously, we cannot predict the probability or timing of any other potential deals. But we are active in our analysis and focusing on developing further of these types of alliances. Now I would like to turn it over to Tom to discuss our financials."

Excluding the $0.11 of litigation settlement and related expense, EPS of $0.32 would have been $0.43. This expense was $18.2 million pretax, nearly all in professional service fees. Money fund yield waivers reduced pretax income by $13.1",332,"Thank you, Chris. Excluding the $0.11 of litigation settlement and related expense, EPS of $0.32 would have been $0.43. This expense was $18.2 million pretax, nearly all in professional service fees. Money fund yield waivers reduced pretax income by $13.1 million for the quarter compared to $12.1 million in the prior quarter. The line items impacted are covered in the press release. Based on current market conditions and asset levels, these waivers would reduce income by approximately $17.5 million in the second quarter. Lower short-term interest rates, in particular for a repurchase agreement, impacted these waivers so far in April. Looking forward, we estimate that gaining 10 basis points in gross yields will likely reduce the impact of these waivers by about 1/3 from the current level, and a 25-basis point increase would reduce the impact by about 2/3. 
Looking at revenues, the decrease from the prior quarter was due mainly to 2 fewer days in the first quarter, which impacted the number by approximately $6.9 million, and to higher money fund yield waivers as average assets actually increased for Money Market equity and fixed income, while on liquidation portfolios decreased.
Turning to operating expenses. Compensation and related expenses in Q1 was in line with the estimate we gave last quarter. Q1 included a credit of approximately $2 million of prior-year incentive compensation. Distribution expense was down due mainly to higher money fund yield waivers and was also impacted by fewer days, which caused a reduction of approximately $2.5 million. 
Looking at our balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities totaled $317 million at quarter end. This combined with expected additional cash flows from operations, and availability under present debt facilities provide debts with significant liquidity to be able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities, as well as the ability to fund related contingent payments, share repurchases dividends, new products, other investments, capital expenditures and debt repayments. We would now like to ask Debbie Cunningham to comment on Federated interest rate outlook. Debbie?"

Our interest rate outlook has actually not changed too much from the past 2 quarters. But it has been impacted in the short-term, fashioned by some of the regulatory changes that have just come into fruition. Namely for April 1 -- from the beginning of April 1, what we've seen on an FDIC assessment-based change is lower overnight set fund rates, which are the driver for lower overnight repo rates set in the marketplace. What has -- what essentially -- in 2010 was an average repo rate that was probably in the low to mid-20s. In the first quarter became somewhere in the neighborhood of the mid-to-high teens. And looking forward into the second quarter of 2011, it will be likely in the high single-digit area. As such, that will impact how the overall portfolios, to some degree, are aligned on a composition basis with less in the space that is required to -- that will be impacted by that overnight rate and the FDIC assessment changes. Having said that though, liquidity is the main characteristic of Money Market funds. And as such, we will continue to keep margin out in liquidity products going forward. So overnight rates are impacted in the first quarter slightly, but it will be more so in the second quarter by these FDIC charge assessments. On an outlook basis, however, for the overall curve for Money Market assets has actually seen a little bit of improvement. And a few more people that were in the rate-raising environment for 2013 and late 2012 have moved much closer to our end of the estimation, which is the end of 2011. We do believe, and obviously that was confirmed by Fed Chairman Bernanke, yes, earlier in the week that the overall queue-in-queue process will be completed. So we'll continue to see the purchase of treasury securities out of the marketplace to the level that was mentioned and for the amount of time that was mentioned. But soon that will change and it will be something that at the end of June, beginning of July, we're turning into something that is really an overall level that becomes much more characteristic of a rising-rate environment. So rising rates are what we would start to see and expect, and be it on QT, I'll call it quantitative tightening basis beginning in the third quarter. So we do think that the Fed will start on a reverse repo basis, putting some of their securities back out into the marketplace beginning in the third quarter and that will then lead to something that is eventual through tightening, ?[indiscernible] increase in the Fed funds rate by the end of the year of 2011."

And absolutely what we're -- we're convinced that the point is that the Fed is going to tread lightly on some of the market perspective. And Q2 is something -- well, to begin with, with something that was -- was and continues to be a grand experiment. And in the context of unwind that grand experiment will continue. Having said that, as market -- as a market that is starved for collateral, i.e. repo, FDIC changes, lower amounts of collateral available because much of it is sitting on the balance sheet of the Fed. The Fed will be encouraged as soon as their process is concluded on the purchase side of the equation. I believe they're set, they're ready to do the unwind portion of the -- from at least a temporary basis with the number of adversary co-counterparties that they have in the marketplace. Obviously they're not just talking about dealing with the primary dealers anymore. They've got -- I think at the end of the day, they're going to have somewhere around 80-some counterparties from a Money Market fund standpoint, and as such they have lots of capacity. And I think what they're going to find is there's a lot of demand for that collateral. So although it's temporary in nature, it's reverse repo. It's not actually putting those markets -- to putting those securities back out into the marketplace on a sale basis, on a profit sale basis. I do believe that they will head down the path of beginning that process. And once they do, they're going to find very happy recipients of it in the marketplace. And as such, that will encourage them to continue going. The other side of the equation from our perspective that leads us to still at end of the year 2011 is just to strengthen the economic picture that we've seen. Although GDP in the first quarter is going to be less than what have maybe been expected, slow growth is still something that from a Money Market perspective is almost nirvana. So we really think that slow growth and slow tightening process is something that will be well risky from the marketplace, certainly off the lows that we're in right now and have been for the last 2 1/2 years. I actually think that as it begins and as the Feds sees sort of the demand for it and the recipients in the marketplace being very positive, that leads us to the conclusion where we are, which is we think it will be in the second half of 2011."

I mean, the FDIC assessment charges were something that -- they're in -- they're passing on April 1, everybody knew they were going to happen.  The market was very wrong about what the impact would be. And the reason for that is the Fed in -- it isn't accepting changes. It's not really changing the amount of intakes, the amount of money that was coming into the FDIC fund, instead what they were doing was repositioning it so that more of it was being paid by larger banks and less by smaller banks. So the focus on the marketplace when looking at the impacts, last quarter basically and the quarter before that was on the big banks. So people are looking at JPMorgan, BofA, Citi and seeing what the impact on those banks would be in there, then -- therefore, that impacts on the marketplace. And that was sort of what was built into the expectation. What was really overworked and underestimated was the power of the smaller bank in this equation. Many, many smaller banks, tens of dozens of smaller banks who traditionally had put repo out in -- or put collateral out into the repo marketplace on a daily basis is keeping that supply at the level that it was decided that because of the assessment changes and the impact on their fee process, it no longer was a profitable thing. It couldn't even breakeven in doing that. So the immediate impact on April 1 was for a sizable amount, again on an individual bank-by-bank basis it wouldn't have made a hill of beans difference, but on a collective basis, the impact of the size of the withdrawal, pretty much collectively of those smaller banks from putting that collateral into the marketplace is what caused the rates to plummet. Now they plummeted too far, and what you essentially saw was something that was a retreat back to a fairly normal level. The foreign banks aren't affected by this, and yet they were being impacted in a very positive way because they were getting such great funding rates, so that has kind of leveled itself up back again. But what you're seeing on that Fed funds rate, 9 basis points is effectively what I was saying in my commentary earlier, that we had been in the low to mid-20s in most of 2010. First quarter we were in the mid-to-high teens and the expectation for this quarter is in the single digit -- the high single-digits area. Now there are 2 things that are exacerbating this, which could make it a little bit worse at this point. Number one is the balanced budget issue and the elimination of the supplementary financing bill, and the withdrawal of that collateral from the marketplace because of the debt ceiling and that potential for hitting that. So if those negotiations continue to go forward, and hopefully as they come to an end -- a successful end there is discussion about bringing that supplemental financing bill back into the marketplace, which would produce more supply, which would be a good thing which would cause rates to go up in that sector. The other side of the equation is queuing to itself. So that has a definitive end to it at the end of June. Once the Fed stops buying basically all the 2 to 10-year treasuries out of the marketplace and holding them on their balance sheet where we get no use of them, that will again create supply. But it is something that I'm looking as not a second quarter item. We're looking to those sort of exacerbation items not being corrected, if you will until the third quarter."

What drives those numbers in view of our size of $32 billion in equities and a $7-plus billion in the Kaufmann Fund. When the Kaufmann Fund assets move from one category to another, that really tilts those figures. And so that's one point. Now as regards to Kaufmann Fund on that point, we remain committed to the fact that this group is excellent investors in selecting good stocks over the long haul. The one fact I will give you that we’ve used with our independent directors and others is that there've been 22 rolling 3-year performance periods when since they started the fund. And of those 22 rolling 3-year periods, 14 of them have found the Kaufmann Fund in the first quartile while they've been in the fourth quartile 4 times, and in the third quartile, 3 times and almost never in the second quartile. And what's going on here is that this team is dedicated to finding stocks they believe in for the long haul. And it is also reminiscent of the time when we bought the fund in '01 coming off some relative tough performance in the late '90s and 2000. And they snapped back quickly after the '01 technology breakdown. So this is just the way that, that Kaufmann Fund does their investing and the way it impacts our overall performance profile. So we are certainly not looking at making any other changes there. One item that was announced early this morning was that we did have a change in senior portfolio manager as the Capital Appreciation Fund, with Jimmy Grefenstette joining Dean Kartsonas and now running that fund and that group into the future. And then the other factor which we mentioned is the MDT, and I don't have to repeat all of the articles you've read about what's happened to quant managers and the spring back that's happened so far this year that I went over in the remarks. So that's pretty much a quick synopsis on your second question."

And It looks like despite like the overall asset mix, being more favorable in terms of long-term versus Money Market, revenues were a bit lighter.

So I guess just in terms of like the fixed income complex, if you can give us an insight on short duration if you're getting inflows there, just what the fee rate on those products are for like versus the overall fixed income average. And then changing in equity just on something like Kaufmann or Prudent Bear where you see some more volatility versus the overall average?

And there is always -- and there has always been pent-up demand there. You follow the systems in communications line, we haven't really cut that. And we continue to invest in there, we think it's just -- it has the right feel to it if we had absolute demands where we had to get stuff done, and we would either cut something out as we -- that's how we've done it -- or not cut it out, but delay it until the next time around. So I don't feel like there's a big time pent up demand of things that we haven't done. And I don't expect it -- the waivers come back and we'll have any kind of explosion on expenses. We are, as Ray mentioned, we're testing -- or Chris mentioned, we're testing out some advertising on a dividend strategy fund and if that works well, we could do more of that. So that could be an area that would increase. And we hope we'd match that up increase because we saw successes with it."

I will start with a brief review of Federated's recent business performance before turning the call over to Tom to discuss our financials. Looking at cash management. Money Markets average assets increased from the prior quarter for both our funds and our separate accounts. As mentioned in the last call, expected outflows early in Q1, mainly from flows that came in late in the year, led to lower period-end fund assets. Growth in average money fund assets was mainly from wealth management and trust channel, while Money Market's separate accounts growth reflected tax seasonality. While market conditions remained challenging, our cash management business is strong and stable, with our market share steady at around 8.8%. Debbie will comment later on the recent market conditions, which have further impacted yields and fee waivers, which Tom will also address. 
On the regulatory front, money funds continue to be an active topic of discussion. Federated and others support the liquidity bank proposal advanced by the industry through the ICI. This enhancement would compliment that new liquidity provision of 2a-7 and would not socialize credit risk. We do not agree with suggestions that favor bank-wide regulation or bank-wide capital requirements, which in our view are far off the point and are more likely to do significant harm than enhance the resiliency of money funds, an important stated objective. In terms of the potential for a systemic risk designation, we don't believe that we will nor should be designated, and have submitted commentary in support for our opinions to the regulators. 
Looking now at our Equity business. We are focused on a series of strategies that have solid performance characteristics and are well suited to meet the particular demands in the market. Leading in this area is strategic value dividend, a strategy that continues to produced strong flows and expanded distribution opportunities for both mutual funds and separate accounts. We added an international version of this strategy in mid-2008 and it has achieved strong one-year and quarterly results ranking in the top 3% of its peer group. The Clover Small Value strategy has solid 3 and 5-year results. This is an area that we see as good growth opportunity, in part because other successful products in this space in the marketplace have closed to new investors. At the other end of the cap spectrum, the costs in large cap funds also has a strong 3-year record and is garnering some solid flows. The International Leaders and InterContinental Funds had positive flows in Q1. InterContinental recently received the Lipper Fund Award for its category leading 10-year consistent return results. The Federated Emerging Market Debt Fund was also recognized as the leading fund on the same basis for its 3-year record. 
While we usually direct our comments to longer-term performance records, with the difficulties that quant strategies across the industry including ours, experienced over the last couple of years, we did want to note that our MDT quant team had very strong performance in the first quarter. The primary strategy, all-cap core, brought its record to the top quartile for the one-year period, and had a top 1% ranking quarter for the first quarter. All 7 of the MDT managed accounts strategies beat their benchmarks in the first quarter, and 6 of 7 have outperformed since inception. Negative equity fund closed in Q1 and in the first couple of weeks of Q2, are due mainly to our alternative strategies, which are market ops and Prudent Bear, and to the Kaufmann fund. Looking at early Q1 results for the first -- I mean, early Q2 results for the first few weeks, equity fund flows have been modestly negative. As regards to Kaufmann Fund, one short comment, their approach continues to be the focus on high-quality growth company and to use of extensive proprietary research and a bottoms-up style, with high conviction and low turnover. It is very much a long-term approach. 
Turning to the fixed income strategies. The Capital Preservation Fund led results for both gross and net sales, and I'll comment further on that shortly. High-yield funds and our strategic income blended product were among a series of funds that had positive flows. Our Total Return Bond Fund had outflows due mainly to the redemption we mentioned on our last call from a client who reached their maximum fund concentration level. We also saw outflows in municipal Bond Funds. We are continuing to look -- we are looking for good results from 2 recently launched products: our Unconstrained Bond Fund and our Floating Rate Strategic Income Fund. Bond Fund flows are negative in the first couple of weeks of April. The Uni Bond Funds continue to have net outflows. We have also seen some clients reducing their fixed income allocation as a part of re-risking strategies. This led to a few lumpy outflows in the first quarter and a $200 million redemption this month in Total Return Bond Fund. 
Turning to fund performance. And looking at the quarter-end Lipper rankings where Federated's equity funds, 22% of the assets are rated in the first or second quartile over the last year, 16% over 3 years, 26% over 5 years and 84% over 10 years. For Bond Fund assets, the comparable first and second quarter percentages are 35%, 1 year; 51%, 3 years; 70% for 5 years; and 68% for 10 years. Looking at Morningstar-rated fund, 20% of the rated equity assets are in foreign 5-star product as of 3/31. And 2/3 are in 3, 4 and 5-star product. Interestingly, 96% of our international equity assets are in the top 2 quartiles for the first year, 1 year, and 21% for 3 years, 78% for 5 years and 78% also for 10 years. At quarter end, we had 11 equity funds with top quartile one-year performance including our strategic dividend, domestic and international, asset allocation, InterContinental and International Leaders Funds, along with several of the MDT funds. We also had 1/2 a dozen funds with top quartile 3-year records, and 9 funds with top 5-year records, plenty of excellent products that is selling in the marketplace.
As of April 27, our managed assets were $353 billion, including $268 billion in Money Market, $32 billion in equities, $53 billion in fixed income, which includes our liquidation portfolios. Money Market mutual fund assets stand at about $237 billion. So far in April, our money fund assets have ranged between $235 billion and $245 billion, and the average has been about $239 billion. 
As regards to distribution, our Retirement business, which we have been investing in by adding sales staff in the DCIO area, is strong and growing. As mentioned, we added $1.2 billion into the capital preservation fund in Q1 by competing successfully in a high level RFP process with one of our major distributors. As a result, we have gained product position in about 700 new retirement plans, with an estimated 100,000 participants. We expect these assets to grow each quarter based on regular plan contributions, and we're also working to gain additional accounts and to grow the new accounts by adding new strategies into these plans. Excluding these conversions, we saw a 4% increase in Q1 to find contribution growth sales compared to the first quarter of 2010. Now generally across our channels, we see modest re-risking activity as our clients are looking to take on more risk. They're moving cautiously. In this environment, strategic value dividend offers a solid step-out strategy by providing equity exposure supported by a solid base of dividends. 
Flow improvement in equity separate accounts was driven by higher sales of the strategic value dividend strategy and by lower redemptions in the MDT strategies. As a result, we saw positive flows in first quarter equity separate accounts after running negative in 2010. Fixed income separate account flows continued to be positive, and we see the potential for $500 million to $1 billion in new flows in this area over the next couple of quarters. We enhanced our product marketing effort in the first quarter with the launch of a campaign designed to initially promote the strategic value -- a strategy through a series of web and print ads. We also recently launched a redesigned website to showcase the insights of our investment professionals and better deliver product and market information and tools to our clients. Regarding acquisitions, we are focused on developing an alliance to further advance our business outside the United States. We are also actively seeking consolidation deals, and recently announced an agreement to transition $515 million from the equity trust funds in Q3. These were from FBL Financial Group in Iowa. Now obviously, we cannot predict the probability or timing of any other potential deals. But we are active in our analysis and focusing on developing further of these types of alliances. Now I would like to turn it over to Tom to discuss our financials."

This expense was $18.2 million pretax, nearly all in professional service fees. Money fund yield waivers reduced pretax income by $13.1 million for the quarter compared to $12.1 million in the prior quarter. The line items impacted are covered in the press release. Based on current market conditions and asset levels, these waivers would reduce income by approximately $17.5 million in the second quarter. Lower short-term interest rates, in particular for a repurchase agreement, impacted these waivers so far in April. Looking forward, we estimate that gaining 10 basis points in gross yields will likely reduce the impact of these waivers by about 1/3 from the current level, and a 25-basis point increase would reduce the impact by about 2/3. 
Looking at revenues, the decrease from the prior quarter was due mainly to 2 fewer days in the first quarter, which impacted the number by approximately $6.9 million, and to higher money fund yield waivers as average assets actually increased for Money Market equity and fixed income, while on liquidation portfolios decreased.
Turning to operating expenses. Compensation and related expenses in Q1 was in line with the estimate we gave last quarter. Q1 included a credit of approximately $2 million of prior-year incentive compensation. Distribution expense was down due mainly to higher money fund yield waivers and was also impacted by fewer days, which caused a reduction of approximately $2.5 million. 
Looking at our balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities totaled $317 million at quarter end. This combined with expected additional cash flows from operations, and availability under present debt facilities provide debts with significant liquidity to be able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities, as well as the ability to fund related contingent payments, share repurchases dividends, new products, other investments, capital expenditures and debt repayments.

Our interest rate outlook has actually not changed too much from the past 2 quarters. But it has been impacted in the short-term, fashioned by some of the regulatory changes that have just come into fruition. Namely for April 1 -- from the beginning of April 1, what we've seen on an FDIC assessment-based change is lower overnight set fund rates, which are the driver for lower overnight repo rates set in the marketplace. What has -- what essentially -- in 2010 was an average repo rate that was probably in the low to mid-20s. In the first quarter became somewhere in the neighborhood of the mid-to-high teens. And looking forward into the second quarter of 2011, it will be likely in the high single-digit area. As such, that will impact how the overall portfolios, to some degree, are aligned on a composition basis with less in the space that is required to -- that will be impacted by that overnight rate and the FDIC assessment changes. Having said that though, liquidity is the main characteristic of Money Market funds. And as such, we will continue to keep margin out in liquidity products going forward. So overnight rates are impacted in the first quarter slightly, but it will be more so in the second quarter by these FDIC charge assessments. On an outlook basis, however, for the overall curve for Money Market assets has actually seen a little bit of improvement. And a few more people that were in the rate-raising environment for 2013 and late 2012 have moved much closer to our end of the estimation, which is the end of 2011. We do believe, and obviously that was confirmed by Fed Chairman Bernanke, yes, earlier in the week that the overall queue-in-queue process will be completed. So we'll continue to see the purchase of treasury securities out of the marketplace to the level that was mentioned and for the amount of time that was mentioned. But soon that will change and it will be something that at the end of June, beginning of July, we're turning into something that is really an overall level that becomes much more characteristic of a rising-rate environment. So rising rates are what we would start to see and expect, and be it on QT, I'll call it quantitative tightening basis beginning in the third quarter. So we do think that the Fed will start on a reverse repo basis, putting some of their securities back out into the marketplace beginning in the third quarter and that will then lead to something that is eventual through tightening, ?[indiscernible] increase in the Fed funds rate by the end of the year of 2011."

And absolutely what we're -- we're convinced that the point is that the Fed is going to tread lightly on some of the market perspective. And Q2 is something -- well, to begin with, with something that was -- was and continues to be a grand experiment. And in the context of unwind that grand experiment will continue. Having said that, as market -- as a market that is starved for collateral, i.e. repo, FDIC changes, lower amounts of collateral available because much of it is sitting on the balance sheet of the Fed. The Fed will be encouraged as soon as their process is concluded on the purchase side of the equation. I believe they're set, they're ready to do the unwind portion of the -- from at least a temporary basis with the number of adversary co-counterparties that they have in the marketplace. Obviously they're not just talking about dealing with the primary dealers anymore. They've got -- I think at the end of the day, they're going to have somewhere around 80-some counterparties from a Money Market fund standpoint, and as such they have lots of capacity. And I think what they're going to find is there's a lot of demand for that collateral. So although it's temporary in nature, it's reverse repo. It's not actually putting those markets -- to putting those securities back out into the marketplace on a sale basis, on a profit sale basis. I do believe that they will head down the path of beginning that process. And once they do, they're going to find very happy recipients of it in the marketplace. And as such, that will encourage them to continue going. The other side of the equation from our perspective that leads us to still at end of the year 2011 is just to strengthen the economic picture that we've seen. Although GDP in the first quarter is going to be less than what have maybe been expected, slow growth is still something that from a Money Market perspective is almost nirvana. So we really think that slow growth and slow tightening process is something that will be well risky from the marketplace, certainly off the lows that we're in right now and have been for the last 2 1/2 years. I actually think that as it begins and as the Feds sees sort of the demand for it and the recipients in the marketplace being very positive, that leads us to the conclusion where we are, which is we think it will be in the second half of 2011."

I mean, the FDIC assessment charges were something that -- they're in -- they're passing on April 1, everybody knew they were going to happen.  The market was very wrong about what the impact would be. And the reason for that is the Fed in -- it isn't accepting changes. It's not really changing the amount of intakes, the amount of money that was coming into the FDIC fund, instead what they were doing was repositioning it so that more of it was being paid by larger banks and less by smaller banks. So the focus on the marketplace when looking at the impacts, last quarter basically and the quarter before that was on the big banks. So people are looking at JPMorgan, BofA, Citi and seeing what the impact on those banks would be in there, then -- therefore, that impacts on the marketplace. And that was sort of what was built into the expectation. What was really overworked and underestimated was the power of the smaller bank in this equation. Many, many smaller banks, tens of dozens of smaller banks who traditionally had put repo out in -- or put collateral out into the repo marketplace on a daily basis is keeping that supply at the level that it was decided that because of the assessment changes and the impact on their fee process, it no longer was a profitable thing. It couldn't even breakeven in doing that. So the immediate impact on April 1 was for a sizable amount, again on an individual bank-by-bank basis it wouldn't have made a hill of beans difference, but on a collective basis, the impact of the size of the withdrawal, pretty much collectively of those smaller banks from putting that collateral into the marketplace is what caused the rates to plummet. Now they plummeted too far, and what you essentially saw was something that was a retreat back to a fairly normal level. The foreign banks aren't affected by this, and yet they were being impacted in a very positive way because they were getting such great funding rates, so that has kind of leveled itself up back again. But what you're seeing on that Fed funds rate, 9 basis points is effectively what I was saying in my commentary earlier, that we had been in the low to mid-20s in most of 2010. First quarter we were in the mid-to-high teens and the expectation for this quarter is in the single digit -- the high single-digits area. Now there are 2 things that are exacerbating this, which could make it a little bit worse at this point. Number one is the balanced budget issue and the elimination of the supplementary financing bill, and the withdrawal of that collateral from the marketplace because of the debt ceiling and that potential for hitting that. So if those negotiations continue to go forward, and hopefully as they come to an end -- a successful end there is discussion about bringing that supplemental financing bill back into the marketplace, which would produce more supply, which would be a good thing which would cause rates to go up in that sector. The other side of the equation is queuing to itself. So that has a definitive end to it at the end of June. Once the Fed stops buying basically all the 2 to 10-year treasuries out of the marketplace and holding them on their balance sheet where we get no use of them, that will again create supply. But it is something that I'm looking as not a second quarter item. We're looking to those sort of exacerbation items not being corrected, if you will until the third quarter."

What drives those numbers in view of our size of $32 billion in equities and a $7-plus billion in the Kaufmann Fund. When the Kaufmann Fund assets move from one category to another, that really tilts those figures. And so that's one point. Now as regards to Kaufmann Fund on that point, we remain committed to the fact that this group is excellent investors in selecting good stocks over the long haul. The one fact I will give you that we’ve used with our independent directors and others is that there've been 22 rolling 3-year performance periods when since they started the fund. And of those 22 rolling 3-year periods, 14 of them have found the Kaufmann Fund in the first quartile while they've been in the fourth quartile 4 times, and in the third quartile, 3 times and almost never in the second quartile. And what's going on here is that this team is dedicated to finding stocks they believe in for the long haul. And it is also reminiscent of the time when we bought the fund in '01 coming off some relative tough performance in the late '90s and 2000. And they snapped back quickly after the '01 technology breakdown. So this is just the way that, that Kaufmann Fund does their investing and the way it impacts our overall performance profile. So we are certainly not looking at making any other changes there. One item that was announced early this morning was that we did have a change in senior portfolio manager as the Capital Appreciation Fund, with Jimmy Grefenstette joining Dean Kartsonas and now running that fund and that group into the future.

So I guess just in terms of like the fixed income complex, if you can give us an insight on short duration if you're getting inflows there, just what the fee rate on those products are for like versus the overall fixed income average. And then changing in equity just on something like Kaufmann or Prudent Bear where you see some more volatility versus the overall average?

The concept of holdup isn't exactly how I would describe what's going on there. What we have discovered, no surprise to us really is that it takes a long time to develop good relationships, to be in the right spot at the right time, to do a deal that is a cultural fit that meets our criteria. So this is not just a power shopping deal where we want to get something checked off. We want to look and get something that is going to really work for the long term. And that has proven more challenging than perhaps we had thought going in. But the pattern of it is very similar, and the attitude we have is very similar to that which we had domestically. So we continue to look for it. And I don't think that it -- in the list of things that you mentioned like, ""Oh is it pricing? No, this isn't pricing."" It's finding the right group with the right culture. And I don't think even when we get there, that the pricing will really be the issue.

It doesn't mean that we have a plan to change the fact that we wanted to raise money for what I called risk management to have the capital here. It was not fun to go through those couple of years and try to talk about borrowing. And so to have it already borrowed, as a finance guy, to have the money available for what our business people want to do is part of what I view my job is.

And there you have to be careful to maintain the proper spread between government funds, agency funds and prime funds.

So there's no way to recapture any kind of money. Now today when there's hardly any yield available, yes, that makes all of these things little more problematic. But getting them in at this point is probably a worthy idea because in it gives you time to get the structure set up for when the rates eventually do go up.

I will start with a brief review of Federated's recent business performance before turning the call over to Tom to discuss the financials. Looking first to cash management. Money market average assets decreased from the prior quarter due mainly to tax seasonality in separate account assets. Money market mutual fund average assets were nearly the same as the prior quarter. Our market share remains steady at around 8.8%. Debbie will comment later on recent money market conditions, including the impact of the debt ceiling and European banks. Tom will address related fee waivers. On the regulatory front, money funds continue to be an active topic of discussion based on comments from the SEC and the FSOC. The regulators believe that further changes should be considered and/or under review. We are enabled to make any predictions on any particular outcome or a particular timeline. We do note however, that the industry issuers and investors and money funds are opposed to a fluctuating NAV. In our view, there is no evidence that a floating NAV would positively impact investor redemption patterns or improved resiliency of money funds. In fact, we believe fluctuating NAV's would have the opposite effect. Capital buffers are not necessarily responsive to the severe liquidity crisis that negatively impacted money funds and other investors in 2008. Our initial reaction to ideas like the capital buffer for the result of the voluminous study necessary to adequately research such a concept with this level of complexity is that it's probably not a practical solution. One outcome could end up being too compressed and even eliminate the spread between prime and government fund yields, which would be just another way of ending prime funds, which is not the goal of the entire operation. 
We believe that money funds were meaningfully and sufficiently strengthen by last year's extensive revisions to 287 and we're seeing those changes helped now as we deal with the noise created around the perception of risk and prime money funds from European bank exposure. We remain favorably disposed to improvements that would enhance the resiliency of money funds by addressing the primary issue faced during the financial crisis namely a market decline liquidity crunch. 
Now turning to our equities business, we have 6 actively managed strategies in a variety of styles that have top quartile 3-year records that are well-positioned for growth. Capital income Prudent Bear and international leaders, International Strategic Value, Kauffman Large Cap and Strategic Value Dividend. In particular, Strategic Value Dividend strategy is well-suited for investor demand for high-quality dividend income. It continues to produce strong flows with over $1.2 billion of year-to-date net inflows to funds and separate accounts combined. The international version of this strategy reached its 3-year anniversary during the second quarter and achieved 5 stars as it ranked in the top 13% of its peer group for the trailing 3 years. This strategy, along with the InterContinental and International Leader Strategies provide a solid position in international equities with positive flows in the second quarter and lots of room for growth. 
Overall, equity fund net flows net flows were negative in April and May but positive in June and slightly negative here in the first 3 weeks of July. Flows in equity separate accounts were negative mainly due to a $315 million redemption from an absolute return mandate, an area where we recently changed were portfolio managers. Net sales of the Strategic Value Dividend strategy were solidly positive. And we saw another quarter of lower net redemptions in the MDT Quantz strategies for SMAs, which improved from about minus $300 million in Q4 to minus $200 million in Q1, minus $77 million in Q2. 
On the Kauffman Fund. The Kaufmann Fund performance improved in the second quarter as the fund ranked in the top third of its Lipper category similar in MorningStar. The Kaufmann Large Cap Fund ranked in the top docile of its category and the Smalltalk fund ranked in the top 14% for the quarter. The core Kauffman team and the investment process remained intact. The team's approach is to focus on high-quality growth companies and use extensive proprietary research and a bottom subsidence with high conviction and low turnover. Obviously, a long-term approach. So that if we look at the 22-rolling, 3-year performance periods beginning with 1986, the fund was ranked in the first quartile 14 times and was ranked in the fourth quartile only 4 times, 3 of which were in the '98, '99 and 2000 period. Interestingly, past periods of underperformance were followed by substantial outperformance. 
Turning to fixed income. Fund flows were negative in April and May and then turned positive in June. These flows are positive through the first 3 weeks of July led by the Total Return Bond Fund and the return to positive muni fund flows. During the second quarter, Total Return Bond Fund showed modest outflows due largely to a couple of significant asset allocation changes made by investors in April and May that combined for about $360 million in lumpy redemptions. Fund returned to modestly positive inflows for June and into July. We also saw reduced outflows in municipal bond funds during the second quarter and inflows in July, as I mentioned. The strategies with positive second-quarter flows include total returned Bond, total returned government fund, high yield, international and stable value. We also add solid inflows into 2 recently launched funds, our Federated Unconstrained Bond Fund and our Federated Floating Rate Strategic Income Fund. 
Turning to investment performance. Looking at quarter end Lipper rankings for Federated's equity funds, 27% of rated assets were in the first or second quarter over the last year, 38%, 3 years, 24% 5 years, 80% 10 years. For bond assets, Bond Fund assets, the comparable first and second quartile percentages are 29% 1 year, 50% 3 years, 70% 5 years and 75% for 10 years. Looking at MorningStar rated funds, 25% of rated assets are in the 4 and 5 star products and as of 6/30, an 82% are in 3 and 4 and 5 star products. At quarter end, we had 10 equity funds with MorningStar top quartile 1-year performance, including international Strategic Value Dividend, Capital Income, asset allocation, InterContinental and International Leaders Fund along with several MBP funds. We also had 7 equity funds with top quartile 3-year records and 7 funds with top quartile 5-year records. As of July 27, managed assets were approximately $349 billion, including $265 billion in money market, $31 billion in equities, $53 billion in fixed income including our liquidation portfolios. Money market mutual fund assets stand at about $237 billion. So far in July, money market fund assets have range between $237 billion and $241 billion and have average $239 billion. 
Looking at some of our distribution highlights, year-to-date, gross sales of equity funds and separate accounts on a combined basis increased about 19% compared to the same period in 2010. We continue to invest in distribution capabilities and are in the process of adding 12 new sales personnel to the broker-dealers sales division. We are encouraged by sales success in this area over the last 3 years. Since 2008, broker-dealers sales have increased from approximately $6.4 billion to $12 billion. And the number of advisors during significant business with us has increased from 29,000 to 35,000. The added resources will enable us to penetrate additional mid-sized broker-dealer firms. We've also recently hired 3 new Consultant Relation Reps in our institutional area to broaden our reach within the institutional consultants and plan sponsors. We are also modestly investing in advertising with an initial focus on the Strategic Value Dividend strategy. We were in print and Web campaign advertisements over the last couple of months. We've been pleased with the results and plan to run additional ads later in the year. 
Regarding acquisitions, we remain focused on developing an alliance to further advance our business outside of the United States. As we work on this, we are also having success abroad for cash management. During the second quarter, we added $2 billion in new business from a large offshore client. We're also working on 2 new money market portal opportunities in the U.K. and have received approval in Ireland for our sterling-denominated money fund that we launched in Q3. In the U.S., we're actively seeking consolidation deals. We recently completed the 2 deals we announced last quarter, with the EquiTrust Fund and a tribute to our international equity fund, adding about $600 million in new assets in a variety of strategies. Now for the financials, I'll turn it over to Tom."

And as Chris mentioned, conditions for money market funds continue to be challenging in the second quarter and into the third quarter here. Money fund yield waivers reduced pretax income by $19.4 million for the quarter compared to $13.1",479,"Thank you, Chris. And as Chris mentioned, conditions for money market funds continue to be challenging in the second quarter and into the third quarter here. Money fund yield waivers reduced pretax income by $19.4 million for the quarter compared to $13.1 million in the prior quarter. The line items impacted are covered in the press release. Yields decreased during the quarter was led to waivers exceeding the April calculation based on then current market conditions. Yields have generally trended lower as the market deals with the debt-ceiling issue and concerns over European debt. In recent market conditions and asset levels, these waivers could reduce income by approximately $23 million in Q3 for Federated. More recently, we've seen uptick in rates for repo and T-bills, which impact waiver levels in the government bonds. Expect these rates to move up of the extremely low levels in the first couple of weeks of July as we move towards some resolution of the debt-ceiling issue. We have seen some upward movement over the last couple of days. And Debbie will review this in a few minutes. 
Looking forward, we estimate that gaining 10 basis points in gross yields will likely reduced the impact of these waivers by about 1/3 from the current levels. And a 25 basis point increase will reduced the impact by about 2/3. Looking at total revenue, decrease from the prior quarter was due to higher money fund waivers, partially offset by one additional day in the quarter and by higher equity and fixed income related revenues. We continue to properly manage expenses and continue to invest for growth. The operating margin was higher in Q2 and in the prior quarter, calculated before the litigation settlement expense booked in the first quarter. The operating margin was also higher compared to Q2 2010, calculated before unusual items related to insurance recovery and impairment charges. 
We amended and restated our term credit facility in the second quarter to revise the facility contains a $200 million revolver to replace the previous facility, which was scheduled to expire later this year. On the term portion, we are able to lower interest expense and we expect to save about $8 million in interest expense over the life of the facility. We expect interest expense in the third quarter will be approximately $3.6 million, down from $4.2 million in Q2. Looking at our balance sheet, cash and marketable securities totaled $294 million at quarter end. These combined with expected additional cash flows from operation and availability under present debt facility provides us with significant liquidity to be able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities as well as the ability to fund related contingent payments, share repurchases dividend, new products and other investments, capital expenditures and debt repayments. Before we take question, we'd like to have Debbie comment on the recent market in money market world."

I thought I'd cover just three quick topics: our outlook and what's happening from a short-term rate perspective, what's the current state of affairs from a European bank exposure perspective and then the most, the newest item of concern is t",1141,"Thanks, Tom. I thought I'd cover just three quick topics: our outlook and what's happening from a short-term rate perspective, what's the current state of affairs from a European bank exposure perspective and then the most, the newest item of concern is that it's ceiling of negotiations for the U.S. treasury. From a rate outlook perspective if you look at the yield curve from money markets securities today versus a year -- a quarter ago, it's relatively steeper but it's steeper for the wrong reason. It's steeper because the shortest end of the yield curve has actually lost a few days points in the yield. So one to three months is basically 2 to 3 basis points more expensive with lower yields than where we were a quarter ago. A lot of back-end in the yield curve, which nobody's really buying too much at this point, 6 to 12 months has remained flat. Our expectation from an outlook perspective for Fed tightening has been pushed into 2012 have been and that's reflective of the slower growth that we've been experiencing from an economic perspective. We do continue to believe that there will be some yield curve steepening in the second half of 2011 with the back end of the yield curve backing up to some degree and more opportunity in the marketplace to buy some better relative value the position as the second half of 2011. 
From a European bank perspective, a couple of things have happened in the recent times. The stress test for those banks by the EU have been completed, with some amount of success afforded to that completion your. The package for Greek debt restructuring has also been reached and although it is not a quick fix in the marketplace, we never thought it would be, this is going to take up to a decade to proceed smoothly and get completed. But it has received fairly good market impact. And by that I look at the spreads that we see on the European banks and again, we use 22 from banks, highest-quality banks within the Eurozone, high-quality rating diverse underlying of their loan portfolio and effectively these banks have stayed the same from a spread perspective in the marketplace to widening maybe 2 to 3 basis points. 
From a Federated prime fund exposure, we have currently and is still maintain -- are still maintaining somewhere in the neighborhood of between 40% and 45% of our prime funds to exposure with these European banks. Again, we have no direct exposure to the Greek banks but the European banks that we use do have some exposure on a secondary basis to the sovereign Greek nation. And again, we're continuing to be comfortable with the other set of these banks. We post that on our website on in every 2-week basis so you can get the most quarterly information there when you're looking for it. The third item is the debt ceiling issue and the potential concerns in the marketplace about a default downgrade and then sort of looking at just the market quick conditions and liquidity in the marketplace. From a default perspective, we think this is a very remote likelihood if we were required actually did happen from our perspective. Fund Board of Directors action, we would need to make as an advisor recommendation to the Board of Directors based on the underlying credit quality of the nation itself, market valuations, the fact that this is not an insolvency issue but rather a willingness to pay and a political theater issue. All of this at this point would lead that if we had to come to such a situation, our recommendation would be to maintain the ownership of this technically defaulted instrument at that point again, thinking this is a very remote possibility. 
On the other side of the equation is the downgrade. There's been line drawn from the rating agencies as to what to expect from the debt cut perspective in order for the RRR ratings to be maintained. We think this is less remote obviously than a default but still we don't think this is probable. First thing to note is the downgrade is out of potential basis for long-term ratings only, not short-term ratings. So nothing would be affected from the short-term ratings perspective for the securities that are held within money market fund. What this would do is basically raised the level of which spreads are measured. Treasury securities are still the largest with most volume, with most liquid, highest quality instruments in the world, not surpassed by Johnson & Johnson, not surpassed by Wal-Mart and some of the others in the marketplace that have been noted and certainly not surpassed by bank deposits where in fact, the backing of those banks comes from the U.S. government. So this would still maintain their liquidity in the marketplace but with the price volatility, that would be a little bit more stringent than what it has been in the past and at a base level of which the rest of the market would price that slightly higher than it is today. From a Federated perspective, despite the outlook for negative potential downgrade for the long-term ratings for the U.S. government debt, the Federated money market funds have been affirmed with their AAA rating. So even if the U.S. debt was downgraded to the AA, double AA+, AA-, whatever happens to be at this point the AAA rating for Federated funds would be maintained. 
From a market conditions perspective, we're looking at treasury bill rates that are actually finally paying us something in the context of this negotiation and the extended time period that it's taking. So diversed it has a little bit of a positive effect overall on the underlying yields of our portfolios, the treasury curve which have been flat to negative out to 3 months, just a week and a half ago now stands anywhere between 9 and 15 basis points. So we're actually getting paid for taking the risk of ownership of treasury securities during the month of August, September and October. 
Lastly, from a Federated fund perspective and flow standpoint, you noticed on the July asset, the assets from money market funds are not markedly changed and we are not seeing clients moving with negative outflows due to these issues. A few are but certainly not in any widespread form and not in any way, shape, or form reflective of any kind of a problem. So liquidity in these products is high, the weighted average maturities is low, positions ourselves for what we think is the second hal steepening of the yield curve and it provides ourselves with a lot of comfort for our shareholders in the context of liquidity that might be needed. With that, I'll turn it back to Ray."

We've been looking at these ideas for several years now and it is a constant situation where because money market funds are not perfect. People keep coming up with ideas. And there's a lot more ideas that people couldn't come up with, that would still be studied. And so I would say that it would be wise for something like Federated to not allow that to restrain us from moving forward. And we don't think they're going to be doing it anything that would kill the money market fund business in any event. All of the ideas are always couched in terms of study more and then even the FSOC recently mentioned things like in order to increase stability, market discipline and investor confidence, things should be studied. And I think when the verdict comes in of all of the studies, you will find the money market funds standing there, though they are in there imperfect position, withstanding the resiliency, demonstrating the resiliency they have to customers and in the marketplace. So that would be how I would look at the issue of money market fund regulation versus M&A activity. I'll let Tom handle the other part of your question."

As I said, there is much to make a judgment about which one of these things can work when we don't initially perceive their workability. They didn't like the sort of polite capital ideas that fidelity have with 40 or 50 basis points of buffer. They didn't like the liquidity bank, which took care of the major problem that occurred in 2008 namely liquidity of the whole system. And so to get down to ideas, which have not shown themselves to be workable, several percentage points of capital is neither economic nor viable in terms of maintaining the existence of prime funds. So it's really hard for me to try and say, which one of these things is ahead of the others. If you do however, look at some of the phrases views they talked about something called deterrence to redemption. I don't know what exactly they mean by that, that's a quote out of FSOC. But if what they are talking about are some pretty legitimate ideas that we think could work. For example, the way we did the Putnam deal back in the day was that the Putnam board decided to hit pause on redemptions for a week and then turn the whole fund over to us. And there was plenty of liquidity in the system because the Fed opened up the windows to buy good paper. So noticed there was no credit maneuver here, it was all on liquidity. If you give the board the right to do that without forcing a liquidation, that would be an interesting one. Another one of that would be well what about redemption in kind, it's been discussed many times. And there's an example of a fund, the AMR fund who basically said they were going to do a redemption in kind and that ended the redemptions. I don't know if that's what they have in mind or not. One other idea which was put out early on that had to do with this was to simply say if you're run into reserve fund, then take the 3% and set that aside and give everybody else the liquidity of par on the 97% of the fund that's there. And proceed down that road. And maybe that's what they mean by deterrence to redemption. But at this point, there's a lot of work that has to be done if they're thinking about doing the things that's Lake has been talking about."

As well as shorter weighted average maturities, which is also reflective of that additional liquidity. Not so much because of concern out of shareholder redemption, but it plays nicely into sort of our strategy of thinking that later in the year we're going to see better yield curve opportunities and have better relative value positions that can be made at that point. What is actually also kind of interesting at this point when I was mentioning what's happening from a treasury bill perspective, a lot of the reasons why we weren't investing and there were periods of time during the month of July when we actually just had cash in our government portfolios because all of that was available to buy at that point in time in the marketplace for the duration of securities that we were looking were at 0 to negative yield. So it seems like less risky of a strategy to just simply leave it in cash. That is not the case with today's portfolio. And that's a reflection of the fact that many who are sitting on the sidelines or were in our market from a cash perspective have left us such when those investors have left the marketplace, yields on treasuries and repost securities have started to lift. What has been overnight treasury and mortgage-backed repo rates of 1 and 3 basis points pretty consistently during the month of June and early July turn into something that's more like 9 to 15 basis points. What had been 0 to negative yields on 3 months and under treasury bill are now anywhere from 9 to 15 basis points. So as I was saying before a little bit perversely in this case, our liquidity position and our shorter weighted average maturity, which generally speaking in a market that is not yet experiencing a rising rate environment, would as you ask cause rates to be lower, cause yields on the funds to be lower. In fact though, due to market conditions that are current, that's not the case. You have seen if you look at our reported deals over the course of this week, they've basically rising each day."

If, in fact, this is only a result of uncertainty in the marketplace at this point in time with regard to debt negotiation and the lack of a budget deal at this point and when that fact occurs, if you see those levels go back down again, then you'll see the projections of the waivers that they see, it's completely realistic.

We still think it goes forward and as such, when the market starts to realize that and continues to focus on it, yields will -- the yield curve will become a little bit more positively slow. The other side of the equation, what has really been problematic for money market funds especially in the second quarter and even to some degree in the first quarter of 2011 which huge amounts of cash sitting on the sidelines and waiting for certain situations to play themselves out before they went back into their natural marketplace. Hedge funds, sovereign debt investors for a large part of the first half of 2011, squarely sitting in the repo and the treasury marketplace creating more demand for a supply that is less and less from the investment banks and from the dealers in the marketplace. So it was simply a supply and demand thing where the demand was much greater. Once the resolution of the debt ceiling goes forward, those investors go back into those natural marketplaces and get out of our cash market, which cost us an imbalance on supply/demand basis to go back to normal and although we may not have the elevated rates in treasury that we see today as of 3 months, 9 to 15 basis points, we should not see the 0 to negative basis points that we are seeing for much of the months of June and July."

To some degree that might pe",676,"First of all, let me address the second part of the question first. Again, possible but we still think fairly unlikely events of a downgrade of some of the rating agencies for the long-term section of the U.S. government debt. To some degree that might perversely be helpful. And again I know that seems kind of crazy. But they're two reasons why I say that. Number one, I mentioned effectively that doesn't take away the status of U.S. government debt. Asked the weather slight quantity instrument, the largest volume, highest quality, most diverse, most offered, most sold instrument in the world. But still become it's still the most liquid instrument in the world and by that it's AA or AAA rated, it will maintain that status because a bubble a rating though it maintains a status with slightly higher yield component. So we are able to buy those treasury security that something that's slightly higher in yield. We don't have there's nothing on a mandated basis from a regulatory perspective. Nor from our perspective within those products that say we have to buy only treasury bills that are AAA rated. It just says that doesn't affect what we can buy and some way shape or form it could actually increased the yield of those instruments. The other side of the equation is we do have, there are some customers in the marketplace that do need AAA as their investment policy, could be potentially part of regulatory requirement and as such, if the treasury bill no longer meets that AAA requirement as I mentioned before, our money funds are still rated AAA. And they will maintain a AAA even without a AAA rating for the underlying treasury securities. So to some degree, the money fund will become the choice for those potentially who are using direct instrument themselves. So again, I'd certainly is not something that we would welcome or think is a high likelihood on a probability basis but there are some positive outcomes and consequences that could be as a result, of it. It back on the first part of your question, you're talking about differentiation between sovereigns and corporate and financial and marketplace and our people looking more towards corporate side of the equation but I do think couple of different things dynamic basis but are working. First of all, there are more corporates in the marketplace and although, we're not growing very quickly from an economic perspective, we are going forward in the economic basis and if you just look at sort of earnings in the corporate sector, they've been vastly positive in the credit metrics of those institutions have actually been improving. So they have more need on the customer and a gross basis underlying to actually borrow with a shorter market. Are there working capital purposes so there's been increased amount on supply in that type of paper. So I think there's more to choose from the and/or maybe 2 years ago when the U.S. was in recession. The other side of the question though is you have to think, you have to know, it may be is not intuitive but you have to know that if the U.S. sovereign some sort of a debt downgrade. Wal-Mart suffers in some way shape or form to. Johnson & Johnson suffers in some weight shape or form to. Exxon Mobil sufferers so it's not a safe haven that takes the place of what would be a downgraded U.S. Treasury security at that point your get would likely also have some flows through effects of those corporate. And potentially cause a reduction in what they need from a short-term financing perspective. But right now, they're doing well from a credit quality and analysis perspective. And in such, an economic situation that we're currently in, they're needing a little bit more funding. So those of those dynamics are positive but I don't think that's replacement in any way, shape, or form for what happened or what we use U.S. government debt for in our portfolios."

I will start with a brief review of Federated's recent business performance before turning the call over to Tom to discuss the financials. Looking first to cash management.

I will start with a brief review of Federated's recent business performance before turning the call over to Tom to discuss the financials. Looking first to cash management. Money market average assets decreased from the prior quarter due mainly to tax seasonality in separate account assets. Money market mutual fund average assets were nearly the same as the prior quarter. Our market share remains steady at around 8.8%. Debbie will comment later on recent money market conditions, including the impact of the debt ceiling and European banks. Tom will address related fee waivers. 
On the regulatory front, money funds continue to be an active topic of discussion based on comments from the SEC and the FSOC. The regulators believe that further changes should be considered and/or under review. We are unable to make any predictions on any particular outcome or a particular timeline. We do note however, that the industry issuers and investors in money funds are opposed to a fluctuating NAV. In our view, there is no evidence that a floating NAV would positively impact investor redemption patterns or improve the resiliency of money funds. In fact, we believe fluctuating NAVs would have the opposite effect. Capital buffers are not necessarily responsive to the severe liquidity crisis that negatively impacted money funds and other investors in 2008. Our initial reaction to ideas like the Squam Lake capital buffer before the results of the voluminous studies necessary to adequately research such a concept with this level of complexity, is that it's probably not a practical solution. One outcome could end up being too compressed or even eliminate the spread between prime and government fund yields, which would be just another way of ending prime funds, which is not the goal of the entire operation. 
We believe that money funds were meaningfully and sufficiently strengthened by last year's extensive revisions to 2a-7. And we're seeing those changes help now as we deal with the noise created around the perception of risk and prime money funds from European bank exposure. We remain favorably disposed to improvements that would enhance the resiliency of money funds by addressing the primary issue faced during the financial crisis namely a market-wide liquidity crunch. 
Now turning to our equities business, we have 6 actively managed strategies in a variety of styles that have top quartile 3-year records that are well positioned for growth: Capital income, Prudent Bear, International Leaders, International Strategic Value, Kaufmann Large Cap and Strategic Value Dividend. In particular, Strategic Value Dividend strategy is well-suited for investor demand for high-quality dividend income. It continues to produce strong flows with over $1.2 billion of year-to-date net inflows to funds and separate in accounts combined. The international version of this strategy reached its 3-year anniversary during the second quarter and achieved 5 stars as it ranked in the top 13% of its peer group for the trailing 3 years. This strategy, along with the InterContinental and International Leader Strategies provide a solid position in international equities with positive flows in the second quarter and lots of room for growth. 
Overall, equity fund net flows were negative in April and May but positive in June and slightly negative here in the first 3 weeks of July. Flows in equity separate accounts were negative mainly due to a $315 million redemption from an absolute return mandate, an area where we recently changed portfolio managers. Net sales of the Strategic Value Dividend strategy were solidly positive. And we saw another quarter of lower net redemptions in the MDT Quant strategies for SMAs, which improved from about minus $300 million in Q4 to minus $200 million in Q1, minus $77 million in Q2. 
On the Kaufmann Fund. The Kaufmann Fund performance improved in the second quarter as the fund ranked in the top third of its Lipper category similar in Morningstar. The Kaufmann Large Cap Fund ranked in the top decile of its category and the Small Cap Fund ranked in the top 14% for the quarter. The core Kaufmann team and investment process remained intact. The team's approach is to focus on high-quality growth companies and use extensive proprietary research and a bottom subtile with high conviction and low turnover. Obviously, a long-term approach. So that if we looked at the 22-rolling, 3-year performance periods beginning with 1986, the fund was ranked in the first quartile 14 times and was ranked in the fourth quartile only 4 times, 3 of which were in the '98, '99 and 2000 period. Interestingly, past periods of underperformance were followed by substantial outperformance. 
Turning to fixed income. Fund flows were negative in April and May and then turned positive in June. These flows are positive through the first 3 weeks of July led by the Total Return Bond Fund and the return to positive muni fund flows. During the second quarter, Total Return Bond Fund showed modest outflows due largely to a couple of significant asset allocation changes made by investors in April and May that combined for about $360 million in lumpy redemptions. Fund returned to modestly positive inflows for June and into July. We also saw reduced outflows in municipal bond funds during the second quarter and inflows in July, as I mentioned. The strategies with positive second quarter flows include Total Return Bond -- Total Return Government Fund, high yield, international and stable value. We also add solid inflows into 2 recently launched funds, our Federated Unconstrained Bond Fund and our Federated Floating Rate Strategic Income Fund. 
Turning to investment performance. Looking at quarter-end Lipper rankings for Federated's equity funds, 27% of rated assets are in the first or second quarter over the last year, 38%, 3 years, 24%, 5 years, 80%, 10 years. For bond assets, Bond Fund assets, the comparable first and second quartile percentages are 29%, 1 year, 50%, 3 years, 70%, 5 years and 75%, for 10 years. Looking at Morningstar rated funds, 25% of rated assets are in the 4 and 5-star products and as of 6/30, and 82% are in 3 and 4 and 5-star product. At quarter end, we had 10 equity funds with Morningstar top quartile 1-year performance, including international Strategic Value Dividend, Capital Income, asset allocation, InterContinental and International Leaders Funds along with several MBP funds. We also had 7 equity funds with top quartile 3-year records and 7 funds with top quartile 5-year records. As of July 27, managed assets were approximately $349 billion, including $265 billion in money market, $31 billion in equities, $53 billion in fixed income including our liquidation portfolios. Money market mutual fund assets stand at about $237 billion. So far in July, money market fund assets have ranged between $237 billion and $241 billion and have averaged $239 billion. 
Looking at some of our distribution highlights, year-to-date, gross sales of equity funds and separate accounts on a combined basis increased about 19% compared to the same period in 2010. We continue to invest in distribution capabilities and are in the process of adding 12 new sales personnel to the broker-dealer sales division. We are encouraged by sale success in this area over the last 3 years. Since 2008, broker-dealer sales have increased from approximately $6.4 billion and $12 billion. And the number of advisors doing significant business with us has increased from 29,000 and 35,000. The added resources will enable us to penetrate additional mid-sized broker-dealer firms. 
We've also recently hired 3 new Consultant Relation Reps in our institutional area to broaden our reach within the institutional consultants and plan sponsors. We are also modestly investing in advertising with an initial focus on the Strategic Value Dividend strategy. We were in print and Web campaign advertisements over the last couple of months. We've been pleased with the results and plan to run additional ads later in the year. 
Regarding acquisitions, we remain focused on developing an alliance to further advance our business outside of the United States. As we work on this, we are also having success abroad for cash management. During the second quarter, we added $2 billion in new business from a large offshore client. We're also working on 2 new money market portal opportunities in the U.K. and have received approval in Ireland for our sterling-denominated money fund that will launched in Q3. In the U.S., we're actively seeking consolidation deals. We recently completed the 2 deals we announced last quarter, with the EquiTrust Funds and the Tributary International Equity Fund, adding about $600 million in new assets in a variety of strategies. Now for the financials, I'll turn it over to Tom."

And as Chris mentioned, conditions for money market funds continue to be challenging in the second quarter and into the third quarter here. Money fund yield waivers reduced pretax income by $19.4 million for the quarter compared to $13.1",481,"Thank you, Chris. And as Chris mentioned, conditions for money market funds continue to be challenging in the second quarter and into the third quarter here. Money fund yield waivers reduced pretax income by $19.4 million for the quarter compared to $13.1 million in the prior quarter. The line items impacted are covered in the press release. Yields decreased during the quarter was led to waivers exceeding the April calculation based on then current market conditions. Yields have generally trended lower as the market deals with the debt-ceiling issue and concerns over European debt. Based on recent market conditions and asset levels, these waivers could reduce income by approximately $23 million in Q3 for Federated. 
More recently, we've seen an uptick in rates for repo and T-bills, which impact waiver levels in the government funds. Expect these rates to move off of the extremely low levels in the first couple of weeks of July as we move towards some resolution of the debt-ceiling issue. We have seen some upward movement over the last couple of days. And Debbie will review this in a few minutes. 
Looking forward, we estimate that gaining 10 basis points in gross yields will likely reduce the impact of these waivers by about 1/3 from the current levels. And a 25 basis-point increase would reduce the impact by about 2/3. Looking at total revenue, the decrease from the prior quarter was due to higher money fund waivers, partially offset by one additional day in the quarter and by higher equity and fixed income-related revenues. We continue to properly manage expenses and continue to invest for growth. The operating margin was higher in Q2 than in the prior quarter, calculated before the litigation settlement expense booked in its first quarter. The operating margin was also higher compared to Q2 2010, calculated before unusual items related to insurance recovery and impairment charges. 
We amended and restated our term credit facility in the second quarter to revise the facility contained to $200 million revolver to replace the previous facility, which was scheduled to expire later this year. On the term portion, we were able to lower interest expense and we expect to save about $8 million in interest expense over the life of the facility. We expect interest expense in the third quarter will be approximately $3.6 million, down from $4.2 million in Q2. 
Looking at our balance sheet, cash and marketable securities totaled $294 million at quarter end. This, combined with expected additional cash flows from operation and availability under present debt facility, provides us with significant liquidity to be able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities, as well as the ability to fund related contingent payments, share repurchases dividend, new product seeds and other investments, capital expenditures and debt repayments. Before we take questions, we'd like to have Debbie comment on the recent market in money market world."

I thought I'd cover just 3 quick topics: our outlook and what's happening from a short-term rate perspective, what's the current state of affairs from a European bank exposure perspective and then the most -- the newest item of concern is tha",1163,"Thanks, Tom. I thought I'd cover just 3 quick topics: our outlook and what's happening from a short-term rate perspective, what's the current state of affairs from a European bank exposure perspective and then the most -- the newest item of concern is that the debt-ceiling negotiations for the U.S. Treasury. 
From a rate outlook perspective, if you look at the yield curve for money market securities today versus a year -- or a quarter ago, it's relatively steeper but it's steeper for the wrong reason. It's steeper because the shortest end of the yield curve has actually lost a few basis points in yield. So one to 3 months is basically 2 to 3 basis points more expensive with lower yields than where we were a quarter ago. A lot of back-end to the yield curve, which nobody's really buying too much at this point, 6 to 12 months has remained flat. Our expectation from an outlook perspective for Fed tightening has been pushed into 2012, and that's reflective of the slower growth that we've been experiencing from an economic perspective. We do continue to believe that, that there will be some yield curve steepening in the second half of 2011, with the back end of the yield curve backing up to some degree and more opportunity in the marketplace to buy some better relative value positions as the second half of 2011 proceeds. 
From a European bank perspective, a couple of things have happened in the recent times. The stress test for those banks by the EU has been completed, with some amount of success afforded to that completion. The package for Greek debt restructuring has also been reached and although it is not a quick fix in the marketplace, we never thought it would be, this was going to take up to a decade to proceed smoothly and get completed. But it has received fairly good market impact. And by that I look at the spreads that we see on the European banks and again, we use 22 different banks, highest-quality banks within the eurozone, high-quality ratings diverse underlying the -- of their loan portfolio and effectively these banks have stayed the same from a spread perspective in the marketplace to widening maybe 2 to 3 basis points. 
From a Federated prime fund exposure, we have currently and will still maintain, are still maintaining somewhere in the neighborhood of between 40% and 45% of our prime funds to exposure with these European banks. Again, we have no direct exposure to the Greek banks but the European banks that we use do have some exposure on a secondary basis to the sovereign Greek nation. And again, we're continuing to be comfortable with the ownership of these banks. We post that on our Website on an every 2-week basis so you can get the most quarterly information there when you're looking for it. 
The third item is the debt-ceiling issue and the potential concerns in the marketplace about a default downgrade and then sort of looking at just the market quick conditions and the liquidity in the marketplace. From a default perspective, we think this is a very remote likelihood if we require it if it did actually did happen from our perspective. Fund Board of Directors action, the -- we would need to make as an advisor, a recommendation to the Board of Directors based on the underlying credit quality of the nation itself, market valuations, the fact that this is not an insolvency issue but rather a willingness to pay and a political theater issue. All of it, as of this point would lead that if we had to come to such a situation, our recommendation would be to maintain the ownership of these technically defaulted instruments at that point again, thinking that this is a very remote possibility. 
On the other side of the equation is the downgrade. There's been lines drawn in the sand from the rating agencies as to what to expect from a debt-cut perspective in order for the AAA ratings to be maintained. We think this is less remote, obviously than a default, but still we don't think this is probable. First thing to note is the downgrade is on a potential basis for long-term ratings only, not short-term ratings. So nothing would be affected from the short-term ratings perspective for the securities that are held within money market fund. What this would do is basically raise the level, off which spreads are measured. 
Treasury securities are still the largest with the most volume, most liquid, as highest quality instruments in the world, not surpassed by Johnson & Johnson, not surpassed by Wal-Mart and some of the others in the marketplace that has been noted. And certainly not surpassed by bank deposits where, in fact, the backing of those banks comes from the U.S. government. So these would still maintain their liquidity in the marketplace but with the price volatility, that would be a little bit more stringent than what it has been in the past and at a base level off of which the rest of the market would price at slightly higher than it is today. From a Federated fund perspective, despite the outlook for negative potential downgrade for the long-term ratings for the U.S. government debt, the Federated money market funds have been affirmed with their AAA ratings. So even if the U.S. debt was downgraded to the AA, double AA+, AA-, whatever would happen to be, at this point, the AAA ratings for Federated funds would be maintained. 
From a market conditions perspective, we're looking at Treasury Bill Rates that are actually finally paying us something in the context of this negotiation and the extended time period that it's taking. So and perversely, it has a little bit of a positive effect overall on the underlying yields of our portfolios, the treasury curve which has been flat to negative out to 3 months, just a week and a half today -- a week and a half ago, now stands anywhere between 9 and 15 basis points. So we're actually getting paid for taking the risk of ownership of treasury securities during the month of August, September and October. 
Lastly, from a Federated funds perspective and a flow standpoint, you noticed on the July asset, the assets from money market funds are not markedly changed, and we are not seeing clients moving with negative outflows due to these issues. A few are, but certainly not in any widespread form and not in any way, shape, or form reflective of any kind of a problem. The liquidity in these products is high, the weighted average maturities is low, positions ourselves well for what we think is the second half, steepening at a yield curve. And it provides ourselves with a lot of comfort for our shareholders in the context of liquidity that might be needed. With that, I'll turn it back to Ray."

And there's a lot more ideas that people could come up with, that will still be studied. And so I would say that it would be wise for somebody like Federated to not allow that to restrain us from moving forward. And we don't think they're going to be doing anything that would kill the money market fund business in any event. All of the ideas are always couched in terms of study more and then even the FSOC recently mentioned things like, in order to increase stability, market discipline and investor confidence, things should be studied. And I think when the verdict comes in of all of the studies, you will find the money market funds standing there, though they are in there imperfect position, withstanding the resiliency, demonstrating the resiliency they have to customers and in the marketplace. So that would be how I would look at the issue of money market fund regulation versus M&A activity. I'll let Tom handle the other part of your question."

As I said, there are much for us to make a judgment about which one of these things can work when we don't initially perceive their workability. They didn't like the sort of polite capital ideas that Fidelity had with 40 or 50 basis points of buffer. They didn't like the liquidity bank, which took care of the major problem that occurred in 2008, namely liquidity of the whole system. And so they get down to ideas, which have not shown themselves to be workable. Several percentage points of capital is neither economic nor viable in terms of maintaining the existence of prime funds. So it's really hard for me to try and say, oh, which one of these things is ahead of the others. If you do however, look at some of the phrases they've used, they talk about something called deterrence to redemption. I don't know what exactly they mean by that, that's a quote out of FSOC. But if what they are talking about are some pretty legitimate ideas that we think could work, for example, the way we did the Putnam deal back in the day, was that the Putnam board decided to hit pause on redemptions for a week and then turned the whole fund over to us. And there was plenty of liquidity in the system because the Fed opened up the windows to buy good paper. So notice there was no credit maneuver here, it was all on liquidity. Well, if you give the board the right to do that without forcing a liquidation, that would be an interesting one. Another one on that would be, well what about redemption in kind, it's been discussed many times. And there's an example of a fund, the AMR fund, who basically said they were going to do a redemption in kind and that ended the redemptions. I don't know if that's what they have in mind, or not. And one other idea which was put out early on, that had to do with this, was to simply say if you run into reserve fund, then take the 3% and set that aside and give everybody else daily liquidity of par on the 97% of the fund that's there. And proceed down that road. And maybe that's, say, what they mean by deterrence to redemption. But at this point, there's a lot of work that has to be done if they're thinking about doing the things that Squam Lake has been talking about."

As well as shorter weighted-average maturities, which is also reflective of that additional liquidity. Not so much because of concern out of shareholder redemption, but it plays nicely into sort of our strategy of thinking that later in the year, we're going to see better yield curve opportunities and have better relative value decision that can be made at that point. What is actually also kind of interesting at this point when I was mentioning what's happening from a Treasury Bill perspective, a lot of the reasons why we weren't investing and there were periods of time during the month of July when we actually just had cash in our government portfolios because all that was available to buy at that point in time in the marketplace for the duration of securities that we were looking for, were at 0 to negative yield. So it seemed like less risky of a strategy to just simply leave it in cash. That is not the case with today's portfolios. And that's a reflection of the fact that many who are sitting on the sidelines or were in our market from a cash perspective have left, as such when those investors have left the marketplace, yields on Treasury and repo securities have started to lift. What has been overnight Treasury and mortgage-backed repo rates of one in 3 basis points, pretty consistently, during the month of June and early July, turned into something that's more like 9 to 15 basis points. What had been 0 to negative yields on 3 months and under Treasury Bills are now anywhere from 9 to 15 basis points. So as I was saying before, a little bit perversely in this case, our liquidity position and our shorter weighted-average maturity, which generally speaking in a market that is not yet experiencing a rising rate environment, would as you ask, cause rates to be lower, cause yields on the funds to be lower. In fact though, due to market conditions that are current, that's not the case. You'll have seen, if you look at our reported deals over the course of this week, they've been basically rising each day."

The other side of the equation, what has really been problematic for money market funds especially in the second quarter and even to some degree in the first quarter of 2011 which huge amounts of cash sitting on the sidelines and waiting for certain situations to play themselves out before they went back into their natural marketplace. Hedge funds, sovereign debt investors were -- for a large part of the first half of 2011, squarely sitting in the repo and the treasury marketplace, creating more demand for a supply that is less and less from the investment banks and from the dealers to the marketplace. So it was simply a supply-demand thing where the demand was much greater. Once the resolution of the debt ceiling goes forward, those investors go back into those -- their natural marketplaces and get out of our cash markets, which cost us an imbalance on a supply-demand basis to go back to normal. And although we may not have the elevated rates in treasury that we see today as of 3 months, 9 to 15 basis points, we should not see the 0 to negative basis points that we were seeing for much of the months of June and July."

First of all, let me address the second part of the question first. In the -- again, possible but we still think fairly unlikely events of a downgrade of some of the rating agencies for the long-term section of U.S. government debts, to some degree",720,"Sure. First of all, let me address the second part of the question first. In the -- again, possible but we still think fairly unlikely events of a downgrade of some of the rating agencies for the long-term section of U.S. government debts, to some degree that might perversely be helpful. And again, I know that seems kind of crazy, but there are 2 reasons why I say that: Number one, I mentioned effectively that doesn't take away the status of U.S. government debts as the bell weather the slight quality instrument, the largest volume, highest quality, most diverse, most offered, most sold instrument in the world. It's still become, it is still the most liquid instrument in the world. And whether the AA or AAA rated, it will maintain that status. As a AA raring though, it maintains that status that's lightly higher yield component. So we are able then to buy those treasury securities that's something that's slightly higher in yield. We don't have -- there's nothing on a mandated basis from a regulatory perspective nor from our prospectuses within those products that say we have to buy only treasury bills that are AAA rated. It just says we supply treasury securities, so that doesn't affect what we can buy and in some way, shape or form, it could actually increase the yields of those instruments. The other side of the equation is, we do have -- there are some customers in the marketplace that do need AAAs as far as their investment policy. It could potentially be part of their regulatory requirements. And as such, if the treasury bill no longer meets that AAA requirement, as I mentioned before, our money funds are still rated AAA. And they will maintain a AAA even without a AAA rating for the underlying holdings of treasury securities. So to some degrees, the money fund will become a choice for those who potentially were using direct instruments themselves. So again, I'd certainly -- a downgrade is not something that we would welcome, look forward to, think as a high likelihood on a probability basis. But there are some positive outcomes and consequences that could be as a result of it. Back to the first part of your question, when you're talking about the differentiation between sovereigns and corporates and financials in the marketplace and our people looking more towards the corporate side of the equation, I do think there are a couple of different things on a dynamic basis that are working there. First of all, there are more corporates in the marketplace, and although we're not growing very quickly from an economic perspective, we are going forward on an economic basis. And if you just look at sort of earnings in the corporate sector, they've been vastly positive, and the credit metrics of those institutions have actually been improving. So they have more need on the customer and a gross basis underlying to actually borrow in a short-term market for their working capital purposes. So there's an increased amount of supply in that type of paper. So I think that there's more to choose from than there may be 1 to 2 years ago when the U.S. was in a recession. The other side of the equation though is, you have to think, you have to know, it maybe is not intuitive, but you have to know that if the U.S. suffers some sort of a debt downgrade. Wal-Mart suffers in some way, shape or form to. Johnson & Johnson suffers in some way, shape or form to. Exxon Mobil suffers in some way, shape or form too. So it's not a safe haven that takes the place of what would be a downgraded U.S. Treasury security at that point. It would likely also have some flows from effects to those corporates, and potentially cause a reduction in what they need from a short-term financing perspective. But right now, they're doing well from a credit, quality and analysis perspective. And in such an economic situation that we're currently in, they're needing a little bit more funding. So those of those dynamics are positive, but I don't think it's a replacement in any way, shape or form for what happens or what we'd use U.S. government debt for in our portfolios."

And the result and change in yield spreads and the yield curve itself will likely, I think, attract the natural bond investors back out into the bond curve.

I will start with a brief review of Federated's recent business performance before turning the call over to Tom to discuss the financials. Looking first to cash management.

I will start with a brief review of Federated's recent business performance before turning the call over to Tom to discuss the financials. Looking first to cash management. Money market average assets decreased from the prior quarter due mainly to tax seasonality in separate account assets. Money market mutual fund average assets were nearly the same as the prior quarter. Our market share remains steady at around 8.8%. Debbie will comment later on recent money market conditions, including the impact of the debt ceiling and European banks. Tom will address related fee waivers. 
On the regulatory front, money funds continue to be an active topic of discussion based on comments from the SEC and the FSOC. The regulators believe that further changes should be considered and are under review. We are unable to make any predictions on any particular outcome or a particular timeline. We do note however, that the industry issuers and investors in money funds are opposed to a fluctuating NAV. In our view, there is no evidence that a floating NAV would positively impact investor redemption patterns or improve the resiliency of money funds. In fact, we believe fluctuating NAVs would have the opposite effect. Capital buffers are not necessarily responsive to the severe liquidity crisis that negatively impacted money funds and other investors in 2008. Our initial reaction to ideas like the Squam Lake capital buffer before the results of the voluminous studies necessary to adequately research such a concept with this level of complexity, is that it's probably not a practical solution. One outcome could end up being too compressed or even eliminate the spread between prime and government fund yields, which would be just another way of ending prime funds, which is not the goal of the entire operation. 
We believe that money funds were meaningfully and sufficiently strengthened by last year's extensive revisions to 2a-7. And we're seeing those changes help now as we deal with the noise created around the perception of risk and prime money funds from European bank exposure. We remain favorably disposed to improvements that would enhance the resiliency of money funds by addressing the primary issue faced during the financial crisis namely a market-wide liquidity crunch. 
Now turning to our equities business, we have 6 actively managed strategies in a variety of styles that have top quartile 3-year records that are well positioned for growth: Capital income, Prudent Bear, International Leaders, International Strategic Value, Kaufmann Large Cap and Strategic Value Dividend. In particular, Strategic Value Dividend strategy is well-suited for investor demand for high-quality dividend income. It continues to produce strong flows with over $1.2 billion of year-to-date net inflows to funds and separate accounts combined. The international version of this strategy reached its 3-year anniversary during the second quarter and achieved 5 stars as it ranked in the top 13% of its peer group for the trailing 3 years. This strategy, along with the InterContinental and International Leader Strategies provide a solid position in international equities with positive flows in the second quarter and lots of room for growth. 
Overall, equity fund net flows were negative in April and May but positive in June and slightly negative here in the first 3 weeks of July. Flows in equity separate accounts were negative mainly due to a $315 million redemption from an absolute return mandate, an area where we recently changed portfolio managers. Net sales of the Strategic Value Dividend strategy were solidly positive. And we saw another quarter of lower net redemptions in the MDT Quant strategies for SMAs, which improved from about minus $300 million in Q4 to minus $200 million in Q1, minus $77 million in Q2. 
On the Kaufmann Fund. The Kaufmann Fund performance improved in the second quarter as the fund ranked in the top third of its Lipper category similar in Morningstar. The Kaufmann Large Cap Fund ranked in the top decile of its category and the Small Cap Fund ranked in the top 14% for the quarter. The core Kaufmann team and investment process remained intact. The team's approach is to focus on high-quality growth companies and use extensive proprietary research and a ""bottom's up"" style with high conviction and low turnover. Obviously, a long-term approach. So that if we looked at the 22-rolling, 3-year performance periods beginning with 1986, the fund was ranked in the first quartile 14 times and was ranked in the fourth quartile only 4 times, 3 of which were in the '98, '99 and 2000 period. Interestingly, past periods of underperformance were followed by substantial outperformance. 
Turning to fixed income. Fund flows were negative in April and May and then turned positive in June. These flows are positive through the first 3 weeks of July led by the Total Return Bond Fund and the return to positive muni fund flows. During the second quarter, Total Return Bond Fund showed modest outflows due largely to a couple of significant asset allocation changes made by investors in April and May that combined for about $360 million in lumpy redemptions. Fund returned to modestly positive inflows for June and into July. We also saw reduced outflows in municipal bond funds during the second quarter and inflows in July, as I mentioned. The strategies with positive second quarter flows include Total Return Bond -- Total Return Government Fund, high yield, international and stable value. We also add solid inflows into 2 recently launched funds, our Federated Unconstrained Bond Fund and our Federated Floating Rate Strategic Income Fund. 
Turning to investment performance. Looking at quarter-end Lipper rankings for Federated's equity funds, 27% of rated assets are in the first or second quarter over the last year, 38%, 3 years, 24%, 5 years, 80%, 10 years. For bond assets, Bond Fund assets, the comparable first and second quartile percentages are 29%, 1 year, 50%, 3 years, 70%, 5 years and 75%, for 10 years. Looking at Morningstar rated funds, 25% of rated assets are in the 4 and 5-star products and as of 6/30, and 82% are in 3 and 4 and 5-star product. At quarter end, we had 10 equity funds with Morningstar top quartile 1-year performance, including International Strategic Value Dividend, Capital Income, Asset Allocation, InterContinental and International Leaders Funds along with several MBP funds. We also had 7 equity funds with top quartile 3-year records and 7 funds with top quartile 5-year records. As of July 27, managed assets were approximately $349 billion, including $265 billion in money market, $31 billion in equities, $53 billion in fixed income including our liquidation portfolios. Money market mutual fund assets stand at about $237 billion. So far in July, money market fund assets have ranged between $237 billion and $241 billion and have averaged $239 billion. 
Looking at some of our distribution highlights, year-to-date, gross sales of equity funds and separate accounts on a combined basis increased about 19% compared to the same period in 2010. We continue to invest in distribution capabilities and are in the process of adding 12 new sales personnel to the broker-dealer sales division. We are encouraged by sale success in this area over the last 3 years. Since 2008, broker-dealer sales have increased from approximately $6.4 billion to $12 billion. And the number of advisors doing significant business with us has increased from 29,000 and 35,000. The added resources will enable us to penetrate additional mid-sized broker-dealer firms. 
We've also recently hired 3 new Consultant Relation Reps in our institutional area to broaden our reach within the institutional consultants and plan sponsors. We are also modestly investing in advertising with an initial focus on the Strategic Value Dividend strategy. We were in print and Web campaign advertisements over the last couple of months. We've been pleased with the results and plan to run additional ads later in the year. 
Regarding acquisitions, we remain focused on developing an alliance to further advance our business outside of the United States. As we work on this, we are also having success abroad for cash management. During the second quarter, we added $2 billion in new business from a large offshore client. We're also working on 2 new money market portal opportunities in the U.K. and have received approval in Ireland for our sterling-denominated money fund that will launched in Q3. In the U.S., we're actively seeking consolidation deals. We recently completed the 2 deals we announced last quarter, with the EquiTrust Funds and the Tributary International Equity Fund, adding about $600 million in new assets in a variety of strategies. Now for the financials, I'll turn it over to Tom."
383724,137097927,149228,"Federated Investors, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2011",2011-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Federated Hermes, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris. And as Chris mentioned, conditions for money market funds continue to be challenging in the second quarter and into the third quarter here. Money fund yield waivers reduced pretax income by $19.4 million for the quarter compared to $13.1",481,"Thank you, Chris. And as Chris mentioned, conditions for money market funds continue to be challenging in the second quarter and into the third quarter here. Money fund yield waivers reduced pretax income by $19.4 million for the quarter compared to $13.1 million in the prior quarter. The line items impacted are covered in the press release. Yields decreased during the quarter which led to waivers exceeding the April calculation based on then current market conditions. Yields have generally trended lower as the market deals with the debt-ceiling issue and concerns over European debt. Based on recent market conditions and asset levels, these waivers could reduce income by approximately $23 million in Q3 for Federated. 
More recently, we've seen an uptick in rates for repo and T-bills, which impact waiver levels in the government funds. Expect these rates to move off of the extremely low levels in the first couple of weeks of July as we move towards some resolution of the debt-ceiling issue. We have seen some upward movement over the last couple of days. And Debbie will review this in a few minutes. 
Looking forward, we estimate that gaining 10 basis points in gross yields will likely reduce the impact of these waivers by about 1/3 from the current levels. And a 25 basis-point increase would reduce the impact by about 2/3. Looking at total revenue, the decrease from the prior quarter was due to higher money fund waivers, partially offset by one additional day in the quarter and by higher equity and fixed income-related revenues. We continue to properly manage expenses and continue to invest for growth. The operating margin was higher in Q2 than in the prior quarter, calculated before the litigation settlement expense booked in its first quarter. The operating margin was also higher compared to Q2 2010, calculated before unusual items related to insurance recovery and impairment charges. 
We amended and restated our term credit facility in the second quarter to revise the facility contained to $200 million revolver to replace the previous facility, which was scheduled to expire later this year. On the term portion, we were able to lower interest expense and we expect to save about $8 million in interest expense over the life of the facility. We expect interest expense in the third quarter will be approximately $3.6 million, down from $4.2 million in Q2. 
Looking at our balance sheet, cash and marketable securities totaled $294 million at quarter end. This, combined with expected additional cash flows from operation and availability under present debt facility, provides us with significant liquidity to be able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities, as well as the ability to fund related contingent payments, share repurchases, dividends, new product seeds and other investments, capital expenditures and debt repayments. Before we take questions, we'd like to have Debbie comment on the recent market in money market world."
383724,137097927,149228,"Federated Investors, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2011",2011-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Federated Hermes, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom. I thought I'd cover just 3 quick topics: our outlook and what's happening from a short-term rate perspective, what's the current state of affairs from a European bank exposure perspective and then the most -- the newest item of concern is tha",1161,"Thanks, Tom. I thought I'd cover just 3 quick topics: our outlook and what's happening from a short-term rate perspective, what's the current state of affairs from a European bank exposure perspective and then the most -- the newest item of concern is that the debt-ceiling negotiations for the U.S. Treasury. 
From a rate outlook perspective, if you look at the yield curve for money market securities today versus a year -- or a quarter ago, it's relatively steeper but it's steeper for the wrong reason. It's steeper because the shortest end of the yield curve has actually lost a few basis points in yield. So one to 3 months is basically 2 to 3 basis points more expensive with lower yields than where we were a quarter ago. While the back-end of the yield curve, which nobody's really buying too much at this point, 6 to 12 months has remained flat. Our expectation from an outlook perspective for Fed tightening has been pushed into 2012, and that's reflective of the slower growth that we've been experiencing from an economic perspective. We do continue to believe though, that there will be some yield curve steepening in the second half of 2011, with the back end of the yield curve backing up to some degree and more opportunity in the marketplace to buy some better relative value positions as the second half of 2011 proceeds. 
From a European bank perspective, a couple of things have happened in the recent times. The stress test for those banks by the EU has been completed, with some amount of success afforded to that completion. The package for Greek debt restructuring has also been reached and although it is not a quick fix in the marketplace, we never thought it would be, this was going to take up to a decade to proceed smoothly and get completed. But it has received fairly good market impact. And by that I look at the spreads that we see on the European banks and again, we use 22 different banks, highest-quality banks within the eurozone, high-quality ratings diverse underlying the -- of their loan portfolio and effectively these banks have stayed the same from a spread perspective in the marketplace to widening maybe 2 to 3 basis points. 
From a Federated prime fund exposure, we have currently and will still maintain, are still maintaining, somewhere in the neighborhood of between 40% and 45% of our prime funds to exposure with these European banks. Again, we have no direct exposure to the Greek banks but the European banks that we use do have some exposure on a secondary basis to the sovereign Greek nation. And again, we're continuing to be comfortable with the ownership of these banks. We post that on our Website on an every 2-week basis so you can get the most quarterly information there when you're looking for it. 
The third item is the debt-ceiling issue and the potential concerns in the marketplace about a default downgrade and then sort of looking at just the market quick conditions and the liquidity in the marketplace. From a default perspective, we think this is a very remote likelihood if we require it if it did actually did happen from our perspective. Fund Board of Directors action, the -- we would need to make as an advisor, a recommendation to the Board of Directors based on the underlying credit quality of the nation itself, market valuations, the fact that this is not an insolvency issue but rather a willingness to pay and a political theater issue. All of those, at this point would lead that if we had to come to such a situation, our recommendation would be to maintain the ownership of these technically defaulted instruments at that point. Again, thinking that this is a very remote possibility. 
On the other side of the equation is the downgrade. There's been lines drawn in the sand from the rating agencies as to what to expect from a debt-cut perspective in order for the AAA ratings to be maintained. We think this is less remote, obviously than a default, but still we don't think this is probable. First thing to note is the downgrade is on a potential basis for long-term ratings only, not short-term ratings. So nothing would be affected from the short-term ratings perspective for the securities that are held within money market fund. What this would do is basically raise the level, off which spreads are measured. 
Treasury securities are still the largest with the most volume, most liquid, as highest quality instruments in the world, not surpassed by Johnson & Johnson, not surpassed by Wal-Mart and some of the others in the marketplace that have been noted. And certainly not surpassed by bank deposits where, in fact, the backing of those banks comes from the U.S. government. So these would still maintain their liquidity in the marketplace but with the price volatility, that would be a little bit more stringent than what it has been in the past and at a base level off of which the rest of the market would price at slightly higher than it is today. From a Federated fund perspective, despite the outlook for negative potential downgrade for the long-term ratings for the U.S. government debt, the Federated money market funds have been affirmed with their AAA ratings. So even if the U.S. debt was downgraded to the AA, double AA+, AA-, whatever would happen to be, at this point, the AAA ratings for Federated funds would be maintained. 
From a market conditions perspective, we're looking at Treasury Bill Rates that are actually finally paying us something in the context of this negotiation and the extended time period that it's taking. So and perversely, it has a little bit of a positive effect overall on the underlying yields of our portfolios, the treasury curve which has been flat to negative out to 3 months, just a week and a half today -- a week and a half ago, now stands anywhere between 9 and 15 basis points. So we're actually getting paid for taking the risk of ownership of treasury securities during the months of August, September and October. 
Lastly, from a Federated funds perspective and a flow standpoint, you noticed on the July assets, the assets from money market funds are not markedly changed, and we are not seeing clients moving with negative outflows due to these issues. A few are, but certainly not in any widespread form and not in any way, shape, or form reflective of any kind of a problem. The liquidity in these products is high, the weighted average maturities is low, positions ourselves well for what we think is the second half, steepening of the yield curve. And it provides ourselves with a lot of comfort for our shareholders in the context of liquidity that might be needed. With that, I'll turn it back to Ray."

And so I would say that it would be wise for somebody like Federated to not allow that to restrain us from moving forward. And we don't think they're going to be doing anything that would kill the money market fund business in any event. All of the ideas are always couched in terms of study more and then even the FSOC recently mentioned things like, in order to increase stability, market discipline and investor confidence, things should be studied. And I think when the verdict comes in of all of the studies, you will find the money market funds standing there, though they are in there imperfect position, withstanding the resiliency, demonstrating the resiliency they have to customers and in the marketplace. So that would be how I would look at the issue of money market fund regulation versus M&A activity. I'll let Tom handle the other part of your question."

As I said, there are much for us to make a judgment about which one of these things can work when we don't initially perceive their workability. They didn't like the sort of polite capital ideas that Fidelity had with 40 or 50 basis points of buffer. They didn't like the liquidity bank, which took care of the major problem that occurred in 2008, namely liquidity of the whole system. And so they get down to ideas, which have not shown themselves to be workable. Several percentage points of capital is neither economic nor viable in terms of maintaining the existence of prime funds. So it's really hard for me to try and say, oh, which one of these things is ahead of the others. If you do however, look at some of the phrases they've used, they talk about something called deterrence to redemption. I don't know what exactly they mean by that, that's a quote out of FSOC. But if what they are talking about are some pretty legitimate ideas that we think could work, for example, the way we did the Putnam deal back in the day, was that the Putnam board decided to hit pause on redemptions for a week and then turned the whole fund over to us. And there was plenty of liquidity in the system because the Fed opened up the windows to buy good paper. So notice there was no credit maneuver here, it was all on liquidity. Well, if you give the board the right to do that without forcing a liquidation, that would be an interesting one. Another one on that would be, well what about redemption in kind, it's been discussed many times. And there's an example of a fund, the AMR fund, who basically said they were going to do a redemption in kind and that ended the redemptions. I don't know if that's what they have in mind, or not. And one other idea which was put out early on, that had to do with this, was to simply say if you run into reserve fund, then take the 3% and set that aside and give everybody else daily liquidity of par on the 97% of the fund that's there. And proceed down that road. And maybe that's a, what they mean by deterrence to redemption. But at this point, there's a lot of work that has to be done if they're thinking about doing the things that Squam Lake has been talking about."

As well as shorter weighted-average maturities, which is also reflective of that additional liquidity. Not so much because of concern out of shareholder redemption, but it plays nicely into sort of our strategy of thinking that later in the year, we're going to see better yield curve opportunities and have better relative value decisions that can be made at that point. What is actually also kind of interesting at this point when I was mentioning what's happening from a Treasury Bill perspective, a lot of the reasons why we weren't investing and there were periods of time during the month of July when we actually just had cash in our government portfolios because all that was available to buy at that point in time in the marketplace for the duration of securities that we were looking for, were at 0 to negative yield. So it seemed like less risky of a strategy to just simply leave it in cash. That is not the case with today's portfolios. And that's a reflection of the fact that many who are sitting on the sidelines or were in our market from a cash perspective have left, as such when those investors have left the marketplace, yields on Treasury and repo securities have started to lift. What had been overnight Treasury and mortgage-backed repo rates of one in 3 basis points, pretty consistently, during the month of June and early July, turned into something that's more like 9 to 15 basis points. What had been 0 to negative yields on 3 months and under Treasury Bills are now anywhere from 9 to 15 basis points. So as I was saying before, a little bit perversely in this case, our liquidity position and our shorter weighted-average maturity, which generally speaking in a market that is not yet experiencing a rising rate environment, would as you ask, cause rates to be lower, cause yields on the funds to be lower. In fact though, due to market conditions that are current, that's not the case. You'll have seen, if you looked at our reported deals over the course of this week, they've been basically rising each day."

And along with that sort of the quantitative tightening cycle beginning, but we do think the anticipation of that in the context of a continued growing economy although on a slower growth path, we'll start to see some yield curve opportunities with the buy -- a bit of the back end of that yield curve steepening out to some degree in the second half and giving us a little bit more opportunity for that short paper that we have in there that we'd like to place further on the curve but just don't feel like it's quite right on an opportunistic basis.

So if this holds, you'll see the yield start to go upwards and be reflective of those short-term rates. If, in fact, this is only a result of uncertainty in the marketplace at this point in time with regard to debt negotiations and the lack of a budget deal at this point and when that in fact occurs, if you see those levels go back down again, then you'll see the projections of the waivers that they see.

We don't think we're in a double dip type of recessionary environment and we do think, although as I've said before, growth will be slower on an economic basis in the second half. We still think it goes forward. And as such, when the market starts to realize that and continues to focus on it, yields will -- the yield curve will become a little bit more positively sloped. The other side of the equation, what has really been problematic for money market funds especially in the second quarter and even to some degree in the first quarter of 2011 was huge amounts of cash sitting on the sidelines and waiting for certain situations to play themselves out before they went back into their natural marketplace. Hedge funds, sovereign debt investors were -- for a large part of the first half of 2011, squarely sitting in the repo and the treasury marketplace, creating more demand for a supply that is less and less from the investment banks and from the dealers in the marketplace. So it was simply a supply-demand thing where the demand was much greater. Once the resolution of the debt ceiling goes forward, those investors go back into those -- their natural marketplaces and get out of our cash markets, which causes that imbalance on a supply-demand basis to go back to normal. And although we may not have the elevated rates in treasury that we see today out to 3 months, 9 to 15 basis points, we should not see the 0 to negative basis points that we were seeing for much of the months of June and July."

So that is something. It doesn't qualify, I think, in the way you're talking about in terms of an immediate catalyst, but that's what we're doing for the long haul. That's the story I'm trying to get across here. The other thing is that we are determined to continue to find something on the international side, which we think will help the overall effort to growth and how you all will look at it in terms of us scoring meaningfully on international assets, which help the overall valuation and obviously, have to add to earnings.

First of all, let me address the second part of the question first. In the -- again, possible but we still think fairly unlikely event of a downgrade of some of the rating agencies for the long-term section of U.S. government debt, to some degree th",719,"Sure. First of all, let me address the second part of the question first. In the -- again, possible but we still think fairly unlikely event of a downgrade of some of the rating agencies for the long-term section of U.S. government debt, to some degree that might perversely be helpful. And again, I know that seems kind of crazy, but there are 2 reasons why I say that: Number one, I mentioned effectively that doesn't take away the status of U.S. government debt as the bellwether, the slight quality instrument, the largest volume, highest quality, most diverse, most offered, most sold instrument in the world. It's still become, it is still the most liquid instrument in the world. And whether the AA or AAA rated, it will maintain that status. As a AA rating though, it maintains that status with a slightly higher yield component. So we are able then to buy those treasury securities that's something that's slightly higher in yield. We don't have -- there's nothing on a mandated basis from a regulatory perspective nor from our prospectuses within those products that say we have to buy only treasury bills that are AAA rated. It just says we have to buy treasury securities, so that doesn't affect what we can buy and in some way, shape or form, it could actually increase the yields of those instruments. The other side of the equation is, we do have -- there are some customers in the marketplace that do need AAAs. It's part of their investment policy. It could potentially be part of their regulatory requirements. And as such, if the treasury bill no longer meets that AAA requirement, as I mentioned before, our money funds are still rated AAA. And they will maintain a AAA even without a AAA rating for the underlying holdings of treasury securities. So to some degree, the money fund will become a choice for those who potentially were using direct instruments themselves. So again, I'd certainly -- a downgrade is not something that we would welcome, look forward to, think as a high likelihood on a probability basis. But there are some positive outcomes and consequences that could be as a result of it. Back to the first part of your question, when you're talking about the differentiation between sovereigns and corporates and financials in the marketplace and are people looking more towards the corporate side of the equation, I do think there's a couple of different things on a dynamic basis that are working there. First of all, there are more corporates in the marketplace, and although we're not growing very quickly from an economic perspective, we are going forward on an economic basis. And if you just look at sort of earnings in the corporate sector, they've been vastly positive, and the credit metrics of those institutions have actually been improving. So they have more need on the customer and a growth basis underlying to actually borrow in a short-term market for their working capital purposes. So there's an increased amount of supply in that type of paper. So I think that there's more to choose from than there may be was 2 years ago when the U.S. was in a recession. The other side of the equation though is, you have to think, you have to know, it maybe is not intuitive, but you have to know that if the U.S. suffers some sort of a debt downgrade. Wal-Mart suffers in some way, shape or form too. Johnson & Johnson suffers in some way, shape or form to. Exxon Mobil suffers in some way, shape or form too. So it's not a safe haven that takes the place of what would be a downgraded U.S. Treasury security at that point. It would likely also have some flow-through effects to those corporates, and potentially cause a reduction in what they need from a short-term financing perspective. But right now, they're doing well from a credit, quality and analysis perspective. And in such an economic situation that we're currently in, they're needing a little bit more funding. So those are those dynamics are positive, but I don't think it's a replacement in any way, shape or form for what happens or what we use U.S. government debt for in our portfolios."

So if you're talking about longer-term investors going straight into the money markets, it's only at that point in time when they are very uncertain about the conditions of that longer-term sector. If in fact the downgrade occurs, if there ends up being a split rating with some at AAA and some at AA, if there is solidly in the AA rating camp, I think whatever the rating agencies finally opine based on whatever debt deal is negotiated, that uncertainty hopefully will go away. And the result and change in yield spreads and the yield curve itself will likely, I think, attract the natural bond investors back out into the bond curve. I don't think, generally speaking, a treasury bond investor would be in treasury cash just simply because of the difference between a highest-quality long-term rating versus a highest-quality short-term rating. I think it's really more reflective of just uncertainty that they would go into that cash officially[ph] ."

I will start with a brief review of Federated's recent business performance before turning the call over to Tom for a discussion of our financials. 
Looking first to cash management, total Money Market assets increased by $6 billion in the third quarter compared to the prior quarter. Average money fund assets decreased slightly in the quarter due mainly to tax seasonality in separate accounts. Money Market mutual fund average assets were nearly the same as the prior couple of quarters. Money Market total assets increased $9 billion or 4% in Q3 versus Q2, and our market share increased to over 9%. Growth in government money fund assets was partially offset by a very modest decrease in prime assets, and by lower Muni fund assets. 
Following my remarks, Tom will address the money fund fee waivers, and Debbie will comment on the current Money Market conditions and our expectations going forward. 
On the regulatory front, money funds continue to be an active topic of discussion. We are engaged in discussions with the regulators as they study various ideas and events suggested. We believe that money funds were meaningfully and sufficiently strengthened by last year's extensive revisions the 2a-7. We are seeing those changes work successfully in realtime, with money funds and European bank investments, money funds and debt ceiling discussions, money funds and loss of USA AAA rating. Investors are able to see fund positions with unprecedented clarity, and we've seen very low movement of money from our prime funds. 
The SEC now has a view into the recent holdings of all money funds. The funds have had ample liquidity in compliance with the revised regulations. Overall, the regulations and structure of money funds are working quite well in the midst of challenging marketing conditions, and they continue to offer excellent cash management services to both shareholders and issuers.
We remain favorably disposed to improvements that will enhance the resiliency of money funds by addressing their primary issue faced during the financial crisis, namely market-wide liquidity crunch. We are able to make predictions on any particular outcome or timeline in this area. 
Turning to longer-term assets, our broad income-focused product line and reputation for solid, consistent income-producing strategies fits well with investors' increased demand for these products in both equity and bond portfolios. Looking for Store Equity business, we had our best quarter for gross equity fund sales in a decade at $2.4 billion. As investors increasingly look for solid income-producing equity investments, we continue to see strong results from the strategic value dividend strategy. It became our first equity fund to produce over $1 billion in net sales during a quarter, and was among the top-selling funds in the entire industry during the quarter. The related separate accounts strategy had another very solid quarter of inflows as well, adding nearly $500 million in net flows during the quarter. We are also seeing heightened institutional interest in the form of RFPs for this strategy. 
Our sales force has been very successful expanding distribution opportunities for this product. In addition, we broadened the focus and placements of our advertising we started earlier this year to include international version of this strategy. We are pleased with the early results of this campaign.
We have started to see some lift in the flows for the international Strategic Value Fund in Q3 and here early in Q4. Both strategies have achieved strong performance and are well-positioned for continued growth. In addition, the tran14 produced higher gross sales and net sales in Q3 over Q2. The Clover Small Value Fund also increased its gross and net sales from the prior quarter. 
At the end of Q3, we had 7 equity strategies and a variety of styles that have top quartile 3-year records and are well-positioned for growth. Capital income Prudent Bear international leaders international strategic value common and large cap and strategic value dividend. 
Equity fund flows are running slightly higher for the first 3 weeks of October, though the early results may not necessarily reflect the results for the entire quarter.
Overall flows in equity separate accounts were positive. We saw growth in the strategic value strategy, partially offset by redemptions that we characterize as largely derisking asset allocation decisions made by our clients, and to a lesser extent, net redemptions in Quant's strategies. 
Equity RFP activity is up about 33% year-to-date Q3 compared to the same period in 2010. We are seeing particular interest in equity income, small-cap value and international equity strategies. Reflecting the challenging market conditions, we are seeing longer decision processes around institutional RFPs. We have about 50% more RFPs in pending status at the end of Q3 compared to a year ago, and a higher percentage of our 2011 RFPs are classified as pending compared to a year ago.
Looking now at fixed income, some flows were positive for Q3, led by our stable Value Capital Preservation product and by our return to positive Muni fund flows. Our multisector and corporate funds had positive flows, and we are beginning to see some good sales results from our new Unconstrained Bond Fund. Fixed income fund flows are running solidly positive for the first 3 weeks of October, with all domestic bond categories producing net inflows. 
Fixed income separate accounts had negative flows with about half of the total due to 3 different government entity accounts that drew down funds. We also saw derisking activity from certain clients in other accounts who allocated funds out of high-yield emerging market and corporate portfolios, which we attribute to the challenging market conditions during the quarter. RFP activity for fixed income is up approximately 30% year-to-date '11 compared to the same period in 2010. We want 2 new accounts in the third quarter, and have about $100 million in related funding expected in Q4 or perhaps even early next year.  We continue to see interest in a variety of areas, including: Active cash, short duration, high yield and other corporates and emerging market debt strategies.
Now turning to fund investment performance and looking at quarter end Lipper rankings for private equity funds, 42% of rated assets are in the first or second quartile over the last year, 35% over 3 years, 45% over 5 years and 76% over 10 years. For Bond Fund assets, the comparable first and second quartile percentages are 68% for 1 year, 38% for 3 years, 69% for 5 years, and 74% for 10 years. 
Looking at the Morningstar rated funds, 30% of rated equity fund assets are in 4 and 5 star product as of 9 30 and 68% are in 3, 4 and 5 star products. For Bond Funds, the comparable percentages are 38% 4 and 5 star and 80% 3, 4 and 5 star. 
As of October 26, managed assets were approximately $355 billion, including $272 billion in Money Markets, $30 billion in equities, $53 billion in fixed income, which includes our liquidation portfolios. Money Market mutual fund assets stand at about $247 billion. So far in October, Money Market fund assets have ranged between $244 billion and $249 billion, with average of $246 billion. 
Looking at distribution highlights, year-to-date, gross sales of equity funds increased about 20% compared to the same period in 2010, with sales growth strongest in our wealth management bank trust channel. Year-to-date, gross SMA sales more than doubled. Fixed income fund sales are up 13% year-to-date, with the best growth coming from the broker-dealer channel. As mentioned last quarter, we are in the process of adding 12 additional sales reps and additional sales support positions in the broker-dealer channel to add to the already substantial sales growth that we've achieved in this area. Our strategy is to leverage the progress we've made over the last couple of years and providing better coverage to the major wire house firms, and to increase our coverage of the regional and independent firms. Now we've added about half of these positions so far, and expect to have the rest on board by the end of Q2 in 2012.
Regarding acquisitions and offshore businesses, we remain focused on developing an alliance to further advance our business outside the U.S., and we continue to work to grow our current offshore businesses. We launched a new sterling-denominated money fund in Q3 and added the fund to a multiple of global portals that already offered our other Ireland domicile products. We expect to complete the addition of the product to 2 new portals this quarter, and to develop retail distribution through a major clearing platform in the U.K. as well.  We recently added a sales person in our Frankfurt office. In our London office, we are currently in the process of adding 2 new positions, including a senior sales rep, and are also looking for some office space in the city.
In the U.S., we are actively seeking consolidation opportunities, and in Q3 completed 2 deals with the EquiTrust Funds and the Tributary International Equity Fund adding about $600 million in new assets in a variety of strategies.

Our margins were about the same as their prior quarter and about the same as Q3 of last year. We continue to be diligent on expenses while making investments for growth in the areas of new products, distribution and acquisitions. 
Money Market funds continue to be a very important source of revenue for Federated even as extraordinary market conditions caused us to waive a significant portion of our revenues in this area. Revenues from Money Market assets were $93 million in the third quarter, about 44% of total revenue, down from a 10-year average of about 50% of our total revenue. Money Market revenue net of distribution payments accounted for about 37% of our total revenue, again net of distribution payments
down from a 10-year average of about 41%. For comparison purposes, our equity revenue net of distribution expense made up 39% of our total, about the same as its 10-year average.
Waivers impacted Money Markets as expected. Full details are in the press release. As we look ahead, we think these waivers could impact the fourth quarter by around $26 million in pretax earnings compared to the $23.2 million in the third quarter. The expected increase is due mainly to the growth in government Money Market assets, which have the lowest gross yield and highest waivers.
Looking forward and holding all other variables constant, we estimate that gaining 10 basis points in gross yields will likely reduce the impact of these waivers by about 40% from these levels. And the 25 basis point increase would reduce the impact by about 70%.
Looking at total revenue, the decrease from the prior quarter was due to higher money fund waivers and lower average equity assets, partially offset by 1 additional day in the quarter and by higher fixed income-related revenues. Comp and related expense was lower than Q2 due mainly to adjustments to incentive compensation accrual. Advertising expense was up sequentially as we began an expanded run of online and print ads to promote the domestic and international strategic value dividend products.
Amortization of intangible decreased due to the Q2 roll off of amortization expenses from certain previously acquired asset and amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased due to the full amortization of certain B-share related assets.
Looking at nonoperating expense, Q3 included $2.3 million in net losses from lower asset -- lower net asset values on consolidated products. These losses were nearly all unrealized on trading securities related to C capital investments.
Looking at our balance sheet, cash and marketable securities, totaled $322 million at quarter end and our net debt was about $70 million. Cash and investments, combined with expected additional cash flow from operations and availability under present debt facilities provides us with significant liquidity to be able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities, as well as the ability to fund related contingent payments, share repurchases, dividends, new product seeds and other investments, capital expenditures and debt repayments. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Debbie to discuss Money Market conditions."

I though I'll just give you an update on rate and then talk a little bit about the hot topic in the market, which continues to be the European banking situation, and then touch also on Operations twist which is a new issue from the Fed since",1012,"Thanks, Tom. I though I'll just give you an update on rate and then talk a little bit about the hot topic in the market, which continues to be the European banking situation, and then touch also on Operations twist which is a new issue from the Fed since the last call. From a short-term rate perspective, we actually saw some reprieve in the marketplace, certainly not from a Fed Funds perspective, but rather from overall short-term rates modestly being higher in the third quarter. Repo, which is a very important vehicle for use within our government, as well prime Money Market funds, is situated in the mid- to high single digits. That's up from the low to mid-single digits in the second quarter. So there has been a little bit of reprieve in that marketplace, certainly not a 24 basis point high from the target range, but again, mid- to high single-digits in the third quarter. And that's continuing in the last quarter of the year. 
Overall LIBOR rate, 1 month was up 6 basis points to 25 basis points, 3 months up 18 basis points to 43, 6 month up 10 basis points to 62 and 12 months LIBOR up 17 basis points to 93 basis points. So we actually have a yield curve but almost gives us 1 handle on 1 end of it. As such, we've been employing our barbell strategy with all of our products might longer dated fixed rate security in addition to shorter dated floating rate securities to help take advantage of some of that improving condition in the yield curve. 
From a European debt perspective, Federated continues to use European banks, 8 different countries, several banks within each of those countries in a fashion that on a percentage allocation basis is not drastically different from our usage of those banks in the past. All year long, that average has been between 40% and 45% in our prime fund for exposure to the European bank. That continues to be the case with the average today right around 43%. And don't expect that to change much going forward. Our strategy however has shortened over the course of the last several years and continuing in for the last several months. The maturity restrictions on many of those institutions, many of those European banks. As such, we are making decisions on whether to roll over those bad debt everyday, and effectively have shortened maturities from somewhere in the 3 to 6 month range, down to somewhere that's more near about 1 month, 2 weeks for some institutions out to 3 months for others. So on average, our decision-making process and our ability to change those decisions should our monitoring and surveillance of those issuers warrant that change, is very quick and very short from a time perspective at this time. We continue to believe that the overall credit quality of those institutions is as high as it gets from a minimal credit risk perspective and our assessment of those institutions. Certainly yesterday's Greek accord from the EU's perspective and their capabilities are now writing down 50% of that Greek debt exposure is a positive in the marketplace. The overall assessment in the market has been received as such. But the devil is in the details and we'll continue to monitor and surveil as we go forward.  This is something that we believe again kicks the can down the road in the contact of this being on an overnight fix to this process.  18 months ago when the first round of Greek debt negotiations were undertaken, there was about a 20% write-down that was mandated. We're now up to 50% and most likely we'll go something further as the market conditions warrant, depending upon what happens from an economic perspective in the marketplace. But again reiterating the institutions in the banking companies that we are using in Europe are all very well-situated to deal with these write-downs and continue to represent minimal credit quality constraints and risks within our prime portfolios.
The last thing I'll mention is Operations twist, which was the new form of easing, if you will, that was announced at the last FOMC meeting by the Federal Reserve. The first thing I'll say about Operator Twist is that it does not result in any new net supply in the marketplace. One of the constant themes that you you've been hearing from me as well as others in the Money Market over the course of the last several years is that this is a supply-constrained market. Operation Twist doesn't help this supply. There are no new Treasury being issued from this operation. What is happening is they're taking the shorter portion of the debt that's currently held in Treasury securities on the New York Fed balance sheet and selling that back out into the marketplace and then taking the proceeds from the sales and redeploying those by purchasing longer dated Treasury securities back onto the balance sheet. So net effect is 0 to the Fed, with an average maturity that's actually lengthening in the process. 
What is helpful from a Money Market perspective is that we now have additional supply on a direct purchase basis. So there are more eligible securities that are in the market and will continue to be put into the marketplace that are directly able for Treasury and government agency Money Market funds to purchase. Setting that to some degree is the fact that some of the longer dated collateral that have been used in the marketplace for Repurchase agreement collateralization is now being put back onto the Fed's balance sheet. Although it's not the end positive result that maybe had been contemplated at the very beginning thoughts of Operations Twist, we do view it as a modest potential positive for Money Market rates and certainly for the government Money Market funds. And most important, when you view the other alternatives that they were contemplating during that time period, Operation Twist is the best outcome that we could've hoped for at that point."

So we felt we've done a very, very good job at the big wire houses, and we're able to carve up territories to allow others to get into smaller broker-dealers, which should expand on exactly that kind of basis those numbers. The next level is that even where we are doing business, we're able to expand from 1 or 2 type tickets or type mandates with an individual to get that up to 3 or 4.

So yes, it does help but we think we are able to do some leveraging there. And we think that the product in and of itself continues on quite smartly. One of the interesting things about this particular fund and relative performance is as follows: Because this fund has been successfully sold as of 5 and 5 product, meaning 5% dividend more or less, 5% growth of dividends more or less, when the performance relative to other funds in the category has even been in the bottom aisle, the funds sales continue apace. And so naturally, we're happy when it has a good relative record, but because of what it is, it continues to sell even though it may have historically, even though historically, it has gone in and out of the top group. So whatever the Lipper rankings is on that product, really won't matter too much because we continue to stick to the knitting."

Generally speaking, our systems allow the investment management folks to have realtime access to all data so if I wanted to know into a day what my positions to French banks are, it's a very simple process for me and the investment group to get that. Our oversight from a flow perspective on that information to the risk management compliance and legal groups happen on a batch basis at night. And that has proven to be pretty effective in the context of keeping everybody up to date on current market conditions and potential as you might note, I would say that, that Money Market funds at this point are really and certainly Federated prime and Muni funds where we would maintain direct exposure to French banks and even on a counterparty basis within our government funds are not making a bet that's different from the marketplace at this point. We're just doing our job in a way that calculates what we consider to be the best relative value institutions out there, and doing it with day-to-day continuous monitoring. The other side of the flow situation is the fund flow. So the asset flow, shareholder flows that are going into and out of those products that use those French banks or European institutions on a day-to-day basis, and that helps us to validate basically that we're doing the appropriate decision-making process within our own assessment of the risks involved in those institutions, the information flow that goes to those oversight groups within Federated. And then again, validated by the client flow. If you look, Chris had mentioned on his regulatory side discussions about various options that continue to be reviewed for money funds reform and our conclusion in many ways that the 287 reforms that occurred in 2010 are 99.99% of the way to final reform for this industry. And what we saw in the July and August time here is in the marketplace where you had huge amount of volatility in the Prime and Muni funds that was for the most part, industry-related to the second round of Greek debt negotiations just beginning. And then you had piled on top of that volatility within the government sector. If you recall at our last discussion, in our last earnings call, we were questioning whether or not the U.S. was going to default. We were questioning that. But the market was questioning whether or not the U.S. is going to default on their debt, and certainly the resulting long-term downgrade by S&P is one that has been challenging for even our government Money Market funds, which from an industry perspective have always been the safe haven. So despite these sorts of conditions in the July and August time period, Federated funds came through with flying colors. And our overall flow validation of our process and our model held up very well against the industry and the industry in total held up very well in the context of the new regulations and what's proven to be a pretty sound source of liquidity, credit and diversification changes that came about from those 2010 regulation changes."

And we've agreed to from a familiar client basis at a time. The other side of it though, when you look at the market conditions and Prime fund redemptions that did take place during that July and August time period, I think the industry on average was down about 10% in Prime fund assets and specifically, there were funds that were down over 50%. These are not Federated funds, but I'm sure you follow the market on a specific basis. You know who they are. This in the 2008 time period would have caused extreme market ill liquidity. And going back again to what Chris mentioned, that's what we perceived to have been the main problem outside of those institutions that owned Lehman Brothers on a credit default basis back in September of 2008.

I will start with a brief review of Federated's recent business performance before turning the call over to Tom for a discussion of our financials. 
Looking first to cash management, total Money Market assets increased by $6 billion in the third quarter compared to the prior quarter. Average money fund assets decreased slightly in the quarter due mainly to tax seasonality in separate accounts. Money Market mutual fund average assets were nearly the same as the prior couple of quarters. Money Market total assets increased $9 billion or 4% in Q3 versus Q2, and our market share increased to over 9%. Growth in government money fund assets was partially offset by a very modest decrease in prime assets, and by lower Muni fund assets. 
Following my remarks, Tom will address the money fund fee waivers, and Debbie will comment on the current Money Market conditions and our expectations going forward. 
On the regulatory front, money funds continue to be an active topic of discussion. We are engaged in discussions with the regulators as they study various ideas and events suggested. We believe that money funds were meaningfully and sufficiently strengthened by last year's extensive revisions to 2a-7. We are seeing those changes work successfully in realtime, with money funds and European bank investments, money funds and debt ceiling discussions, money funds and loss of U.S.A. AAA rating. Investors are able to see fund positions with unprecedented clarity, and we've seen very low movement of money from our Prime funds. 
The SEC now has a view into the recent holdings of all money funds. The funds have had ample liquidity in compliance with the revised regulations. Overall, the regulations and structure of money funds are working quite well in the midst of challenging marketing conditions, and they continue to offer excellent cash management services to both shareholders and issuers.
We remain favorably disposed to improvements that would enhance the resiliency of money funds by addressing the primary issue faced during the financial crisis, namely market-wide liquidity crunch. We are unable to make predictions on any particular outcome or timeline in this area. 
Turning to longer-term assets, our broad income-focused product line and reputation for solid, consistent income-producing strategies fits well with investors' increased demand for these products in both equity and bond portfolios. Looking first to our Equity business, we had our best quarter for gross equity fund sales in a decade at $2.4 billion. As investors increasingly look for solid income-producing equity investments, we continue to see strong results from the strategic value dividend strategy. It became our first equity fund to produce over $1 billion in net sales during a quarter, and was among the top-selling funds in the entire industry during the quarter. The related separate accounts strategy had another very solid quarter of inflows as well, adding nearly $500 million in net flows during the quarter. We are also seeing heightened institutional interest in the form of RFPs for this strategy. 
Our sales force has been very successful expanding distribution opportunities for this product. In addition, we broadened the focus and placements of our advertising we started earlier this year to include international version of this strategy. We are pleased with the early results of this campaign.
We have started to see some lift in the flows for the International Strategic Value Fund in Q3 and here early in Q4. Both strategies have achieved strong performance and are well-positioned for continued growth. In addition, the Prudent Bear Fund produced higher gross sales and net sales in Q3 over Q2. The Clover Small Value Fund also increased its gross and net sales from the prior quarter. 
At the end of Q3, we had 7 equity strategies in a variety of styles that have top quartile 3-year records and are well-positioned for growth. Capital Income, Prudent Bear, Equity Income, International Leaders, International Strategic Value, Kaufmann Large Cap and Strategic Value Dividend. 
Equity fund flows are running slightly higher for the first 3 weeks of October, so the early results may not necessarily reflect the results for the entire quarter.
Overall flows in equity separate accounts were positive. We saw growth in the Strategic Value strategy, partially offset by redemptions that we characterize as largely de-risking asset allocation decisions made by our clients, and to a lesser extent, net redemptions in Quant's strategies. 
Equity RFP activity is up about 33% year-to-date, Q3 compared to the same period in 2010. We are seeing particular interest in equity income, small-cap value and international equity strategies. Reflecting the challenging market conditions, we are seeing longer decision processes around institutional RFPs. We have about 50% more RFPs in pending status at the end of Q3 compared to a year ago, and a higher percentage of our 2011 RFPs are classified as pending compared to a year ago.
Looking now at fixed income, some flows were positive for Q3, led by our stable Value Capital Preservation Fund product and by a return to positive Muni fund flows. Our multisector and corporate funds had positive flows, and we are beginning to see some good sales results from our new Unconstrained Bond Fund. Fixed income fund flows are running solidly positive for the first 3 weeks of October, with all domestic bond categories producing net inflows. 
Fixed income separate accounts had negative flows with about half of the total due to 3 different government entity accounts that drew down funds. We also saw a derisking activity from certain clients in other accounts who allocated funds out of high-yield emerging market and corporate portfolios, which we attribute to the challenging market conditions during the quarter. RFP activity for fixed income is up approximately 30% year-to-date of '11 compared to the same period in 2010. We won 2 new accounts in the third quarter, and have about $100 million in related funding expected in Q4 or perhaps even early next year. We continue to see interest in a variety of areas, including: active cash, short duration, high yield and other corporates and emerging market debt strategies.
Now turning to fund investment performance and we're looking at quarter-end Lipper rankings for Federated's equity funds, 42% of rated assets are in the first or second quartile over the last year, 35% over 3 years, 45% over 5 years and 76% over 10 years. For Bond Fund assets, the comparable first and second quartile percentages are 68% for 1 year, 38% for 3 years, 69% for 5 years, and 74% for 10 years. 
Looking at the Morningstar rated funds, 30% of rated equity fund assets are in 4 and 5-star product as of 9/30 and 68% are in 3, 4 and 5-star products. For Bond Funds, the comparable percentages are 38%, 4 and 5-star; and 80%, 3, 4 and 5-star. 
As of October 26, managed assets were approximately $355 billion, including $272 billion in Money Markets, $30 billion in equities, $53 billion in fixed income, which includes our liquidation portfolios. Money Market mutual fund assets stand at about $247 billion. So far in October, Money Market fund assets have ranged between $244 billion and $249 billion, with average of $246 billion. 
Looking at distribution highlights, year-to-date, gross sales of equity funds increased about 20% compared with the same period in 2010, with sales growth strongest in our wealth management bank trust channel. Year-to-date, gross SMA sales have more than doubled. Fixed income fund sales are up 13% year-to-date, with the best growth coming from the broker/dealer channel. As mentioned last quarter, we are in the process of adding 12 additional sales reps and additional sales support positions in the broker/dealer channel to add to the already substantial sales growth that we've achieved in this area. Our strategy is to leverage the progress we've made over the last couple of years in providing better coverage to the major wirehouse firms, and to increase our coverage of the regional and independent firms. Now we've added about half of these positions so far, and expect to have the rest on board by the end of Q2 in 2012.
Regarding acquisitions and offshore businesses, we remain focused on developing an alliance to further advance our business outside the U.S., and we continue to work to grow our current offshore businesses. We launched a new sterling-denominated money fund in Q3 and added the fund to a multiple of global portals that already offered our other Ireland domicile products. We expect to complete the addition of the product to 2 new portals this quarter, and to develop retail distribution through a major clearing platform in the U.K. as well. We recently added a sales person in our Frankfurt office. In our London office, we are currently in the process of adding 2 new positions, including a senior sales rep, and are also looking for some office space in the city.
In the U.S., we are actively seeking consolidation opportunities, and in Q3 completed 2 deals with the EquiTrust Funds and the Tributary International Equity Fund adding about $600 million in new assets in a variety of strategies.

Our margins were about the same as the prior quarter and about the same as Q3 of last year. We continue to be diligent on expenses while making investments for growth in the areas of new products, distribution and acquisitions. 
Money Market funds continue to be a very important source of revenue for Federated even as the extraordinary market conditions caused us to waive a significant portion of our revenues in this area. Revenues from Money Market assets were $93 million in the third quarter, about 44% of total revenue, down from a 10-year average of about 50% of our total revenues. Money Market revenue net of distribution payments accounted for about 37% of our total revenue, again net of distribution payments
down from a 10-year average of about 41%. For comparison purposes, our equity revenue net of distribution expense made up 39% of our total, about the same as its 10-year average.
Waivers impacted Money Markets as expected. Full details are in the press release. As we look ahead, we think these waivers could impact the fourth quarter by around $26 million in pretax earnings compared to the $23.2 million in the third quarter. The expected increase is due mainly to the growth in government Money Market assets, which have the lowest gross yield and highest waivers.
Looking forward and holding all other variables constant, we estimate that gaining 10 basis points in gross yields will likely reduce the impact of these waivers by about 40% from these levels, and the 25 basis point in increase would reduce the impact by about 70%.
Looking at total revenue, the decrease from the prior quarter was due to higher money fund waivers and lower average equity assets, partially offset by 1 additional day in the quarter and by higher fixed income-related revenues. Comp and related expense was lower than Q2 due mainly to adjustments to incentive compensation accrual. Advertising expense was up sequentially as we began an extended run of online and print ads to promote the domestic and international strategic value dividend products.
Amortization and intangible decreased due to the Q2 roll-off of amortization expenses from certain previously acquired assets and amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased due to the full amortization of certain B Share related assets.
Looking at nonoperating expense, Q3 included $2.3 million in net losses from lower asset -- lower net asset values on consolidated products. These losses were nearly all unrealized on trading securities related to seek capital investments.
Looking at our balance sheet, cash and marketable securities, totaled $322 million at quarter-end and our net debt was about $70 million. Cash and investments, combined with expected additional cash flow from operations and availability under present debt facilities provides us with significant liquidity to be able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities, as well as the ability to fund related contingent payments, share repurchases, dividends, new product seeds and other investments, capital expenditures and debt repayments. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Debbie to discuss Money Market conditions."

I thought I'd just give you an update on rates and then talk a little bit about the hot topic in the market which continues to be the European banking situation, and then touch also on Operation Twist which is a new issue from the Fed since t",1020,"Thanks, Tom. I thought I'd just give you an update on rates and then talk a little bit about the hot topic in the market which continues to be the European banking situation, and then touch also on Operation Twist which is a new issue from the Fed since the last call. From a short-term rate perspective, we actually saw some reprieve in the marketplace, certainly not from a Fed Funds perspective, but rather from overall short-term rates modestly being higher in the third quarter. Repo, which is a very important vehicle for use within our government, as well as prime mini-market funds, is situated in the mid to high single digits. That's up from the low to mid-single digits in the second quarter. So there has been a little bit of reprieve in that marketplace, certainly not as a 25 basis point high for the target range, but again, mid to high single digits in the third quarter. And that's continuing in the last quarter of the year. 
Overall LIBOR rate, 1 month was up 6 basis points to 25 basis points, 3 months up 18 basis points to 43, 6 month up 10 basis points to 62 and 12 months LIBOR up 17 basis points to 93 basis points. So we actually have a yield curve that almost gives us a one handle on the long end of it. As such, we've been employing our barbelled strategy within all of our products buying longer-dated fixed rate security in addition to shorter-dated floating rate security to help take advantage of some of that improving condition in the yield curve. 
From a European debt perspective, Federated continues to use European banks, 8 different countries, several banks within each of those countries in a fashion that on a percentage allocation basis is not drastically different from our usage of those banks in the past. All year long, that average has been between 40% and 45% in our Prime fund for exposure to the European bank. That continues to be the case with the average today right around 43%. And don't expect that to change much going forward. Our strategy, however, has shortened over the course of the last several years and continuing in for the last several months. The maturity restrictions on many of those institutions, many of those European banks. As such, we are making decisions on whether to roll over those bad debt everyday, and effectively have shortened maturities from somewhere in the 3 to 6 months range, down to somewhere that's more near about 1 month, 2 weeks for some institutions out to 3 months for others. So on average, our decision-making process and our ability to change those decisions, should our monitoring and surveillance of those issuers warrant that change, is very quick and very short from a time perspective at this time. We continue to believe that the overall credit quality of those institutions is as high as it gets from a minimal credit risk perspective and our assessment of those institutions. Certainly yesterday's Greek accord from the EU's perspective and their capabilities are now writing down 50% of that Greek debt exposure is a positive in the marketplace. The overall assessment in the market has been received as such. But the devil is in the details and we'll continue to monitor and surveil as we go forward. This is something that we believe, again, kicks the can down the road in the context of this being not an overnight fix to this process. 18 months ago, when the first round of Greek debt negotiations were undertaken, there was about a 20% write-down that was mandated. We're now up to 50% and most likely we'll go something further as the market conditions warrant, depending upon what happens from an economic perspective in the marketplace. But again reiterating, the institutions in the banking companies that we are using in Europe are all very well-situated to deal with these write-downs and continue to represent minimal credit quality constraints and risks within our Prime portfolios.
The last thing I'll mention is Operation Twist, which was the new form of easing, if you will, that was announced at the last FOMC meeting by the Federal Reserve. The first thing I'll say about Operation Twist is that it does not result in any new net supply in the marketplace. One of the constant themes that you've been hearing from me as well as others in the Money Market over the course of the last several years is that this is a supply-constrained market. Operation Twist doesn't help this supply. There are no new treasuries being issued from this operation. What is happening is they're taking the shorter portion of the debt that's currently held in Treasury securities on the New York Fed balance sheet and selling that back out into the marketplace and then taking the proceeds from the sales and redeploying those by purchasing longer dated Treasury securities back on to the balance sheet. So net effect is 0 to the Fed, with an average maturity that's actually lengthening in the process. 
What is helpful from a Money Market perspective is that we now have additional supply on a direct purchase basis. So there are more eligible securities that will be -- that are in the market and will continue to be put into the marketplace that are directly able for Treasury and government agency Money Market funds to purchase. Offsetting that to some degree is the fact that some of the longer-dated collateral that have been used in the marketplace for repurchase agreement collateralization is now being put back on to the Fed's balance sheet. So although it's not the end positive result that maybe had been contemplated at the very beginning, thoughts of Operation Twist, we do view it as a modest potential positive for Money Market rates and certainly for the government Money Market funds. And most important, when you view the other alternatives that they were contemplating during that time period, Operation Twist is the best outcome that we could have hoped for at that point."

So yes, it does help but we think we are able to do some leveraging there. And we think that the product in on of itself continues on quite smartly. One of the interesting things about this particular fund and relative performance is as follows: because this fund has been successfully sold as a 5 and 5 product, meaning 5% dividend more or less, 5% growth of dividends more or less, when the performance relative to other funds in the category has even been in the bottom decile, the funds sales continue apace. And so naturally, we're happy when it has a good relative record, but because of what it is, it continues to sell even though it may have historically -- even though historically, it has gone in and out of the top group.

Generally speaking, our systems allow the investment management folks to have realtime access to all data so if I want to know intra-day what my positions to French banks are, it's a very simple process for me and the investment group to get that. Our oversight from a flow perspective on that information to the risk management compliance and legal groups happens on a batch basis at night. And that has proven to be pretty effective in the context of keeping everybody up to date on current market conditions and potential bets as you might note, I would say that, that Money Market funds at this point really are -- and certainly Federated's Prime and Muni funds where we would maintain direct exposure to French banks and even on a counter-party basis within our government funds are not making a bet that's different from the marketplace at this point. We're just doing our job in a way that calculates what we consider to be the best relative value of institutions out there, and doing it with day-to-day continuous monitoring. The other side of this flow situation is the fund flow. So the asset flow, shareholder flows that are going into and out of the -- those products that use those French banks or European institutions on a day-to-day basis, and that helps us to validate basically that we're doing the appropriate decision-making process within our own assessment of the risks involved in those institutions, the information flow that goes to those oversight groups within Federated. And then again, validated by the client flow. If you look, Chris had mentioned on his regulatory side, discussions about various options that continue to be reviewed for money fund reform and our conclusion in many ways that the 2a-7 reforms that occurred in 2010 are 99.99% of the way to final reform for this industry. And what we saw in the July and August time period in the marketplace where you had huge amounts of volatility in the Prime and Muni funds that was for the most part, industry-related to the second round of Greek debt negotiations just beginning. And then you had piled on top of that volatility within the government sector. If you recall at our last discussion, our last earnings call, we were questioning whether or not the U.S. was going to default. We were questioning that. But the market was questioning whether or not the U.S. was going to default on their debt, and certainly the resulting long-term downgrade by S&P is one that has been challenging for even our government Money Market funds, which from an industry perspective, have always been the safe haven. So despite these sorts of conditions in the July and August time period, Federated funds came through with flying colors. And our overall flow validation of our process and our model held up very well against the industry and the industry in total held up very well in the context of the new regulations and what's proven to be a pretty sound source of liquidity, credit and diversification changes that came about from those 2010 regulation changes."

And actually just to press to 2a-7, it seems like there were meaningful redemptions at the Prime funds and have been in these periods of credit quality concerns and times of stress most recently. So 3Q Prime funds at about $97 billion of redemptions around Greek debt to and French bank concerns, et cetera. And I think you saw this out of your Prime cash obligation funds which had the biggest exposure to French banks. That saw disproportional redemptions for you guys. So it seems like little concerns, little runs in Prime funds. If there was a big credit problem, there could be a big run. And I thought that was what the regulators were trying to prevent. And if we're still seeing these mini-runs here -- run is probably a terrible word, but like outsized redemptions, is it really -- as the new rules really working well or do they -- seems like -- well, I guess your opinion is they're working well, but I don't know if this data kind of confirms that? Any response to that?"

At any given point in time, we may have a larger shareholder in that fund or any of our other products that may cause it to look like it's doing something different. In fact, our strategy across all the Prime funds is identical. So -- and generally speaking, the only difference is that you might note on a quarter end or reporting date are the results of client flows that just happened to be a little different. And that we've agreed to from a know-your-client basis ahead of time. The other side of it though, when you look at sort of the market conditions and Prime fund redemptions that did take place during that July and August time period, I think the industry on average was down about 10% in Prime fund assets and specifically, there were funds that were down over 50%. These are not Federated funds, but I'm sure you follow the market on a specific basis. You know who they are. This in the 2008 time period would have caused extreme market illiquidity. And going back again to what Chris mentioned, that's what we perceived to have been the main problem outside of those institutions that owned Lehman Brothers on a credit default basis back in September of 2008. But the extreme illiquidity that was the result of that back in 2008 certainly did not play out at all in the context of the summer of 2011 timeframe."

I will start with a brief review of Federated's recent business performance before turning the call over to Tom for a discussion of our financials. 
Looking first to cash management, total Money Market assets increased by $6 billion in the third quarter compared to the prior quarter. Average money fund assets decreased slightly in the quarter due mainly to tax seasonality in separate accounts. Money Market mutual fund average assets were nearly the same as the prior couple of quarters. Money Market total assets increased $9 billion or 4% in Q3 versus Q2, and our market share increased to over 9%. Growth in government money fund assets was partially offset by a very modest decrease in prime assets, and by lower Muni fund assets. 
Following my remarks, Tom will address the money fund fee waivers, and Debbie will comment on the current Money Market conditions and our expectations going forward. 
On the regulatory front, money funds continue to be an active topic of discussion. We are engaged in discussions with the regulators as they study various ideas that have been suggested. We believe that money funds were meaningfully and sufficiently strengthened by last year's extensive revisions to 2a-7. We are seeing those changes work successfully in real time, with money funds and European bank investments, money funds and debt ceiling discussions, money funds and loss of USA AAA rating. Investors are able to see fund positions with unprecedented clarity, and we've seen very low movement of money from our Prime funds. 
The SEC now has a view into the recent holdings of all money funds. The funds have had ample liquidity in compliance with the revised regulations. Overall, the regulations and structure of money funds are working quite well in the midst of challenging marketing conditions, and they continue to offer excellent cash management services to both shareholders and issuers.
We remain favorably disposed to improvements that would enhance the resiliency of money funds by addressing the primary issue faced during the financial crisis, namely market-wide liquidity crunch. We are unable to make predictions on any particular outcome or timeline in this area. 
Turning to longer-term assets, our broad income-focused product line and reputation for solid, consistent income-producing strategies fits well with investors' increased demand for these products in both equity and bond portfolios. Looking first to our Equity business, we had our best quarter for gross equity fund sales in a decade at $2.4 billion. As investors increasingly look for solid income-producing equity investments, we continue to see strong results from the strategic value dividend strategy. It became our first equity fund to produce over $1 billion in net sales during a quarter, and was among the top-selling funds in the entire industry during the quarter. The related separate accounts strategy had another very solid quarter of inflows as well, adding nearly $500 million in net flows during the quarter. We are also seeing heightened institutional interest in the form of RFPs for this strategy. 
Our sales force has been very successful expanding distribution opportunities for this product. In addition, we broadened the focus and placements of our advertising we started earlier this year to include international version of this strategy. We are pleased with the early results of this campaign.
We have started to see some lift in the flows for the International Strategic Value Fund in Q3 and here early in Q4. Both strategies have achieved strong performance and are well-positioned for continued growth. In addition, the Prudent Bear Fund produced higher gross sales and net sales in Q3 over Q2. The Clover Small Value Fund also increased its gross and net sales from the prior quarter. 
At the end of Q3, we had 7 equity strategies in a variety of styles that have top quartile 3-year records and are well-positioned for growth. Capital Income, Prudent Bear, Equity Income, International Leaders, International Strategic Value, Kaufmann Large Cap and Strategic Value Dividend. 
Equity fund flows are running slightly higher for the first 3 weeks of October, so the early results may not necessarily reflect the results for the entire quarter.
Overall flows in equity separate accounts were positive. We saw growth in the Strategic Value strategy, partially offset by redemptions that we characterize as largely de-risking asset allocation decisions made by our clients, and to a lesser extent, net redemptions in Quant's strategies. 
Equity RFP activity is up about 33% year-to-date, Q3 compared to the same period in 2010. We are seeing particular interest in equity income, small-cap value and international equity strategies. Reflecting the challenging market conditions, we are seeing longer decision processes around institutional RFPs. We have about 50% more RFPs in pending status at the end of Q3 compared to a year ago, and a higher percentage of our 2011 RFPs are classified as pending compared to a year ago.
Looking now at fixed income, some flows were positive for Q3, led by our stable Value Capital Preservation Fund product and by a return to positive Muni fund flows. Our multisector and corporate funds had positive flows, and we are beginning to see some good sales results from our new Unconstrained Bond Fund. Fixed income fund flows are running solidly positive for the first 3 weeks of October, with all domestic bond categories producing net inflows. 
Fixed income separate accounts had negative flows with about half of the total due to 3 different government entity accounts that drew down funds. We also saw a derisking activity from certain clients in other accounts who allocated funds out of high-yield emerging market and corporate portfolios, which we attribute to the challenging market conditions during the quarter. RFP activity for fixed income is up approximately 30% year-to-date of '11 compared to the same period in 2010. We won 2 new accounts in the third quarter, and have about $100 million in related funding expected in Q4 or perhaps even early next year. We continue to see interest in a variety of areas, including: active cash, short duration, high yield and other corporates and emerging market debt strategies.
Now turning to fund investment performance and looking at quarter-end Lipper rankings for Federated's equity funds, 42% of rated assets are in the first or second quartile over the last year, 35% over 3 years, 45% over 5 years and 76% over 10 years. For Bond Fund assets, the comparable first and second quartile percentages are 68% for 1 year, 38% for 3 years, 69% for 5 years, and 74% for 10 years. 
Looking at the Morningstar rated funds, 30% of rated equity fund assets are in 4- and 5-star product as of 9/30 and 68% are in 3-, 4- and 5-star products. For Bond Funds, the comparable percentages are 38%, 4- and 5-star; and 80%, 3-, 4- and 5-star. 
As of October 26, managed assets were approximately $355 billion, including $272 billion in Money Markets, $30 billion in equities, $53 billion in fixed income, which includes our liquidation portfolios. Money Market mutual fund assets stand at about $247 billion. So far in October, Money Market fund assets have ranged between $244 billion and $249 billion, with average of $246 billion. 
Looking at distribution highlights, year-to-date, gross sales of equity funds increased about 20% compared with the same period in 2010, with sales growth strongest in our wealth management bank trust channel. Year-to-date, gross SMA sales have more than doubled. Fixed income fund sales are up 13% year-to-date, with the best growth coming from the broker/dealer channel. As mentioned last quarter, we are in the process of adding 12 additional sales reps and additional sales support positions in the broker/dealer channel to add to the already substantial sales growth that we've achieved in this area. Our strategy is to leverage the progress we've made over the last couple of years in providing better coverage to the major wirehouse firms, and to increase our coverage of the regional and independent firms. Now we've added about half of these positions so far, and expect to have the rest on board by the end of Q2 in 2012.
Regarding acquisitions and offshore businesses, we remain focused on developing an alliance to further advance our business outside the U.S., and we continue to work to grow our current offshore businesses. We launched a new sterling-denominated money fund in Q3 and added the fund to a multiple of global portals that already offered our other Ireland domicile products. We expect to complete the addition of the product to 2 new portals this quarter, and to develop retail distribution through a major clearing platform in the U.K. as well. We recently added a sales person in our Frankfurt office. In our London office, we are currently in the process of adding 2 new positions, including a senior sales rep, and are also looking for some office space in the city.
In the U.S., we are actively seeking consolidation opportunities, and in Q3 completed 2 deals with the EquiTrust Funds and the Tributary International Equity Fund, adding about $600 million in new assets in a variety of strategies.

Our margins were about the same as the prior quarter and about the same as Q3 of last year. We continue to be diligent on expenses while making investments for growth in the areas of new products, distribution and acquisitions. 
Money Market funds continue to be a very important source of revenue for Federated even as the extraordinary market conditions caused us to waive a significant portion of our revenues in this area. Revenues from Money Market assets were $93 million in the third quarter, about 44% of total revenue, down from a 10-year average of about 50% of our total revenues. Money Market revenue net of distribution payments accounted for about 37% of our total revenue, again net of distribution payments, down from a 10-year average of about 41%. For comparison purposes, our equity revenue net of distribution expense made up 39% of our total, about the same as its 10-year average.
Waivers impacted Money Markets as expected. Full details are in the press release. As we look ahead, we think these waivers could impact the fourth quarter by around $26 million in pretax earnings compared to the $23.2 million in the third quarter. The expected increase is due mainly to the growth in government Money Market assets, which have the lowest gross yield and highest waivers.
Looking forward and holding all other variables constant, we estimate that gaining 10 basis points in gross yields will likely reduce the impact of these waivers by about 40% from these levels, and the 25 basis point in increase would reduce the impact by about 70%.
Looking at total revenue, the decrease from the prior quarter was due to higher money fund waivers and lower average equity assets, partially offset by 1 additional day in the quarter and by higher fixed income-related revenues. Comp and related expense was lower than Q2 due mainly to adjustments to incentive compensation accrual. Advertising expense was up sequentially as we began an extended run of online and print ads to promote the domestic and international strategic value dividend products.
Amortization and intangible decreased due to the Q2 roll-off of amortization expenses from certain previously acquired assets and amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased due to the full amortization of certain B Share related assets.
Looking at nonoperating expense, Q3 included $2.3 million in net losses from lower asset -- lower net asset values on consolidated products. These losses were nearly all unrealized on trading securities related to seed capital investments.
Looking at our balance sheet, cash and marketable securities, totaled $322 million at quarter-end and our net debt was about $70 million. Cash and investments, combined with expected additional cash flow from operations and availability under present debt facilities provides us with significant liquidity to be able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities, as well as the ability to fund related contingent payments, share repurchases, dividends, new product seeds and other investments, capital expenditures and debt repayments. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Debbie to discuss Money Market conditions."

I thought I'd just give you an update on rates and then talk a little bit about the hot topic in the market which continues to be the European banking situation, and then touch also on Operation Twist, which is a new issue from the Fed since",1022,"Thanks, Tom. I thought I'd just give you an update on rates and then talk a little bit about the hot topic in the market which continues to be the European banking situation, and then touch also on Operation Twist, which is a new issue from the Fed since the last call. From a short-term rate perspective, we actually saw some reprieve in the marketplace, certainly not from a Fed Funds perspective, but rather from overall short-term rates modestly being higher in the third quarter. Repo, which is a very important vehicle for use within our government, as well as prime mini-market funds, is situated in the mid to high single digits. That's up from the low to mid-single digits in the second quarter. So there has been a little bit of reprieve in that marketplace, certainly not as a 25 basis point high for the target range, but again, mid to high single digits in the third quarter. And that's continuing in the last quarter of the year. 
Overall LIBOR rate, 1 month was up 6 basis points to 25 basis points, 3 months up 18 basis points to 43, 6 month up 10 basis points to 62 and 12 months LIBOR up 17 basis points to 93 basis points. So we actually have a yield curve that almost gives us a one handle on the long end of it. As such, we've been employing our barbelled strategy within all of our products buying longer-dated fixed rate security in addition to shorter-dated floating rate security to help take advantage of some of that improving condition in the yield curve. 
From a European debt perspective, Federated continues to use European banks, 8 different countries, several banks within each of those countries in a fashion that on a percentage allocation basis is not drastically different from our usage of those banks in the past. All year long, that average has been between 40% and 45% in our Prime fund for exposure to the European bank. That continues to be the case with the average today right around 43%. And don't expect that to change much going forward. Our strategy, however, has shortened over the course of the last several years and continuing in for the last several months. The maturity restrictions on many of those institutions, many of those European banks. As such, we are making decisions on whether to roll over those debt, that debt, every day, and effectively have shortened maturities from somewhere in the 3 to 6 months range, down to somewhere that's more near about 1 month, 2 weeks for some institutions out to 3 months for others. So on average, our decision-making process and our ability to change those decisions, should our monitoring and surveillance of those issuers warrant that change, is very quick and very short from a time perspective at this time. We continue to believe that the overall credit quality of those institutions is as high as it gets from a minimal credit risk perspective and our assessment of those institutions. Certainly yesterday's Greek accord from the EU's perspective and their capabilities are now writing down 50% of that Greek debt exposure is a positive in the marketplace. The overall assessment in the market has been received as such. But the devil is in the details and we'll continue to monitor and surveil as we go forward. This is something that we believe, again, kicks the can down the road in the context of this being not an overnight fix to this process. 18 months ago, when the first round of Greek debt negotiations were undertaken, there was about a 20% write-down that was mandated. We're now up to 50% and most likely we'll go something further as the market conditions warrant, depending upon what happens from an economic perspective in the marketplace. But again reiterating, the institutions in the banking companies that we are using in Europe are all very well-situated to deal with these write-downs and continue to represent minimal credit quality constraints and risks within our Prime portfolios.
The last thing I'll mention is Operation Twist, which was the new form of easing, if you will, that was announced at the last FOMC meeting by the Federal Reserve. The first thing I'll say about Operation Twist is that it does not result in any new net supply in the marketplace. One of the constant themes that you've been hearing from me as well as others in the Money Market over the course of the last several years is that this is a supply-constrained market. Operation Twist doesn't help this supply. There are no new treasuries being issued from this operation. What is happening is they're taking the shorter portion of the debt that's currently held in Treasury securities on the New York Fed balance sheet and selling that back out into the marketplace and then taking the proceeds from the sales and redeploying those by purchasing longer dated Treasury securities back on to the balance sheet. So net effect is 0 to the Fed, with an average maturity that's actually lengthening in the process. 
What is helpful from a Money Market perspective is that we now have additional supply on a direct purchase basis. So there are more eligible securities that will be -- that are in the market and will continue to be put into the marketplace that are directly able for Treasury and government agency Money Market funds to purchase. Offsetting that to some degree is the fact that some of the longer-dated collateral that have been used in the marketplace for repurchase agreement collateralization is now being put back on to the Fed's balance sheet. So although it's not the end positive result that maybe had been contemplated at the very beginning, thoughts of Operation Twist, we do view it as a modest potential positive for Money Market rates and certainly for the government Money Market funds. And most important, when you view the other alternatives that they were contemplating during that time period, Operation Twist is the best outcome that we could have hoped for at that point."

I mean, we took the number of advisers that we're calling on from in the mid-20,000s to over 30,000. And depending on how you count advisers, there is 120,000 of them. So we felt we've done a very, very good job at the big wirehouses, and we're able to carve up territories to allow others to get into smaller broker/dealers, which should expand on exactly that kind of basis, those numbers. The next level is that even where we are doing business, we're able to expand from 1 or 2 type tickets or type mandates with an individual to get that up to 3 or 4. And once you do that, then there's a higher love quotient going on, which helps both the numbers and the longevity of the business. So the way that we're looking at it is that we can expand very smartly in this business, and that's why we're committed to adding the people. I guess that's a good piece of evidence there.

So yes, it does help but we think we are able to do some leveraging there. And we think that the product in and of itself continues on quite smartly. One of the interesting things about this particular fund and relative performance is as follows: because this fund has been successfully sold as a 5 and 5 product, meaning 5% dividend more or less, 5% growth of dividends more or less, when the performance relative to other funds in the category has even been in the bottom decile, the funds sales continue apace. And so naturally, we're happy when it has a good relative record, but because of what it is, it continues to sell even though it may have historically -- even though historically, it has gone in and out of the top group.

If you look at our history, when we've done those deals, the acquisitions, our purchase of shares has gone down, and when we paid the dividends, it hasn't been necessarily exactly closely to when we made the acquisitions. So that's a lot of talk to say. Let's see whether we get an acquisition and what we would do with our cash into the future, not committing to anything."

As Debbie mentioned, these funds have essentially not had yield for about 3 years now. So they're managed with a bias towards liquidity which means there's a lot of repo there and going back to Debbie's comments, we've been in the mid to upper single digits on repo levels that really dominate those portfolios. So that allows us to continue to operate the funds to have net revenue from the funds and to not be subsidizing them the way most people define a subsidy, meaning actually supporting the cost of the products. We are not doing that."

This is not to say that there isn't an analysis that goes on in between as well. In addition, there is a separate risk management effort headed by a fellow by the name of Mike Granido, interestingly with a background at JPMorgan.

Generally speaking, our systems allow the investment management folks to have real time access to all data so if I want to know intra-day what my positions to French banks are, it's a very simple process for me and the investment group to get that. Our oversight from a flow perspective on that information to the risk management compliance and legal groups happens on a batch basis at night. And that has proven to be pretty effective in the context of keeping everybody up to date on current market conditions and potential bets as you might note, I would say that, that Money Market funds at this point really are -- and certainly Federated's Prime and Muni funds where we would maintain direct exposure to French banks and even on a counter-party basis within our government funds, are not making a bet that's different from the marketplace at this point. We're just doing our job in a way that calculates what we consider to be the best relative value of institutions out there, and doing it with day-to-day continuous monitoring. The other side of this flow situation is the fund flow. So the asset flow, shareholder flows that are going into and out of the -- those products that use those French banks or European institutions on a day-to-day basis, and that helps us to validate basically that we're doing the appropriate decision-making process within our own assessment of the risks involved in those institutions, the information flow that goes to those oversight groups within Federated. And then again, validated by the client flow. If you look, Chris had mentioned on his regulatory side, discussions about various options that continue to be reviewed for money fund reform and our conclusion in many ways that the 2a-7 reforms that occurred in 2010 are 99.99% of the way to final reform for this industry. And what we saw in the July and August time period in the marketplace, where you had huge amounts of volatility in the Prime and Muni funds that was for the most part, industry-related to the second round of Greek debt negotiations just beginning. And then you had piled on top of that volatility within the government sector. If you recall at our last discussion, our last earnings call, we were questioning whether or not the U.S. was going to default. We weren't questioning that, but the market was questioning whether or not the U.S. was going to default on their debt, and certainly the resulting long-term downgrade by S&P is one that has been challenging for even our government Money Market funds, which from an industry perspective, have always been the safe haven. So despite these sorts of conditions in the July and August time period, Federated funds came through with flying colors. And our overall flow validation of our process and our model held up very well against the industry and the industry in total held up very well in the context of the new regulations and what's proven to be a pretty sound source of liquidity, credit and diversification changes that came about from those 2010 regulation changes."

And I think you saw this out of your Prime cash obligation funds, which had the biggest exposure to French banks. That saw disproportional redemptions for you guys. So it seems like little concerns, little runs in Prime funds. If there was a big credit problem, there could be a big run. And I thought that was what the regulators were trying to prevent. And if we're still seeing these mini-runs here -- run is probably a terrible word, but like outsized redemptions, is it really -- are the new rules really working well or do they -- seems like -- well, I guess your opinion is they're working well, but I don't know if this data kind of confirms that?

At any given point in time, we may have a larger shareholder in that fund or any of our other products that may cause it to look like it's doing something different. In fact, our strategy across all the Prime funds is identical. So -- and generally speaking, the only difference is that you might note on a quarter end or reporting date are the results of client flows that just happened to be a little different. And that we've agreed to from a know-your-client basis ahead of time. The other side of it, though, when you look at sort of the market conditions and Prime fund redemptions that did take place during that July and August time period, I think the industry on average was down about 10% in Prime fund assets and specifically, there were funds that were down over 50%. These are not Federated funds, but I'm sure you follow the market on a specific basis. You know who they are. This in the 2008 time period would have caused extreme market illiquidity. And going back again to what Chris mentioned, that's what we perceived to have been the main problem outside of those institutions that owned Lehman Brothers on a credit default basis back in September of 2008. But the extreme illiquidity that was the result of that back in 2008 certainly did not play out at all in the context of the summer of 2011 timeframe."
