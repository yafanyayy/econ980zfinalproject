I'm pleased to report that BMC Software delivered a strong fiscal third quarter. We generated solid results across our key financial metrics, including total bookings, license bookings, revenue and cash flow from operations. We also enhanced our technology leadership, launching new products and solutions that position us more strongly than ever to capture the growing demand for cloud computing. 
With our strong bookings performance and with the visibility we have to our fiscal fourth quarter, we are raising our fiscal year 2011 expectations for certain key metrics, including total bookings and ESM license bookings and cash flow from operations.
Let's look more closely at our fiscal 2011 third quarter results compared to the year-ago period. Total bookings grew 10% to a company record of $594 million. License bookings grew 19% to $295 million. Revenue was up 6% to a company record of $540 million. Cash flow from operations increased to 117% to $180 million. Non-GAAP diluted EPS increased 4% to $0.79 per diluted share. And our balance sheet remains strong with $1.6 billion in cash and investments and $1.8 billion in deferred revenue. 
That's a snapshot of our all financial performance. But let me turn next to provide a brief overview of our ESM and MSM business units during the third quarter.  Our ESM business generated solid growth, with ESM license bookings increasing 8% to a company record of $163 million, off a challenging compare to the year-ago period. On a trailing 12-month basis ESM license bookings have increased 15% year-over-year, in line with our longer-term objective of mid-teens growth. 
We were pleased that performance was balanced across the product lines with exceptionally strong performance in our automation products. We were also excited to see strong growth from EMEA and Asia-Pacific.
We also seeing a positive impact from our efforts to strengthen our ESM sales organization. During the quarter, the average number of productive sales reps increased from the prior year. And we are on track to achieve a 20% increase in the average productive sales headcount in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. 
Our execution regarding our BSM platform continues to trend higher, as evidenced by our continued ability to win large multiproduct platform deals. During the third quarter, we had 30 ESM transactions with over $1 million in license bookings, up 11% from a year ago. More than 75% of these transactions were multiproduct license transactions. Major ESM wins during the third quarter included the United States Army, Capgemini, CSC, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Cisco Services, MetLife and BMW, to name a few. 
In addition to the impressive growth in the number of large deals, we also saw our average selling price continue to increase. 
Our MSM business also performed very well in the quarter with strength in new product sales and increased capacity upgrades. During the quarter, we expanded our relationships with existing customers with 65 new product placements. Some key MSM mainframe wins include Banco Bradesco, Crédit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Pfizer Foundation hospitals, National Australia Bank and WellPoint. In the quarter, we also saw strong double-digit growth in the annual run rate spend for our top 15 MSM deals, with 13 of the 15 transactions resulting in an increase in spend with BMC.
The mainframe continues to be the trusted platform for critical business transaction processing, as evidenced by our fifth annual worldwide survey of mainframe users in IBM's successful launch of its Z Enterprise 196 system. According to our survey, 84% of respondents expected to see steady or growing usage on the platform. In addition, almost 60% of respondents indicated that the mainframe will attract new workloads over the next year. This year's survey results and the success of IBM's Z Enterprise 196 confirm that our continued investment in the mainframe is the right direction.
Beyond on the core mainframe solutions, we also saw strength in our Workload Automation business. As we discussed in our recent Investor Day, Workload Automation is about 1/3 of our MSM business. During the third quarter, we saw strength in BMC's Control-M, our industry-leading enterprise workload automation solution. We added 21 new BMC Control-M customers and expanded our existing relationships with 55 new product placements. Some key MSM Workload Automation wins included Banco Santander,, China Construction Bank, Expedia, Imation, Logica, waste management and. 
As we discussed at our recent Investor Day, one of the key drivers of our performance is enterprise adoption of cloud computing. Cloud computing gives enterprises a flexible IT infrastructure to deliver applications, while offering service providers a platform for new revenue streams. Properly managed clouds can dramatically reduce the time required to respond to changing business demands while reducing operational costs.
The key to successful cloud computing is service management. Fortunately, this directly aligns to our long-standing strategy for BSM, Business Service Management. Business Service Management really is the killer app for cloud computing. Our dynamic BSM platform supports public cloud, private cloud and hybrid environments with solutions for planning, deploying, opting and optimizing the cloud. Our leadership was validated by more than 20 significant Q2 wins for BMC's Cloud Lifecycle Management solution, including cloud wins at Accenture, Vodafone and MetLife. In response to this growing demand for cloud computing, we continued to invest in our product capabilities through internal development and through acquisitions and in our strategic alliances with other cloud computing leaders.
Our internal R&D efforts delivered new cloud relevant capabilities across our portfolio that further differentiated BMC. In January, we extended our Cloud Lifecycle Management solution to enable clients to customize their clouds using the first platform-agnostic solutions for delivering and governing internal and external services. We also launched BMC Control-M self-service, the industry's first BSM self-service solution that empowers business users to work directly with the workload automation processes to power the business. 
In December, we announced the enhancement of our proactive operation solutions, which integrates planning, predictive analytics and preventive automation to improve availability and performance in physical, virtual and cloud infrastructures. We also extended our BMC Control-M workload automation solution with new capabilities for informatics and SAP business objects. 
We also released our latest BMC discovery independent mapping solution that combines the depth of best-of-breed discovery capabilities that we acquired one year ago with the breadth of our existing ATM solutions. 
In addition to investing in our own R&D efforts, we also expanded our capabilities by investing in companies that enhance and easily integrate into our BSM platform. In December we acquired Great Apps Systems, [ph] the privately held industry leader in automating heterogeneous database patching and administration. 
And as we mentioned in last quarter's call in October, we acquired the software business of Neptuni, [ph] a European-based capacity management and IT performance optimization solutions. The addition of Neptuni is technology extends BMC's existing leadership in physical and virtual capacity management. 
During the third quarter, we built upon our strong network of strategic partner relationships in strengthening our sales footprint, our service capabilities and our portfolio of Zulu shins. Our expanding partnerships with salesforce.com, Cisco and Accenture underscore the strength of BMC's competitive advantages in the IT management software business. We started working with salesforce.com the market leader in business applications delivered from the cloud last year with the release of BMC's ServiceDesk on force.com. This December, our two companies escalated our partnership with the announcement of Remedy Force, salesforce.com's eight and newest cloud offering that combines BMC's market-leading IT as an solutions with salesforce.com's leading enterprise cloud computing platform. This is the best of both worlds. cutting-edge delivery of proven solutions that provide businesses a simple and fast path to better IT service management. It is also significant that Remedy Force will be sold and marketed as a salesforce.com product in addition to being sold by BMC. 
Our most recent alliance with Cisco targets a very different but equally significant market opportunity, new solutions for large-scale multi-cloud computing infrastructures. We're already delivering the first product of this alliance, a new integrated cloud delivery platform that combines both companies' technologies. The integrated cloud delivery platform enables enterprises and service providers to build and operate large-scale infrastructures that make mission-critical cloud services a reality. Some of our most significant cloud wins for the third quarter included this new solution, and were sold in partnership with Cisco.
During the third quarter, we also announced the expansion of a long-standing relationship with Accenture. The two companies will jointly develop, market and implement packaged and custom BSM Solutions, all built on BMC's BSM platform. Our platform approach enables customers to extract maximum return on their IT investments as they take advantage of virtualization, cloud computing, Software-as-a-Service and other new technologies. In addition, BMC will leverage Accenture technology professionals to increase the capacity of our delivery and implementation capabilities with a dedicated Accenture team providing consulting and integration services to BMC's professional services organization. 
Our cloud strategy and solutions underscore our leadership in helping enterprises improve the way they manage IT. this Has been demonstrated not only by our growth in bookings and revenue, but also by the recognition we continue to win among industry analysts. For example, we are happy to note that Gartner positioned us in the leaders quadrant of their recent report, Magic Quadrant for IT service desks. Please download and read this important document. We feel this confirms what we already knew, that our ServiceDesk solutions are the industry's most comprehensive. It also shows that the market is responding positively to Remedy Force and Remedy On Demand, the software and ServiceDesk service to solution we launched earlier this year. 
Gartner also positioned us once again in the leaders quadrant of their December 13 report, Magic Quadrant for IT Event Correlation and Analysis 2010, which is available also at our corporate website. We believe this shows that we differentiate ourselves from the competition with our complete vision for correlation and analysis.
Looking forward, we are encouraged by the number of analysts that expect enterprise software spending to show solid growth in calendar year 2011. A number of independent research studies such as a recent one by Gartner, indicate that IT operations management will be among the area showing the most growth. Research like this confirms the positive trends we're seeing in the marketplace, which, combined with the visibility we have into the fiscal fourth quarter, supports us in raising our guidance for total bookings him a ESM license bookings and cash flow from operations for the current fiscal year. These are among the many factors that make us confident about our future prospects.
In summary, score that our strategy of growth and investment is working very well and generating attractive returns. Our service automation, Software-as-a-Service and cloud solutions all continue to show strong increases in customer demand. Our partnerships are enabling us to expand the market opportunities we enjoyed. At the same time, we remain committed to our ongoing strategy of optimizing efficiency, productivity and operating leverage to improve profitability.
Before I turn the call over to Steve Solcher for more details in our financials, I would first like to update you on a management change. As you saw in our earnings release earlier today, John will be taking a new role with the company effective April 1 when we enter our new fiscal year. We told you last year how John was focused on building a ESM sales and services organization into competitive differentiator is for BMC. The result of his efforts speak for themselves and are in our earnings results we are announcing today and in prior quarters since he took the senior leadership role at BMC. John has been instrumental in shaping our ESM sales force and services organization and we are now asking him to help us across both business units. In April, John will move to Canberra miss, strategy and corporate involvement organization where he will focus on new go to market initiatives for all of BMC. Helping us develop new sales and distribution models to serve us as we continue to grow organically and via acquisitions. John as but a strong impressive leadership team SVP worldwide sales and services and will continue to rely on those key leaders, notably look out Lazaro and will continue to run ESM sales and services organizations respectively and that's they have over the past year. And now here's Steve to provide you more insight into our financial results during the third quarter."

Is Bob mentioned earlier our third quarter was a quarter of strong top line results. Our bookings results are balanced with strong performance across both our ESM and MSM business units as well as across our major product lines and major geographies. We continue to make focused investments in R&D, sales and services in order to capitalize in our leadership position in the fast-growing markets. We remain disciplined in our approach of balancing additional investments along with improved profitability.
Our bookings momentum through the first nine months of our fiscal year and our outlook for the fourth quarter, put, positions us well to deliver strong fiscal year results across key financial metrics, including total bookings, ESM license bookings, non-GAAP diluted EPS and cash flow from operations. That let me now turn to our results for the third quarter.
In the third quarter, non-GAAP operating income 2% to $188 million from $191 million in the third quarter of last year. Non-GAAP operating margin declined three points to 35%. Third quarter non-GAAP operating margin was negatively impacted by the loss associated with our Professional Services business, the slight dilution related to acquisitions that we completed in the third quarter and unexpected $3 million expense related to a legal case. Please refer to Slide 5 for highlights of our ESM and MSM business unit operating results.
ESM's non-GAAP operating income in the third quarter increased 7% to $72 million. ESM's operating margin was 21%, four points lower than the year-ago quarter. This decline was primarily driven I the loss in our Professional Services business. MSM's non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter increased by 2% to $116 million. MSM's non-GAAP operating margin was 57%, flat with a year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP net earnings for the third quarter were $143 million, an increase of 1% of the third quarter of fiscal '10. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.79, up 4% from the year-ago quarter. This reflects a non-GAAP effect tax rate of 24% for the quarter. GAAP operating income in the third quarter was $139 million compared to $148 million in the year-ago quarter. GAAP net earnings and diluted EPS were $109 million and $0.60 compared to $111 million and $0.59 in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. These results reflect diluted shares outstanding in the third quarter of $182 million compared to $187 million in the year-ago quarter.
Turning now to bookings. In the third quarter, total bookings of $594 million were up 10% as reported and 12% on a constant-currency basis compared to the year-ago quarter. Total license bookings for the quarter increased 19% as reported and 20% on a constant-currency basis to $295 million as compared to the year-ago quarter. Total bookings on a trailing 12 month basis were $2.1 billion, up 10% compared to the year-ago quarter. The weighted average contract length for total bookings on a trailing 12 month basis was 2.17 years, flat with a year-ago quarter. After normalizing for contract length, trailing 12 month annualized bookings for the third quarter were $958 million, up 10% from the year-ago quarter and up three percentage points from the second quarter. Please see Slide 7 in our presentation. From the geographic perspective, we have particularly strong bookings growth in Europe and Asia across both our ESM and MSM businesses.
Now let me turn to bookings performance of each of our business units. For ESM business unit, license bookings are the best measure of performance. We generated strong growth in our ESM business with ESM license bookings at $163 million in the third quarter, up 8% from the year-ago quarter. For the first three quarters of fiscal 2011, ESM license bookings are up 23% compared to the year-ago period. Be closed 30 ESM license transactions over $1 million in the third quarter, up 11% compared to the year ago. Of the license transactions, a over $1 million, 23 included multiple product lines. The momentum in our Service Automation discipline continued in the third quarter, as Service Automation license bookings are up 59% for the first nine months. The number of productive ESM sales headcount is tracking to plan. And we continue to expect average productive sales headcount to increase by 20% for the fiscal year.
Turning to the MSM business. We believe MSM is best evaluated on the basis of total and annualized bookings over the trailing 12 months. In the third quarter, total MSM bookings on a trailing 12-month basis decreased to 5% to $761 million compared to the year-ago quarter and had an average contract length of 2.88 years. After normalizing for contract length, total annualized MSM bookings for the trailing 12 months were $264 million, an increase of 1% compared to the year-ago quarter. 
We are encouraged that capacity upgrades in our MSM business returned to more historical levels in the third quarter, which contrasts with the low level of capacity upgrades in the first half of our fiscal year. We are also pleased that we had strong growth in new MSM business, which includes attracting new customers and selling additional products to existing customers.
Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the quarter was $540 million, up 6% as reported and 7% on a constant-currency basis from the third quarter of fiscal 2010. ESM's total revenue was up 8% to $335 million, and MSM's total revenue was up 3% to $205 million. License revenue in the third quarter was $235 million, an increase of 9% from the year-ago quarter. ESM's license revenue was $149 million, up 9% from the year-ago quarter. MSM license revenue increased by 8% to $86 million from the year-ago quarter.
During the third quarter, the percentage of license bookings that was deferred was 54% versus 55% in the year-ago quarter. For the third quarter, maintenance revenue was $259 million, flat with the year-ago quarter but up $7 million sequentially. I am pleased with the sequential improvement in maintenance revenue in both our ESM and MSM businesses, and our renewal rates remain stable. And our license bookings strength over the last several quarters is starting to positively impact maintenance revenue trends. ESM's maintenance revenue was $140 million, flat compared to the year-ago quarter and up $4 million sequentially. MSM maintenance revenue was $119 million, also flat compared to the year ago and up $3 million sequentially. Professional Services revenue, which is included in our ESM business unit, increased by 45% from the year-ago quarter to $46 million. Our Professional Services business generated a non-GAAP operating loss of $7 million compared to a $2 million loss in the year-ago period.
Moving next to operating expenses. During the third quarter, non-GAAP operating expenses were $352 million, up 11% from $317 million in the year-ago quarter. This increase was driven primarily by a $20 million increase in expenses related to our Professional Services business, driven in part by higher third-party subcontracting costs. In addition, this increase reflects the continued focus investments we have made in our ESM business. The impact of our recent acquisitions of and an unexpected $3 million legal expense. 
Looking at our business units, ESM's non-GAAP operating expenses were $263 million, an increase of 13% compared to the year-ago quarter. MSM's non-GAAP operating expenses were $89 million, an increase of 5% from the year-ago quarter. As a result of our current business momentum and improving market opportunity, we believe it is prudent that we remain focused on making investments in ESM in order to capitalize on our strong leadership position in this market. These investments include enhancing our cloud and SaaS offerings, supporting our strategic alliances, increasing sales headcount and strengthening our services organization. Other income in the third quarter was $2 million compared to a $1 million loss in the year-ago quarter.
Now turning to the balance sheet. Total deferred license revenue at the end of the third quarter was $661 million, a company record, and up $60 million sequentially from $601 million. During the quarter, we deferred $160 million of license revenue or 54% of license bookings and recognized $100 million of deferred license revenue from the balance sheet. Total deferred revenue increased by $54 million sequentially to $1.8 billion. The current portion of deferred revenue now stands at 54% of total deferred revenue.
Software development costs on the balance sheet were $185 million, as we capitalized $33 million and amortized $19 million during the quarter. Capitalization of software development costs was slightly higher sequentially due to the timing of our development efforts around several products. Given the timing of development efforts and release dates of new products, we expect capitalization of software development costs to decline sequentially in the fourth quarter. 
Cash and investments at the end of the quarter totaled $1.6 billion, up $72 million sequentially. Our net cash position was $1.3 billion. For the quarter, cash flow from operations was $180 million, up 117% from $83 million in the year-ago quarter. For the first three quarters, cash flow from operations has now increased by 43% to $475 million.
During the quarter, we remain committed to share repurchases. We repurchased 1.7 million shares for a total of $75 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $771 million remaining in our current share repurchase per gram. Given our revised outlook for cash flow from operations, our strong cash balance and current market conditions, we expect to increase the pace of share repurchase in the fourth quarter.
So let me briefly sum up the quarter. We are pleased with our solid execution and performance across both of our business units during the quarter. Our strong competitive position, focused investment in key growth areas and commitment to generating growth and improving profitability position us well to achieve both our short-term and long-term goals. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob to discuss our revised expectations for the year and his concluding remarks."

The improving economic outlook has created an appetite within businesses for new technologies like cloud computing that leverage IT investments of the past to support innovation, faster responsiveness to changing business needs and efficiency. Our commitment to providing a path to the future that does not rule out the past has contributed to yet another strong period of financial performance for BMC. 
Given our strong bookings performance in the third quarter and our visibility into the fourth fiscal quarter, we are raising our fiscal year 2011 expectations for certain key metrics including total bookings, ESM license bookings and cash flow from operations. We are reiterating our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share expectation in the range of $2.92 to $3.02. At the midpoint, this would represent a 12% increase over the last year.
Our non-GAAP diluted EPS estimate excludes an estimated range of $0.43 to $0.48 per diluted share for non-GAAP adjustments, including share-based compensation; the amortization of intangible assets, severance, exit costs and related charges; as well as the related tax impacts of these items and certain discrete tax items. The assumptions underlying this full year fiscal '11 estimate include: bookings growth in the high single digits compared to our prior expectation of mid to high single-digit growth; ESM license bookings growth in the high teens to low 20s compared to our prior expectation of high teens growth; MSM total bookings growth in the low single digits; total revenue growth in the mid-single digits; at current rates, we do not expect currency to materially impact full year bookings or revenue growth rates; non-GAAP operating margin flat to the year-ago period; a license bookings deferral rate in the low 50% range; other income slightly down compared to a year ago; weighted shares outstanding slightly down compared to the prior year; and a non-GAAP tax rate of 24%.
We now expect full year fiscal 2011 cash flow from operations to be between $710 million and $760 million, an increase from our prior expectation of $675 million to $725 million. At the midpoint, this would represent a $100 million or 16% increase over last year.

And as we said in our prepared remarks, we had a $7 million loss associated with services, and I think it's really attributable to several things. A lot of that, given that is growing demand in our Professional Services business itself. And we supplemented that demand by having a bunch of what we call third-party contractors to help us fulfill that demand. I think what you should expect us over time as that business becomes more in line profitability-wise. So we will continue to improve the profitability of that, as we kind of do not do what I would say is kind of double-dipping where we're using our own people and subcontracting more so I really do expect BMC personnel to drive a lot of that can have less reliance on the third-party contractors."

We are looking at PSO revenues and bookings growing significantly faster than we originally anticipated, and cloud is driving a lot of that. I mean a few quarters ago we had zero associated with cloud and we were doing more implementations. Now what's happening is we are winning these cloud standardization deals. But the way they go down is they want us to come in and set up proof of concept, essentially open the store before they put any product on the shelf. And so the upsell of these accounts is really exceptionally positive for us. But the expense is somewhat front-end-loaded. So the fact our Professional Services group is growing. Revenue grew 45% and bookings faster than that, just puts required of us to make some investment in that group so we can implement those systems and grow it. And if we keep these cloud deals like we're winning and I expect that we will, we plan on implanting them successfully to these customers. And we have to hire some people to do that."

I think as Bob mentioned, we also have been highly successful in what we call new product offerings, and that's either new products to existing customers or brand-new customers. And so that also would be treated in the license line. And then finally when you think about our renewal opportunity, it was heavily back-end-loaded. So again, to remind everybody as we had a pretty tough first half, the MSM business was actually down in the first half, roughly 17%. And we're looking at the second half being almost a mirror of that, the flip side of that. So we have a very nice renewal opportunity in the second half of the year.

We estimated we would have about 20% growth in productive capacity in the sales force. We are on track to do that or better. We had attrition issues about a year ago. Those are gone. In fact, we're in very good shape right now in attrition. So now we're entering a little bit of more -- we're not in a startup mode. we're in more of a steady-state mode. So we will grow headcount. We will grow our services people. We will grow pre-sales people. But we're not going to do it in some bursts. It's going to be more linear throughout the year."

So we feel good about the model we've been using. I wouldn't expect us to deviate sharply from that. I never want to say never. And there are circumstances, we did Blade. It was unusual for us. We did Remedy. It was unusual for us, but those deals were transformative. We'll always that open as an open if we see the right thing that we think we change the company.

He's in charge of the worldwide sales force for the second year. And he's continuing to evolve the sales organization as he did in Europe. Asia has been a relatively small but a very effective sales force for us. I mean one of our wins, China Construction Bank, this quarter is one of multiple success we're having in China, where we're getting great references in some of the largest, most well-established, recognized Chinese enterprises and agencies. So we're doing well there. Australia, we just won the NBN deal, the national network for building the national cloud system and public cloud for the Australian government. That was in cooperation Cisco. There we won a large transaction there. And we've been ramping heads. We kind of ramped heads pretty well solidly over in Asia last year. And I think that's paid up for us. The teams on the ground there have been on the ground now long enough to establish good customer relationships. And we're seeing that bare fruit. But I'd say overall the area where we've had a good quarter in federal this quarter. I think we're kind of keeping our fingers crossed and watching federal coz all of us, I think, is unsure as to what the latest austerity measures might mean in the federal space. But we had a really solid quarter in federal. And part of the reason -- I met with the CTO of large government agency. He told me they've got a major austerity program. And that is why they standardized on our cloud offering. So they standardized on our cloud, because of the costs. But I'm still a little cautious about federal. I want to see what happens there. We have a great team in federal. We just had a federal event with 1,000 customers signed up for our two-day there. But let's see what the austerity measures would mean to federal."

I'm pleased to report that BMC Software delivered a strong fiscal third quarter. We generated solid results across our key financial metrics, including total bookings, license bookings, revenue and cash flow from operations. We also enhanced our technology leadership, launching new products and solutions that position us more strongly than ever to capture the growing demand for cloud computing. 
With our strong bookings performance and with the visibility we have to our fiscal fourth quarter, we're raising our fiscal year 2011 expectations for certain key metrics, including total bookings and ESM license bookings and cash flow from operations.
Let's look more closely at our fiscal 2011 third quarter results compared to the year-ago period. Total bookings grew 10% to a company record of $594 million. License bookings grew 19% to $295 million. Revenue was up 6% to a company record of $540 million. Cash flow from operations increased 117% to $180 million. Non-GAAP diluted EPS increased 4% to $0.79 per diluted share. And our balance sheet remains strong with $1.6 billion in cash and investments and $1.8 billion in deferred revenue. 
That's a snapshot of our all financial performance. But let me turn next to provide a brief overview of our ESM and MSM business units during the third quarter.
  Our ESM business generated solid growth, with ESM license bookings increasing 8% to a company record of $163 million, off a challenging compare to the year-ago period. On a trailing 12-month basis ESM license bookings have increased 15% year-over-year, in line with our longer-term objective of mid-teens growth. 
We were pleased that performance was balanced across the product lines, with exceptionally strong performance in our automation products. We were also excited to see strong growth from EMEA and Asia-Pacific.
We also seeing a positive impact from our efforts to strengthen our ESM sales organization. During the quarter, the average number of productive sales reps increased from the prior year. And we are on track to achieve a 20% increase in the average productive sales headcount in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. 
Our execution regarding our BSM platform continues to trend higher, as evidenced by our continued ability to win large, multiproduct platform deals. During the third quarter, we had 30 ESM transactions with over $1 million in license bookings, up 11% from a year ago. More than 75% of these transactions were multiproduct license transactions. Major ESM wins during the third quarter included the United States Army, Capgemini, CSC, BBVA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Cisco Services, MetLife and BMW, to name a few. 
In addition to the impressive growth in the number of large deals, we also saw our average selling price continue to increase.  Our MSM business also performed very well in the quarter with strength in new product sales and increased capacity upgrades. 
During the quarter, we expanded our relationships with existing customers with 65 new product placements. Some key MSM mainframe wins included Banco Bradesco, Bitmarck, Crédit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, National Australia Bank and WellPoint.  In the quarter, we also saw strong double-digit growth in the annual run rate spend for our top 15 MSM deals, with 13 of the 15 transactions resulting in an increase in spend with BMC.
The mainframe continues to be the trusted platform for critical business transaction processing, as evidenced by our Fifth Annual Worldwide Survey of Mainframe Users and IBM's successful launch of its zEnterprise 196 system. According to our survey, 84% of respondents expected to see steady or growing MIPS usage on the platform. In addition, almost 60% of respondents indicated that the mainframe will attract new workloads over the next year. This year's survey results and the success of IBM's zEnterprise 196 confirm that our continued investment in the mainframe is the right direction.
Beyond on the core mainframe solutions, we also saw strength in our Workload Automation business. As we discussed at our recent Investor Day, Workload Automation is about 1/3 of our MSM business. During the third quarter, we saw strength in BMC's Control-M, our industry-leading enterprise workload automation solution. We added 21 new BMC Control-M customers and expanded our existing relationships with 55 new product placements. Some key MSM workload automation wins included Banco Santander,, China Construction Bank, Expedia, Imation, Logica, Waste Management and Woori Bank.
As we discussed at our recent Investor Day, one of the key drivers of our performance is enterprise adoption of cloud computing. Cloud computing gives enterprises a flexible IT infrastructure to deliver applications, while offering service providers a platform for new revenue streams. Properly managed clouds can dramatically reduce the time required to respond to changing business demands while reducing operational costs.
The key to successful cloud computing is service management. Fortunately, this directly aligns to our long-standing strategy for BSM, Business Service Management. Business Service Management really is the killer app for cloud computing. Our dynamic BSM platform supports public cloud, private cloud and hybrid environments with solutions for planning, deploying, operating and optimizing the cloud. 
Our leadership was validated by more than 20 significant Q2 wins for BMC's Cloud Lifecycle Management solution, including cloud wins at Accenture, Vodafone and MetLife. In response to this growing demand for cloud computing, we continued to invest in our product capabilities through internal development and through acquisitions and in our strategic alliances with other cloud computing leaders.
Our internal R&D efforts delivered new cloud relevant capabilities across our portfolio that further differentiated BMC. In January, we extended our Cloud Lifecycle Management solution to enable clients to customize their clouds using the first platform-agnostic solutions for delivering and governing internal and external services. We also launched BMC Control-M Self Service, the industry's first BSM self-service solution that empowers business users to work directly with the workload automation processes to power their business. 
In December, we announced the enhancement of our Proactive Operations solutions, which integrates planning, predictive analytics and preventive automation to improve availability and performance in physical, virtual and cloud infrastructures. We also extended our BMC Control-M workload automation solution with new capabilities for Informatica and SAP BusinessObjects.  We also released our latest BMC Atrium Discovery and Dependency Mapping solution that combines the depth of Tideway's best-of-breed discovery capabilities that we acquired one year ago with the breadth of our existing Atrium solutions. 
In addition to investing in our own R&D efforts, we also expanded our capabilities by investing in companies that enhance and easily integrate into our BSM platform. In December, we acquired GridApp Systems, the privately held industry leader in automating heterogeneous database provisioning, patching and administration. 
And as we mentioned during last quarter's call, in October, we acquired the software business of Neptuny, a European-based capacity management and IT performance optimization solution. The addition of Neptuny's  technology extends BMC's existing leadership in physical and virtual capacity management. 
During the third quarter, we built upon our strong network of strategic partner relationships in strengthening our sales footprint, our service capabilities and our portfolio of solutions. Our expanding partnerships with salesforce.com, Cisco and Accenture underscore the strength of BMC's competitive advantages in the IT management software business. We started working with salesforce.com, the market leader in business applications delivered from the cloud, last year, with the release of BMC  ServiceDesk on Force.com. 
This December, our two companies escalated our partnership with the announcement of RemedyForce, salesforce.com's eight and newest cloud offering that combines BMC's market-leading ITSM solutions with salesforce.com's leading enterprise cloud computing platform. This is the best of both worlds. Cutting-edge delivery of proven solutions that provide businesses a simple and fast path to better IT service management. It is also significant that RemedyForce will be sold and marketed as a salesforce.com product in addition to being sold by BMC. 
Our most recent alliance with Cisco targets a very different but equally significant market opportunity, new solutions for large-scale, multi-tenant cloud computing infrastructures. We're already delivering the first product of this alliance, a new Integrated Cloud Delivery Platform that combines both companies' technologies. The Integrated Cloud Delivery Platform enables enterprises and service providers to build and operate large-scale infrastructures that make mission-critical cloud services a reality. Some of our most significant cloud wins for the third quarter included this new solution and were sold in partnership with Cisco.
During the third quarter, we also announced the expansion of a long-standing relationship with Accenture. The two companies will jointly develop, market and implement packaged and custom BSM solutions, all built on BMC's BSM platform. Our platform approach enables customers to extract maximum return on their IT investments, as they take advantage of virtualization, cloud computing, Software-as-a-Service and other new technologies. In addition, BMC will leverage Accenture technology professionals to increase the capacity of our delivery and implementation capabilities with a dedicated Accenture team, providing consulting and integration services to BMC's professional services organization. 
Our cloud strategy and solutions underscore our leadership in helping enterprises improve the way they manage IT. This has been demonstrated not only by our growth in bookings and revenues, but also by the recognition we continue to win among industry analysts. For example, we are happy to note that Gartner positioned us in the Leaders Quadrant of their recent report, Magic Quadrant for IT Service Desk. Please download and read this important document. We feel this affirms confirms what we already knew, that our ServiceDesk solutions are the industry's most comprehensive. It also shows that the market is responding positively to RemedyForce and Remedy OnDemand, the Software-as-a-Service ServiceDesk solution we launched earlier this year. 
Gartner also positioned us once again in the Leaders Quadrant of their December 13 report, Magic Quadrant for IT Event Correlation and Analysis 2010, which is available also on our corporate website. We believe this shows that we differentiated ourselves from the competition with our complete vision for event correlation and analysis.
Looking forward, we are encouraged by the number of analysts that expect enterprise software spending to show solid growth in calendar year 2011. A number of independent research studies such as a recent one by Gartner, indicate that IT operations management will be among the areas showing the most growth. Research like this confirms the positive trends we're seeing in the marketplace, which, combined with the visibility we have into the fiscal fourth quarter, supports us in raising our guidance for total bookings, ESM license bookings and cash flow from operations for the current fiscal year. These are among the many factors that make us confident about our future prospects.
In summary, let me underscore that our strategy of growth and investment is working very well and generating attractive returns. Our service automation, Software-as-a-Service and cloud solutions all continue to show strong increases in customer demand. Our partnerships are enabling us to expand the market opportunities we enjoy. At the same time, we remain committed to our ongoing strategy of optimizing efficiency, productivity and operating leverage to improve profitability.
Before I turn the call over to Steve Solcher for more details in our financials, I would first like to update you on a management change. As you saw in our earnings release earlier today, John McMahon will be taking a new role with the company, effective April 1, when we enter our new fiscal year. We told you last year how John was focused on building the ESM sales and services organization into competitive differentiators for BMC. The result of his efforts speak for themselves and are reflected in our earnings results we're announcing today and in prior quarters since he took the senior leadership role at BMC.  John has been instrumental in shaping our ESM sales force and services organization, and we're now asking him to help us across both business units. 
In April, John will move to Ken Berryman's Strategy and Corporate Development organization, where he will focus on new go-to-market initiatives for all of BMC, helping us develop new sales and distribution models to serve us, as we continue to grow organically and via acquisitions. John has built a strong and impressive leadership team in his tenure as SVP of Worldwide Sales and Services and will continue to rely on those key leaders, notably, Luca Lazzaron and Vance Loiselle will continue to run ESM sales and services organizations respectively,  as they have over this past year. 
And now here's Steve to provide you more insight into our financial results during the third quarter."

As Bob mentioned earlier our third quarter was a quarter of strong top line results.

As Bob mentioned earlier our third quarter was a quarter of strong top line results. Our bookings results were balanced with strong performance across both our ESM and MSM business units as well as across our major product lines and major geographies. We continue to make focused investments in R&D, sales and services in order to capitalize in our leadership position in these fast-growing markets. We remain disciplined in our approach of balancing additional investments along with improved profitability.
Our bookings momentum through the first nine months of our fiscal year and our outlook for the fourth quarter, positions us well to deliver strong fiscal year results across key financial metrics, including total bookings, ESM license bookings, non-GAAP diluted EPS and cash flow from operations. With that let me now turn to our results for the third quarter.
In the third quarter, non-GAAP operating income decreased 2% to $188 million from $191 million in the third quarter of last year. Non-GAAP operating margin declined three points to 35%. Third quarter non-GAAP operating margin was negatively impacted by the loss associated with our Professional Services business, the slight dilution related to two acquisitions that we completed in the third quarter and an unexpected $3 million expense related to a legal case. Please refer to Slide 5 for highlights of our ESM and MSM business unit operating results.
ESM's non-GAAP operating income in the third quarter decreased 7% to $72 million. ESM's operating margin was 21%, four points lower than the year-ago quarter. This decline was primarily driven by the loss in our Professional Services business. 
MSM's non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter increased by 2% to $116 million. MSM's non-GAAP operating margin was 57%, flat with the year-ago quarter. 
Non-GAAP net earnings for the third quarter were $143 million, an increase of 1% from the third quarter of fiscal '10. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.79, up 4% from the year-ago quarter. This reflects a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 24% for the quarter. 
GAAP operating income in the third quarter was $139 million compared to $148 million in the year-ago quarter. GAAP net earnings and diluted EPS were $109 million and $0.60 compared to $111 million and $0.59 in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. These results reflect diluted shares outstanding in the third quarter of $182 million compared to $187 million in the year-ago quarter.
Turning now to bookings. In the third quarter, total bookings of $594 million were up 10% as reported and 12% on a constant-currency basis compared to the year-ago quarter. Total license bookings for the quarter increased 19% as reported and 20% on a constant-currency basis to $295 million as compared to the year-ago quarter. 
Total bookings on a trailing 12-month basis were $2.1 billion, up 10% compared to the year-ago quarter. The weighted average contract length for total bookings on a trailing 12-month basis was 2.17 years, flat with the year-ago quarter. After normalizing for contract length, trailing 12-month annualized bookings for the third quarter were $958 million, up 10% from the year-ago quarter and up three percentage points from the second quarter. Please see Slide 7 in our presentation. 
From the geographic perspective, we have particularly strong bookings growth in Europe and Asia, across both our ESM and MSM businesses.
Now let me turn to bookings performance of each of our business units. For ESM business unit, license bookings are the best measure of performance. We generated strong growth in our ESM business with ESM license bookings at $163 million in the third quarter, up 8% from the year-ago quarter.  For the first three quarters of fiscal 2011, ESM license bookings are up 23% compared to the year-ago period. 
We closed 30 ESM license transactions over $1 million in the third quarter, up 11% compared to the year ago. Of the license transactions over $1 million, 23 included multiple product lines. The momentum in our service automation discipline continued in the third quarter, as service automation license bookings are up 59% for the first nine months. The number of productive ESM sales headcount is tracking to plan. And we continue to expect average productive sales headcount to increase by 20% for the fiscal year.
Turning to the MSM business. We believe MSM is best evaluated on the basis of total and annualized bookings over the trailing 12 months. In the third quarter, total MSM bookings on a trailing 12-month basis decreased 5% to $761 million compared to the year-ago quarter and had an average contract length of 2.88 years. After normalizing for contract length, total annualized MSM bookings for the trailing 12 months were $264 million, an increase of 1% compared to the year-ago quarter. 
We are encouraged that capacity upgrades in our MSM business returned to more historical levels in the third quarter, which contrasts with the low level of capacity upgrades in the first half of our fiscal year. We are also pleased that we had strong growth in new MSM business, which includes attracting new customers and selling additional products to existing customers.
Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the quarter was $540 million, up 6% as reported and 7% on a constant-currency basis from the third quarter of fiscal 2010. ESM's total revenue was up 8% to $335 million, and MSM's total revenue was up 3% to $205 million. 
License revenue in the third quarter was $235 million, an increase of 9% from the year-ago quarter. ESM's license revenue was $149 million, up 9% from the year-ago quarter. MSM license revenue increased by 8% to $86 million from the year-ago quarter.
During the third quarter, the percentage of license bookings that was deferred was 54% versus 55% in the year-ago quarter. For the third quarter, maintenance revenue was $259 million, flat with the year-ago quarter but up $7 million sequentially. I am pleased with the sequential improvement in maintenance revenue in both our ESM and MSM businesses. Our renewal rates remain stable. And our license bookings strength over the last several quarters is starting to positively impact maintenance revenue trends. 
ESM's maintenance revenue was $140 million, flat compared to the year-ago quarter and up $4 million sequentially. MSM maintenance revenue was $119 million, also flat compared to the year ago and up $3 million sequentially. 
Professional Services revenue, which is included in our ESM business unit, increased by 45% from the year-ago quarter to $46 million. Our Professional Services business generated a non-GAAP operating loss of $7 million compared to a $2 million loss in the year-ago period.
Moving next to operating expenses. During the third quarter, non-GAAP operating expenses were $352 million, up 11% from $317 million in the year-ago quarter. This increase was driven primarily by a $20 million increase in expenses related to our Professional Services business, driven in part by higher third-party subcontracting costs. In addition, this increase reflects the continued focus investments we have made in our ESM business, the impact of our recent acquisitions of Neptuny and GridApp and an unexpected $3 million legal expense. 
Looking at our business units, ESM's non-GAAP operating expenses were $263 million, an increase of 13% compared to the year-ago quarter. MSM's non-GAAP operating expenses were $89 million, an increase of 5% from the year-ago quarter. 
As a result of our current business momentum and improving market opportunity, we believe it is prudent that we remain focused on making investments in ESM in order to capitalize on our strong leadership position in this market. These investments include enhancing our cloud and SaaS offerings, supporting our strategic alliances, increasing sales headcount and strengthening our services organization. Other income in the third quarter was $2 million compared to a $1 million loss in the year-ago quarter.
Now turning to the balance sheet. Total deferred license revenue at the end of the third quarter was $661 million, a company record, and up $60 million sequentially from $601 million. During the quarter, we deferred $160 million of license revenue or 54% of license bookings and recognized $100 million of deferred license revenue from the balance sheet. Total deferred revenue increased by $54 million sequentially to $1.8 billion. The current portion of deferred revenue now stands at 54% of total deferred revenue.
Software development costs on the balance sheet were $185 million as we capitalized $33 million and amortized $19 million during the quarter. Capitalization of software development costs was slightly higher sequentially due to the timing of our development efforts around several products. Given the timing of development efforts and release dates of new products, we expect capitalization of software development costs to decline sequentially in the fourth quarter. 
Cash and investments at the end of the quarter totaled $1.6 billion, up $72 million sequentially. Our net cash position was $1.3 billion. 
For the quarter, cash flow from operations was $180 million, up 117% from $83 million in the year-ago quarter. For the first three quarters, cash flow from operations has now increased by 43% to $475 million.
During the quarter, we remain committed to share repurchases. We repurchased 1.7 million shares for a total of $75 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $771 million remaining in our current share repurchase program. Given our revised outlook for cash flow from operations, our strong cash balance and current market conditions, we expect to increase the pace of share repurchase in the fourth quarter.
So let me briefly sum up the quarter. We are pleased with our solid execution and performance across both of our business units during the quarter. Our strong competitive position, focused investment in key growth areas and commitment to generating growth and improving profitability position us well to achieve both our short-term and long-term goals. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob to discuss our revised expectations for the year and his concluding remarks."

The improving economic outlook has created an appetite within businesses for new technologies like cloud computing that leverage IT investments of the past to support innovation, faster responsiveness to changing business needs and efficiency. Our commitment to providing a path to the future that does not rule out the past has contributed to yet another strong period of financial performance for BMC. 
Given our strong bookings performance in the third quarter and our visibility into the fourth fiscal quarter, we are raising our fiscal year 2011 expectations for certain key metrics, including total bookings, ESM license bookings and cash flow from operations. 
We are reiterating our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share expectation in the range of $2.92 to $3.02. At the midpoint, this would represent a 12% increase over last year.
Our non-GAAP diluted EPS estimate excludes an estimated range of $0.43 to $0.48 per diluted share for non-GAAP adjustments, including share-based compensation; the amortization of intangible assets, severance, exit costs and related charges; as well as the related tax impacts of these items; and certain discrete tax items. 
The assumptions underlying this full year fiscal '11 estimate include: Bookings growth in the high single digits compared to our prior expectation of mid to high single-digit growth; ESM license bookings growth in the high teens to low 20s compared to our prior expectation of high teens growth; MSM total bookings growth in the low single digits; total revenue growth in the mid single digits; at current rates, we do not expect currency to materially impact full year bookings or revenue growth rates; non-GAAP operating margin flat to the year-ago period; a license bookings deferral rate in the low 50% range; other income slightly down compared to a year ago; weighted shares outstanding slightly down compared to the prior year; and a non-GAAP tax rate of 24%.
We now expect full year fiscal 2011 cash flow from operations to be between $710 million and $760 million, an increase from our prior expectation of $675 million to $725 million. At the midpoint, this would represent a $100 million or 16% increase over last year.

And as we said in our prepared remarks, we had a $7 million loss associated with services. And I think it's really attributable to several things. A lot of that, given that, is the growing demand in our Professional Services business itself. And that demand, we supplemented that demand by having a bunch of what we call third-party contractors to help us fulfill that demand. I think what you should expect is over time is that business becomes more in line profitability-wise. So we'll continue to improve the profitability of that, as we kind of do not do what I would say is kind of double-dipping where we're using our own people and then subcontracting more, because I really do expect the BMC personnel to drive a lot of that and to have less reliance on the third-party contractors."

I think what's important for everybody on the phone to really pick up is the growth is there. And what we're really trying to do is to supplement that growth, which is fueling bookings growth. It's fueling the ESM license bookings growth. It's fueling ESM total bookings growth. And so this is something that I think we're all pretty excited about.

And so the upsell on these accounts is really exceptionally positive for us. But the expense is somewhat front-end-loaded. So the fact that our professional services group is growing, revenue grew 45% and bookings faster than that just required of us to make some investment in that group so that we can implement those systems and grow it. And if we keep winning these Cloud deals like we're winning, and I expect that we will, we plan on implementing them successfully to these customers. And we have to hire some people to do that."

I think, as Bob mentioned, we also have been highly successful in what we call our new product offerings. And that's either new products to existing customers or brand-new customers. And so that also would be treated in the license line. And then finally, when you think about our renewal opportunity, it was heavily back-end-loaded. So again, to remind everybody, as we had a pretty tough first half, the MSM business was actually down in the first half, roughly 17%.

I was in Europe last week with a large Central European manufacturer who, just this last quarter, standardized on our product line for managing their enterprise. They are highly, highly virtualized. I think they gave me the numbers. I want to say it was about 80% virtualized. And in the conversation, the reason they standardized on our products was to manage the entire environment, specifically the virtual environment. He did say in the meeting that he has no intention of acquiring his management environment from his virtualization vendor, because that would be, paraphrasing, this would be a very serious vendor lock-in strategy that he's not going to participate in. So he said he thinks it's centrally important that they have a management environment that is a heterogeneous company who doesn't lock them into one virtual machine. And he said that very explicitly. So in his case, I think that we won one of our larger deals last quarter for a customer that was buying our software, large, contract multiple products for specifically managing the virtual environment."

If you remember, our sales transformation began first in Europe. And Luca Lazzaron, who ran Europe for us, he moved over, if you remember, a year ago. He has been running worldwide sales now for the company for over a year, and we've put together three of the best quarters in our history. And so Luca is now reporting directly to me. He's in charge of the worldwide sales force for the second year. And he's continuing to evolve the sales organization as he did in Europe. Asia has been a relatively small but a very effective sales force for us. I mean, one of our wins, China Construction Bank, this quarter is one of multiple success we're having in China where we're getting great references in some of the largest, most well-established, recognized Chinese enterprises and agencies. So we're doing well there. Australia, we just won the NBN deal, the National Network for building the National Cloud System and Public Cloud for the Australian government. That was in cooperation Cisco. Then we won a large transaction there. And we've been ramping heads. We kind of ramped heads pretty well, pretty solidly over in Asia last year. And I think that's paid off for us. The team's on the ground there. It has been on the ground now for long enough to establish good customer relationships. And we're seeing that bear fruit. But I'd say, overall, the area that's -- well, we had a good quarter in federal this quarter. I think we're kind of keeping our fingers crossed and watching federal because all of us, I think, are unsure as to what the latest austerity measures might mean in the federal space. But we had a really solid quarter in federal. And part of the reason, I met with the CTO of a large government agency. He told me they've got a major austerity program. And that is why they standardized on our Cloud offering. So they standardized on our Cloud because of the costs. But I'm still a little cautious about federal. I want to see what happens there. We had a great team in federal. We just had a federal event with 1,000 customers signed up for our two-day there. But we just got to see what austerity measures would mean to federal."

So now, I think we've only been out a little while. We're basically seeing it double every quarter. Half of the SaaS business was Remedy OnDemand and half of it was RemedyForce, and here's what's exciting about that is its sales forces didn't -- this school year didn't start until February 1. And so they did not want to rock the boat and do anything heavy with their sales forces. Any company would not during the last month of their quarter. So after we announced our partnership on stage, DreamForce, the real incentives and the promotions and the sales execution engine that is now salesforce's eight Cloud, has not begun until two days ago. So it's about how we're getting good balance. So in the high end, Remedy OnDemand is doing very well competitively, we have some smaller SaaS competitors that had a free run for a while and win rates are good and getting better there. Now that we've got good references, it's really going to make a huge difference. And then we've got this monster sales organization of salesforce.com, who is about to launch on it with a product we're going to invest a lot of money in to make sure it's a strong product for them and us."

I'm pleased to report that BMC Software delivered a strong fiscal third quarter. We generated solid results across our key financial metrics, including total bookings, license bookings, revenue and cash flow from operations. We also enhanced our technology leadership, launching new products and solutions that position us more strongly than ever to capture the growing demand for cloud computing. 
With our strong bookings performance and with the visibility we have to our fiscal fourth quarter, we're raising our fiscal year 2011 expectations for certain key metrics, including total bookings and ESM license bookings and cash flow from operations.
Let's look more closely at our fiscal 2011 third quarter results compared to the year-ago period. Total bookings grew 10% to a company record of $594 million. License bookings grew 19% to $295 million. Revenue was up 6% to a company record of $540 million. Cash flow from operations increased 117% to $180 million. Non-GAAP diluted EPS increased 4% to $0.79 per diluted share. And our balance sheet remains strong with $1.6 billion in cash and investments and $1.8 billion in deferred revenue. 
That's a snapshot of our overall financial performance. But let me turn next to provide a brief overview of our ESM and MSM business units during the third quarter.
Our ESM business generated solid growth, with ESM license bookings increasing 8% to a company record of $163 million, off a challenging compare to the year-ago period. On a trailing 12-month basis ESM license bookings have increased 15% year-over-year, in line with our longer-term objective of mid-teens growth. 
We were pleased that performance was balanced across the product lines, with exceptionally strong performance in our automation products. We were also excited to see strong growth from EMEA and Asia-Pacific.
We also seeing a positive impact from our efforts to strengthen our ESM sales organization. During the quarter, the average number of productive sales reps increased from the prior year. And we are on track to achieve a 20% increase in the average productive sales headcount in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. 
Our execution regarding our BSM platform continues to trend higher, as evidenced by our continued ability to win large, multiproduct platform deals. During the third quarter, we had 30 ESM transactions with over $1 million in license bookings, up 11% from a year ago. More than 75% of these transactions were multiproduct license transactions. Major ESM wins during the third quarter included the United States Army, Capgemini, CSC, BBVA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Cisco Services, MetLife and BMW, to name a few. 
In addition to the impressive growth in the number of large deals, we also saw our average selling price continue to increase. Our MSM business also performed very well in the quarter with strength in new product sales and increased capacity upgrades. 
During the quarter, we expanded our relationships with existing customers with 65 new product placements. Some key MSM mainframe wins included Banco Bradesco, Bitmarck, Crédit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, National Australia Bank and WellPoint. In the quarter, we also saw strong double-digit growth in the annual run rate spend for our top 15 MSM deals, with 13 of the 15 transactions resulting in an increase in spend with BMC.
The mainframe continues to be the trusted platform for critical business transaction processing, as evidenced by our Fifth Annual Worldwide Survey of Mainframe Users and IBM's successful launch of its zEnterprise 196 system. According to our survey, 84% of respondents expected to see steady or growing MIPS usage on the platform. In addition, almost 60% of respondents indicated that the mainframe will attract new workloads over the next year. This year's survey results and the success of IBM's zEnterprise 196 confirm that our continued investment in the mainframe is the right direction.
Beyond on the core mainframe solutions, we also saw strength in our Workload Automation business. As we discussed at our recent Investor Day, Workload Automation is about 1/3 of our MSM business. During the third quarter, we saw strength in BMC's Control-M, our industry-leading enterprise workload automation solution. We added 21 new BMC Control-M customers and expanded our existing relationships with 55 new product placements. Some key MSM workload automation wins included Banco Santander,, China Construction Bank, Expedia, Imation, Logica, Waste Management and Woori Bank.
As we discussed at our recent Investor Day, one of the key drivers of our performance is enterprise adoption of cloud computing. Cloud computing gives enterprises a flexible IT infrastructure to deliver applications, while offering service providers a platform for new revenue streams. Properly managed clouds can dramatically reduce the time required to respond to changing business demands while reducing operational costs.
The key to successful cloud computing is service management. Fortunately, this directly aligns to our long-standing strategy for BSM, Business Service Management. Business Service Management really is the killer app for cloud computing. Our dynamic BSM platform supports public cloud, private cloud and hybrid environments with solutions for planning, deploying, operating and optimizing the cloud. 
Our leadership was validated by more than 20 significant Q3 wins for BMC's Cloud Lifecycle Management solution, including cloud wins at Accenture, Vodafone and MetLife. In response to this growing demand for cloud computing, we continued to invest in our product capabilities through internal development and through acquisitions and in our strategic alliances with other cloud computing leaders.
Our internal R&D efforts delivered new cloud relevant capabilities across our portfolio that further differentiated BMC. In January, we extended our Cloud Lifecycle Management solution to enable clients to customize their clouds using the first platform-agnostic solutions for delivering and governing internal and external Cloud services. We also launched BMC Control-M Self Service, the industry's first BSM self-service solution that empowers business users to work directly with the workload automation processes to power their business. 
In December, we announced the enhancement of our Proactive Operations solutions, which integrates planning, predictive analytics and preventive automation to improve availability and performance in physical, virtual and cloud infrastructures. We also extended our BMC Control-M workload automation solution with new capabilities for Informatica and SAP BusinessObjects.  We also released our latest BMC Atrium Discovery and Dependency Mapping solution that combines the depth of Tideway's best-of-breed discovery capabilities that we acquired one year ago with the breadth of our existing Atrium solutions. 
In addition to investing in our own R&D efforts, we also expanded our capabilities by investing in companies that enhance and easily integrate into our BSM platform. In December, we acquired GridApp Systems, the privately held industry leader in automating heterogeneous database provisioning, patching and administration. 
And as we mentioned during last quarter's call, in October, we acquired the software business of Neptuny, a European-based capacity management and IT performance optimization solution. The addition of Neptuny's technology extends BMC's existing leadership in physical and virtual capacity management. 
During the third quarter, we built upon our strong network of strategic partner relationships in strengthening our sales footprint, our service capabilities and our portfolio of solutions. Our expanding partnerships with salesforce.com, Cisco and Accenture underscore the strength of BMC's competitive advantages in the IT management software business. We started working with salesforce.com, the market leader in business applications delivered from the cloud, last year, with the release of BMC  ServiceDesk on Force.com. 
This December, our two companies escalated our partnership with the announcement of RemedyForce, salesforce.com's eighth and newest cloud offering that combines BMC's market-leading ITSM solutions with salesforce.com's leading enterprise cloud computing platform. This is the best of both worlds. Cutting-edge delivery of proven solutions that provide businesses a simple and fast path to better IT service management. It is also significant that RemedyForce will be sold and marketed as a salesforce.com product in addition to being sold by BMC. 
Our most recent alliance with Cisco targets a very different but equally significant market opportunity, new solutions for large-scale, multi-tenant cloud computing infrastructures. We're already delivering the first product of this alliance, a new Integrated Cloud Delivery Platform that combines both companies' technologies. The Integrated Cloud Delivery Platform enables enterprises and service providers to build and operate large-scale infrastructures that make mission-critical cloud services a reality. Some of our most significant cloud wins for the third quarter included this new solution and were sold in partnership with Cisco.
During the third quarter, we also announced the expansion of a long-standing relationship with Accenture. The two companies will jointly develop, market and implement packaged and custom BSM solutions, all built on BMC's BSM platform. Our platform approach enables customers to extract maximum return on their IT investments, as they take advantage of virtualization, cloud computing, Software-as-a-Service and other new technologies. In addition, BMC will leverage Accenture technology professionals to increase the capacity of our delivery and implementation capabilities with a dedicated Accenture team, providing consulting and integration services to BMC's professional services organization. 
Our cloud strategy and solutions underscore our leadership in helping enterprises improve the way they manage IT. This has been demonstrated not only by our growth in bookings and revenues, but also by the recognition we continue to win among industry analysts. For example, we are happy to note that Gartner positioned us in the Leaders Quadrant of their recent report, Magic Quadrant for IT Service Desk. Please download and read this important document. We feel this affirms what we already knew, that our ServiceDesk solutions are the industry's most comprehensive. It also shows that the market is responding positively to RemedyForce and Remedy OnDemand, the Software-as-a-Service ServiceDesk solution we launched earlier this year. 
Gartner also positioned us once again in the Leaders Quadrant of their December 13 report, Magic Quadrant for IT Event Correlation and Analysis 2010, which is available also on our corporate website. We believe this shows that we differentiated ourselves from the competition with our complete vision for event correlation and analysis.
Looking forward, we are encouraged by the number of analysts that expect enterprise software spending to show solid growth in calendar year 2011. A number of independent research studies such as a recent one by Gartner, indicate that IT operations management will be among the areas showing the most growth. Research like this confirms the positive trends we're seeing in the marketplace, which, combined with the visibility we have into the fiscal fourth quarter, supports us in raising our guidance for total bookings, ESM license bookings and cash flow from operations for the current fiscal year. These are among the many factors that make us confident about our future prospects.
In summary, let me underscore that our strategy of growth and investment is working very well and generating attractive returns. Our service automation, Software-as-a-Service and cloud solutions all continue to show strong increases in customer demand. Our partnerships are enabling us to expand the market opportunities we enjoy. At the same time, we remain committed to our ongoing strategy of optimizing efficiency, productivity and operating leverage to improve profitability.
Before I turn the call over to Steve Solcher for more details in our financials, I would first like to update you on a management change. As you saw in our earnings release earlier today, John McMahon will be taking a new role with the company, effective April 1, when we enter our new fiscal year. We told you last year how John was focused on building the ESM sales and services organization into competitive differentiators for BMC. The result of his efforts speak for themselves and are reflected in our earnings results we're announcing today and in prior quarters since he took a senior leadership role at BMC.  John has been instrumental in shaping our ESM sales force and services organization, and we're now asking him to help us across both business units. 
In April, John will move to Ken Berryman's Strategy and Corporate Development organization, where he will focus on new go-to-market initiatives for all of BMC, helping us develop new sales and distribution models to serve us, as we continue to grow organically and via acquisitions. John has built a strong and impressive leadership team in his tenure as SVP of Worldwide Sales and Services and will continue to rely on those key leaders, notably, Luca Lazzaron and Vance Loiselle will continue to run ESM sales and services organizations respectively, as they have over this past year. 
And now here's Steve to provide you more insight into our financial results during the third quarter."

As Bob mentioned earlier our third quarter was a quarter of strong top line results. Our bookings results were balanced with strong performance across both our ESM and MSM business units as well as across our major product lines and major geographies. We continue to make focused investments in R&D, sales and services in order to capitalize on our leadership position in these fast-growing markets. We remain disciplined in our approach of balancing additional investments along with improved profitability.
Our bookings momentum through the first nine months of our fiscal year and our outlook for the fourth quarter, position us well to deliver strong fiscal year results across key financial metrics, including total bookings, ESM license bookings, non-GAAP diluted EPS and cash flow from operations. With that let me now turn to our results for the third quarter.
In the third quarter, non-GAAP operating income decreased 2% to $188 million from $191 million in the third quarter of last year. Non-GAAP operating margin declined three points to 35%. Third quarter non-GAAP operating margin was negatively impacted by the loss associated with our Professional Services business, the slight dilution related to two acquisitions that we completed in the third quarter and an unexpected $3 million expense related to a legal case. Please refer to Slide 5 for highlights of our ESM and MSM business unit operating results.
ESM's non-GAAP operating income in the third quarter decreased 7% to $72 million. ESM's operating margin was 21%, four points lower than the year-ago quarter. This decline was primarily driven by the loss in our Professional Services business. 
MSM's non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter increased by 2% to $116 million. MSM's non-GAAP operating margin was 57%, flat with the year-ago quarter. 
Non-GAAP net earnings for the third quarter were $143 million, an increase of 1% from the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.79, up 4% from the year-ago quarter. This reflects a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 24% for the quarter. 
GAAP operating income in the third quarter was $139 million compared to $148 million in the year-ago quarter. GAAP net earnings and diluted EPS were $109 million and $0.60 compared to $111 million and $0.59 in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. These results reflect diluted shares outstanding in the third quarter of $182 million compared to $187 million in the year-ago quarter.
Turning now to bookings. In the third quarter, total bookings of $594 million were up 10% as reported and 12% on a constant-currency basis compared to the year-ago quarter. Total license bookings for the quarter increased 19% as reported and 20% on a constant-currency basis to $295 million as compared to the year-ago quarter. 
Total bookings on a trailing 12-month basis were $2.1 billion, up 10% compared to the year-ago quarter. The weighted average contract length for total bookings on a trailing 12-month basis was 2.17 years, flat with the year-ago quarter. After normalizing for contract length, trailing 12-month annualized bookings for the third quarter were $958 million, up 10% from the year-ago quarter and up three percentage points from the second quarter. Please see Slide 7 in our presentation. 
From the geographic perspective, we have particularly strong bookings growth in Europe and Asia, across both our ESM and MSM businesses.
Now let me turn to bookings performance of each of our business units. For ESM business unit, license bookings are the best measure of performance. We generated strong growth in our ESM business with ESM license bookings at $163 million in the third quarter, up 8% from the year-ago quarter.  For the first three quarters of fiscal 2011, ESM license bookings are up 23% compared to the year-ago period. 
We closed 30 ESM license transactions over $1 million in the third quarter, up 11% compared to the year ago. Of the license transactions over $1 million, 23 included multiple product lines. The momentum in our service automation discipline continued in the third quarter, as service automation license bookings are up 59% for the first nine months. The number of productive ESM sales headcount is tracking to plan. And we continue to expect average productive sales headcount to increase by 20% for the fiscal year.
Turning to the MSM business. We believe MSM is best evaluated on the basis of total and annualized bookings over the trailing 12 months. In the third quarter, total MSM bookings on a trailing 12-month basis decreased 5% to $761 million compared to the year-ago quarter and had an average contract length of 2.88 years. After normalizing for contract length, total annualized MSM bookings for the trailing 12 months were $264 million, an increase of 1% compared to the year-ago quarter. 
We are encouraged that capacity upgrades in our MSM business returned to more historical levels in the third quarter, which contrasts with the low level of capacity upgrades in the first half of our fiscal year. We are also pleased that we had strong growth in new MSM business, which includes attracting new customers and selling additional products to existing customers.
Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the quarter was $540 million, up 6% as reported and 7% on a constant-currency basis from the third quarter of fiscal 2010. ESM's total revenue was up 8% to $335 million, and MSM's total revenue was up 3% to $205 million. 
License revenue in the third quarter was $235 million, an increase of 9% from the year-ago quarter. ESM's license revenue was $149 million, up 9% from the year-ago quarter. MSM license revenue increased by 8% to $86 million from the year-ago quarter.
During the third quarter, the percentage of license bookings that was deferred was 54% versus 55% in the year-ago quarter. For the third quarter, maintenance revenue was $259 million, flat with the year-ago quarter but up $7 million sequentially. I am pleased with the sequential improvement in maintenance revenue in both our ESM and MSM businesses. Our renewal rates remain stable. And our license bookings strength over the last several quarters is starting to positively impact maintenance revenue trends. 
ESM's maintenance revenue was $140 million, flat compared to the year-ago quarter and up $4 million sequentially. MSM maintenance revenue was $119 million, also flat compared to the year ago and up $3 million sequentially. 
Professional Services revenue, which is included in our ESM business unit, increased by 45% from the year-ago quarter to $46 million. Our Professional Services business generated a non-GAAP operating loss of $7 million compared to a $2 million loss in the year-ago period.
Moving next to operating expenses. During the third quarter, non-GAAP operating expenses were $352 million, up 11% from $317 million in the year-ago quarter. This increase was driven primarily by a $20 million increase in expenses related to our Professional Services business, driven in part by higher third-party subcontracting costs. In addition, this increase reflects the continued focus investments we have made in our ESM business, the impact of our recent acquisitions of Neptuny and GridApp and an unexpected $3 million legal expense. 
Looking at our business units, ESM's non-GAAP operating expenses were $263 million, an increase of 13% compared to the year-ago quarter. MSM's non-GAAP operating expenses were $89 million, an increase of 5% from the year-ago quarter. 
As a result of our current business momentum and improving market opportunity, we believe it is prudent that we remain focused on making investments in ESM in order to capitalize on our strong leadership position in this market. These investments include enhancing our cloud and SaaS offerings, supporting our strategic alliances, increasing sales headcount and strengthening our services organization. Other income in the third quarter was $2 million compared to a $1 million loss in the year-ago quarter.
Now turning to the balance sheet. Total deferred license revenue at the end of the third quarter was $661 million, a company record, and up $60 million sequentially from $601 million. During the quarter, we deferred $160 million of license revenue or 54% of license bookings and recognized $100 million of deferred license revenue from the balance sheet. Total deferred revenue increased by $54 million sequentially to $1.8 billion. The current portion of deferred revenue now stands at 54% of total deferred revenue.
Software development costs on the balance sheet were $185 million as we capitalized $33 million and amortized $19 million during the quarter. Capitalization of software development costs was slightly higher sequentially due to the timing of our development efforts around several products. Given the timing of development efforts and release dates of new products, we expect capitalization of software development costs to decline sequentially in the fourth quarter. 
Cash and investments at the end of the quarter totaled $1.6 billion, up $72 million sequentially. Our net cash position was $1.3 billion. 
For the quarter, cash flow from operations was $180 million, up 117% from $83 million in the year-ago quarter. For the first three quarters, cash flow from operations has now increased by 43% to $475 million.
During the quarter, we remain committed to share repurchases. We repurchased 1.7 million shares for a total of $75 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $771 million remaining in our current share repurchase program. Given our revised outlook for cash flow from operations, our strong cash balance and current market conditions, we expect to increase the pace of share repurchase in the fourth quarter.
So let me briefly sum up the quarter. We are pleased with our solid execution and performance across both of our business units during the quarter. Our strong competitive position, focused investment in key growth areas and commitment to generating growth and improving profitability position us well to achieve both our short-term and long-term goals. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob to discuss our revised expectations for the year and his concluding remarks."

The improving economic outlook has created an appetite within businesses for new technologies like cloud computing that leverage IT investments of the past to support innovation, faster responsiveness to changing business needs and efficiency. Our commitment to providing a path to the future that does not rule out the past has contributed to yet another strong period of financial performance for BMC. 
Given our strong bookings performance in the third quarter and our visibility into the fourth fiscal quarter, we are raising our fiscal year 2011 expectations for certain key metrics, including total bookings, ESM license bookings and cash flow from operations. 
We are reiterating our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share expectation in the range of $2.92 to $3.02. At the midpoint, this would represent a 12% increase over last year.
Our non-GAAP diluted EPS estimate excludes an estimated range of $0.43 to $0.48 per diluted share for non-GAAP adjustments, including share-based compensation; the amortization of intangible assets, severance, exit costs and related charges; as well as the related tax impacts of these items; and certain discrete tax items. 
The assumptions underlying this full year fiscal 2011 estimate include: Bookings growth in the high single digits compared to our prior expectation of mid to high single-digit growth; ESM license bookings growth in the high teens to low 20s compared to our prior expectation of high teens growth; MSM total bookings growth in the low single digits; total revenue growth in the mid single digits; at current rates, we do not expect currency to materially impact full year bookings or revenue growth rates; non-GAAP operating margin flat to the year-ago period; a license bookings deferral rate in the low 50% range; other income slightly down compared to a year ago; weighted shares outstanding slightly down compared to the prior year; and a non-GAAP tax rate of 24%.
We now expect full year fiscal 2011 cash flow from operations to be between $710 million and $760 million, an increase from our prior expectation of $675 million to $725 million. At the midpoint, this would represent a $100 million or 16% increase over last year.

And as we said in our prepared remarks, we had a $7 million loss associated with services. And I think it's really attributable to several things. A lot of that, given that, is the growing demand in our Professional Services business itself. And that demand, we supplemented that demand by hiring a bunch of what we call third-party contractors to help us fulfill that demand. I think what you should expect is over time is that business becomes more in line profitability-wise. So we'll continue to improve the profitability of that, as we kind of do not do what I would say is kind of double-dipping where we're using our own people and then subcontracting more, because I really do expect the BMC personnel to drive a lot of that and to have less reliance on the third-party contractors."

It's fueling the ESM license bookings growth. It's fueling ESM total bookings growth. And so this is something that I think we're all pretty excited about.

And so the upsell on these accounts is really exceptionally positive for us. But the expense is somewhat front-end-loaded. So the fact that our professional services group is growing, revenue grew 45% and bookings faster than that just required of us to make some investment in that group so that we can implement those systems and grow it. And if we keep winning these Cloud deals like we're winning, and I expect that we will, we plan on implementing them successfully to these customers. And we have to hire some people to do that."

I think, as Bob mentioned, we also have been highly successful in what we call our new product offerings. And that's either new products to existing customers or brand-new customers. And so that also would be treated in the license line. And then finally, when you think about our renewal opportunity, it was heavily back-end-loaded. So again, to remind everybody, as we had a pretty tough first half, the MSM business was actually down in the first half, roughly 17%. And we're looking at the second half being almost a mirror of that, the flip side of that, so really nice renewal opportunity in the second half of the year.

I was in Europe last week with a large Central European manufacturer who, just this last quarter, standardized on our product line for managing their enterprise. They are highly, highly virtualized. I think they gave me the numbers. I want to say it was about 80% virtualized. And in the conversation, the reason they standardized on our products was to manage the entire environment, specifically the virtual environment. He did say in the meeting that he has no intention of acquiring his management environment from his virtualization vendor, because that would be, paraphrasing, this would be a very serious vendor lock-in strategy that he's not going to participate in. So he said he thinks it's centrally important that they have a management environment that is a heterogeneous company who doesn't lock them into one virtual machine. And he said that very explicitly. So in his case, I think that we won one of our larger deals last quarter for a customer that was buying our software, large, contract multiple products for specifically managing the virtual environment."

If you remember, our sales transformation began first in Europe. And Luca Lazzaron, who ran Europe for us, he moved over, if you remember, a year ago. He has been running worldwide sales now for the company for over a year, and we've put together three of the best quarters in our history. And so Luca is now reporting directly to me. He's in charge of the entire worldwide sales force for the second year. And he's continuing to evolve the sales organization as he did in Europe. Asia has been a relatively small but a very effective sales force for us. I mean, one of our wins, China Construction Bank, this quarter is one of multiple successes we're having in China where we're getting great references in some of the largest, most well-established, recognized Chinese enterprises and agencies. So we're doing well there. Australia, we just won the NBN deal, the National Network for building the National Cloud System and Public Cloud for the Australian government. That was in cooperation Cisco. Then we won a large transaction there. And we've been ramping heads. We kind of ramped heads pretty well, pretty solidly over in Asia last year. And I think that's paid off for us. The team's on the ground there. It has been on the ground now for long enough to establish good customer relationships. And we're seeing that bear fruit. But I'd say, overall, the area that's -- well, we had a good quarter in federal this quarter. I think we're kind of keeping our fingers crossed and watching federal because all of us, I think, are unsure as to what the latest austerity measures might mean in the federal space. But we had a really solid quarter in federal. And part of the reason, I met with the CTO of a large government agency. He told me they've got a major austerity program. And that is why they standardized on our Cloud offering. So they standardized on our Cloud because of the costs. But I'm still a little cautious about federal. I want to see what happens there. We had a great team in federal. We just had a federal event with 1,000 customers signed up for our two-day there. But we just got to see what austerity measures would mean to federal."

So now, I think we've only been out a little while. We're basically seeing it double every quarter. Half of the SaaS business was Remedy OnDemand and half of it was RemedyForce, and here's what's exciting about that is its sales forces didn't -- fiscal year didn't start until February 1. And so they did not want to rock the boat and do anything heavy with their sales forces. Any company would not during the last month of their quarter. So after we announced our partnership on stage, DreamForce, the real incentives and the promotions and the sales execution engine that is now salesforce's eight Cloud, has not begun until two days ago. So it's about how we're getting good balance. So in the high end, Remedy OnDemand is doing very well competitively, we have some smaller SaaS competitors that had a free run for a while and win rates are good and getting better there. Now that we've got good references, it's really going to make a huge difference. And then we've got this monster sales organization of salesforce.com, who is about to launch on it with a product we're going to invest a lot of money in to make sure it's a strong product for them and us."

As you've seen from our earnings release, fiscal 2011 was another year of strong improvements in bookings, revenue, cash flow and earnings. Total bookings rose 13%. License bookin",1996,"Thank you, Derrick, and thanks to all of you for joining us this afternoon. As you've seen from our earnings release, fiscal 2011 was another year of strong improvements in bookings, revenue, cash flow and earnings. Total bookings rose 13%. License bookings were up 20%. ESM license bookings were up 21%. MSM total bookings were up 4%. Revenue grew 8%. GAAP diluted EPS rose 15%. Non-GAAP operating income increased 9%. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was up 12% and operating cash flow was up 20%.
I am proud to say that for the year, we delivered on or exceeded our expectations for total company bookings, ESM license bookings, MSM total bookings, revenue, operating cash flow and non-GAAP diluted EPS. And in fact, we generated record levels of performance in each of these metrics. The strong results underscore the success of our strategy over the last several years to make disciplined investments that enhance our market leadership and enable us to accelerate top line growth. 
As part of this strategy, we strengthened our sales force, increased internal R&D efforts related to cloud and other major technology trends, selectively acquired complementary technologies in rapidly growing market segments and bolstered our strategic partnerships. These initiatives are clearly paying off and we expect to reap additional benefits in 2012 and beyond.
Let me turn next to our fourth quarter performance, which enabled us to end fiscal 2011 on a very strong note. Total bookings for the quarter were up 21%. License bookings rose 16%. Revenue increased 14%. GAAP operating income was up 23%, and non-GAAP diluted EPS was up 20%. For both the full year and the fourth quarter, we continued to see very good performance across both of our business units, all key product lines and all major geographies. 
ESM license bookings were up 21% for the year and 18% for the fourth quarter. Our ESM growth reflects, in part, our success in strengthening our ESM sales organization. We met our fiscal 2011 goal to achieve a 20% increase in the average productive sales headcount compared to the prior year. I'm also pleased that we saw a significant decline in attrition rates in our ESM sales organization during the fiscal 2011 compared to a year ago, and we are expecting further declines in attrition rates in fiscal 2012. That's one reason we continue to win a greater number of larger, multidisciplined platform deals. 
The number of ESM license transactions over $1 million increased 36% for the year and 55% for the quarter. This dynamic is also creating opportunities for our professional services team, which we increasingly capitalized on during fiscal 2011. Professional services revenue rose 51% for the quarter and 37% for the full year. The number of midsized deals, which demonstrates how we are increasing our footprint, also increased. Transactions between $500,000 and $1 million were up 10% and 6% for the year and quarter, respectively. Key wins during the quarter, include Harris Corporation, Unisys and FINRA, the U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. These were all multidisciplined platform wins. 
Our MSM business continues to perform very well, with strong double-digit growth in the annual spend rate of our top 15 MSM transactions in Q4. The growth was broad-based, with 13 of the top 15 customers increasing their annual spend with MSM. In fact, the growth in the annual spend rate of MSM's top 15 transactions were strong for the full fiscal year. Over the year, we grew the spend rate on our top 15 MSM transactions each quarter in the mid-teens. We also saw continued strength in new product sales and growth in capacity upgrades. The increase in annual spend rate for these larger transactions reflects our success in managing and expanding our relationships with MSM's customers. Some of this is due to our increased focus and our success on winning competitive replacements, as well as expanding our customer use of products that help drive efficiency and IT operations. During the quarter, we added 122 new product placements in our existing install base. And over the course of fiscal 2011, we added a total of over 350 new product placements to existing customers. Some key mainframe customer wins in Q4 included Bank of America and Nationwide Insurance. 
As you know, workload automation, which includes our BMC Control-M product line, is about 1/3 of our MSM business. We continue to see strength in this business, with Control-M bookings growth in the mid-single digits during fiscal 2011. Over the past year, we added 88 new BMC Control-M customers and expanded our existing relationships with 195 new product placements. This includes 33 new customers and 66 new product placements in the fourth quarter. Some key workload automation wins in the fourth quarter included the Social Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service. So that's a snapshot of our business unit's performance in the quarter and the year. 
Now let's talk about the dynamics of our market. One of the most important solutions IT can offer is to develop a flexible infrastructure, one that provides the right type and level of services at the right cost. In fact, it's interesting to note that in a recent Gartner webinar titled, Reimagining IT, the 2011 CIO Agenda, that Mark MacDonald delivered on March 16th, global CIOs were asked what their top 3 strategies were for 2011. Number one on that list for the first time was, developing and managing a flexible IT infrastructure. In one's years time, it jumped from eighth on the list to the #1 spot. The reasons for this are clear. In a competitive global business environment, IT needs to be structured, managed, staffed and deployed as a service, a service that business managers can leverage to achieve their goals and objectives. 
That's exactly what BMC does. BMC is in the business of building agile, flexible IT infrastructures. We allow IT to offer a service platform that enables enterprises to align and manage their technology resources more quickly, efficiently and productively. Furthermore with our platform, the underlying resources to deliver the services can be dynamically brokered, further driving down the total costs of their services. The evolution in growth of cloud computing is one very visible manifestation of the drive for a more flexible IT infrastructure. As you know, clouds offer a way to significantly increased flexibility while containing or even reducing costs. And as you also know, BMC helps to build and manage clouds for enterprises, governments and service providers. 
Our leadership in building and managing practical and robust private, public and hybrid clouds is evident in the growing number of cloud-related deals that we've won. Over the course of fiscal 2011, we have nearly 50 cloud solution wins. These wins include global Fortune 2000 companies, such as AXA and Pfizer, as well as many of the world's largest telcos and service providers. Our continuing success in the marketplace reflects the strong commitment we're making to enhance our technology leadership and product capabilities. 
During the past year, we introduced a new Cloud Lifecycle Management solution as well as new BMC Control-M self service solutions. Both of these products were developed by our in-house R&D teams and they are 2 of the most successful products launched in our company's recent history. We're very happy with the success of our organic R&D innovation, and it will remain a key focus for us as it provides us with a clear competitive advantage.
another competitive advantage is our ability to acquire and integrate complementary technologies. After the close of the fourth quarter, we announced the purchase of Coradiant. This deal represents a major step forward and makes us a clear leader in next generation applications performance management. Coradiant provides us with state-of-the-art end-user experience monitoring for enterprise, SaaS and cloud-based applications. 
During fiscal year 2011, we acquired 2 businesses that support our technology strategy. The first, systems, focuses on automating database provisioning across operating systems. The second, the software business of Neptuny, extended BMC's existing leadership in physical and virtual capacity management. These 2 transactions, like others that we have made recently, are performing very well. 
While our success in helping customers build and manage clouds demonstrates one important way we're helping drive a more flexible infrastructure, it's equally important to remember that there are other ways. This includes our Software-as-a-Service offerings. Remedy OnDemand enables customers to access our full ITIL based industry suite of service desk offerings. Our RemedyForce offering, which is marketed and sold by both salesforce.com and directly by BMC, is a powerful easy-to-use solution for customers looking for service desks that's built on top of the sales force platform, Force.com. 
You'll remember that just one year ago back in fiscal 2010 fourth quarter, we launched our initial SaaS offering. In the past year, we have generated really SaaS 100,000 wins from both Remedy OnDemand and RemedyForce offerings. 34 of these wins were in the fourth quarter alone, demonstrating accelerating momentum on both offerings. New SaaS wins in the quarter include Source Buyer and the Texas Department of State Health Services. 
Our partner ecosystem continues to expand and deliver value to our customers and our shareholders. The strategic alliance with Cisco on their Integrated Cloud Delivery Platform is an example of our partner strategy at work. This alliance is focused on enabling service providers to develop flexible infrastructure and cloud offerings for their customers. BMC technology is at the heart of this platform, and we're very pleased with its reception in the marketplace.
There are other examples with how we are working to enable enterprises to develop a more flexible infrastructure. Our portfolio and heterogeneous approach to IT management naturally aligns us with the global partner community ranging from Accenture to CSC to Dell to Wipro. Just today, we announced an expanded partnership with Red Hat to deliver a joint offering coupling Red Hat's virtualization and cloud platforms with BMC's Cloud Lifecycle Management suite. These alliances create powerful, practical, complete offerings for our customers, and they enable our partners to offer managed services to their customers to build clouds for their own use and to resell our professional services and technology. Our focus here and across the board is enabling our customers to optimize their IT investments by leveraging new ways of doing business, virtualization, cloud computing, Software-as-a-Service, mobility and other technologies that increase speed, responsiveness, efficiency and productivity of their business.
As we move through fiscal 2012, the demand from enterprises for a more flexible IT infrastructure remains strong. We're seeing across geographic regions and industry segments. Or also seeing it across larger and smaller enterprises. We believe this demand will fundamentally transform IT management in the years ahead. 
As I've noted, we're very well positioned amidst this change to capture the market opportunities that line ahead. From a financial standpoint, we have a healthy, growing stream of bookings, revenue, cash flow and earnings as well as a very strong balance sheet. From a technology standpoint, we have the highest performance and best integrated portfolio of IT management solutions. We're making smart investment in both internal development and external acquisitions to maintain and grow our competitive edge. From a sales and marketing standpoint, we have a strong and growing footprint that enables us to reach an increasing number of customers around the world. And from a management standpoint, we have a clearly defined strategy for success and the commitment and expertise required to execute on it.
All of these factors make us quite optimistic about fiscal 2012, which we enter with great momentum. As we move forward, I believe we will look back on the year we just closed as a pivotal year, a year when the company transitioned from being a strong moderate-growth company to one characterized by sustained accelerating growth, led by a solid ESM engine capable of delivering ongoing double-digit growth. I'll have more to say on our expectations for fiscal 2012 in a few minutes. But first, Steve Solcher will provide you with a more detailed financial review."

I would like to start by adding to Bob's comments about our performance for the year. First as you know, we met or exceeded our fiscal 2011 expectations in terms of total bookings, ESM license bookings, MSM total bookings, revenues, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and cash flow from operations. In fact, each of these reached record levels in fiscal 2011. We also had strong double-digit growth for the year in total bookings, ESM license bookings, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and cash flow from operations.
Second, during fiscal 2011, we demonstrated our ability to grow earnings and cash flow from operations, while at the same time making the investments in internal development, sales and services necessary to maintain and build our competitive advantage. These investments reflect our view that there are substantial market opportunities ahead and our desire to ensure that we are properly positioned to capture them. 
With that, let me review our financial results for the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year in more detail.  Non-GAAP operating income increased 23% from $161 million to $197 million in the fourth quarter compared to the year-ago period. Our fourth quarter non-GAAP operating margin was 35%, up 2 points from the year-ago quarter. For the full year, we achieved non-GAAP operating income of $733 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin for fiscal 2011 was 35%, the same as in fiscal year 2010. Please refer to Slide 5 for selected non-GAAP financial information, which includes segment operating margin of our ESM and MSM business units.
ESM's non-GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter increased to $67 million, up 32% from the year-ago period. ESM's non-GAAP operating margin increased year-over-year by 2 percentage points to 19%. For the full fiscal year, ESM's non-GAAP operating income increased by 17% to $280 million. ESM's non-GAAP operating margin increased by 1 percentage point in fiscal year 2011 to 22%. As we've noted, we plan to continue to make investments in our ESM businesses as we look to expand our growth opportunities while continuing to deliver increased earnings.
MSM's non-GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter was $130 million, up 18% from the year-ago period and its non-GAAP operating margin increased 5 percentage points to 61%. For the full year, MSM's non-GAAP operating income was $453 million, up 4% and its non-GAAP operating margin was 58%, up 1 percentage point compared to the year ago. We remain focused on maintaining strong operating margins within our MSM business unit.
Our non-GAAP net earnings for the fourth quarter were $141 million, up 17% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.78, which reflects a non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter of 29%. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was higher than previous quarters and was higher than our full year expectation due to the change in the geographic mix of profits. This higher-than-expected non-GAAP tax rate in the fourth quarter negatively impacted our non-GAAP results by $0.05 in the quarter. 
For fiscal 2011, non-GAAP net earnings were $546 million, an increase of 10% compared to $496 million in fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the year was a company record at $2.99, up 12% compared to the prior year. This reflects a non-GAAP effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 of 25%. These non-GAAP results reflect diluted shares outstanding for both the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year of 182 million versus 186 million and 187 million in the respective year-ago periods.
GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter was $142 million compared to $116 million in the year-ago period. GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share were $123 million and $0.67 compared to $119 million and $0.64 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, respectively. GAAP operating income in fiscal 2011 was $533 million compared with $506 million in fiscal 2010. GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year were $456 million and $2.50 per diluted share versus $406 million and $2.17 per diluted share in 2010.
Fourth quarter and full fiscal year GAAP net earnings were positively impacted by a net income tax benefit of $25 million and $57 million, respectively, in connection with tax authority settlements related to prior year's tax matters. These tax benefits were excluded from our non-GAAP results.
Turning now to bookings. Total bookings for the fourth quarter were $708 million, representing an increase of 21% compared to the year-ago period. On a constant-currency basis, fourth quarter bookings increased to 18%. Total bookings for fiscal 2011 were a company record $2.2 billion, up $251 million or 13% as reported and on a constant-currency basis compared to fiscal 2010. The weighted average contract length for total bookings on a trailing 12-month basis was 2.17 years, up 2% from 2.12 years in the year-ago period. After normalizing for contract length, trailing 12-month annualized bookings for the fourth quarter were $1 billion, up 10% for the year-ago period. Please refer to Slide 7 in our presentation. 
Now let me turn to the performance of each of our business units. Total ESM license bookings were $162 million in the fourth quarter, up 18% from the year-ago period. For fiscal 2011, total ESM license bookings were $571 million, up 21% from fiscal 2010. Our performance was balanced across each of our product disciplines with growth and license bookings ranging from 15% to 35%. 
Turning to the MSM business unit. We believe MSM is best evaluated on the basis of total and annualized bookings over their trailing 12 months. Total MSM bookings for fiscal 2011 increased 4% to $843 million and had an average contract length of 2.9 years. After normalizing for contract length, total annualized MSM bookings for the trailing 12 months were $290 million, up 4%.
Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the quarter was $562 million, a 14% increase on both a reported and constant-currency basis compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. ESM and MSM total revenue for the quarter increased 18% and 9%, respectively compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Total revenue for the year was a company record at $2.1 billion, increasing 8% on a reported and constant-currency basis. ESM and MSM total revenue for the year increased 12% and 2%, respectively compared to fiscal 2010. License revenue in the fourth quarter was $251 million, up 24% from a year ago. ESM license revenue was $158 million, up 27%, while MSM license revenue was $93 million, up 20% from last year. For fiscal 2011, license revenue rose 14% to $865 million. 
For the fourth quarter, maintenance revenue was $259 million, an increase of 1% compared to a year ago. ESM maintenance revenue was $138 million, up 1% and MSM maintenance revenue was $121 million, up 2% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. For fiscal 2011, maintenance revenue was flat at $1 billion. 
Professional services revenue, which is included in the ESM segment, grew 51% from the year-ago period to $53 million in the fourth quarter. Professional services revenue in fiscal 2011 increased by 37% to $177 million. The growth in our professional services business underscores our involvement in new cloud initiatives and the opportunities for continued license bookings growth, as enterprises move from proof of concept to fully-deployed cloud solutions in their data centers.
Moving next to operating expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $365 million, up 10% from the year-ago period. The fourth quarter's sequential increase in non-GAAP operating expenses reflects our typical seasonality. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the year were up 8% from the previous year. 
Looking at our business units, ESM non-GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $282 million compared to $245 million in the year-ago quarter. MSM non-GAAP operating expenses were $83 million compared to $85 million in the year-ago quarter.  For fiscal 2011, ESM non-GAAP operating expenses were $1 billion compared to $902 million in fiscal 2010. MSM non-GAAP operating expenses were $334 million compared to $335 million in the previous year. 
Other income in the fourth quarter was $2 million, up 5% from the year-ago quarter. For the full fiscal year, other income was a loss of approximately $2 million, the same as in fiscal 2010. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. Total deferred license revenue at the end of the fourth quarter was a company record $686 million, up 4% sequentially and 10% year-over-year. During the quarter, we deferred $128 million of license revenue or 46% of license bookings and recorded $104 million of deferred license revenue from the balance sheet. Total deferred revenue increased by $146 million sequentially to $2 billion. The current portion of deferred revenue now stands at 53%. 
Our software development costs as of March 31 were $194 million, as we capitalized $29 million and amortized, $21 million during the quarter. For the fiscal year, we capitalized $123 million of software development costs and amortized $75 million. We expect gross capitalized software development costs to remain flat for fiscal 2012. While we expect the amortization of such costs to increase by approximately $20 million, these estimates are incorporated into our 2012 expectations.
Cash and investments at March 31 totaled $1.8 billion, an increase of $156 million sequentially. Our net cash position was $1.4 billion at March 31, 2011. For the quarter, cash flow from operations was $219 million. For fiscal 2011, cash flow from operations was a company record $765 million, up 20% from the prior year. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.9 million shares of our stock for a total cost of $140 million. For fiscal 2011, we repurchased 10.6 million shares at a cost of $439 million. We have 631 million remaining in our current share repurchase program as of March 31.
Let me summarize by saying that fiscal 2011 was a year of significant achievement for BMC. We achieved record levels of bookings, revenues, non-GAAP earnings and cash flow from operations. We enhanced our technology leadership and product portfolio through both internal development and selected strategic acquisitions. We strengthened our sales force, partnerships and alliances to reach more customers in more ways. All of these factors position us well in fiscal 2012. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for his concluding remarks and expectations for fiscal 2012."

As we have noted, fiscal 2012 is shaping up to be another year in which we expect to significantly increase shareholder value by driving increases in bookings, revenue, earnings and cash flow from operations. All the key factors are in place. The global economy is showing signs of improvement. Customer demand for agile, flexible IT infrastructures is strong, and we enjoy a leading position in our markets.
To capitalize on our recent success and to continue to position us well for the future, we are continuing to make strategic investments in growth opportunities. These key strategic investment areas include cloud, SaaS, professional services, alliances and partnerships as well as to strategic acquisitions. In terms of what this means for our financial results, we expect GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $3.21 to $3.31 per share. At the midpoint, this would represent a 9% increase over last year. This includes approximately $0.02 dilution related to Coradiant. This range includes an estimated $0.92 to $0.97 per share for non-GAAP adjustments including expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation and severance, costs and related charges. The assumptions underlying our full year fiscal 2012 expectations include: total bookings growth in the low double digits; ESM license bookings growth in the low 20s; MSM total bookings growth in the mid-single digits; revenue growth in the high single digits to the low double digits; operating margin staying the same with the prior year, which reflects dilution related to the acquisition of Coradiant, the impact from net capitalized software development costs, the fact that ESM continues to represent a higher proportion of our business and our investment in key strategic areas, a slight increase in the license bookings ratable rate, currency impact at today's rates and other income, weighted shares outstanding and a non-GAAP tax rate at levels similar to fiscal 2011. 
We expect full year fiscal 2012 cash flow from operations to be between $825 million and $875 million, which represents an 11% improvement at the midpoint.

The average cloud deal, so we've been selling true cloud architecture, our CLM product line is part of that for about 3 quarters now. And between Q3 and Q4, the ASP for that business doubled. We are seeing people come back to the well. As you know, when cloud first goes in some of these large enterprises, it's done almost like proof of concept. They want to understand it just enough to prove it can work. And then the way that the contract is structured or the way the customers' intentions are designed is to come back to us as the things begins to scale and buy more capacity and we're seeing more revenue. So for instance one of our largest deals this quarter, a deal we named by name, which is a large global systems integrator and outsourcer who's setting up a cloud for U.S. Federal, came back, our first cloud transaction was in Q2. They came back this quarter. We had an 8-figure transaction for cloud that included our Cloud Lifecycle manager that was on top of the architecture that was obviously a large deal. So we're starting to see cloud deals go from proof of concept to production. We're seeing ASP in some our SaaS offerings going up. We had a number of 6-figure transactions on RemedyForce as an example begin to go up. And as you heard in prepared remarks, the number of $1 million transaction is going up as customers basically standardize on our whole BSM concept and say we're going to go with this idea really managing IT as a service. And so the kind of the vision is paying off. Cloud accelerated it and our sales, and I take my hat off to our sales organization. Our sales organization in the last year has been really focused in training, heavily training on building that pipeline and telling the story. And now, that's really starting to come in for us."

So with the attrition rates under control and with the fact that we do plan on continuing to invest and add more sales capacity, with the fact that those salespeople because of the big turnover we had a couple of years ago, you have sales people who are now 1 year or 2, some cases 3 years into the territories being trained. You're really starting to get into some better productivity assumptions around sales people who are really beginning to hit their stride. So we'll have a more mature, better educated, longer tenured sales force. We have attrition under control, and we're going to be adding heads. And we've also got our training programs pretty well lined up. So I guess that would answer the question hopefully on sales, and Steve."

We've been investing in best practices, methodologies, playbooks, et cetera. I give an example. Some of the very first cloud deals we did particularly the very first ones, were fairly rough. I mean we were having to feel our way through of helping the customer, set up the architecture, implementing the software. We were Version 1. It's that of our software. We're now Version 2 of our cloud lifecycle manager. So we just did a deal this last quarter that was, in 90 days from selling the cloud solution to the customer to standing the cloud up into production. And part of that is because the money we've been spending on tightening up our methodologies and our training programs So some of the investments we've been making there is going to come home and help continue to make us more profitable in the years ahead.

Going forward, we're looking for a slight increase in that deferral rate, which will also as we grow our license bookings, will cause the absolute dollar deferral to be even greater in next fiscal year.

It's one of the most exciting products I've seen since I've been with the company, and we'd be happy to give demonstrations for some of you if you like to see what I'm talking about. And that's what's this group's been trained on. So I think the energy and the excitement in the sales force going forward is very strong. In terms of who we are bumping heads with, it's the usual suspects on, we come at it, we break it down into multiple sectors. First we go after the telcos and the service providers. In that marketplace, those are big fish and that is Cisco certainly is still helping us in these large telcos. We are very, I don't know that we've lost a large telco that I can think of, a service provider yet. We're winning those. There probably one that I don't know about that we've lost but I don't know it. And so we're very strong there. We will compete with IBM. We'll compete and they come in with kind of their blue washing, where they come in with an army of people and say, Don't worry about how it works. Just hire us and we'll make it work. We compete with Hewlett Packard, of course, who has many of the components. We don't see CA much in the larger deals. We see CA, when we do see them, more targeting SMB kind of mid-market service providers and those sort of things with one of their acquisitions. And that's we see them in the space. Vmware, we are asked about, we really don't so much compete with Vmware. The answer hasn't changed on that in a number of quarters. They have certain things that they do for their environment, but we deliver a complete management environment. If you look at the Red Hat announcement today, that's really a good example of the differentiation. We're integrating into their virtualization with our management environment so customers can get a very fast, deployed managed environment. So there are some fuzz around the Vmware. But really it's the vast majority of the revenue we're driving, sitting on top of their platforms in the cloud space. And as I mentioned, the big 8-figure transaction we're sitting on top of the VCE platform just this quarter. So at present, they're not a material competitor in almost any respect. But it's the usual suspects. Did I answer your question?"

So let me expand the definition a little bit. In general when we talk about cloud lifecycle manager, we're talking about helping the customer set up their own cloud environment. But certainly our SaaS product is, by anybody's definition, would count as cloud technology, cloud revenue. And we were at a year ago, we had our very first customer one year ago. We have now about 100 customers on SaaS. Both RemedyForce and Remedy OnDemand are both growing very nicely. It's a very nice mix. We are beating the competition large and small, head to head. The win rates are really going up very nicely now. It appears to us well north of 50% of the time. And again considering the fact that our products were just ramping up, I'm very pleased with that. We've got a lot of focus, dedicated focus. Our sales force are very focused on it right now. I've been the meeting really often with the General Manager of the RemedyForce business unit over at salesforce. And we've just closed multiple 6-figure transactions with help from our friends at salesforce. So that's starting to ramp and I expect that the quantity of transactions around RemedyForce to continue to go very rapidly. Remedy OnDemand will be at probably less volume but larger transactions, particularly in the Remedy install base. So that's also not included in what we were calling cloud revenue, but I think you could easily call it that."

But we saw what was coming with new web architectures and kind of Web 2.0 architectures and kind of waited until we found what we thought we'd can of be the big winner in that space and new architecture. So that's how we moved into that space. I think in general, I don't know that I can tell you that you don't already know that the amount of SaaS that are going to be deployed is shooting up, the amount of cloud in general is shooting up. And APM application performance management that can see you through the cloud and get really give you what that customer real experience it not a synthetic transaction, which by the way can be fooled, but a real report on how your customers are actually seeing the performance of those obligations absolutely critical. So I think everyone recognizes that it's deploying these new generation apps and ones is asking for that capability. But they want more than that. They need to seek, they need to integrate like our capacity planning tools into that. So as you're watching performance, you can begin to see the performance is beginning to degrade. You can model what happens if the transaction volume increases 10% or 20% and you can model different scenarios. And this is more like our Neptuny acquisition comes in and you can begin to say, we're going to have -- we're going to forecast our performance problem for this if we don't take action. Then BMC's automation tools can in and actually take the action necessary to remediate an advance of the performance problem. So we're really giving the customers the ability to see the problem, to forecast a problem before it occurs, see it if it does occur, take the action as necessary to fix it or to keep it from occurring and do all that in concept of this new architectural design that maybe traditional. And there's a lot of excitement, a lot of energy around that."

As you've seen from our earnings release, fiscal 2011 was another year of strong improvements in bookings, revenue, cash flow and earnings. Total bookings rose 13%. License bookin",1998,"Thank you, Derrick, and thanks to all of you for joining us this afternoon. As you've seen from our earnings release, fiscal 2011 was another year of strong improvements in bookings, revenue, cash flow and earnings. Total bookings rose 13%. License bookings were up 20%, ESM license bookings were up 21%, MSM total bookings were up 4%, revenue grew 8%, GAAP diluted EPS rose 15%, non-GAAP operating income increased 9%, non-GAAP diluted EPS was up 12% and operating cash flow was up 20%.
I'm proud to say that for the year, we delivered on or exceeded our expectations for total company bookings, ESM license bookings, MSM total bookings, revenue, operating cash flow and non-GAAP diluted EPS. And in fact, we generated record levels of performance in each of these metrics. These strong results underscore the success of our strategy over the last several years to make disciplined investments that enhance our market leadership and enable us to accelerate top line growth. 
As part of this strategy, we strengthened our sales force, increased internal R&D efforts related to cloud and other major technology trends, selectively acquired complementary technologies in rapidly growing market segments and bolstered our strategic partnerships. These initiatives are clearly paying off and we expect to reap additional benefits in 2012 and beyond.
Let me turn next to our fourth quarter performance, which enabled us to end fiscal '11 on a very strong note. Total bookings for the quarter were up 21%, license bookings rose 16%, revenue increased 14%, non-GAAP operating income was up 23% and non-GAAP diluted EPS was up 20%. For both the full year and the fourth quarter, we continued to see very good performance across both of our business units, all key product lines and all major geographies. 
ESM license bookings were up 21% for the year and 18% for the fourth quarter. Our ESM growth reflects, in part, our success in strengthening our ESM sales organization. We met our fiscal 2011 goal to achieve a 20% increase in the average productive sales headcount compared to the prior year. I'm also pleased that we saw a significant decline in attrition rates in our ESM sales organization during the fiscal 2011 compared to a year ago, and we're expecting further declines in attrition rates in fiscal 2012. That's one reason we continue to win a greater number of larger, multi-disciplined platform deals. 
The number of ESM license transactions over $1 million increased 36% for the year and 55% for the quarter. This dynamic is also creating opportunities for our professional services team, which we increasingly capitalized on during fiscal 2011. Professional services revenue rose 51% for the quarter and 37% for the full year. The number of midsized deals, which demonstrates how we are increasing our footprint, also increased. Transactions between $500,000 and $1 million were up 10% and 6% for the year and quarter, respectively. Key wins during the quarter include Harris Corp., Unisys and FINRA, the U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. These were all multi-disciplined platform wins. 
Our MSM business continues to perform very well, with strong double-digit growth in the annual spend rate of our top 15 MSM transactions in Q4. The growth was broad-based, with 13 of the top 15 customers increasing their annual spend with MSM. In fact, the growth in the annual spend rate of MSM's top 15 transactions were strong for the full fiscal year. 
Over the year, we grew the spend rate on our top 15 MSM transactions each quarter in the mid-teens. We also saw continued strength in new product sales and growth in capacity upgrades. The increase in annual spend rate for these larger transactions reflects our success in managing and expanding our relationships with MSM's customers. Some of this is due to our increased focus and our success on winning competitive replacements, as well as expanding our customer use of products that help drive efficiency and our IT operations. 
During the quarter, we added 122 new product placements in our existing installed base. And over the course of fiscal 2011, we added a total of over 350 new product placements to existing customers. Some key mainframe customer wins in Q4 included Bank of America and Nationwide Insurance. 
As you know, workload automation, which includes our BMC Control-M product line, is about 1/3 of our MSM business. We continue to see strength in this business with Control-M bookings growth in the mid-single digits during fiscal 2011. Over the past year, we added 88 new BMC Control-M customers and expanded our existing relationships with 195 new product placements. This includes 33 new customers and 66 new product placements in the fourth quarter. Some key workload automation wins in the fourth quarter included the Social Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service. So that's a snapshot of our business unit performance in the quarter and the year. 
Now let's talk about the dynamics of our market. One of the most important solutions IT can offer is to develop a flexible infrastructure, one that provides the right type and level of services at the right cost. In fact, it's interesting to note that in a recent Gartner webinar titled, Reimagining IT, the 2011 CIO Agenda, that Mark MacDonald delivered on March 16th, global CIOs were asked what their top 3 strategies were for 2011. Number one on that list for the first time was, developing and managing a flexible IT infrastructure. In one year's time, it jumped from eighth on the list to the #1 spot. The reasons for this are clear. In a competitive global business environment, IT needs to be structured, managed, staffed and deployed as a service, a service that business managers can leverage to achieve their goals and objectives. 
That's exactly what BMC does. BMC is in the business of building agile, flexible IT infrastructures. We allow IT to offer a service platform that enables enterprises to align and manage their technology resources more quickly, efficiently and productively. Furthermore with our platform, the underlying resources to deliver the services can be dynamically brokered, further driving down the total costs of their services. The evolution in growth of cloud computing is one very visible manifestation of the drive for a more flexible IT infrastructure. As you know, clouds offer a way to significantly increase flexibility while containing or even reducing costs. And as you also know, BMC helps to build and manage clouds for enterprises, governments and service providers. 
Our leadership in building and managing practical and robust private, public and hybrid clouds is evident in the growing number of cloud-related deals that we've won. Over the course of fiscal 2011, we have nearly 50 cloud solution wins. These wins include global Fortune 2000 companies, such as AXA and Pfizer, as well as many of the world's largest telcos and service providers. Our continuing success in the marketplace reflects the strong commitment we're making to enhance our technology leadership and product capabilities. 
During the past year, we introduced a new Cloud Lifecycle Management solution as well as new BMC Control-M Self Service solutions. Both of these products were developed by our in-house R&D teams and they are two of the most successful products launched in our company's recent history. We're very happy with the success of our organic R&D innovation, and it will remain a key focus for us as it provides us with a clear competitive advantage.
Another competitive advantage is our ability to acquire and integrate complementary technologies. After the close of the fourth quarter, we announced the purchase of Coradiant. This deal represents a major step forward and makes us a clear leader in next generation Applications Performance Management. Coradiant provides us with state-of-the-art end-user experience monitoring for enterprise, SaaS and cloud-based applications. 
During fiscal year 2011, we acquired 2 businesses that support our technology strategy. The first, GridApp Systems, focuses on automating database provisioning across operating systems. The second, the software business of Neptuny, extended BMC's existing leadership in physical and virtual capacity management. These 2 transactions, like others that we have made recently, are performing very well. 
While our success in helping customers build and manage cloud demonstrates one important way we're helping drive a more flexible infrastructure, it's equally important to remember that there are other ways. This includes our Software-as-a-Service offerings. Remedy OnDemand enables customers to access our full ITIL-based industry leading suite of service desk offerings. Our RemedyForce offering, which is marketed and sold by both salesforce.com and directly by BMC, is a powerful, easy-to-use solution for customers looking for service desk that's built natively on top of the salesforce platform, Force.com. 
You'll remember that just one year ago back in fiscal 2010 fourth quarter, we launched our initial SaaS offering. In the past year, we have generated nearly 100 SaaS wins from both Remedy OnDemand and RemedyForce offerings. 34 of these wins were in the fourth quarter alone, demonstrating accelerating momentum on both offerings. New SaaS wins in the quarter include Source Buyer and the Texas Department of State Health Services. 
Our partner ecosystem continues to expand and deliver value to our customers and our shareholders. The strategic alliance with Cisco on their Integrated Cloud Delivery Platform is an example of our partner strategy at work. This alliance is focused on enabling service providers to develop flexible infrastructure and cloud offerings for their customers. BMC technology is at the heart of this platform, and we're very pleased with its reception in the marketplace.
There are other examples with how we're working to enable enterprises to develop a more flexible infrastructure. Our broad portfolio and heterogeneous approach to IT management naturally aligns us with the global partner community ranging from Accenture to CSC to Dell to Wipro. Just today, we announced an expanded partnership with Red Hat to deliver a joint offering coupling Red Hat's virtualization and cloud platform with BMC's Cloud Lifecycle Management suite. These alliances create powerful, practical, complete offerings for our customers, and they enable our partners to offer managed services to their customers to build clouds for their own use and to resell our professional services and technology. Our focus here and across the board is enabling our customers to optimize their IT investments by leveraging new ways of doing business, virtualization, cloud computing, Software-as-a-Service, mobility and other technologies that increase speed, responsiveness, efficiency and productivity of their business.
As we move through fiscal 2012, the demand from enterprises for a more flexible IT infrastructure remains strong. We're seeing it across geographic regions and industry segments. We're also seeing it across larger and smaller enterprises. We believe this demand will fundamentally transform IT management in the years ahead. 
As I've noted, we're very well positioned amidst this change to capture the market opportunities that lie ahead. From a financial standpoint, we have a healthy, growing stream of bookings, revenue, cash flow and earnings, as well as a very strong balance sheet. From a technology standpoint, we have the highest performance and best integrated portfolio of IT management solutions. We're making smart investments in both internal development and external acquisitions to maintain and grow our competitive edge. From a sales and marketing standpoint, we have a strong and growing footprint that enables us to reach an increasing number of customers around the world. And from a management standpoint, we have a clearly defined strategy for success and the commitment and expertise required to execute on it.
All of these factors make us quite optimistic about fiscal 2012, which we enter with great momentum. As we move forward, I believe we will look back on the year we just closed as a pivotal year. A year when the company transitioned from being a strong, moderate growth company to one characterized by sustained accelerating growth, led by a solid ESM engine capable of delivering ongoing double-digit growth. 
I'll have more to say on our expectations for fiscal 2012 in a few minutes. But first, Steve Solcher will provide you with a more detailed financial review."

I would like to start by adding to Bob's comments about our performance for the year. First, as you know, we met or exceeded our fiscal 2011 expectations in terms of total bookings, ESM license bookings, MSM total bookings, revenues, non-G",1733,"Thank you, Bob. I would like to start by adding to Bob's comments about our performance for the year. First, as you know, we met or exceeded our fiscal 2011 expectations in terms of total bookings, ESM license bookings, MSM total bookings, revenues, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and cash flow from operations. In fact, each of these reached record levels in fiscal 2011. We also had strong double-digit growth for the year in total bookings, ESM license bookings, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and cash flow from operations.
Second, during fiscal 2011, we demonstrated our ability to grow earnings and cash flow from operations, while at the same time making the investments in internal development, sales and services necessary to maintain and build our competitive advantage. These investments reflect our view that there are substantial market opportunities ahead and our desire to ensure that we are properly positioned to capture them. 
With that, let me review our financial results for the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year in more detail. Non-GAAP operating income increased 23% from $161 million to $197 million in the fourth quarter compared to the year-ago period. Our fourth quarter non-GAAP operating margin was 35%, up 2 points from the year-ago quarter. For the full year, we achieved non-GAAP operating income of $733 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin for fiscal 2011 was 35%, the same as in fiscal year 2010. Please refer to Slide 5 for a selected non-GAAP financial information, which includes segment operating margin of our ESM and MSM business units.
ESM's non-GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter increased to $67 million, up 32% from the year-ago period. ESM's non-GAAP operating margin increased year-over-year by 2 percentage points to 19%. For the full fiscal year, ESM's non-GAAP operating income increased by 17% to $280 million. ESM's non-GAAP operating margin increased by 1 percentage point in fiscal year 2011 to 22%. As we've noted, we plan to continue to make investments in our ESM business as we look to expand our growth opportunities while continuing to deliver increased earnings.
MSM's non-GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter was $130 million, up 18% from the year-ago period, and its non-GAAP operating margin increased 5 percentage points to 61%. For the full year, MSM's non-GAAP operating income was $453 million, up 4%, and its non-GAAP operating margin was 58%, up 1 percentage point compared to the year ago. We remain focused on maintaining strong operating margins within our MSM business unit.
Our non-GAAP net earnings for the fourth quarter were $141 million, up 17% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.78 which reflects a non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter of 29%. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was higher than previous quarters and was higher than our full year expectation due to the change in the geographic mix of profits. This higher-than-expected non-GAAP tax rate in the fourth quarter negatively impacted our non-GAAP results by $0.05 in the quarter. 
For fiscal 2011, non-GAAP net earnings were $546 million, an increase of 10% compared to $496 million in fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the year was a company record at $2.99, up 12% compared to the prior year. This reflects a non-GAAP effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 of 25%. These non-GAAP results reflect diluted shares outstanding for both the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year of 182 million versus 186 million and 187 million in the respective year-ago periods.
GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter was $142 million compared to $116 million in the year-ago period. GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share were $123 million and $0.67 compared to $119 million and $0.64 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, respectively. GAAP operating income in fiscal 2011 was $533 million compared with $506 million in fiscal 2010. GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year were $456 million and $2.50 per diluted share versus $406 million and $2.17 per diluted share in 2010. Fourth quarter and full fiscal year GAAP net earnings were positively impacted by a net income tax benefit of $25 million and $57 million, respectively, in connection with tax authority settlements related to prior year's tax matters. These tax benefits were excluded from our non-GAAP results.
Turning now to bookings. Total bookings for the fourth quarter were $708 million, representing an increase of 21% compared to the year-ago period. On a constant-currency basis, fourth quarter bookings increased 18%. Total bookings for fiscal 2011 were a company record $2.2 billion, up $251 million or 13% as reported and on a constant currency basis compared to fiscal 2010. The weighted average contract length for total bookings on a trailing 12-month basis was 2.17 years, up 2% from 2.12 years in the year-ago period. After normalizing for contract length, trailing 12-month annualized bookings for the fourth quarter were $1 billion, up 10% from the year-ago period. Please refer to Slide 7 in our presentation. 
Now let me turn to the performance of each of our business units. Total ESM license bookings were $162 million in the fourth quarter, up 18% from the year-ago period. For fiscal 2011, total ESM license bookings were $571 million, up 21% from fiscal 2010. Our performance was balanced across each of our product disciplines with growth and license bookings ranging from 15% to 35%. 
Turning to the MSM business unit. We believe MSM is best evaluated on the basis of total and annualized bookings over the trailing 12 months. Total MSM bookings for fiscal 2011 increased 4% to $843 million and had an average contract length of 2.9 years. After normalizing for contract length, total annualized MSM bookings for the trailing 12 months were $290 million, up 4%.
Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the quarter was $562 million, a 14% increase on both a reported and constant currency basis compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. ESM and MSM total revenue for the quarter increased 18% and 9%, respectively compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Total revenue for the year was a company record at $2.1 billion, increasing 8% on a reported and constant currency basis. ESM and MSM total revenue for the year increased 12% and 2%, respectively compared to fiscal 2010. License revenue in the fourth quarter was $251 million, up 24% from a year ago. ESM license revenue was $158 million, up 27%, while MSM license revenue was $93 million, up 20% from last year. For fiscal 2011, license revenue rose 14% to $865 million. 
For the fourth quarter, maintenance revenue was $259 million, an increase of 1% compared to a year ago. ESM maintenance revenue was $138 million, up 1%, and MSM maintenance revenue was $121 million, up 2% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. For fiscal 2011, maintenance revenue was flat at $1 billion. 
Professional Services revenue, which is included in the ESM segment, grew 51% from the year-ago period to $53 million in the fourth quarter. Professional Services revenue in fiscal 2011 increased by 37% to $177 million. The growth in our Professional Services business underscores our involvement in new cloud initiatives and the opportunity for continued license bookings growth, as enterprises move from proof-of-concept to fully deployed cloud solutions in their data centers.
Moving next to operating expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $365 million, up 10% from the year-ago period. The fourth quarter sequential increase in non-GAAP operating expenses reflects our typical seasonality. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the year were up 8% from the previous year. 
Looking at our business units, ESM non-GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $282 million compared to $245 million in the year-ago quarter. MSM non-GAAP operating expenses were $83 million compared to $85 million in the year-ago quarter. For fiscal 2011, ESM non-GAAP operating expenses were $1 billion compared to $902 million in fiscal 2010. MSM non-GAAP operating expenses were $334 million compared to $335 million in the previous year. Other income in the fourth quarter was $2 million, up 5% from the year-ago quarter. For the full fiscal year, other income was a loss of approximately $2 million, the same as in fiscal 2010. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. Total deferred license revenue at the end of the fourth quarter was a company record $686 million, up 4% sequentially and 10% year-over-year. During the quarter, we deferred $128 million of license revenue or 46% of license bookings and recorded $104 million of deferred license revenue from the balance sheet. Total deferred revenue increased by $146 million sequentially to $2 billion. The current portion of deferred revenue now stands at 53%. 
Our software development costs as of March 31 were $194 million as we capitalized $29 million and amortized $21 million during the quarter. For the fiscal year, we capitalized $123 million of software development costs and amortized $75 million. We expect gross capitalized software development costs to remain flat for fiscal 2012. While we expect the amortization of such costs to increase by approximately $20 million, these estimates are incorporated into our 2012 expectations.
Cash and investments at March 31 totaled $1.8 billion, an increase of $156 million sequentially. Our net cash position was $1.4 billion at March 31, 2011. For the quarter, cash flow from operations was $290 million. For fiscal 2011, cash flow from operations was a company record $765 million, up 20% from the prior year. 
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.9 million shares of our stock for a total cost of $140 million. For fiscal 2011, we repurchased 10.6 million shares at a cost of $439 million. We have 631 million remaining in our current share repurchase program as of March 31.
Let me summarize by saying that fiscal 2011 was a year of significant achievement for BMC. We achieved record levels of bookings, revenues, non-GAAP earnings and cash flow from operations. We enhanced our technology leadership and product portfolio through both internal development and selected strategic acquisitions. We strengthened our sales force, partnerships and alliances to reach more customers in more ways. All of these factors position us well in fiscal 2012. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for his concluding remarks and expectations for fiscal 2012."

As we've noted, fiscal 2012 is shaping up to be another year in which we expect to significantly increase shareholder value by driving increases in bookings, revenue, earnings and cash flow from operations. All the key factors are in place. The global economy is showing signs of improvement. Customer demand for agile, flexible IT infrastructures is strong, and we enjoy a leading position in our markets.
To capitalize on our recent success and to continue to position us well for the future, we are continuing to make strategic investments in growth opportunities. These key strategic investment areas include cloud, SaaS, Professional Services, alliances and partnerships as well as strategic acquisitions. In terms of what this means for our financial results, we expect non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $3.21 to $3.31 per share. At the midpoint, this would represent a 9% increase over last year. This includes approximately $0.02 dilution related to Coradiant. This range excludes an estimated $0.92 to $0.97 per share for non-GAAP adjustments, including expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation and severance, exit costs and related charges. 
The assumptions underlying our full year fiscal 2012 expectations include: total bookings growth in the low double digits; ESM license bookings growth in the low 20s; MSM total bookings growth in the mid-single digits; revenue growth in the high single digits to low double digits; operating margin staying the same with the prior year, which reflects dilution related to the acquisition of Coradiant, the impact from net capitalized software development costs, the fact that ESM continues to represent a higher proportion of our business and our investment in key strategic areas, a slight increase in the license bookings ratable rate, currency impact at today's rates and other income, weighted shares outstanding and a non-GAAP tax rate at levels similar to fiscal 2011. 
We expect full year fiscal 2012 cash flow from operations to be between $825 million and $875 million, which represents an 11% improvement at the midpoint. 
With that, we will now turn the call over to questions. Operator?"

The average cloud deal, so we've been selling true cloud architecture, our CLM product line is part of that for about 3 quarters now. And between Q3 and Q4, the ASPs for that business doubled. We're seeing people come back to the well. As you know, when cloud first goes in some of these large enterprises, it's done. It's almost like proof-of-concept. They want to stand up just enough to prove it can work. And then the way that the contract is structured or the way the customers' intentions are designed is to come back to us as this thing begins to scale and buy more capacity and we're seeing more revenue. So for instance, one of our largest deals this quarter, a deal we named by name, which is a large global systems integrator and outsourcer who's setting up a cloud for U.S. Federal came back -- our first cloud transaction with them was in Q2. They came back this quarter. We had an 8-figure transaction for cloud that included our Cloud Lifecycle Manager that was on top of the VCE architecture that was obviously a large deal. So we're starting to see cloud deals go from proof-of-concept to production. We're seeing our ASPs in some our SaaS offerings going up. We've had a number of 6-figure transactions on RemedyForce as an example begin to go up. And as you heard in prepared remarks, the number of $1 million transaction is going up as customers basically standardize on our whole BSM concept and say we're going to go with this idea of really managing IT-as-a-service. And so kind of the vision is paying off, cloud accelerated it and our sales -- and really I've got to take my hat off to our sales organization. Our sales organization in the last year has been really focused in training, heavily training on building that pipeline and telling the story. And now, that's really starting to come in for us."

One of the things -- one of the advantages we have this year and I mentioned in my comments is that our attrition is well under control. Q4 was the lowest it's been in 2 years. It's well inside of our target ranges and what we hoped it would be. In some geographies, it's actually so low. We're taking a look at that. So with the attrition rates under control and with the fact that we do plan on continuing to invest and add more sales capacity, with the fact that those salespeople -- because of the big turnover we had a couple of years ago, you have salespeople who are now 1 year or 2, some cases 3 years into the territories being trained. You're really starting to get into some better productivity assumptions around salespeople who are really beginning to hit their stride. So we'll have a more mature, better educated, longer tenured sales force. We have attrition under control and we're going to be adding heads, and we've also got our training programs pretty well lined up. So I guess that would answer the question hopefully on sales.

We've been investing in best practices, methodologies, playbooks, et cetera. I give an example. Some of the very first cloud deals we did, particularly the very first ones, were fairly rough. I mean, we were having to feel our way through of helping the customer, set up the architecture, implementing the software. We were Version 1, if that, of our software. We're now Version 2 of our Cloud Lifecycle Manager. So we just did a deal this last quarter that was in 90 days from selling the cloud solution to the customer to standing the cloud up into production. And part of that is because the money we've been spending on tightening up our methodologies and our training programs. So some of the investments we've been making there is going to come home and help continue to make us more profitable in the years ahead. We still have more work to do there though."

The deferral rate for us came in at slightly below where we were expecting not only for the quarter and the year. But it's important to really highlight that the dollar amount that was deferred in the quarter, $25 million, is still a substantial number. And for the year, we deferred $62 million of license versus $13 million the year before, and that creates a headwind to us which impacts margins. Going forward, we're looking for a slight increase in that deferral rate, which will also, as we grow our license bookings, will cause the absolute dollar deferral to be even greater in next fiscal year. So some of the questions that we get is around the margin. This is a natural headwind to the margin as we continue to net defer license bookings."

First thing I'd tell you is that we just finished our sales training event in Florida where I was there and we had intense training on our entire worldwide ESM sales force on Cloud Lifecycle Manager, with simulations, with demos, with -- I mean, so we now have all hands on deck on CLM, and CLM 2.0 just now really starting to hit the Street. And Cloud Lifecycle Manager 2.0 is a powerful new product. I'm telling you. It's one of the most exciting products I've seen since I've been with the company, and we'd be happy to give set of demonstrations for some of you if you'd like to see what I'm talking about. And that's what this group's been trained on. So I think the energy and the excitement in the sales force going forward is very strong. In terms of who we're bumping heads with, it's the usual suspects on. We come at it in kind of -- we break it down into multiple sectors. First, we go after the telcos and the service providers. In that marketplace, those are big fish and that is -- Cisco certainly is still helping us in these large telcos. We're doing very well against the competition. I don't know that we've lost a large telco that I can think of or service provider, yet we're winning those. There's probably one I don't know about that we've lost but I don't know it. And so we're very strong there. We will compete with IBM. We'll compete and they come in with kind of their blue-washing where they come in with an army of people and say, ""Don't worry about how it works. Just hire us and we'll make it work."" We compete with Hewlett-Packard, of course, who has many of the components. We don't see CA much in the larger deals. We see CA when we do see them more targeting SMB kind of mid-market service providers and those sort of things with one of their acquisitions. And that's the only place we see them in the space. VMware, we were asked about, and we really don't so much compete with VMware. The answer hasn't changed on that in a number of quarters. They have certain things that they do for their environment, but we deliver a complete management environment. You look at the Red Hat announcement today, that's really a good example of the differentiation. We're integrating into their virtualization with our management environment, so customers can get a very fast deployed managed environment. So there are some fuzz around the VMware, but really it's the vast majority of the revenue we're driving, sitting on top of their platforms in the cloud space. And as I mentioned, that big 8-figure transaction, we're sitting on top of the VCE platform just this quarter. So at present, they're not a material competitor in almost any respect. But it's the usual suspects. Did I answer your question?"

We have now 100 customers on SaaS. Both RemedyForce and Remedy OnDemand are both growing very nicely. It's a very nice mix. We are beating the competition large and small, head-to-head. The win rates are really going up very nicely now. It appears to us to be well north of 50% of the time. And again, considering the fact that our products were just ramping up, I'm very pleased with that. We've got a lot of focus, dedicated focus. Our friends at salesforce are very focused on it right now. I've been the meeting fairly often with the General Manager of the RemedyForce business unit over at salesforce, and we've just closed multiple 6-figure transactions with help from our friends at salesforce. So that's really starting to ramp, and I expect that the quantity of transactions around RemedyForce to continue to go very rapidly.

And so our sales rep didn't know we were negotiating, sent an e-mail up saying, ""I don't know who Coradiant is, but my customer just said we should buy them."" So that story was told in front of our sales force. We have a lot of energy around it. This plugs straight in to our traditional sales model. The sales reps will eat it up. This is right down the alley for them.

They're all doing very well, they run very nicely and the products we've delivered like CLM in the last few years are also growing very nicely.

So our expectation is, as those customers renew those same time-based licenses. So it's really nothing that we're doing internally. It is customer-driven. And until that customer signs a contract, we're typically going with our best estimate at the time and try to determine what the deferral rate. The rate though, again, as I said earlier, I would not focus on the percentage. I would focus on the dollar amount that is being deferred. We deferred this year $62 million, again, versus $13 million, and our deferral rate went down 3 percentage points."

Well, I think in general, a lot of the old APM products and products like Mercury or others that were designed kind of for a different architecture. really don't scale, don't move to this new environment. And we are little bit missed out on that phase as a company and made the decision to wait. But we saw what was coming with new Web architectures and kind of Web 2.0 architectures, and kind of waited until we found what we thought would kind of be the big winner in that space and this new architecture. So that's how we moved into that space. I think in general, I don't know that I can tell you anything you don't already know that the amount of SaaS applications that are going to be deployed is shooting up, the amount of cloud in general is shooting up. And APM, Application Performance Management, that can see through the cloud and can really give you what that customer's real experience is, not a synthetic transaction, which by the way can be fooled, but a real report on how your customers are actually seeing the performance of those applications is absolutely critical. So I think everyone recognizes that it's deploying these new generation apps and is asking for that capability. But they want more than that. They need to seek -- they need to integrate things like our capacity planning tools into that. So that as you're watching performance, you can begin to see the performance is beginning to degrade, you can model what happens if the transaction volume increases 10% or 20% and you can model different scenarios, and this is where like our Neptuny acquisition comes in. And you can begin to say, ""We're going to have -- we're going to forecast our performance problem for this if we don't take action."" Then BMC's automation tools can kick in and actually take the action necessary to remediate in advance of the performance problem. So we're really giving the customers the ability to see the problem, to forecast a problem before it occurs, see it if it does occur, take the action that's necessary to fix it or to keep it from occurring and do all that in concept of this new architectural design. It maybe cloud or maybe traditional. And there's a lot of excitement, a lot of energy around that."

Part 2 is that we've got some deals we're working this fiscal year that I just visited with a customer that looked very much on track to occur. In fact in some cases, in one case, I think the deal just got larger when I was there on Friday that will happen this BMC fiscal year. And I also visited with some, as I mentioned, some very high level buyers on some transactions that will work that probably would be more like next fiscal year.

As you've seen from our earnings release, fiscal 2011 was another year of strong improvements in bookings, revenue, cash flow and earnings. Total bookings rose 13%. License bookin",1998,"Thank you, Derrick, and thanks to all of you for joining us this afternoon. As you've seen from our earnings release, fiscal 2011 was another year of strong improvements in bookings, revenue, cash flow and earnings. Total bookings rose 13%. License bookings were up 20%, ESM license bookings were up 21%, MSM total bookings were up 4%, revenue grew 8%, GAAP diluted EPS rose 15%, non-GAAP operating income increased 9%, non-GAAP diluted EPS was up 12% and operating cash flow was up 20%.
I'm proud to say that for the year, we delivered on or exceeded our expectations for total company bookings, ESM license bookings, MSM total bookings, revenue, operating cash flow and non-GAAP diluted EPS. And in fact, we generated record levels of performance in each of these metrics. These strong results underscore the success of our strategy over the last several years to make disciplined investments that enhance our market leadership and enable us to accelerate top line growth. 
As part of this strategy, we strengthened our sales force, increased internal R&D efforts related to cloud and other major technology trends, selectively acquired complementary technologies in rapidly growing market segments and bolstered our strategic partnerships. These initiatives are clearly paying off, and we expect to reap additional benefits in 2012 and beyond.
Let me turn next to our fourth quarter performance, which enabled us to end fiscal '11 on a very strong note. Total bookings for the quarter were up 21%, license bookings rose 16%, revenue increased 14%, non-GAAP operating income was up 23% and non-GAAP diluted EPS was up 20%. For both the full year and the fourth quarter, we continued to see very good performance across both of our business units, all key product lines and all major geographies. 
ESM license bookings were up 21% for the year and 18% for the fourth quarter. Our ESM growth reflects, in part, our success in strengthening our ESM sales organization. We met our fiscal 2011 goal to achieve a 20% increase in the average productive sales headcount compared to the prior year. I'm also pleased that we saw a significant decline in attrition rates in our ESM sales organization during the fiscal 2011 compared to a year ago, and we're expecting further declines in attrition rates in fiscal 2012. That's one reason we continue to win a greater number of larger, multi-discipline platform deals. 
The number of ESM license transactions over $1 million increased 36% for the year and 55% for the quarter. This dynamic is also creating opportunities for our professional services team, which we increasingly capitalized on during fiscal 2011. Professional services revenue rose 51% for the quarter and 37% for the full year. The number of midsized deals, which demonstrates how we are increasing our footprint, also increased. Transactions between $500,000 and $1 million were up 10% and 6% for the year and quarter, respectively. Key wins during the quarter include Harris Corporation, Unisys and FINRA, the U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. These were all multi-discipline platform wins. 
Our MSM business continues to perform very well, with strong double-digit growth in the annual spend rate of our top 15 MSM transactions in Q4. The growth was broad-based, with 13 of the top 15 customers increasing their annual spend with MSM. In fact, the growth in the annual spend rate of MSM's top 15 transactions was strong for the full fiscal year. 
Over the year, we grew the spend rate on our top 15 MSM transactions each quarter in the mid-teens. We also saw continued strength in new product sales and growth in capacity upgrades. The increase in annual spend rate for these larger transactions reflects our success in managing and expanding our relationships with MSM's customers. Some of this is due to our increased focus and our success on winning competitive replacements, as well as expanding our customers' use of products that help drive efficiency in their IT operations. 
During the quarter, we added 122 new product placements in our existing installed base. And over the course of fiscal 2011, we added a total of over 350 new product placements to existing customers. Some key mainframe customer wins in Q4 included Bank of America and Nationwide Insurance. 
As you know, workload automation, which includes our BMC Control-M product line, is about 1/3 of our MSM business. We continue to see strength in this business with Control-M bookings growth in the mid-single digits during fiscal 2011. Over the past year, we added 88 new BMC Control-M customers and expanded our existing relationships with 195 new product placements. This includes 33 new customers and 66 new product placements in the fourth quarter. Some key workload automation wins in the fourth quarter included the Social Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service. So that's a snapshot of our business unit performance in the quarter and the year. 
Now let's talk about the dynamics of our market. One of the most important solutions IT can offer is to develop a flexible infrastructure, one that provides the right type and level of services at the right cost. In fact, it's interesting to note that in a recent Gartner webinar titled ""Reimagining IT: The 2011 CIO Agenda,"" that Mark MacDonald delivered on March 16, global CIOs were asked what their top 3 strategies were for 2011. Number one on that list for the first time was developing and managing a flexible IT infrastructure. In one year's time, it jumped from eighth on the list to the #1 spot. The reasons for this are clear. In a competitive global business environment, IT needs to be structured, managed, staffed and deployed as a service, a service that business managers can leverage to achieve their goals and objectives. 
That's exactly what BMC does. BMC is in the business of building agile, flexible IT infrastructures. We allow IT to offer a service platform that enables enterprises to align and manage their technology resources more quickly, efficiently and productively. Furthermore, with our platform, the underlying resources to deliver the services can be dynamically brokered, further driving down the total cost of their services. The evolution and growth of cloud computing is one very visible manifestation of the drive for a more flexible IT infrastructure. As you know, clouds offer a way to significantly increase flexibility while containing or even reducing costs. And as you also know, BMC helps to build and manage clouds for enterprises, governments and service providers. 
Our leadership in building and managing practical and robust private, public and hybrid clouds is evident in the growing number of cloud-related deals that we've won. Over the course of fiscal 2011, we had nearly 50 cloud solution wins. These wins include global Fortune 2000 companies, such as AXA and Pfizer, as well as many of the world's largest telcos and service providers. Our continuing success in the marketplace reflects the strong commitment we're making to enhance our technology leadership and product capabilities. 
During the past year, we introduced a new Cloud Lifecycle Management solution as well as new BMC Control-M self-service solutions. Both of these products were developed by our in-house R&D teams, and they are two of the most successful products launched in our company's recent history. We're very happy with the success of our organic R&D innovation, and it will remain a key focus for us as it provides us with a clear competitive advantage.
Another competitive advantage is our ability to acquire and integrate complementary technologies. After the close of the fourth quarter, we announced the purchase of Coradiant. This deal represents a major step forward and makes us a clear leader in next-generation applications performance management. Coradiant provides us with state-of-the-art end-user experience monitoring for enterprise, SaaS and cloud-based applications. 
During fiscal year 2011, we acquired 2 businesses that support our technology strategy. The first, GridApp Systems, focuses on automating database provisioning across operating systems. The second, the software business of Neptuny, extended BMC's existing leadership in physical and virtual capacity management. These 2 transactions, like others that we have made recently, are performing very well. 
While our success in helping customers build and manage cloud demonstrates one important way we're helping drive a more flexible infrastructure, it's equally important to remember that there are other ways. This includes our Software-as-a-Service offerings. Remedy OnDemand enables customers to access our full ITIL-based industry leading suite of service desk offerings. Our RemedyForce offering, which is marketed and sold by both salesforce.com and directly by BMC, is a powerful, easy-to-use solution for customers looking for a service desk that's built natively on top of the salesforce platform, Force.com. 
You'll remember that just one year ago back in fiscal 2010, fourth quarter, we launched our initial SaaS offering. In the past year, we have generated nearly 100 SaaS wins from both Remedy OnDemand and RemedyForce offerings. 34 of these wins were in the fourth quarter alone, demonstrating accelerating momentum on both offerings. New SaaS wins in the quarter include Source Buyer and the Texas Department of State Health Services. 
Our partner ecosystem continues to expand and deliver value to our customers and our shareholders. The strategic alliance with Cisco on their Integrated Cloud Delivery Platform is an example of our partner strategy at work. This alliance is focused on enabling service providers to develop flexible infrastructure and cloud offerings for their customers. BMC technology is at the heart of this platform, and we're very pleased with its reception in the marketplace.
There are other examples of how we're working to enable enterprises to develop a more flexible infrastructure. Our broad portfolio and heterogeneous approach to IT management naturally aligns us with the global partner community ranging from Accenture to CSC to Dell to Wipro. Just today, we announced an expanded partnership with Red Hat to deliver a joint offering coupling Red Hat's virtualization and cloud platform with BMC's Cloud Lifecycle Management suite. These alliances create powerful, practical, complete offerings for our customers, and they enable our partners to offer managed services to their customers to build clouds for their own use and to resell our professional services and technology. Our focus here and across the board is enabling our customers to optimize their IT investments by leveraging new ways of doing business, virtualization, cloud computing, Software-as-a-Service, mobility and other technologies that increase the speed, responsiveness, efficiency and productivity of their business.
As we move through fiscal 2012, the demand from enterprises for a more flexible IT infrastructure remains strong. We're seeing it across geographic regions and industry segments. We're also seeing it across larger and smaller enterprises. We believe this demand will fundamentally transform IT management in the years ahead. 
As I have noted, we're very well positioned amidst this change to capture the market opportunities that lie ahead. From a financial standpoint, we have a healthy, growing stream of bookings, revenue, cash flow and earnings, as well as a very strong balance sheet. From a technology standpoint, we have the highest performance and best integrated portfolio of IT management solutions. We're making smart investments in both internal development and external acquisitions to maintain and grow our competitive edge. From a sales and marketing standpoint, we have a strong and growing footprint that enables us to reach an increasing number of customers around the world. And from a management standpoint, we have a clearly defined strategy for success and the commitment and expertise required to execute on it.
All of these factors make us quite optimistic about fiscal 2012, which we enter with great momentum. As we move forward, I believe we will look back on the year we just closed as a pivotal year, a year when the company transitioned from being a strong, moderate-growth company to one characterized by sustained, accelerating growth, led by a solid ESM engine capable of delivering ongoing double-digit growth. 
I'll have more to say on our expectations for fiscal 2012 in a few minutes. But first, Steve Solcher will provide you with a more detailed financial review."
25673,129708262,122737,"BMC Software Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, May 04, 2011",2011-05-04,"Earnings Calls","BMC Software, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bob. I would like to start by adding to Bob's comments about our performance for the year. First, as you know, we met or exceeded our fiscal 2011 expectations in terms of total bookings, ESM license bookings, MSM total bookings, revenues, non-G",1733,"Thank you, Bob. I would like to start by adding to Bob's comments about our performance for the year. First, as you know, we met or exceeded our fiscal 2011 expectations in terms of total bookings, ESM license bookings, MSM total bookings, revenues, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and cash flow from operations. In fact, each of these reached record levels in fiscal 2011. We also had strong double-digit growth for the year in total bookings, ESM license bookings, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and cash flow from operations.
Second, during fiscal 2011, we demonstrated our ability to grow earnings and cash flow from operations, while at the same time making the investments in internal development, sales and services necessary to maintain and build our competitive advantage. These investments reflect our view that there are substantial market opportunities ahead and our desire to ensure that we are properly positioned to capture them. 
With that, let me review our financial results for the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year in more detail. Non-GAAP operating income increased 23% from $161 million to $197 million in the fourth quarter compared to a year-ago period. Our fourth quarter non-GAAP operating margin was 35%, up 2 points from the year-ago quarter. For the full year, we achieved non-GAAP operating income of $733 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin for fiscal 2011 was 35%, the same as in fiscal year 2010. Please refer to Slide 5 for our selected non-GAAP financial information, which includes segment operating margin of our ESM and MSM business units.
ESM's non-GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter increased to $67 million, up 32% from the year-ago period. ESM's non-GAAP operating margin increased year-over-year by 2 percentage points to 19%. For the full fiscal year, ESM's non-GAAP operating income increased by 17% to $280 million. ESM's non-GAAP operating margin increased by 1 percentage point in fiscal year 2011 to 22%. As we've noted, we plan to continue to make investments in our ESM business as we look to expand our growth opportunities while continuing to deliver increased earnings.
MSM's non-GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter was $130 million, up 18% from the year-ago period, and its non-GAAP operating margin increased 5 percentage points to 61%. For the full year, MSM's non-GAAP operating income was $453 million, up 4%, and its non-GAAP operating margin was 58%, up 1 percentage point compared to the year ago. We remain focused on maintaining strong operating margins within our MSM business unit.
Our non-GAAP net earnings for the fourth quarter were $141 million, up 17% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.78, which reflects a non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter of 29%. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was higher than previous quarters and was higher than our full year expectation due to the change in the geographic mix of profits. This higher-than-expected non-GAAP tax rate in the fourth quarter negatively impacted our non-GAAP results by $0.05 in the quarter. 
For fiscal 2011, non-GAAP net earnings were $546 million, an increase of 10% compared to $496 million in fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the year was a company record at $2.99, up 12% compared to the prior year. This reflects a non-GAAP effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 of 25%. These non-GAAP results reflect diluted shares outstanding for both the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year of 182 million versus 186 million and 187 million in the respective year-ago periods.
GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter was $142 million compared to $116 million in the year-ago period. GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share were $123 million and $0.67 compared to $119 million and $0.64 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, respectively. GAAP operating income in fiscal 2011 was $533 million compared with $506 million in fiscal 2010. GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year were $456 million and $2.50 per diluted share versus $406 million and $2.17 per diluted share in 2010. Fourth quarter and full fiscal year GAAP net earnings were positively impacted by a net income tax benefit of $25 million and $57 million, respectively, in connection with tax authority settlements related to prior year's tax matters. These tax benefits were excluded from our non-GAAP results.
Turning now to bookings. Total bookings for the fourth quarter were $708 million, representing an increase of 21% compared to the year-ago period. On a constant-currency basis, fourth quarter bookings increased 18%. Total bookings for fiscal 2011 were a company record $2.2 billion, up $251 million or 13% as reported and on a constant currency basis compared to fiscal 2010. The weighted average contract length for total bookings on a trailing 12-month basis was 2.17 years, up 2% from 2.12 years in the year-ago period. After normalizing for contract length, trailing 12-month annualized bookings for the fourth quarter were $1 billion, up 10% from the year-ago period. Please refer to Slide 7 in our presentation. 
Now let me turn to the performance of each of our business units. Total ESM license bookings were $162 million in the fourth quarter, up 18% from the year-ago period. For fiscal 2011, total ESM license bookings were $571 million, up 21% from fiscal 2010. Our performance was balanced across each of our product disciplines with growth and license bookings ranging from 15% to 35%. 
Turning to the MSM business unit. We believe MSM is best evaluated on the basis of total and annualized bookings over the trailing 12 months. Total MSM bookings for fiscal 2011 increased 4% to $843 million and had an average contract length of 2.9 years. After normalizing for contract length, total annualized MSM bookings for the trailing 12 months were $290 million, up 4%.
Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the quarter was $562 million, a 14% increase on both a reported and constant currency basis compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. ESM and MSM total revenue for the quarter increased 18% and 9%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Total revenue for the year was a company record at $2.1 billion, increasing 8% on a reported and constant currency basis. ESM and MSM total revenue for the year increased 12% and 2%, respectively, compared to fiscal 2010. License revenue in the fourth quarter was $251 million, up 24% from a year ago. ESM license revenue was $158 million, up 27%, while MSM license revenue was $93 million, up 20% from last year. For fiscal 2011, license revenue rose 14% to $865 million. 
For the fourth quarter, maintenance revenue was $259 million, an increase of 1% compared to a year ago. ESM maintenance revenue was $138 million, up 1%, and MSM maintenance revenue was $121 million, up 2% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. For fiscal 2011, maintenance revenue was flat at $1 billion. 
Professional Services revenue, which is included in the ESM segment, grew 51% from the year-ago period to $53 million in the fourth quarter. Professional Services revenue in fiscal 2011 increased by 37% to $177 million. The growth in our Professional Services business underscores our involvement in new cloud initiatives and the opportunity for continued license bookings growth, as enterprises move from proof-of-concept to fully deployed cloud solutions in their data centers.
Moving next to operating expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $365 million, up 10% from the year-ago period. The fourth quarter sequential increase in non-GAAP operating expenses reflects our typical seasonality. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the year were up 8% from the previous year. 
Looking at our business units, ESM non-GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $282 million compared to $245 million in the year-ago quarter. MSM non-GAAP operating expenses were $83 million compared to $85 million in the year-ago quarter. For fiscal 2011, ESM non-GAAP operating expenses were $1 billion compared to $902 million in fiscal 2010. MSM non-GAAP operating expenses were $334 million compared to $335 million in the previous year. Other income in the fourth quarter was $2 million, up 5% from the year-ago quarter. For the full fiscal year, other income was a loss of approximately $2 million, the same as in fiscal 2010. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. Total deferred license revenue at the end of the fourth quarter was a company record $686 million, up 4% sequentially and 10% year-over-year. During the quarter, we deferred $128 million of license revenue or 46% of license bookings and recorded $104 million of deferred license revenue from the balance sheet. Total deferred revenue increased by $146 million sequentially to $2 billion. The current portion of deferred revenue now stands at 53%. 
Our software development costs as of March 31 were $194 million as we capitalized $29 million and amortized $21 million during the quarter. For the fiscal year, we capitalized $123 million of software development costs and amortized $75 million. We expect gross capitalized software development costs to remain flat for fiscal 2012, while we expect the amortization of such costs to increase by approximately $20 million.  These estimates are incorporated into our 2012 expectations.
Cash and investments at March 31 totaled $1.8 billion, an increase of $156 million sequentially. Our net cash position was $1.4 billion at March 31, 2011. For the quarter, cash flow from operations was $290 million. For fiscal 2011, cash flow from operations was a company record $765 million, up 20% from the prior year. 
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.9 million shares of our stock for a total cost of $140 million. For fiscal 2011, we repurchased 10.6 million shares at a cost of $439 million. We have 631 million remaining in our current share repurchase program as of March 31.
Let me summarize by saying that fiscal 2011 was a year of significant achievement for BMC. We achieved record levels of bookings, revenues, non-GAAP earnings and cash flow from operations. We enhanced our technology leadership and product portfolio through both internal development and selected strategic acquisitions. We strengthened our sales force, partnerships and alliances to reach more customers in more ways. All of these factors position us well in fiscal 2012. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for his concluding remarks and expectations for fiscal 2012."

As we've noted, fiscal 2012 is shaping up to be another year in which we expect to significantly increase shareholder value by driving increases in bookings, revenue, earnings and cash flow from operations. All the key factors are in place. The global economy is showing signs of improvement. Customer demand for agile, flexible IT infrastructures is strong, and we enjoy a leading position in our markets.
To capitalize on our recent success and to continue to position us well for the future, we are continuing to make strategic investments in growth opportunities. These key strategic investment areas include cloud, SaaS, Professional Services, alliances and partnerships as well as strategic acquisitions. In terms of what this means for our financial results, we expect non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $3.21 to $3.31 per share. At the midpoint, this would represent a 9% increase over last year. This includes approximately $0.02 dilution related to Coradiant. This range excludes an estimated $0.92 to $0.97 per share for non-GAAP adjustments, including expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation and severance, exit costs and related charges. 
The assumptions underlying our full year fiscal 2012 expectations include: total bookings growth in the low double digits; ESM license bookings growth in the low 20s; MSM total bookings growth in the mid-single digits; revenue growth in the high single digits to low double digits; operating margin staying the same with the prior year, which reflects the dilution related to the acquisition of Coradiant, the impact from net capitalized software development costs, the fact that ESM continues to represent a higher proportion of our business and our investment in key strategic areas, a slight increase in the license bookings ratable rate, currency impact at today's rates and other income, weighted shares outstanding and a non-GAAP tax rate at levels similar to fiscal 2011. 
We expect full year fiscal 2012 cash flow from operations to be between $825 million and $875 million, which represents an 11% improvement at the midpoint. 
With that, we will now turn the call over to questions. Operator?"

The average cloud deal, so we've been selling true cloud architecture, our CLM product line is part of that, for about 3 quarters now. And between Q3 and Q4, the ASPs for that business doubled. We're seeing people come back to the well. As you know, when cloud first goes in some of these large enterprises, it's done. It's almost like proof-of-concept. They want to stand up just enough to prove it can work. And then the way that the contract is structured or the way the customers' intentions are designed is to come back to us as this thing begins to scale and buy more capacity and we see more revenue. So for instance, one of our largest deals this quarter, a deal with a -- that we name by name, which is a large global systems integrator and outsourcer who's setting up a cloud for U.S. Federal, came back -- our first cloud transaction with them was in Q2. They came back this quarter. We had an 8-figure transaction for cloud that included our Cloud Lifecycle Manager that was on top of the VCE architecture that -- it was obviously a large deal. So we're starting to see cloud deals go from proof-of-concepts to production. We're seeing our ASPs in some our SaaS offerings going up. We've had a number of 6-figure transactions on RemedyForce, as an example, begin to go up. And as you heard in the prepared remarks, the number of $1 million transaction is going up as customers basically standardize on our whole BSM concept and say, ""We're going to go with this idea of really managing IT-as-a-service."" And so kind of the vision is paying off, cloud accelerated it. And our sales -- and really I've got to take my hat off to our sales organization, our sales organization in the last year has been really focused in training, heavily training on building that pipeline and telling the story. And now that's really starting to come in for us."

It's well inside of our target ranges and what we hoped it would be. In some geographies, it's actually so low, we're taking a look at that. So with the attrition rates under control and with the fact that we do plan on continuing to invest and add more sales capacity, with the fact that those sales people -- because of the big turnover we had a couple of years ago, you have sales people who are now a year or 2, some cases 3 years into the territories being trained. You're really starting to get into some better productivity assumptions around sales people who are really beginning to hit their stride. So we'll have a more mature, better-educated, longer-tenured sales force. We have attrition under control and we're going to be adding heads, and we've also got our training programs pretty well lined up. So I guess that would answer the question hopefully on sales. And Steve, I'll hand it to you."

I mean, we were having to feel our way through helping the customer set up the architecture, implementing the software. We were Version 1, if that, of our software. We're now at Version 2 of our Cloud Lifecycle Manager. So we just did a deal this last quarter that was in 90 days from selling the cloud solution to the customer to standing the cloud up into production. And part of that is because the money we've been spending on tightening up our methodologies and our training programs. So some of the investments we've been making there is going to come home and help continue to make us more profitable in the years ahead. We still have more work to do there, though."

Going forward, we're looking for a slight increase in that deferral rate, which will also, as we grow our license bookings, will cause the absolute dollar deferral to be even greater in next fiscal year.

I'm telling you, it's one of the most exciting products I've seen since I've been with the company, and we'd be happy to give -- set up demonstrations for some of you if you'd like to see what I'm talking about. And that's what this group's been trained on. So I think the energy and the excitement in the sales force going forward is very strong. In terms of who we're bumping heads with, it's the usual suspects on -- we come at it in kind of -- we break it down into multiple sectors. First, we go after the telcos and the service providers. In that marketplace, those are big fish, and that is -- Cisco certainly is still helping us in these large telcos. We're doing very well against the competition. I don't know that we've lost a large telco that I can think of or service provider yet. We're winning those. There's probably one I don't know about that we've lost, but I don't know it. And so we're very strong there. We will compete with IBM. We'll compete, and they come in with kind of their blue-washing where they come in with an army of people and say, ""Don't worry about how it works. Just hire us and we'll make it work."" We compete with Hewlett-Packard, of course, who has many of the components. We don't see CA much in the larger deals. We see CA when we do see them more targeting SMB kind of mid-market service providers and those sort of things with one of their acquisitions. And that's the only place we see them in the space. VMware, we were asked about, and we really don't so much compete with VMware. The answer hasn't changed on that in a number of quarters. They have certain things that they do for their environment, but we deliver a complete management environment. You look at the Red Hat announcement today.  That's really a good example of the differentiation. We're integrating into their virtualization with our management environment, so customers can get a very fast deployed managed environment. So there's some fuzz around VMware, but really it's the vast majority of the revenue we're driving, is sitting on top of their platforms in the cloud space. And as I mentioned, that big 8-figure transaction was sitting on top of the VCE platform just this quarter. So at present, they're not a material competitor in almost any respect. But it's the usual suspects. Did I answer your question?"

And again, considering the fact that our products, we're just ramping up, I'm very pleased with that. We've got a lot of focus, dedicated focus. Our friends at Salesforce are very focused on it right now. I've been the meeting fairly often with the General Manager of the RemedyForce business unit over at Salesforce, and we've just closed multiple 6-figure transactions with help from our friends at Salesforce.

We're already beginning to offer that to our customers. And in fact, one of our large accounts that we just recently won in the meeting with a customer about a week before we closed Coradiant was talking to us about Coradiant and said, ""You guys really ought to go buy this company because it fits so beautifully into your story and your message."" And so our sales rep didn't know we were negotiating, sent an e-mail up saying, ""I don't know who Coradiant is, but my customer just said we should buy them."" So that story was told in front of our sales force. We got a lot of energy around it. This plugs straight in to our traditional sales model. The sales reps will eat it up. This is right down the alley for them. By the way, if you look at our last 8 acquisitions in the last 3.5 years or so since really the automation acquisitions, you're looking at a growth rate that is on average north of 50%. So we don't have any acquisitions that are underperforming. They're all doing very well.

And we a little bit missed out on that phase as a company and made the decision to wait. But we saw what was coming with new Web architectures and kind of Web 2.0 architectures, and kind of waited until we found what we thought would kind of be the big winner in that space and this new architecture. And so that's how we moved into that space. I think, in general, I don't know that I can tell you anything you don't already know that the amount of SaaS applications that are going to be deployed is shooting up, the amount of cloud in general is shooting up. And APM, Application Performance Management, that can see through the cloud and can really give you what that customer's real experience is, not a synthetic transaction, which by the way can be fooled, but a real report on how your customers are actually seeing the performance of those applications is absolutely critical. So I think everyone recognizes that, that's deploying these new generation apps and is asking for that capability. But they want more than that. They need to seek -- they need to integrate things like our capacity planning tools into that. So that as you're watching performance, you can begin to see the performance is beginning to degrade, you can model what happens if the transaction volume increases 10% or 20% and you can model different scenarios, and this is where like our Neptuny acquisition comes in. And you can begin to say, ""We're going to have -- we're going to forecast our performance problem for this if we don't take action."" Then BMC's automation tools can kick in and actually take the action necessary to remediate in advance of the performance problem. So we're really giving the customers the ability to see the problem, to forecast a problem before it occurs, see it if it does occur, take the action that's necessary to fix it or to keep it from occurring and do all that in concept of this new architectural design. It may be cloud or may be traditional. And there's a lot of excitement, a lot of energy around that."

Part 2 is that we've got some deals we're working this fiscal year that I just visited with a customer that looked very much on track to occur. In fact in some cases, in one case, I think the deal just got larger when I was there on Friday, that will happen this BMC fiscal year.

These strong results underscore the success of our strategy over the last several years to make disciplined investments that enhance our market leadership and enable us to accelerate top line growth. 
As part of this strategy, we strengthened our sales force, increased internal R&D efforts related to cloud and other major technology trends, selectively acquired complementary technologies in rapidly growing market segments and bolstered our strategic partnerships. These initiatives are clearly paying off, and we expect to reap additional benefits in 2012 and beyond.
Let me turn next to our fourth quarter performance, which enabled us to end fiscal '11 on a very strong note. Total bookings for the quarter were up 21%, license bookings rose 16%, revenue increased 14%, non-GAAP operating income was up 23% and non-GAAP diluted EPS was up 20%. For both the full year and the fourth quarter, we continued to see very good performance across both of our business units, all key product lines and all major geographies. 
ESM license bookings were up 21% for the year and 18% for the fourth quarter. Our ESM growth reflects, in part, our success in strengthening our ESM sales organization. We met our fiscal 2011 goal to achieve a 20% increase in the average productive sales headcount compared to the prior year. I'm also pleased that we saw a significant decline in attrition rates in our ESM sales organization during the fiscal 2011 compared to a year ago, and we're expecting further declines in attrition rates in fiscal 2012. That's one reason we continue to win a greater number of larger, multi-discipline platform deals. 
The number of ESM license transactions over $1 million increased 36% for the year and 55% for the quarter. This dynamic is also creating opportunities for our professional services team, which we increasingly capitalized on during fiscal 2011. Professional services revenue rose 51% for the quarter and 37% for the full year. The number of midsized deals, which demonstrates how we are increasing our footprint, also increased. Transactions between $500,000 and $1 million were up 10% and 6% for the year and quarter, respectively. Key wins during the quarter include Harris Corporation, Unisys and FINRA, the U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. These were all multi-discipline platform wins. 
Our MSM business continues to perform very well, with strong double-digit growth in the annual spend rate of our top 15 MSM transactions in Q4. The growth was broad-based, with 13 of the top 15 customers increasing their annual spend with MSM. In fact, the growth in the annual spend rate of MSM's top 15 transactions was strong for the full fiscal year. 
Over the year, we grew the spend rate on our top 15 MSM transactions each quarter in the mid-teens. We also saw continued strength in new product sales and growth in capacity upgrades. The increase in annual spend rate for these larger transactions reflects our success in managing and expanding our relationships with MSM's customers. Some of this is due to our increased focus and our success on winning competitive replacements, as well as expanding our customers' use of products that help drive efficiency in their IT operations. 
During the quarter, we added 122 new product placements in our existing installed base. And over the course of fiscal 2011, we added a total of over 350 new product placements to existing customers. Some key mainframe customer wins in Q4 included Bank of America and Nationwide Insurance. 
As you know, workload automation, which includes our BMC Control-M product line, is about 1/3 of our MSM business. We continue to see strength in this business with Control-M bookings growth in the mid-single digits during fiscal 2011. Over the past year, we added 88 new BMC Control-M customers and expanded our existing relationships with 195 new product placements. This includes 33 new customers and 66 new product placements in the fourth quarter. Some key workload automation wins in the fourth quarter included the Social Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service. So that's a snapshot of our business unit performance in the quarter and the year. 
Now let's talk about the dynamics of our market. One of the most important solutions IT can offer is to develop a flexible infrastructure, one that provides the right type and level of services at the right cost. In fact, it's interesting to note that in a recent Gartner webinar titled ""Reimagining IT: The 2011 CIO Agenda,"" that Mark MacDonald delivered on March 16, global CIOs were asked what their top 3 strategies were for 2011. Number one on that list for the first time was developing and managing a flexible IT infrastructure. In one year's time, it jumped from eighth on the list to the #1 spot. The reasons for this are clear. In a competitive global business environment, IT needs to be structured, managed, staffed and deployed as a service, a service that business managers can leverage to achieve their goals and objectives. 
That's exactly what BMC does. BMC is in the business of building agile, flexible IT infrastructures. We allow IT to offer a service platform that enables enterprises to align and manage their technology resources more quickly, efficiently and productively. Furthermore, with our platform, the underlying resources to deliver the services can be dynamically brokered, further driving down the total cost of their services. The evolution and growth of cloud computing is one very visible manifestation of the drive for a more flexible IT infrastructure. As you know, clouds offer a way to significantly increase flexibility while containing or even reducing costs. And as you also know, BMC helps to build and manage clouds for enterprises, governments and service providers. 
Our leadership in building and managing practical and robust private, public and hybrid clouds is evident in the growing number of cloud-related deals that we've won. Over the course of fiscal 2011, we had nearly 50 cloud solution wins. These wins include global Fortune 2000 companies, such as AXA and Pfizer, as well as many of the world's largest telcos and service providers. Our continuing success in the marketplace reflects the strong commitment we're making to enhance our technology leadership and product capabilities. 
During the past year, we introduced a new Cloud Lifecycle Management solution as well as new BMC Control-M self-service solutions. Both of these products were developed by our in-house R&D teams, and they are two of the most successful products launched in our company's recent history. We're very happy with the success of our organic R&D innovation, and it will remain a key focus for us as it provides us with a clear competitive advantage.
Another competitive advantage is our ability to acquire and integrate complementary technologies. After the close of the fourth quarter, we announced the purchase of Coradiant. This deal represents a major step forward and makes us a clear leader in next-generation applications performance management. Coradiant provides us with state-of-the-art end-user experience monitoring for enterprise, SaaS and cloud-based applications. 
During fiscal year 2011, we acquired 2 businesses that support our technology strategy. The first, GridApp Systems, focuses on automating database provisioning across operating systems. The second, the software business of Neptuny, extended BMC's existing leadership in physical and virtual capacity management. These 2 transactions, like others that we have made recently, are performing very well. 
While our success in helping customers build and manage cloud demonstrates one important way we're helping drive a more flexible infrastructure, it's equally important to remember that there are other ways. This includes our Software-as-a-Service offerings. Remedy OnDemand enables customers to access our full ITIL-based industry leading suite of service desk offerings. Our RemedyForce offering, which is marketed and sold by both salesforce.com and directly by BMC, is a powerful, easy-to-use solution for customers looking for a service desk that's built natively on top of the salesforce platform, Force.com. 
You'll remember that just one year ago back in fiscal 2010, fourth quarter, we launched our initial SaaS offering. In the past year, we have generated nearly 100 SaaS wins from both Remedy OnDemand and RemedyForce offerings. 34 of these wins were in the fourth quarter alone, demonstrating accelerating momentum on both offerings. New SaaS wins in the quarter include Source Buyer and the Texas Department of State Health Services. 
Our partner ecosystem continues to expand and deliver value to our customers and our shareholders. The strategic alliance with Cisco on their Integrated Cloud Delivery Platform is an example of our partner strategy at work. This alliance is focused on enabling service providers to develop flexible infrastructure and cloud offerings for their customers. BMC technology is at the heart of this platform, and we're very pleased with its reception in the marketplace.
There are other examples of how we're working to enable enterprises to develop a more flexible infrastructure. Our broad portfolio and heterogeneous approach to IT management naturally aligns us with the global partner community ranging from Accenture to CSC to Dell to Wipro. Just today, we announced an expanded partnership with Red Hat to deliver a joint offering coupling Red Hat's virtualization and cloud platform with BMC's Cloud Lifecycle Management suite. These alliances create powerful, practical, complete offerings for our customers, and they enable our partners to offer managed services to their customers to build clouds for their own use and to resell our professional services and technology. Our focus here and across the board is enabling our customers to optimize their IT investments by leveraging new ways of doing business, virtualization, cloud computing, Software-as-a-Service, mobility and other technologies that increase the speed, responsiveness, efficiency and productivity of their business.
As we move through fiscal 2012, the demand from enterprises for a more flexible IT infrastructure remains strong. We're seeing it across geographic regions and industry segments. We're also seeing it across larger and smaller enterprises. We believe this demand will fundamentally transform IT management in the years ahead. 
As I have noted, we're very well positioned amidst this change to capture the market opportunities that lie ahead. From a financial standpoint, we have a healthy, growing stream of bookings, revenue, cash flow and earnings, as well as a very strong balance sheet. From a technology standpoint, we have the highest performance and best integrated portfolio of IT management solutions. We're making smart investments in both internal development and external acquisitions to maintain and grow our competitive edge. From a sales and marketing standpoint, we have a strong and growing footprint that enables us to reach an increasing number of customers around the world. And from a management standpoint, we have a clearly defined strategy for success and the commitment and expertise required to execute on it.
All of these factors make us quite optimistic about fiscal 2012, which we enter with great momentum. As we move forward, I believe we will look back on the year we just closed as a pivotal year, a year when the company transitioned from being a strong, moderate-growth company to one characterized by sustained, accelerating growth, led by a solid ESM engine capable of delivering ongoing double-digit growth. 
I'll have more to say on our expectations for fiscal 2012 in a few minutes. But first, Steve Solcher will provide you with a more detailed financial review."
25673,129708262,123061,"BMC Software Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, May 04, 2011",2011-05-04,"Earnings Calls","BMC Software, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bob. I would like to start by adding to Bob's comments about our performance for the year. First, as you know, we met or exceeded our fiscal 2011 expectations in terms of total bookings, ESM license bookings, MSM total bookings, revenues, non-G",1733,"Thank you, Bob. I would like to start by adding to Bob's comments about our performance for the year. First, as you know, we met or exceeded our fiscal 2011 expectations in terms of total bookings, ESM license bookings, MSM total bookings, revenues, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and cash flow from operations. In fact, each of these reached record levels in fiscal 2011. We also had strong double-digit growth for the year in total bookings, ESM license bookings, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and cash flow from operations.
Second, during fiscal 2011, we demonstrated our ability to grow earnings and cash flow from operations, while at the same time making the investments in internal development, sales and services necessary to maintain and build our competitive advantage. These investments reflect our view that there are substantial market opportunities ahead and our desire to ensure that we are properly positioned to capture them. 
With that, let me review our financial results for the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year in more detail. Non-GAAP operating income increased 23% from $161 million to $197 million in the fourth quarter compared to a year-ago period. Our fourth quarter non-GAAP operating margin was 35%, up 2 points from the year-ago quarter. For the full year, we achieved non-GAAP operating income of $733 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin for fiscal 2011 was 35%, the same as in fiscal year 2010. Please refer to Slide 5 for our selected non-GAAP financial information, which includes segment operating margin of our ESM and MSM business units.
ESM's non-GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter increased to $67 million, up 32% from the year-ago period. ESM's non-GAAP operating margin increased year-over-year by 2 percentage points to 19%. For the full fiscal year, ESM's non-GAAP operating income increased by 17% to $280 million. ESM's non-GAAP operating margin increased by 1 percentage point in fiscal year 2011 to 22%. As we've noted, we plan to continue to make investments in our ESM business as we look to expand our growth opportunities while continuing to deliver increased earnings.
MSM's non-GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter was $130 million, up 18% from the year-ago period, and its non-GAAP operating margin increased 5 percentage points to 61%. For the full year, MSM's non-GAAP operating income was $453 million, up 4%, and its non-GAAP operating margin was 58%, up 1 percentage point compared to the year ago. We remain focused on maintaining strong operating margins within our MSM business unit.
Our non-GAAP net earnings for the fourth quarter were $141 million, up 17% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.78, which reflects a non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter of 29%. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was higher than previous quarters and was higher than our full year expectation due to the change in the geographic mix of profits. This higher-than-expected non-GAAP tax rate in the fourth quarter negatively impacted our non-GAAP results by $0.05 in the quarter. 
For fiscal 2011, non-GAAP net earnings were $546 million, an increase of 10% compared to $496 million in fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the year was a company record at $2.99, up 12% compared to the prior year. This reflects a non-GAAP effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 of 25%. These non-GAAP results reflect diluted shares outstanding for both the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year of 182 million versus 186 million and 187 million in the respective year-ago periods.
GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter was $142 million compared to $116 million in the year-ago period. GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share were $123 million and $0.67 compared to $119 million and $0.64 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, respectively. GAAP operating income in fiscal 2011 was $533 million compared with $506 million in fiscal 2010. GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year were $456 million and $2.50 per diluted share versus $406 million and $2.17 per diluted share in 2010. Fourth quarter and full fiscal year GAAP net earnings were positively impacted by a net income tax benefit of $25 million and $57 million, respectively, in connection with tax authority settlements related to prior year's tax matters. These tax benefits were excluded from our non-GAAP results.
Turning now to bookings. Total bookings for the fourth quarter were $708 million, representing an increase of 21% compared to the year-ago period. On a constant-currency basis, fourth quarter bookings increased 18%. Total bookings for fiscal 2011 were a company record $2.2 billion, up $251 million or 13% as reported and on a constant currency basis compared to fiscal 2010. The weighted average contract length for total bookings on a trailing 12-month basis was 2.17 years, up 2% from 2.12 years in the year-ago period. After normalizing for contract length, trailing 12-month annualized bookings for the fourth quarter were $1 billion, up 10% from the year-ago period. Please refer to Slide 7 in our presentation. 
Now let me turn to the performance of each of our business units. Total ESM license bookings were $162 million in the fourth quarter, up 18% from the year-ago period. For fiscal 2011, total ESM license bookings were $571 million, up 21% from fiscal 2010. Our performance was balanced across each of our product disciplines with growth and license bookings ranging from 15% to 35%. 
Turning to the MSM business unit. We believe MSM is best evaluated on the basis of total and annualized bookings over the trailing 12 months. Total MSM bookings for fiscal 2011 increased 4% to $843 million and had an average contract length of 2.9 years. After normalizing for contract length, total annualized MSM bookings for the trailing 12 months were $290 million, up 4%.
Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the quarter was $562 million, a 14% increase on both a reported and constant currency basis compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. ESM and MSM total revenue for the quarter increased 18% and 9%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Total revenue for the year was a company record at $2.1 billion, increasing 8% on a reported and constant currency basis. ESM and MSM total revenue for the year increased 12% and 2%, respectively, compared to fiscal 2010. License revenue in the fourth quarter was $251 million, up 24% from a year ago. ESM license revenue was $158 million, up 27%, while MSM license revenue was $93 million, up 20% from last year. For fiscal 2011, license revenue rose 14% to $865 million. 
For the fourth quarter, maintenance revenue was $259 million, an increase of 1% compared to a year ago. ESM maintenance revenue was $138 million, up 1%, and MSM maintenance revenue was $121 million, up 2% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. For fiscal 2011, maintenance revenue was flat at $1 billion. 
Professional Services revenue, which is included in the ESM segment, grew 51% from the year-ago period to $53 million in the fourth quarter. Professional Services revenue in fiscal 2011 increased by 37% to $177 million. The growth in our Professional Services business underscores our involvement in new cloud initiatives and the opportunity for continued license bookings growth, as enterprises move from proof-of-concept to fully deployed cloud solutions in their data centers.
Moving next to operating expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $365 million, up 10% from the year-ago period. The fourth quarter sequential increase in non-GAAP operating expenses reflects our typical seasonality. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the year were up 8% from the previous year. 
Looking at our business units, ESM non-GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $282 million compared to $245 million in the year-ago quarter. MSM non-GAAP operating expenses were $83 million compared to $85 million in the year-ago quarter. For fiscal 2011, ESM non-GAAP operating expenses were $1 billion compared to $902 million in fiscal 2010. MSM non-GAAP operating expenses were $334 million compared to $335 million in the previous year. Other income in the fourth quarter was $2 million, up 5% from the year-ago quarter. For the full fiscal year, other income was a loss of approximately $2 million, the same as in fiscal 2010. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. Total deferred license revenue at the end of the fourth quarter was a company record $686 million, up 4% sequentially and 10% year-over-year. During the quarter, we deferred $128 million of license revenue or 46% of license bookings and recorded $104 million of deferred license revenue from the balance sheet. Total deferred revenue increased by $146 million sequentially to $2 billion. The current portion of deferred revenue now stands at 53%. 
Our software development costs as of March 31 were $194 million as we capitalized $29 million and amortized $21 million during the quarter. For the fiscal year, we capitalized $123 million of software development costs and amortized $75 million. We expect gross capitalized software development costs to remain flat for fiscal 2012, while we expect the amortization of such costs to increase by approximately $20 million.  These estimates are incorporated into our 2012 expectations.
Cash and investments at March 31 totaled $1.8 billion, an increase of $156 million sequentially. Our net cash position was $1.4 billion at March 31, 2011. For the quarter, cash flow from operations was $290 million. For fiscal 2011, cash flow from operations was a company record $765 million, up 20% from the prior year. 
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.9 million shares of our stock for a total cost of $140 million. For fiscal 2011, we repurchased 10.6 million shares at a cost of $439 million. We have 631 million remaining in our current share repurchase program as of March 31.
Let me summarize by saying that fiscal 2011 was a year of significant achievement for BMC. We achieved record levels of bookings, revenues, non-GAAP earnings and cash flow from operations. We enhanced our technology leadership and product portfolio through both internal development and selected strategic acquisitions. We strengthened our sales force, partnerships and alliances to reach more customers in more ways. All of these factors position us well in fiscal 2012. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for his concluding remarks and expectations for fiscal 2012."

As we've noted, fiscal 2012 is shaping up to be another year in which we expect to significantly increase shareholder value by driving increases in bookings, revenue, earnings and cash flow from operations. All the key factors are in place. The global economy is showing signs of improvement. Customer demand for agile, flexible IT infrastructures is strong, and we enjoy a leading position in our markets.
To capitalize on our recent success and to continue to position us well for the future, we are continuing to make strategic investments in growth opportunities. These key strategic investment areas include cloud, SaaS, Professional Services, alliances and partnerships as well as strategic acquisitions. In terms of what this means for our financial results, we expect non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $3.21 to $3.31 per share. At the midpoint, this would represent a 9% increase over last year. This includes approximately $0.02 dilution related to Coradiant. This range excludes an estimated $0.92 to $0.97 per share for non-GAAP adjustments, including expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation and severance, exit costs and related charges. 
The assumptions underlying our full year fiscal 2012 expectations include: total bookings growth in the low double digits; ESM license bookings growth in the low 20s; MSM total bookings growth in the mid-single digits; revenue growth in the high single digits to low double digits; operating margin staying the same with the prior year, which reflects the dilution related to the acquisition of Coradiant, the impact from net capitalized software development costs, the fact that ESM continues to represent a higher proportion of our business and our investment in key strategic areas, a slight increase in the license bookings ratable rate, currency impact at today's rates and other income, weighted shares outstanding and a non-GAAP tax rate at levels similar to fiscal 2011. 
We expect full year fiscal 2012 cash flow from operations to be between $825 million and $875 million, which represents an 11% improvement at the midpoint. 
With that, we will now turn the call over to questions. Operator?"

So first on the deal side, I'll give you just one example of it. The average cloud deal, so we've been selling true cloud architecture, our CLM product line is part of that, for about 3 quarters now.

The average cloud deal, so we've been selling true cloud architecture, our CLM product line is part of that, for about 3 quarters now. And between Q3 and Q4, the ASPs for that business doubled. We're seeing people come back to the well. As you know, when cloud first goes in some of these large enterprises, it's done. It's almost like proof-of-concept. They want to stand up just enough to prove it can work. And then the way that the contract is structured or the way the customers' intentions are designed is to come back to us as this thing begins to scale and buy more capacity and we see more revenue. So for instance, one of our largest deals this quarter, a deal with a -- that we name by name, which is a large global systems integrator and outsourcer who's setting up a cloud for U.S. Federal, came back -- our first cloud transaction with them was in Q2. They came back this quarter. We had an 8-figure transaction for cloud that included our Cloud Lifecycle Manager that was on top of the VCE architecture that -- it was obviously a large deal. So we're starting to see cloud deals go from proof-of-concepts to production. We're seeing our ASPs in some our SaaS offerings going up. We've had a number of 6-figure transactions on RemedyForce, as an example, begin to go up. And as you heard in the prepared remarks, the number of $1 million transaction is going up as customers basically standardize on our whole BSM concept and say, ""We're going to go with this idea of really managing IT-as-a-service."" And so kind of the vision is paying off, cloud accelerated it. And our sales -- and really I've got to take my hat off to our sales organization, our sales organization in the last year has been really focused in training, heavily training on building that pipeline and telling the story. And now that's really starting to come in for us."

So on sales capacity, we're going to run basically the same play we ran last year. We will add high teens. It may not quite get to 20% right now. I think it's closer to 18%, 19% in terms of productive heads we plan on growing. One of the things that -- one of the advantages we have this year and I mentioned it in my comments, is that our attrition is well under control. Q4 was the lowest it's been in 2 years. It's well inside of our target ranges and what we hoped it would be. In some geographies, it's actually so low, we're taking a look at that. So with the attrition rates under control and with the fact that we do plan on continuing to invest and add more sales capacity, with the fact that those sales people -- because of the big turnover we had a couple of years ago, you have sales people who are now a year or 2, some cases 3 years into the territories being trained. You're really starting to get into some better productivity assumptions around sales people who are really beginning to hit their stride. So we'll have a more mature, better-educated, longer-tenured sales force. We have attrition under control and we're going to be adding heads, and we've also got our training programs pretty well lined up. So I guess that would answer the question hopefully on sales. And Steve, I'll hand it to you."

We're now at Version 2 of our Cloud Lifecycle Manager. So we just did a deal this last quarter that was in 90 days from selling the cloud solution to the customer to standing the cloud up into production. And part of that is because the money we've been spending on tightening up our methodologies and our training programs.

I'm telling you, it's one of the most exciting products I've seen since I've been with the company, and we'd be happy to give -- set up demonstrations for some of you if you'd like to see what I'm talking about. And that's what this group's been trained on. So I think the energy and the excitement in the sales force going forward is very strong. In terms of who we're bumping heads with, it's the usual suspects on -- we come at it in kind of -- we break it down into multiple sectors. First, we go after the telcos and the service providers. In that marketplace, those are big fish, and that is -- Cisco certainly is still helping us in these large telcos. We're doing very well against the competition. I don't know that we've lost a large telco that I can think of or service provider yet. We're winning those. There's probably one I don't know about that we've lost, but I don't know it. And so we're very strong there. We will compete with IBM. We'll compete, and they come in with kind of their blue-washing where they come in with an army of people and say, ""Don't worry about how it works. Just hire us and we'll make it work."" We compete with Hewlett-Packard, of course, who has many of the components. We don't see CA much in the larger deals. We see CA when we do see them more targeting SMB kind of mid-market service providers and those sort of things with one of their acquisitions. And that's the only place we see them in the space. VMware, we were asked about, and we really don't so much compete with VMware. The answer hasn't changed on that in a number of quarters. They have certain things that they do for their environment, but we deliver a complete management environment. You look at the Red Hat announcement today.  That's really a good example of the differentiation. We're integrating into their virtualization with our management environment, so customers can get a very fast deployed managed environment. So there's some fuzz around VMware, but really it's the vast majority of the revenue we're driving, is sitting on top of their platforms in the cloud space. And as I mentioned, that big 8-figure transaction was sitting on top of the VCE platform just this quarter. So at present, they're not a material competitor in almost any respect. But it's the usual suspects. Did I answer your question?"

The win rates are really going up very nicely now. It appears to us to be well north of 50% of the time. And again, considering the fact that our products, we're just ramping up, I'm very pleased with that. We've got a lot of focus, dedicated focus. Our friends at Salesforce are very focused on it right now. I've been the meeting fairly often with the General Manager of the RemedyForce business unit over at Salesforce, and we've just closed multiple 6-figure transactions with help from our friends at Salesforce.

And so our sales rep didn't know we were negotiating, sent an e-mail up saying, ""I don't know who Coradiant is, but my customer just said we should buy them."" So that story was told in front of our sales force. We got a lot of energy around it. This plugs straight in to our traditional sales model. The sales reps will eat it up. This is right down the alley for them. By the way, if you look at our last 8 acquisitions in the last 3.5 years or so since really the automation acquisitions, you're looking at a growth rate that is on average north of 50%. So we don't have any acquisitions that are underperforming. They're all doing very well.

Well, I think in general, a lot of the old APM products and products like Mercury or others that were designed kind of for a different architecture really don't scale, don't move to this new environment. And we a little bit missed out on that phase as a company and made the decision to wait. But we saw what was coming with new Web architectures and kind of Web 2.0 architectures, and kind of waited until we found what we thought would kind of be the big winner in that space and this new architecture. And so that's how we moved into that space. I think, in general, I don't know that I can tell you anything you don't already know that the amount of SaaS applications that are going to be deployed is shooting up, the amount of cloud in general is shooting up. And APM, Application Performance Management, that can see through the cloud and can really give you what that customer's real experience is, not a synthetic transaction, which by the way can be fooled, but a real report on how your customers are actually seeing the performance of those applications is absolutely critical. So I think everyone recognizes that, that's deploying these new generation apps and is asking for that capability. But they want more than that. They need to seek -- they need to integrate things like our capacity planning tools into that. So that as you're watching performance, you can begin to see the performance is beginning to degrade, you can model what happens if the transaction volume increases 10% or 20% and you can model different scenarios, and this is where like our Neptuny acquisition comes in. And you can begin to say, ""We're going to have -- we're going to forecast our performance problem for this if we don't take action."" Then BMC's automation tools can kick in and actually take the action necessary to remediate in advance of the performance problem. So we're really giving the customers the ability to see the problem, to forecast a problem before it occurs, see it if it does occur, take the action that's necessary to fix it or to keep it from occurring and do all that in concept of this new architectural design. It may be cloud or may be traditional. And there's a lot of excitement, a lot of energy around that."

I was in D.C. on Friday talking about some really nice transactions -- well, some nice ideas. I mean, I shouldn't call them transactions, some nice opportunities that we're working of quite some size. I think it's important to recognize that even though we've had really nice growth in Federal for quite some time, it's still only maybe 10% of our business in ESM. And so that's Part 1. Part 2 is that we've got some deals we're working this fiscal year that I just visited with a customer that looked very much on track to occur. In fact in some cases, in one case, I think the deal just got larger when I was there on Friday, that will happen this BMC fiscal year. And I also visited with some, as I mentioned, some very high-level buyers on some transactions that will work that probably would be more like next fiscal year. But that would be, if they happen, will be some of the larger deals that we've ever worked on. So I feel good about our Federal business.

25673,137262423,147235,"BMC Software Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2011",2011-07-27,"Earnings Calls","BMC Software, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Derrek, and thanks to all of you for joining us this afternoon. You've seen our first quarter results in the press release we issued earlier today. Our overall performance was solid with strong increases in bookings, revenue, non-GAAP earnings",1461,"Thank you, Derrek, and thanks to all of you for joining us this afternoon. You've seen our first quarter results in the press release we issued earlier today. Our overall performance was solid with strong increases in bookings, revenue, non-GAAP earnings and cash flow from operations. While ESM license bookings were flat, we saw continued growth in key business initiatives including our Cloud, Software-as-a-Service, Professional Services and MSM Solutions. Some highlights during the quarter.
Total bookings rose 39%. License bookings were up 43%. ESM license bookings were flat although the prior year. Was a quarter in which they rose 40%. MSM trailing 12-month bookings were up 25%. Revenue grew 9%. Non-GAAP operating income rose 9%. A non-GAAP diluted EPS was up 16% and operating cash flow was up 56%.
Now let me provide some additional perspective on our 2 business units beginning with ESM. ESM license bookings were flat in the first quarter and below our expectations. This reflects several factors. Most importantly, we had a difficult compare with the first quarter last year, a period in which we generated 40% growth in ESM license bookings. Contributing to that 40% growth last year were 4 large ESM license transactions, each of which were more than $3 million in license bookings fixed this includes a $15 million transaction from the prior quarter, which was closed minutes into the fiscal 2011 first quarter.
This quarter by contrast, we only had one that ESM license transactions over $3 million. I want to highlight that while we had fewer ESM license transactions over $3 million, we had a healthy increase in ESM license transactions over $1 million with 20 this year versus 14 a year ago. In addition for license transactions under $3 million, ESM license bookings increased 25% year-over-year.
In addition to the lack of large deals this quarter, we saw weakness in the U.S. Public Sector during the quarter. Finally for some of our larger transactions, we're seeing in selected cases an elongation in the selling process especially in Europe as customers take longer to evaluate the strategic investments they're making.
Some customers, for example, are inserting additional approval steps into their buying process. We saw that this last quarter. So to summarize, these factors, a tough compared, fewer larger transactions, some public-sector weakness and a longer sales cycle contributed to our ESM license bookings performance this quarter. Despite these challenges, our ESM business continued to capitalize on the opportunities resulting from key technology trends. Our Cloud and Software-as-a-service initiative against more traction in the marketplace and we want a number of additional customers around the world. In fact, during the first quarter, we had 21 Cloud Solutions wins. These include NBC Universal, University of Hong Kong and International which is Israel's leading edge at international leading to an issue for better. As a standard, we saw a 53% increase in the number of SaaS wins from our Remedy OnDemand and RemedyForce offerings. New SaaS wins during the first quarter included MIT, News International, System Independent School District and the Open University. New wins during the quarter included Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Micron Technologies, Nordstrom and Telstra.
Due in large part to the increased demand for cloud implementation, our professional services revenue rose 35% for the quarter and profitability improved. To help take our services organization to the next level of performance and delivery, we've hired a new VP of Global Services, Carlos Granda. Carlos is an experienced professional services executive who had leading roles at VMware, Oracle and BEA systems. We expect him to drive continued growth and operational excellence in services. We are also continuing to invest in our sales force. The number of sales reps that we hired in the first quarter increased on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. Due to a more competitive market for talent, we are a bit below where we'd like to be for hiring. Therefore, we now expect average productive sales headcount to be closer to 10% of the fiscal year compared to our original expectation of high teens. We plan to continue to hire aggressively in the second quarter.
The need for flexible, agile IT infrastructures remains high among enterprises. We continue to stack up very well against the competition and have seen is no change in our competitive positioning. I want to add that based on what we see in the marketplace in our pipeline, we remain positive about the rest of the year. We are not seeing signs of a broad-based slowdown in spending on IT.
While we remain positive about our outlook and competitive position, we are revising our fiscal year 2012 expectations for ESM license bookings growth from the low 20s as discussed in May to the midteens. This revised expectation reflects the lower number of productive sales headcount, negative currency impact on growth versus prior expectations, continued weakness in the public sector and some elongation of the sales cycle for very large transactions particularly in Europe.
Let me turn now to our products and our alliances. To enhance our technology leadership, we launched an important new portfolio of solutions that delivers the industry's most robust application performance management capability across physical, virtual, cloud and hybrid environments. These new solutions leverage our recent acquisition of Coradiant, which significantly enhance our BPM capabilities. We also recently acquired a row price, which provides the most widely the Floyd mobility solutions for our remedy IT service management suite. We continue to expand our partnerships and alliances announcing new strategic partnerships with Red Hat and Unisys and continued the momentum of strong relationships with Cisco, Salesforce.com, Accenture and others. I encourage you to review the progress we've made in this area found on our website at BMC.com/partners.
Let me now turn to our MSM business, which had a very strong performance during the quarter across the business as well as one large renewal.
Total MSM bookings for the trailing 12 months increased 25% to $990 million dollars. Total annualized MSM bookings for the trailing 12 months were up 15%. We continue to see strong double-digit growth in the annual's spend rate of our top 15 MSM transactions in the first quarter. During the quarter, we added 51 new product placements in our existing install base. Further we expanded our relationship with customers like Federal Express, Medicare Australia and Nissan. We also added 4 new menu customers including FedEx, replacing the competition in each instance. We saw continued strength in workload automation which includes our BMC Control-M product line. Workload automation is about 1/3 of our MSM business. We added 26 new BMC Control-M customers and expanded our existing relationships with 37 new product placements. Some key workload automation wins for the first quarter included Wendy's International and Hong Kong Electric Company. We believe the mainframe business continues to offer very good opportunities for us. In fact recently acquired a portfolio of IMS database products and customers from Neon Enterprise Software. The deal further enhances our IMS database management portfolio providing the most comprehensive solution set to best address today's IT challenges with big data. Database availability and data analysis all within organizations IMS environment. So that gives you a snapshot of our performance and key developments in the first quarter.
Let me wrap up my initial comments with a few important highlights. First, our market opportunity remains very strong. We believe there are important opportunities ahead for BMC to leverage its leadership in IT management as technology trends such as cloud computing drive customer purchasing decisions. Second, we are continuing to invest in our business to enhance that technology leadership, that means developing new products internally, acquiring new capabilities, tightly integrating them into our portfolio and partnering with other industry leaders to bring our solutions to market. Third, our management team is committed to and focused on executing our strategy for growth. We recently made a key leadership changed towards this end. I'm extremely happy to report that Paul [ph] who headed at ESM products and marketing has been promoted to Service President of our ESM business. Paul's leadership and operational skills have contributed greatly to our success over the past several years. I'm confident that under Paul's oversight, ESM will expand its market leadership in technology, sales, marketing and operations.
So in short, we have the market opportunity, the technology and the leadership in place for continued success. This success depends in large part on our ability to execute on a high-level and on a consistent basis. Based on what we're seeing today, our outlook for the remainder of the year continues to be quite positive. I'll provide you with our updated expectations for fiscal 2012 in a few minutes. But first, Steve Solcher will provide more detailed financial review of the quarter."
25673,137262423,147235,"BMC Software Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2011",2011-07-27,"Earnings Calls","BMC Software, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bob. In the first quarter, we had strong financial performance and year-over-year growth across most of our key metrics including total bookings, revenue, non-GAAP earnings per share and cash flow from operations. Our MSM business had a very so",1445,"Thank you, Bob. In the first quarter, we had strong financial performance and year-over-year growth across most of our key metrics including total bookings, revenue, non-GAAP earnings per share and cash flow from operations. Our MSM business had a very solid quarter and the strong growth on a trailing 12-month basis. While our ESM license bookings were flat year-over-year, we continue to see momentum across key areas of this business including cloud, Software-as-a-Service and Professional Services. We remain positive on our outlook for the fiscal year.
Although margins were flat year-over-year, it is important to point out that we had a $6 million headwind in the first quarter relating to more amortization of summer capitalization and we expect to have a similar headwind in the second quarter. In addition, our license bookings throughout the rate was 11 percentage points higher this quarter than in the prior period, driven by a higher dollar percentage of turn-based transactions. With those thoughts in mind, let me now turn to our financial results.
Non-GAAP operating income increased by 9% from $157 million to $171 million in the first quarter. Our first quarter non-GAAP operating margin was 34% flat with the year ago quarter. Please refer to Slide 5 in our presentation for selected non-GAAP financial information, which includes segment profitability of our ESM and MSM business units. ESM's non-GAAP operating income in the first quarter was $59 million, down 9% from the year ago period. ESM's non-GAAP operating margin declined year-over-year by 4 percentage points to 19%. As Bob mentioned earlier, we continue to make strategic investments in our ESM business unit. MSM's non-GAAP operating income in the first quarter was $111 million, up 22% from the year ago period, and its non-GAAP operating margin increased 5 percentage points to 57%. We remain focused on maintaining a strong operating margins within our MSM business units.
Our non-GAAP net earnings for the first quarter were $129 million, up 14% from the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the period was $0.72, which reflects a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 23% for the quarter. These non-GAAP results reflect diluted shares outstanding of the first quarter of $181 million versus $184 million in the year ago period. GAAP operating income in the first quarter was $115 million compared to $108 million in the year ago period. GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share were $96 million and $0.53 per diluted share compared with $93 million and $0.50 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2011, respectively. First quarter GAAP net earnings in fiscal 2012 and 2011 were positively impacted by net income tax benefits of $6 million and $14 million, respectively, in which are reported in connection with tax authority settlements related to prior year tax matters. These tax benefits were excluded from our non-GAAP results.
Turning now to bookings, total bookings for the first quarter were $615 million, representing an increase of 39% compared to the year ago period. On a constant currency basis, first quarter bookings increased 33%. Our bookings growth was positively impacted by a large multi-year transaction that was primarily a renewal within our MSM business. Total license bookings for the quarter increased by 43% year-over-year to $193 million. The weighted average contract length for total bookings and a trailing 12-month basis was 2.42 years, up 11% from 2.19 years in the year ago period. After normalizing for contract length, trailing 12-month annualized bookings for the first quarter were $978 million, up 7% from the year ago period. Please refer to Slide 7 in our presentation. Now let me turn to the performance of each of our business units. In the first quarter, total ESM license bookings were $101 million, flat with the year ago period. We see a solid pipeline entering the second quarter and expect a similar sequential growth as with the prior year as well as year-over-year growth in the second quarter.
Turning to the MSM business unit. Total MSM bookings for the trailing 12 months increased 25% to $990 million and had an average contract length of 3.3 years. On a constant currency basis, trailing 12-month MSM bookings were up 23%. Again, MSM bookings and the average contract length were impacted in the quarter by a large multiyear renewal. After normalizing for contract length, total annualized MSM bookings for the trailing 12 months were up 15% as reported and 30% on a constant currency basis to $301 million. Turning to revenue, total revenue for the quarter was $502 million, a 9% increase compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2011. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased 7%. License revenue in the first quarter was $190 million, up 11% from the year ago. ESM license revenue was $119 million, up 5% like MSM license revenue was $71 million and up 22% from the first quarter last year.
For the first quarter, maintenance revenue was $265 million, an increase of 4% compared to the year ago quarter and up $6 million sequentially. ESM maintenance revenue which was $141 million, up 3% and MSN maintenance revenue $123 million, up 6% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2011. We are pleased with both at the sequential and year-over-year growth and maintenance revenue across both our business units.
Professional Services revenue, which is included in the ESM segment grew 35% from the year ago period to $48 million in the first quarter. This business delivered a non-GAAP gross margin of 5%. We remain pleased with the transformation we are making in our Professional Services organization.
Moving next to operating expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter were $332 million, up 9% from the year ago period. On a constant currency basis, non-GAAP operating expenses were up 5% year-over-year. Looking at our business units, ESM's non-GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter were $249 million, up 13% from the year ago quarter. This increase reflects the impact of currency and the strategic investments we made in our ESM business, is we increased our expense run rates from acquisitions, added additional sales and services capacity and accelerated our internal development efforts around cloud and Software-as-a-Service. MSM's non-GAAP operating expenses were $83 million, flat compared to the year ago quarter. Other income in the first quarter was a loss of $2 million compared to a loss of $6 million in the year ago quarter. Now turning to the balance sheet, total deferred license revenues at the end of the first quarter was 689 million, up slightly sequentially and up 17% year-over-year. During the quarter, we deferred $106 million of license revenue or 55% of license bookings and recorded $104 million of deferred license revenue from the balance sheet. Total deferred revenue increased by $113 million sequentially to $2.1 billion. The current portion of deferred revenue now stands at 52%. Our net software development costs, where $202 million, a 4% increase over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 as we capitalized $31 million and amortized $23 million. For the year, we continue to expect net software capitalization to be down $20 million over the prior year. Cash and marketable securities at June  30th totaled $1.7 billion, a decrease of $78 million sequentially. Our net cash position was $1.3 billion at June 30. For the quarter, cash flow from operations was $261 million, up 56% from the year ago. Cash flow for the first quarter was positively impacted by a strong intra-quarter selections. By the end of the first half of fiscal 2012, we now expect to have approximately 43% of our full-year expectations for cash flow from operations. This is a 5 percentage points higher than last year.
During the first quarter, we repurchased 3.4 million shares of our stock for a total cost of $180 million. We now have for $450 million remaining in our current share repurchase program as of June 30. We also spent $151 million related to the acquisitions Coradiant Aero plus and the IMS assets for the Neon Software. Let me briefly sum up. From a total bookings, non-GAAP earnings per share in cash flow perspective our first quarter was strong. Our MSM business performed very well. While ESM license bookings were flat for difficult comparison, our ESM business was saw positive trends in key growing markets such as cloud and Software-as-a-Service. Our outlook for the remainder of the year remains positive. With our leadership position in key growth areas and the strategic investments we're making internal development and acquisitions, we are well positioned to capitalize on the market opportunities ahead of us. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for his concluding remarks."

I'd like to close by updating you on our view of the fiscal 2012. As we have noted, we expect the remainder of fiscal 2012 to be a period of strong growth particularly in the latter half of the year for ESM license bookings. We believe that the drive-by enterprises to upgrade more flexible, agile IT infrastructures is generating strong demand for our portfolio of integrated technology solutions. We are continuing to invest in higher growth, higher return areas of opportunity to enhance our leadership in the marketplace. In terms of the fiscal 2012 outlook, we now expect non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $3.25 $3.35 per share, which is $0.04 higher than our previous expectations provided in May. At the midpoint, this would represent a 10% increase over last year. This includes approximately $0.02 dilution related to Coradiant. This range excludes an estimated an $0.92 to $0.97 a share for non-GAAP adjustments including expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation and severance, exit costs and related charges. The assumptions underlying this full year fiscal 2012 estimate include total bookings growth in the low double digits with a SKU of full-year booking expected in the first half of the year to be similar to the prior year. ESM license bookings grow in the midteens. MSM total bookings growth in the high single digits, which is higher than our previous expectations of the mid-single digits. Revenue growth in the high single to low double digits operating margin, flat with the prior year, an increase in the license bookings ratable in comparison to prior year, currency impact at today's rates, which is a negative impact of about 1 point to the total book and revenue growth rates compared to our previous expectations, other income add a loss of approximately $8 million for the year, weighted shares outstanding slightly lower than the fiscal 112 and a non-GAAP tax rate of 24% for the year.
We continue to expect the full year fiscal 2011 cash flow from operations to be between $825 million and $875 million, which represents an 11% improvement over fiscal 2011 at the midpoint. With that, we will now turn the call over too questions. Operator?"

This Q4 was very strong, and we didn't have that this year.

Our briefing centers the deal we win, the customers validate consistently, our vision for how we're building out the management environment. Part of that solution is to give the customers the all-important aspect of how their customers, their end-users perceive their responsiveness. IT for years has reported on the components, this is network availability 5 9s. This is a server response time. But really, the only measure that matters of the business on online transactions is what the eyeballs of the end-user experience, and Coradiant really brings that to us so that we can roll out a self-service, self provisioning hybrid cloud environment to the customer with a service level agreement tied into that. Coradiant is one of the key components that will give us the ability to then report back to the customer on how is the end-user experiencing taking it, are they inside there some subsecond or they're 2 seconds or whatever they determine it to be response times, and when something does go wrong, how quickly can we determine exactly what is the root cause. And then perhaps another BMC products or lack of BladeLogic or perhaps our Remedy OnDemand trouble ticketing system will through the logic that manage the issue. It ties the products together and it adds that part of the total value equation that is in the end-user experience, where IT really delivers its value to its customers. So it's very important to us. It's one piece, it's not the total piece, but it's an important piece we're delivering on that."

You've seen our first quarter results in the press release we issued earlier today. Our overall performance was solid with strong increases in bookings, revenue, non-GAAP earnings",1455,"Thank you, Derrick, and thanks to all of you for joining us this afternoon. You've seen our first quarter results in the press release we issued earlier today. Our overall performance was solid with strong increases in bookings, revenue, non-GAAP earnings and cash flow from operations. While ESM license bookings were flat, we saw continued growth in key business initiatives, including our Cloud, Software-as-a-Service, Professional Services, and MSM Solutions. Some highlights during the quarter.
Total bookings rose 39%. License bookings were up 43%. ESM license bookings were flat although the prior year. Was a quarter in which they rose 40%. MSM trailing 12-month bookings were up 25%. Revenue grew 9%. Non-GAAP operating income rose 9%. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was up 16%,  and operating cash flow was up 56%.
Now let me provide some additional perspective on our 2 business units beginning with ESM. ESM license bookings were flat in the first quarter and below our expectations. This reflects several factors. Most importantly, we had a difficult compare with the first quarter last year, a period in which we generated 40% growth in ESM license bookings. Contributing to that 40% growth last year were 4 large ESM license transactions, each of which were more than $3 million in license bookings, this included a $15 million transaction from the prior quarter, which was closed minutes into the fiscal 2011 first quarter.
This quarter by contrast, we only had one ESM licensed transaction over $3 million. I want to highlight that while we had fewer ESM license transactions over $3 million, we had a healthy increase in ESM license transactions over $1 million with 20 this year versus 14 a year ago. In addition for license transactions under $3 million, ESM license bookings increased 25% year-over-year.
In addition to the lack of large deals this quarter, we saw weakness in the U.S. Public Sector during the quarter. Finally for some of our larger transactions, we're seeing in selected cases, an elongation in the selling process, especially in Europe, as customers take longer to evaluate the strategic investments they're making.
Some customers, for example, are inserting additional approval steps into the buying process. We saw that this last quarter. So to summarize, these factors, a tough compare, fewer larger transactions, some public-sector weakness, and a longer sales cycle, contributed to our ESM license bookings performance this quarter. Despite these challenges, our ESM business continued to capitalize on the opportunities resulting from key technology trends. Our Cloud and Software-as-a-service initiatives gained more traction in the marketplace, and we won a number of additional customers around the world. 
In fact, during the first quarter, we had 21 Cloud Solutions wins. These include NBC Universal, University of Hong Kong, and Bezeq International, which is Israel's leading Internet and International telecommunications provider. 
In the same time period, we saw a 53% increase in the number of SaaS wins from our Remedy OnDemand and RemedyForce offerings. New SaaS wins during the first quarter included MIT, News International, Houston Independent School District, and the Open University. New wins during the quarter included Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Micron Technology, Nordstrom, and Telstra.
Due in large part to the increased demand for cloud implementations, our professional services revenue rose 35% for the quarter and profitability improved. To help take our services organization to the next level of performance and delivery, we've hired a new VP of Global Services, Carlos Granda. Carlos is an experienced professional services executive who had leading roles at VMware, Oracle, and BEA Systems. We expect him to drive continued growth and operational excellence in services. 
We're also continuing to invest in our sales force. The number of sales reps that we hired in the first quarter increased on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. Due to a more competitive market for talent, we are a bit below where we'd like to be for hiring. Therefore, we now expect average productive sales headcount to be up closer to 10% for the fiscal year, compared to our original expectation of high teens. We plan to continue to hire aggressively in the second quarter.
The need for flexible, agile IT infrastructures remains high among enterprises. We continue to stack up very well against the competition and have seen no change in our competitive positioning. I want to add that based on what we see in the marketplace and our pipeline, we remain positive about the rest of the year. We are not seeing signs of a broad-based slowdown in spending on IT.
While we remain positive about our outlook and competitive position, we are revising our fiscal year 2012 expectations for ESM license bookings growth from the low 20s as discussed in May to the mid-teens. This revised expectation reflects the lower number of productive sales headcount, negative currency impact on growth versus prior expectations, continued weakness in the public sector, and some elongation of the sales cycle for very large transactions particularly in Europe.
Let me turn now to our products and our alliances. To enhance our technology leadership, we launched an important new portfolio of solutions that delivers the industry's most robust application performance management capabilities across physical, virtual, cloud and hybrid environments. These new solutions leverage our recent acquisition of Coradiant, which significantly enhanced our EPM capabilities. 
We also recently acquired Aeroprise, which provides the most widely deployed mobility solutions for our remedy IT service management suite. We continue to expand our partnerships and alliances, announcing new strategic partnerships with Red Hat, and Unisys and continued the momentum of strong relationships with Cisco, Salesforce.com, Accenture, and others. I encourage you to review the progress we've made in this area found on our website at BMC.com/partners.
Let me now turn to our MSM business, which had a very strong performance during the quarter across the business as well as one large renewal.
Total MSM bookings for the trailing 12 months increased 25% to $990 million dollars. Total annualized MSM bookings for the trailing 12 months were up 15%. We continue to see strong double-digit growth in the annual spend rate of our top 15 MSM transactions in the first quarter. During the quarter, we added 51 new product placements in our existing install base. Further we expanded our relationship with customers like Federal Express, Medicare Australia, and Nissan. 
We also added 4 new MainView customers, including FedEx, replacing the competition in each instance. We saw continued strength in workload automation which includes our BMC Control-M product line. Workload automation is about 1/3 of our MSM business. We added 26 new BMC Control-M customers and expanded our existing relationships with 37 new product placements. 
Some key workload automation wins for the first quarter included Wendy's International and Hong Kong Electric Company. We believe the mainframe business continues to offer very good opportunities for us. In fact, we recently acquired the portfolio of IMS database products and customers from Neon Enterprise Software. The deal further enhances our IMS database management portfolio providing the most comprehensive solution set to best address today's IT challenges with big data, database availability, and data analysis all within organizations IMS environment. So that gives you a snapshot of our performance in key developments in the first quarter.
Let me wrap up my initial comments with a few important highlights. First, our market opportunity remains very strong. We believe there are important opportunities ahead for BMC to leverage its leadership in IT management as technology trends such as cloud computing drive customer purchasing decisions. 
Second, we are continuing to invest in our business to enhance that technology leadership. That means developing new products internally, acquiring new capabilities, tightly integrating them into our portfolio, and partnering with other industry leaders to bring our solutions to market. 
Third, our management team is committed to and focused on executing our strategy for growth. We recently made a key leadership change towards this end. I'm extremely happy to report that Paul Avenant, who headed up ESM products and marketing, has been promoted to Service President of our ESM business. Paul's leadership and operational skills have contributed greatly to our success over the past several years. I'm confident that under Paul's oversight, ESM will expand its market leadership in technology, sales, marketing, and operations.
So in short, we have the market opportunity, the technology and the leadership in place for continued success. This success depends in large part on our ability to execute in a high-level and on a consistent basis. Based on what we're seeing today, our outlook for the remainder of the year continues to be quite positive. I'll provide you with our updated expectations for fiscal 2012 in a few minutes. But first, Steve Solcher will provide a more detailed financial review of the quarter."

While our ESM license bookings were flat year-over-year, we continued to see momentum across key areas of this business including cloud, Software-as-a-Service and Professional Services. We remain positive on our outlook for the fiscal year.
Although margins were flat year-over-year, it is important to point out that we had a $6 million headwind in the first quarter relating to more amortization of software capitalization, and we expect to have a similar headwind in the second quarter. In addition, our license bookings ratable rate was 11 percentage points higher this quarter than in the prior period, driven by a higher dollar percentage of term based transactions. 
With those thoughts in mind, let me now turn to our financial results. Non-GAAP operating income increased by 9% from $157 million to $171 million in the first quarter. Our first quarter non-GAAP operating margin was 34% flat with the year ago quarter. Please refer to Slide 5 in our presentation for selected non-GAAP financial information, which includes segment profitability of our ESM and MSM business units. 
ESM's non-GAAP operating income in the first quarter was $59 million, down 9% from the year ago period. ESM's non-GAAP operating margin declined year-over-year by 4 percentage points to 19%. As Bob mentioned earlier, we continue to make strategic investments in our ESM business unit. 
MSM's non-GAAP operating income in the first quarter was $111 million, up 22% from the year ago period, and its non-GAAP operating margin increased 5 percentage points to 57%. We remain focused on maintaining strong operating margins within our MSM business unit.
Our non-GAAP net earnings for the first quarter were $129 million, up 14% from the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the period was $0.72, which reflects a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 23% for the quarter. These non-GAAP results reflect diluted shares outstanding in the first quarter of $181 million versus $184 million in the year ago period. 
GAAP operating income in the first quarter was $115 million compared to $108 million in the year ago period. GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share were $96 million and $0.53 per diluted share compared with $93 million and $0.50 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2011, respectively. 
First quarter GAAP net earnings in fiscal 2012 and 2011 were positively impacted by net income tax benefits of $6 million and $14 million, respectively, in which we recorded in connection with tax authority settlements related to prior year tax matters. These tax benefits were excluded from our non-GAAP results.
Turning now to bookings, total bookings for the first quarter were $615 million, representing an increase of 39% compared to the year ago period. On a constant currency basis, first quarter bookings increased 33%. Our bookings growth was positively impacted by a large multi-year transaction that was primarily a renewal within our MSM business. 
Total license bookings for the quarter increased by 43% year-over-year to $193 million. The weighted average contract length for total bookings on a trailing 12-month basis was 2.42 years, up 11% from 2.19 years in the year ago period. 
After normalizing for contract length, trailing 12-month annualized bookings for the first quarter were $978 million, up 7% from the year ago period. Please refer to Slide 7 in our presentation. 
Now let me turn to the performance of each of our business units. In the first quarter, total ESM license bookings were $101 million, flat with the year ago period. We see a solid pipeline entering the second quarter and expect similar sequential growth as with the prior year, as well as year-over-year growth in the second quarter.
Turning to the MSM business unit. Total MSM bookings for the trailing 12 months increased 25% to $990 million and had an average contract length of 3.3 years. On a constant currency basis, trailing 12-month MSM bookings were up 23%. Again, MSM bookings and the average contract length were impacted in the quarter by a large multiyear renewal. After normalizing for contract length, total annualized MSM bookings for the trailing 12 months were up 15% as reported and 13% on a constant currency basis to $301 million. 
Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the quarter was $502 million, a 9% increase compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2011. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased 7%. License revenue in the first quarter was $190 million, up 11% from the year ago. ESM license revenue was $119 million, up 5%, while MSM license revenue was $71 million and up 22% from the first quarter last year.
For the first quarter, maintenance revenue was $265 million, an increase of 4% compared to the year ago quarter and up $6 million sequentially. ESM maintenance revenue was $141 million, up 3%, and MSM maintenance revenue $123 million, up 6% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2011. We are pleased with both the sequential and year-over-year growth and maintenance revenue across both our business units.
Professional Services revenue, which is included in the ESM segment, grew 35% from the year ago period, to $48 million in the first quarter. This business delivered a non-GAAP gross margin of 5%. We remain pleased with the transformation we are making in our Professional Services organization.
Moving next to operating expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter were $332 million, up 9% from the year ago period. On a constant currency basis, non-GAAP operating expenses were up 5% year-over-year. Looking at our business units, ESM's non-GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter were $249 million, up 13% from the year ago quarter. This increase reflects the impact of currency and the strategic investments we made in our ESM business, as we increased our expense run rates from acquisitions, added additional sales and services capacity, and accelerated our internal development efforts around cloud and Software-as-a-Service. 
MSM's non-GAAP operating expenses were $83 million, flat compared to the year ago quarter. Other income in the first quarter was a loss of $2 million compared to a loss of $6 million in the year ago quarter. 
Now turning to the balance sheet, total deferred license revenue at the end of the first quarter was $689 million, up slightly sequentially and up 17% year-over-year. During the quarter, we deferred $106 million of license revenue, or 55% of license bookings and recorded $104 million of deferred license revenue from the balance sheet. 
Total deferred revenue increased by $113 million sequentially to $2.1 billion. The current portion of deferred revenue now stands at 52%. Our net capitalized software development cost were $202 million, a 4% increase over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, as we capitalized $31 million and amortized $23 million. 
For the year, we continue to expect net software capitalization to be down $20 million over the prior year. Cash and marketable securities at June 30 totaled $1.7 billion, a decrease of $78 million sequentially. Our net cash position was $1.3 billion at June 30. For the quarter, cash flow from operations was $261 million, up 56% from the year ago period. Cash flow for the first quarter was positively impacted by strong intra-quarter collections. 
By the end of the first half of fiscal 2012, we now expect to have approximately 43% of our full-year expectations for cash flow from operations. This is 5 percentage points higher than last year.
During the first quarter, we repurchased 3.4 million shares of our stock for a total cost of $180 million. We now have $450 million remaining in our current share repurchase program as of June 30. We also spent $151 million related to the acquisitions of Coradiant and Aeroprise, and the IMS assets for Neon Software. 
Let me briefly sum up. From a total bookings, non-GAAP earnings per share in cash flow perspective, our first quarter was strong. Our MSM business performed very well. While ESM license bookings were flat from a difficult comparison, our ESM business saw positive trends in key growing markets such as cloud and Software-as-a-Service. 
Our outlook for the remainder of the year remains positive. With our leadership position in key growth areas, and the strategic investments we are making through both internal development and acquisitions, we are well positioned to capitalize on the market opportunity ahead of us. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for his concluding remarks."

I'd like to close by updating you on our view of fiscal 2012. As we have noted, we expect the remainder of fiscal 2012 to be a period of strong growth particularly in the latter half of the year for ESM license bookings. 
We believe that the drive by enterprises to create more flexible, agile, IT infrastructures is generating strong demand for our portfolio of integrated technology solutions. We're continuing to invest in higher growth, higher return areas of opportunity to enhance our leadership in the marketplace. 
In terms of the fiscal 2012 outlook, we now expect non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $3.25 to $3.35 per share, which is $0.04 higher than our previous expectations provided in May. At the midpoint, this would represent a 10% increase over last year. This includes approximately $0.02 dilution related to Coradiant. 
This range excludes an estimated $0.92 to $0.97 a share for non-GAAP adjustments, including expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation and severance, exit cost and related charges. 
The assumptions underlying this full year fiscal 2012 estimate include total bookings growth in the low double digits, with a SKU of full-year booking expected in the first half of the year to be similar to the prior year. ESM license bookings growth in the mid-teens. MSM total bookings growth in the high single digits, which is higher than our previous expectations of the mid-single digits. 
Revenue growth in the high single to low double digits operating margin, flat with the prior year, an increase in the license bookings ratable rate in comparison to prior year, currency impact at today's rates, which is a negative impact of about 1 point to the total bookings and revenue growth rates compared to our previous expectations, other income at a loss of approximately $8 million for the year, weighted shares outstanding slightly lower than fiscal 2011, and a non-GAAP tax rate of 24% for the year.
We continue to expect the full year fiscal 2011 cash flow from operations to be between $825 million and $875 million, which represents an 11% improvement over fiscal 2011 at the midpoint. With that, we will now turn the call over to questions. Operator?"

This Q4 was very strong, and we didn't have that this year. We had the pipeline, we thought that we could get it done but we knew that the larger transactions were more back-end loaded.

Are you participating in sort of that new customer growth, or realize it's not going to be that bouyant in the mainframe.

Our briefing centers continue, the deals we win, the customers validate consistently our vision for how we're building out a management environment. Part of that solution is to give the customers the all-important aspect of how their customers, their end-users, perceive their responsiveness. IT for years has reported on the components. This is network availability 5 9s. This is the server response time. But really, the only measure that matters to the business on online transactions is what the eyeballs of the end-user experience, and Coradiant really brings that to us so that we can roll out a self-service, self provisioning, hybrid cloud environment to the customer, with a service level agreement tied into that. Coradiant is one of the key components that will give us the ability to then report back to the customer on how is the end-user experiencing it? Are they inside there sub-second or their 2 second, or whatever they determine it to be response times. And when something does go wrong, how quickly can we determine exactly what is the root cause. And then perhaps another BMC product like a BladeLogic, or perhaps our Remedy OnDemand trouble ticketing system will go through the logic to manage the issue. It ties the products together and it adds that part of the total value equation that is in the end-user experience, where IT really delivers its value to its customers. So it's very important to us. It's one piece, it's not the total piece, but it's an important piece we're delivering on that."

You've seen our first quarter results in the press release we issued earlier today. Our overall performance was solid with strong increases in bookings, revenue, non-GAAP earnings",1456,"Thank you, Derrick, and thanks to all of you for joining us this afternoon. You've seen our first quarter results in the press release we issued earlier today. Our overall performance was solid with strong increases in bookings, revenue, non-GAAP earnings and cash flow from operations. While ESM license bookings were flat, we saw continued growth in key business initiatives, including our Cloud, Software-as-a-Service, Professional Services, and MSM Solutions. Some highlights during the quarter.
Total bookings rose 39%. License bookings were up 43%. ESM license bookings were flat although the prior year period was a quarter in which they rose 40%. MSM trailing 12-month bookings were up 25%. Revenue grew 9%. Non-GAAP operating income rose 9%. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was up 16%,  and operating cash flow was up 56%.
Now let me provide some additional perspective on our 2 business units beginning with ESM. ESM license bookings were flat in the first quarter and below our expectations. This reflects several factors. Most importantly, we had a difficult compare with the first quarter last year, a period in which we generated 40% growth in ESM license bookings. Contributing to that 40% growth last year were 4 large ESM license transactions, each of which were more than $3 million in license bookings, this included a $15 million transaction from the prior quarter, which was closed minutes into the fiscal 2011 first quarter.
This quarter by contrast, we only had one ESM licensed transaction over $3 million. I want to highlight that while we had fewer ESM license transactions over $3 million, we had a healthy increase in ESM license transactions over $1 million with 20 this year versus 14 a year ago. In addition for license transactions under $3 million, ESM license bookings increased 25% year-over-year.
In addition to the lack of large deals this quarter, we saw weakness in the U.S. Public Sector during the quarter. Finally for some of our larger transactions, we're seeing in selected cases, an elongation in the selling process, especially in Europe, as customers take longer to evaluate the strategic investments they're making.
Some customers, for example, are inserting additional approval steps into the buying process. We saw that this last quarter. So to summarize, these factors, a tough compare, fewer larger transactions, some public-sector weakness, and a longer sales cycle, contributed to our ESM license bookings performance this quarter. Despite these challenges, our ESM business continued to capitalize on the opportunities resulting from key technology trends. Our Cloud and Software-as-a-service initiatives gained more traction in the marketplace, and we won a number of additional customers around the world. 
In fact, during the first quarter, we had 21 Cloud Solutions wins. These include NBC Universal, University of Hong Kong, and Bezeq International, which is Israel's leading Internet and International telecommunications provider. 
In the same time period, we saw a 53% increase in the number of SaaS wins from our Remedy OnDemand and RemedyForce offerings. New SaaS wins during the first quarter included MIT, News International, Houston Independent School District, and the Open University. New wins during the quarter included Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Micron Technology, Nordstrom, and Telstra.
Due in large part to the increased demand for cloud implementations, our professional services revenue rose 35% for the quarter and profitability improved. To help take our services organization to the next level of performance and delivery, we've hired a new VP of Global Services, Carlos Granda. Carlos is an experienced professional services executive who had leading roles at VMware, Oracle, and BEA Systems. We expect him to drive continued growth and operational excellence in services. 
We're also continuing to invest in our sales force. The number of sales reps that we hired in the first quarter increased on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. Due to a more competitive market for talent, we are a bit below where we'd like to be for hiring. Therefore, we now expect average productive sales headcount to be up closer to 10% for the fiscal year, compared to our original expectation of high teens. We plan to continue to hire aggressively in the second quarter.
The need for flexible, agile IT infrastructures remains high among enterprises. We continue to stack up very well against the competition and have seen no change in our competitive positioning. I want to add that based on what we see in the marketplace and our pipeline, we remain positive about the rest of the year. We are not seeing signs of a broad-based slowdown in spending on IT.
While we remain positive about our outlook and competitive position, we are revising our fiscal year 2012 expectations for ESM license bookings growth from the low 20s as discussed in May to the mid-teens. This revised expectation reflects the lower number of productive sales headcount, negative currency impact on growth versus prior expectations, continued weakness in the public sector, and some elongation of the sales cycle for very large transactions particularly in Europe.
Let me turn now to our products and our alliances. To enhance our technology leadership, we launched an important new portfolio of solutions that delivers the industry's most robust application performance management capabilities across physical, virtual, cloud and hybrid environments. These new solutions leverage our recent acquisition of Coradiant, which significantly enhanced our EPM capabilities. 
We also recently acquired Aeroprise, which provides the most widely deployed mobility solutions for our remedy IT service management suite. We continue to expand our partnerships and alliances, announcing new strategic partnerships with Red Hat, and Unisys and continued the momentum of strong relationships with Cisco, Salesforce.com, Accenture, and others. I encourage you to review the progress we've made in this area found on our website at BMC.com/partners.
Let me now turn to our MSM business, which had a very strong performance during the quarter across the business as well as one large renewal.
Total MSM bookings for the trailing 12 months increased 25% to $990 million dollars. Total annualized MSM bookings for the trailing 12 months were up 15%. We continue to see strong double-digit growth in the annual spend rate of our top 15 MSM transactions in the first quarter. During the quarter, we added 51 new product placements in our existing install base. Further we expanded our relationship with customers like Federal Express, Medicare Australia, and Nissan. 
We also added 4 new MainView customers, including FedEx, replacing the competition in each instance. We saw continued strength in workload automation which includes our BMC Control-M product line. Workload automation is about 1/3 of our MSM business. We added 26 new BMC Control-M customers and expanded our existing relationships with 37 new product placements. 
Some key workload automation wins for the first quarter included Wendy's International and Hong Kong Electric Company. We believe the mainframe business continues to offer very good opportunities for us. In fact, we recently acquired the portfolio of IMS database products and customers from Neon Enterprise Software. The deal further enhances our IMS database management portfolio providing the most comprehensive solution set to best address today's IT challenges with big data, database availability, and data analysis all within organizations' IMS environment. So that gives you a snapshot of our performance in key developments in the first quarter.
Let me wrap up my initial comments with a few important highlights. First, our market opportunity remains very strong. We believe there are important opportunities ahead for BMC to leverage its leadership in IT management as technology trends such as cloud computing drive customer purchasing decisions. 
Second, we are continuing to invest in our business to enhance that technology leadership. That means developing new products internally, acquiring new capabilities, tightly integrating them into our portfolio, and partnering with other industry leaders to bring our solutions to market. 
Third, our management team is committed to and focused on executing our strategy for growth. We recently made a key leadership change towards this end. I'm extremely happy to report that Paul Avenant, who headed up ESM products and marketing, has been promoted to Service President of our ESM business. Paul's leadership and operational skills have contributed greatly to our success over the past several years. I'm confident that under Paul's oversight, ESM will expand its market leadership in technology, sales, marketing, and operations.
So in short, we have the market opportunity, the technology and the leadership in place for continued success. This success depends in large part on our ability to execute in a high-level and on a consistent basis. Based on what we're seeing today, our outlook for the remainder of the year continues to be quite positive. I'll provide you with our updated expectations for fiscal 2012 in a few minutes. But first, Steve Solcher will provide a more detailed financial review of the quarter."
25673,137262423,147564,"BMC Software Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2011",2011-07-27,"Earnings Calls","BMC Software, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bob.

In the first quarter, we had strong financial performance and year-over-year growth across most of our key metrics, including total bookings, revenue, non-GAAP earnings per share and cash flow from operations. Our MSM business had a very solid quarter and strong growth on a trailing 12-month basis. 
While our ESM license bookings were flat year-over-year, we continued to see momentum across key areas of this business including cloud, Software-as-a-Service and Professional Services. We remain positive on our outlook for the fiscal year.
Although margins were flat year-over-year, it is important to point out that we had a $6 million headwind in the first quarter relating to more amortization of software capitalization, and we expect to have a similar headwind in the second quarter. In addition, our license bookings ratable rate was 11 percentage points higher this quarter than in the prior period, driven by a higher dollar percentage of term based transactions. 
With those thoughts in mind, let me now turn to our financial results. Non-GAAP operating income increased by 9% from $157 million to $171 million in the first quarter. Our first quarter non-GAAP operating margin was 34%, flat with the year ago quarter. Please refer to Slide 5 in our presentation for selected non-GAAP financial information, which includes segment profitability of our ESM and MSM business units. 
ESM's non-GAAP operating income in the first quarter was $59 million, down 9% from the year ago period. ESM's non-GAAP operating margin declined year-over-year by 4 percentage points to 19%. As Bob mentioned earlier, we continue to make strategic investments in our ESM business unit. 
MSM's non-GAAP operating income in the first quarter was $111 million, up 22% from the year ago period, and its non-GAAP operating margin increased 5 percentage points to 57%. We remain focused on maintaining strong operating margins within our MSM business unit.
Our non-GAAP net earnings for the first quarter were $129 million, up 14% from the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the period was $0.72, which reflects a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 23% for the quarter. These non-GAAP results reflect diluted shares outstanding in the first quarter of $181 million versus $184 million in the year ago period. 
GAAP operating income in the first quarter was $115 million compared to $108 million in the year ago period. GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share were $96 million and $0.53 per diluted share compared with $93 million and $0.50 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2011, respectively. 
First quarter GAAP net earnings in fiscal 2012 and 2011 were positively impacted by net income tax benefits of $6 million and $14 million, respectively, in which we recorded in connection with tax authority settlements related to prior year tax matters. These tax benefits were excluded from our non-GAAP results.
Turning now to bookings, total bookings for the first quarter were $615 million, representing an increase of 39% compared to the year ago period. On a constant currency basis, first quarter bookings increased 33%. Our bookings growth was positively impacted by a large multi-year transaction that was primarily a renewal within our MSM business. 
Total license bookings for the quarter increased by 43% year-over-year to $193 million. The weighted average contract length for total bookings on a trailing 12-month basis was 2.42 years, up 11% from 2.19 years in the year ago period. 
After normalizing for contract length, trailing 12-month annualized bookings for the first quarter were $978 million, up 7% from the year ago period. Please refer to Slide 7 in our presentation. 
Now let me turn to the performance of each of our business units. In the first quarter, total ESM license bookings were $101 million, flat with the year ago period. We see a solid pipeline entering the second quarter and expect similar sequential growth as with the prior year, as well as year-over-year growth in the second quarter.
Turning to the MSM business unit. Total MSM bookings for the trailing 12 months increased 25% to $990 million and had an average contract length of 3.3 years. On a constant currency basis, trailing 12-month MSM bookings were up 23%. Again, MSM bookings and the average contract length were impacted in the quarter by a large multiyear renewal. After normalizing for contract length, total annualized MSM bookings for the trailing 12 months were up 15% as reported and 13% on a constant currency basis to $301 million. 
Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the quarter was $502 million, a 9% increase compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2011. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased 7%. License revenue in the first quarter was $190 million, up 11% from the year ago. ESM license revenue was $119 million, up 5%, while MSM license revenue was $71 million and up 22% from the first quarter last year.
For the first quarter, maintenance revenue was $265 million, an increase of 4% compared to the year ago quarter and up $6 million sequentially. ESM maintenance revenue was $141 million, up 3%, and MSM maintenance revenue $123 million, up 6% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2011. We are pleased with both the sequential and year-over-year growth and maintenance revenue across both our business units.
Professional Services revenue, which is included in the ESM segment, grew 35% from the year ago period, to $48 million in the first quarter. This business delivered a non-GAAP gross margin of 5%. We remain pleased with the transformation we are making in our Professional Services organization.
Moving next to operating expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter were $332 million, up 9% from the year ago period. On a constant currency basis, non-GAAP operating expenses were up 5% year-over-year. Looking at our business units, ESM's non-GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter were $249 million, up 13% from the year ago quarter. This increase reflects the impact of currency and the strategic investments we made in our ESM business, as we increased our expense run rates from acquisitions, added additional sales and services capacity, and accelerated our internal development efforts around cloud and Software-as-a-Service. 
MSM's non-GAAP operating expenses were $83 million, flat compared to the year ago quarter. Other income in the first quarter was a loss of $2 million compared to a loss of $6 million in the year ago quarter. 
Now turning to the balance sheet, total deferred license revenue at the end of the first quarter was $689 million, up slightly sequentially and up 17% year-over-year. During the quarter, we deferred $106 million of license revenue, or 55% of license bookings, and recorded $104 million of deferred license revenue from the balance sheet. 
Total deferred revenue increased by $113 million sequentially to $2.1 billion. The current portion of deferred revenue now stands at 52%. Our net capitalized software development cost were $202 million, a 4% increase over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, as we capitalized $31 million and amortized $23 million. 
For the year, we continue to expect net software capitalization to be down $20 million over the prior year. Cash and marketable securities at June 30 totaled $1.7 billion, a decrease of $78 million sequentially. Our net cash position was $1.3 billion at June 30. For the quarter, cash flow from operations was $261 million, up 56% from the year ago period. Cash flow for the first quarter was positively impacted by strong intra-quarter collections. 
By the end of the first half of fiscal 2012, we now expect to have approximately 43% of our full-year expectations for cash flow from operations. This is 5 percentage points higher than last year.
During the first quarter, we repurchased 3.4 million shares of our stock for a total cost of $180 million. We now have $450 million remaining in our current share repurchase program as of June 30. We also spent $151 million related to the acquisitions of Coradiant and Aeroprise, and the IMS assets for Neon Software. 
Let me briefly sum up. From a total bookings, non-GAAP earnings per share and cash flow perspective, our first quarter was strong. Our MSM business performed very well. While ESM license bookings were flat from a difficult comparison, our ESM business saw positive trends in key growing markets such as cloud and Software-as-a-Service. 
Our outlook for the remainder of the year remains positive. With our leadership position in key growth areas, and the strategic investments we are making through both internal development and acquisitions, we are well positioned to capitalize on the market opportunity ahead of us. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for his concluding remarks."

I'd like to close by updating you on our view of fiscal 2012. As we have noted, we expect the remainder of fiscal 2012 to be a period of strong growth, particularly in the latter half of the year for ESM license bookings. 
We believe that the drive by enterprises to create more flexible, agile, IT infrastructures is generating strong demand for our portfolio of integrated technology solutions. We're continuing to invest in higher growth, higher return areas of opportunity to enhance our leadership in the marketplace. 
In terms of the fiscal 2012 outlook, we now expect non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $3.25 to $3.35 per share, which is $0.04 higher than our previous expectations provided in May. At the midpoint, this would represent a 10% increase over last year. This includes approximately $0.02 dilution related to Coradiant. 
This range excludes an estimated $0.92 to $0.97 a share for non-GAAP adjustments, including expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation and severance, exit cost and related charges. 
The assumptions underlying this full year fiscal 2012 estimate include total bookings growth in the low double digits, with a SKU of full-year booking expected in the first half of the year to be similar to the prior year. ESM license bookings growth in the mid-teens. MSM total bookings growth in the high single digits, which is higher than our previous expectations of the mid-single digits. 
Revenue growth in the high single to low double digits, operating margin flat with the prior year, an increase in the license bookings ratable rate in comparison to prior year, currency impact at today's rates, which is a negative impact of about 1 point to the total bookings and revenue growth rates compared to our previous expectations, other income at a loss of approximately $8 million for the year, weighted shares outstanding slightly lower than fiscal 2011, and a non-GAAP tax rate of 24% for the year.
We continue to expect the full year fiscal 2011 cash flow from operations to be between $825 million and $875 million, which represents an 11% improvement over fiscal 2011 at the midpoint. With that, we will now turn the call over to questions. Operator?"

If you remember just back up a minute, if you remember Q4 a year ago was not so strong in ESM. And the reason it wasn't so strong was primarily a number of large slip deals that then we picked up and had a blowout Q1 a year ago that had the 40% growth rate that we had to compare, we had to deal with. This Q4 was very strong, and we didn't have that this year. We had the pipeline, we thought that we could get it done but we knew that the larger transactions were more back-end loaded.

Our briefing centers continue, the deals we win, the customers validate consistently our vision for how we're building out a management environment. Part of that solution is to give the customers the all-important aspect of how their customers, their end-users, perceive their responsiveness. IT for years has reported on the components. This is network availability 5 9s. This is the server response time. But really, the only measure that matters to the business on online transactions is what the eyeballs of the end-user experience, and Coradiant really brings that to us so that we can roll out a self-service, self provisioning, hybrid cloud environment to the customer, with a service level agreement tied into that. Coradiant is one of the key components that will give us the ability to then report back to the customer on how is the end-user experiencing it? Are they inside there sub-second or their 2 second, or whatever they determine it to be response times. And when something does go wrong, how quickly can we determine exactly what is the root cause. And then perhaps another BMC product like a BladeLogic, or perhaps our Remedy OnDemand trouble ticketing system will go through the logic to manage the issue. It ties the products together and it adds that part of the total value equation that is in the end-user experience, where IT really delivers its value to its customers. So it's very important to us. It's one piece, it's not the total piece, but it's an important piece of delivering on that."

Our second quarter performance was mixed. During the quarter, we reported solid growth in total revenue, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP EPS and cash flow from operations. Our MSM and Professional Services businesses again performe",1670,"Thank you, Derrick. Our second quarter performance was mixed. During the quarter, we reported solid growth in total revenue, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP EPS and cash flow from operations. Our MSM and Professional Services businesses again performed well. We did a good job of managing expenses. Both our ESM and MSM businesses maintained their technology leadership positions in their respective markets. One area of underperformance during the quarter was in ESM license bookings, which decreased 13% compared to the a year-ago quarter. There were several factors driving this result that I will address shortly. 
Despite our mixed performance in the second quarter, we remain confident that our strategy is sound, that our solutions are the best in the industry, that our competitive position is strong and that our long-term growth prospects are encouraging. Let me provide more specifics regarding our second quarter financial performance.
Revenue grew 11%. Non-GAAP operating income rose 13%. Non-GAAP operating margin increased by 1 percentage point. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was up 6% and operating cash flow was up 27%. 
Now let me provide additional perspective on our 2 business units, beginning with ESM.
ESM license bookings were, as noted, down during the second quarter. Some of the shortfall was due to external factors: Our performance in key geographic areas of market segments, most notably certain regions in EMEA and the U.S. public sector continued to be soft due to economic and financial conditions. We saw some deals delay toward the end of the quarter, particularly in Europe as buying cycles are longated. However, most of the factors driving our ESM performance were related to our own execution. While we were actively addressing these challenges, we do expect a continued negative impact in the short term and are, therefore, lower in our full year fiscal 2012 expectations for ESM license bookings from mid-teens growth to a mid-single-digit decline. 
To provide context for our second quarter performance and full year expectations, it's helpful to review the status of 2 key areas of focus heading into this year: Productive sales capacity and overall sales productivity. Related to productive sales capacity, increasing our sales footprint and our ability to directly reach customers is essential to capturing the strong market demand that we see for our solutions. However, our current expectation for productive sales capacity is significantly below our original expectations, which was for growth in the high teens for the year. We've experienced lower-than-expected hiring in the first quarter and higher-than-expected attrition in the first half. Additionally, we've seen a reduction in the overall mix of tenured sales representatives. As a result, we now expect productive sales capacity growth in the low- to mid-single digits for the year. 
Related to the second key area of focus, sales productivity, in both our original fiscal 2012 expectations and our revised expectations in July, we expected an increase in overall sales productivity. However, the higher-than-expected attrition rates, particularly for the more tenured and productive sales reps have hurt overall productivity. We've already taken several steps to respond to these challenges to increase capacity and productivity going forward. 
First, we aggressively ramped hiring in the second quarter, and we'll continue that ramp through the second half of our fiscal year. Although we will take these newly hired resources sometime to be fully productive, we expect to see tangible results next year. Second, we are recruiting new seniors sales leadership to fill key positions to both help to grow capacity and drive increased productivity as rapidly as possible. Finally, we're very focused on retaining existing sales palate. 
As we put these steps into place to increase productive sales capacity and address overall sales productivity, it's important to note we are building on what history has shown to be a strong base and sales process. With CIO level access, leading solutions suite and the industry's best training and qualification process. We have an excellent team in place. However, we need to evolve our current sales organization to increase the size of the team and make sure that the tools required to sustain its forward momentum. 
The other key areas that are important to discuss are our growth initiatives, cloud and SaaS. I'm pleased that both of these areas are performing very well for us. One of our major goals heading into the fiscal year was to establish BMC as the leader in cloud management. As customers standardize on our cloud management suite, it positions us well for long-term revenue growth. We're executing well against this goal as indicated by our cloud results. During the quarter, the number of cloud wins and license bookings were well above plan, and we currently have a strong and growing clout pipeline. New cloud customers include AIG, AXYS Technologies, Duke Energy, Huawei Technologies, Telstra and Sanofi-Aventis. 
Another major strategic imperative is to become the leader in Software-as-a-Service management. The number of new SaaS customers closed in the quarter and the related amount of subscription annual contract value, ACV, continues to show strong growth. Our offerings include RemedyForce, which we offered directly and through salesforce.com and Remedy on demand, which we market directly through our BMC and reseller channel. 
New wins for RemedyForce include City College of New York and University. And key wins for our Remedy on demand include the Spanish Bank, BBVA and City Colleges of Chicago. We are optimistic about the opportunity for these solutions. 
From a financial perspective, it's important to highlight that because our sass business is subscription-based offering, it is not included in our reported ESM license bookings. We were also pleased to note that during the quarter, 18 ESM customers with license transactions above $1 million chose to standardize across multiple BSM disciplines. One of the keys to getting more platform wins is a relentless focus on maintaining a competitive edge for our technology in terms of its functionality and how it is seemlessly integrated. 
One area of growing importance as the need for development and operations to collaborate closely to manage application changes successfully into production. This area is commonly referred to as devops. The recent acquisition of a business software provider focused on accelerating enterprise application delivery and improving release quality positions us as a leader in this rapidly growing market sector. Our focus here is to integrate stream steps process management capabilities into an existing BMC solution to support seamless application management from development to production. 
Another bright spot for ESM during the quarter was the performance of our professional services business. Fueled in part by increased demand for clout implementations, our professional services revenue rose 35% for the second quarter in a row with positive gross margins. 
To summarize ESM's second quarter performance, we injured entered fiscal 2012 with expectations that were predicated on growing productive sales capacity, improving sales productivity and winning in new markets. However, the lower-than-expected productive sales capacity and sales productivity have impacted overall ESM license bookings. We are aggressively taking actions to demonstration and increase productivity. Our management team and entire company are focused on improving ESM's performance. In short, we have identified the issues impacting our ESM business, and we know what steps are required to increase sales capacity and sales productivity. 
We continue to benefit from the strength of our technology and the positive trends in several key areas including cloud management, SaaS, major BSM platform wins and our professional services business. We will continue to provide you details of our progress as I do believe the market opportunities for ESM solution remain large and growing.
Let me turn now to our MSM business. MSM had another very good quarter. Total MSM bookings for the trailing 12 months increased 25% to $939 million. Total MSM annualized bookings for the trailing 12 months were up 13%. We continue to see growth in the annual spend rate of our top 15 MSM transactions in the second quarter. 
During the quarter, we added or expanded our relationships with new and existing customers through 102 new product placements in MSM. We expanded our relationship with customers like TNT express, credit agriculture technologies and the Department of Treasury IT. We also saw a continued strength in workload automation, which includes our BMC Control-M product line. As you know, workload automation represents about 1/3 of our MSM business. We added 13 new BMC Control-M customers and expanded our existing relationships with 55 new product placement. 
Some key workload automation wins in the second quarter included Continental Casualty Company, Macy's and ANZ Banking Group. 
The mainframe business continues to offer a very good opportunities for us. In our sixth annual worldwide mean fame survey, one of the most reference service in the industry, 62% of the respondents expect to grow overall mainframe capacity. That's up from 56% last year. Among respondents at large companies, 93% expected capacity to grow or remain steady. About half of all respondents said new workloads and new business applications are contributing to their capacity growth. 
Finally, it's worth noting that 60% said the top IT priority is keeping costs down. Our MSM solutions help our enterprise customers meet their key business priorities while lowering their cost of mainframe management. The need to address growing IT complexity through more efficient IT management is common to customers of both our ESM and MSM businesses. We continue to see opportunities to leverage our strengths across our distributed and mainframe IT management portfolios, among the largest enterprise customers around the world.
Let me close by summarizing why I believe we are well positioned today. While our markets are not immune from today's economic and financial uncertainties, our market opportunity is substantial and expanding. Our company is strong, focused, very profitable and committed to building shareholder value. To do so, we are intently focused on addressing our operational challenges, and we are confident that we have the correct strategy, people, products and the technology in place to capture the opportunities ahead. 
Let me now turn the call over to Steve Solcher to provide a more detailed financial review of the quarter."

Before I begin, I would like to make a few brief comments regarding our financial performance. Despite the results in our ESM license bookings, I am pleased with the overall financial health of our company. Total bookings are up 11% through the first half. Our income statement reflects strong growth in total revenues and record profitability levels. Cash flow growth is strong, and we expect fiscal 2012 to be a record year for cash flow from operations. Our balance sheet remains solid with $1.6 billion in cash and marketable securities. With those thoughts in mind, let me now turn to our financial results.
Non-GAAP operating income increased by 13% from $191 million to $216 million in the second quarter. Our second quarter non-GAAP operating margin was 39%, up 1 percentage point from the year-ago quarter. For the first half of fiscal 2012, non-GAAP operating income increased 11% from $348 million to $387 million. Non-GAAP operating margin for the first half was 37%, up 1 percentage point year over year. 
ESM's non-GAAP operating income in the second quarter was $89 million, up 17% from the a year-ago quarter. ESM's non-GAAP operating margin increased year over year by 1 percentage point to 26%. MSM's non-GAAP operating income in the second quarter was $127 million, up 11% from the the year-ago quarter, and its non-GAAP operating margin increased 1 percentage point to 61%.
Please refer to Slide 5 in our presentation for selected non-GAAP financial information, which includes segment profitability of our ESM and MSM business units. Our non-GAAP net earnings for the second quarter were $153 million, up 4% from the second quarter of fiscal 2011. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the period was $0.87, which reflects a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 28% for the quarter. These non-GAAP results reflect diluted shares outstanding in the second quarter of $176 million versus $181 million than the year-ago period. GAAP operating income in the second quarter was $161 million compared with $144 million in da year-ago quarter. GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share were $115 million and $0.65 per diluted share compared to $132 million and $0.73 per diluted share in the second quarter fiscal 2011, respectively.
Prior-year second quarter GAAP net earnings were positively impacted by net income tax benefits of $18 million, which were recorded in connection collection with tax authority settlements related to prior year's tax matters. These tax benefits were excluded from our non-GAAP results. 
Turning now to bookings. Total bookings for the second quarter were $382 million, a 16% decrease compared to the year-ago quarter. On a constant currency basis, second quarter bookings decreased to 14%. Total bookings for the first half were up 11% to $998 million. Total license bookings for the second quarter decreased by 15% year over year to $188 million. For the first half, license bookings rose 7% to $380 million. The weighted average contract link for total bookings on a trailing 12-month basis was 2.33 years, up 7% from 2.18 years in the year ago period. After normalizing for contract, trailing 12-month annualized bookings for the second quarter were $986 million, up 6% from the the year-ago period. Please refer to Slide 7 in our presentation.
Now let me turn to the performance of each of our business units. In the second quarter, total ESM license bookings were $126 million, down 13% in da year-ago quarter, and up 25% sequentially compared to the first quarter. For the first half of fiscal 2012, ESM license bookings were down 8% to $227 million. 
Turning to the MSM business unit. Total MSM bookings for the trailing 12 month increased 95% to $939 million and had an average contract length of 3.23 years. On a constant currency basis, trailing 12-month MSM bookings were up 24%. After normalizing for contract length, MSM total annualized bookings for the trailing 12 months were up 13% as reported and 12% on a constant currency basis to $290 million. 
Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the quarter was $557 million, an 11% increase compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2011. On a constant currency basis revenue increased 10%. License revenue in the second quarter was $230 million, up 10% from a year ago. ESM license revenue was $146 million come, up 11%, while MSM's license revenue was $84 million, up 9% from the second quarter of last year. 
For the second quarter, maintenance revenue was $271 million, an increase of 7% compared to the year-ago quarter and up $6 million sequentially. ESM maintenance revenue was $146 million, up 7%, and MSM maintenance revenue was $125 million, up 8% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2011. We are pleased with both the continued sequential and year-over-year growth in maintenance revenue across both of our business units. 
Professional services revenue, which is included in the ESM business unit, grew 35% from the a year-ago period to $57 million in the second quarter. This business delivered a non-GAAP gross margin of 8%.
Moving next to operating expenses, non-GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter were $340 million, up 9% from the the year-ago period. On a constant currency basis, non-GAAP operating expenses were up 7% at year over year. This increase reflects the investments we are making in growth opportunities within our ESM business around cloud, SaaS and professional services as well as the impact of acquisitions. 
Looking at our business units, ESM's non-GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter were $259 million, up 11% from a year-ago quarter. MSM's non-GAAP operating expenses were $181 million, up 5% compared to the year-ago quarter. We are focused on improving profitability and continue to identify opportunities to improve our cost structure across our businesses. 
Other income in the second quarter was a loss of $5 million compared to the slight gain in a year-ago quarter. This year-over-year decline is primarily due to a reduction in the net gains related to our deferred compensation plan.
Now turning to the balance sheet. Total deferred license revenue at the end of the second quarter was $647 million, up 8% year over year. During the quarter, we deferred $68 million up license revenue or 36% of license bookings and recorded $107 million of deferred license revenue from the balance sheet. The deferral rate for the quarter of 36% was impacted by a lower-than-expected deferral rate in our ESM business of 25%. Total deferred revenue decreased by $174 million sequentially to $1.9 billion. The current portion of deferred revenue now stands at 52%. 
Our net cap software development costs were $214 million, a 6% increase over the first quarter as we capitalized $36 million and amortized $24 million. For the year, we expect net software capitalization to be down approximately $15 million over the prior year primarily due to the increased amortization. 
Cash and marketable securities at September 30 totaled $1.6 billion, a decrease of $126 million sequentially. Our net cash position was $1.2 billion at September 30.
For the quarter, cash flow from operations was $162 million, up 27% from the year-ago quarter. As of September 30, we have generated 51% of the midpoint of our revised full year guidance for cash flow from operations versus 38% in the previous comparable period. 
During the second quarter, we repurchased 5.4 million shares of our stock for a total cost of $225 million. Our Board of Directors has authorized an additional $1 billion per share repurchases. Along with the remaining amount from prior authorizations, we now have 1.2 billion remaining in our share repurchase program. 
Let me briefly sum up. We remain confident in the market opportunity ahead and in our ability to capture it. Our strategic ESM initiatives, including cloud, SaaS and professional services, are exceeding their expectations. We are taking the necessary steps that we believe will reduce sales attrition and increase sales productivity, which should bode well for our continued success. Our MSM business continues to perform well. We remain a very profitable and strong company that is generating robust cash flows and is a leader in our field. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for his concluding remarks."

We know what steps are required to increase the productive capacity and overall productivity of our ESM sales organization, and we are intently engaged in that activity now, and we'll be measuring our progress in reporting it out to you regularly. 
With that, let me update you on our view for the remainder of fiscal 2012. Due to our performance in the first half and our current outlook for the remainder of the year, we are lowering our full year expectations for bookings, revenue, cash flow and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. We now expect non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $3.21 to $3.31. At the midpoint is represented a 9% increase over last year. This includes approximately $0.02 dilution related to the acquisition of Coradiant. This range excludes an estimated $0.88 to $0.93 per share for non-GAAP adjustments, including expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation and severance, exit costs and related charges. 
The assumptions underlying our full year fiscal 2012 expectations include: Total bookings growth in the mid-single digits; ESM license bookings decline in the mid-single digits; MSM total bookings growth in the high single digits; revenue growth in the mid-single digits; operating margin staying flat with the prior year; license bookings ratable rate similar to the prior year; currency impact at today's rates, which is about a 1 point help in both bookings and revenue on the year-over-year basis; other income in the loss of approximately $10 million for the year; weighted shares outstanding approximately 4% lower than fiscal 2011; and a non-GAAP tax rate of 26% for the year.
We now expect full year fiscal 2012 cash flow from operations to be between $800 million and $850 million, which at the midpoint represents an 8% improvement over fiscal 2011.

When we look at the deals that slip or the deals that we don't close, we're not in the vast majority, we're not talking this up to HP or IBM or somebody take a deal away from us. So I think we need more at that is one of our big issue. We got into close to where we need to close so much in the pipeline that is just to close for the metal. We need more coverage, and more productive reps have been here longer will provide that coverage. I think that on the product lines, cloud is doing very well. The SaaS is doing very well. Both of them well ahead of plans. We can always do better, and we have plans to improve those as well, but we feel quite good about that. In terms of geographic mix, yes, there are a few standouts. U.S. Federal is really behind plan, u.S. public sector in general. And we think in that market we're coming off some tough comps, but we knew that. I think the market is just tough U.S. public sector is just a tough market for us right now, and I think that's a macro factor. Southern Europe is not a big number. It's pretty -- just not delivering much business right now. Northern Europe grew really nice but that's an interesting one to talk about for a second. That group is continually done very well for us they did well again. But in the last few days in the quarter, they had between $5 million and $10 million worth of license bookings that pushed. So we were expecting them to do well, and they did, but we expect them to do better, and we can chalk those up specifically to macro issues. But again, they did well there. In the U.S., we've got -- we had one of our regions that just has for several quarters in a row underperformed, and that I think is self-inflicted wounder there. We made changes in sales management there, and we just need to get that in shape. Now one of the things I'll tell, I think we have some very good sales people in our organization and very good methodologies, very good sales model. But this attrition issue has been with us for probably 3.5, 4 years now, and it's just not scaling peer. We're going to have to make a few changes to get that under control."

BMC coming off a number of very -- several strong years has been specifically -- in fact, we just interviewed a candidate from our one ex-employees and they said we were specifically targeting our sales force to hire. So we know that I suspect that as a backdrop. To answer your question specifically, we've interviewed really almost every sales representative in the country company since we kind of identified that this issue was more acute than we had realized. We put in place -- we've identified what they told us what they see it is the key issues are. One of the things we put in place as compensation plan changes to the management where attrition and recruiting are now part of the incentive system. Culturally, it has been business model wise this salesforce gives a very strong salesforce, but culturally, it's intensely demanding. It's an organization that assumes -- that meets quarterly performance or they ask you to need. Some of this attrition by the way is not people putting some of that is the new vineyard 2 quarters or you've 2 quarters of the performance out the door, and that model works for a smaller company. For us we've got a hybrid we've got some of that but we also have a cost management with multi-year targets and working with larger accounts, so we may change in this compensation. We're making change in management compensation we've identified the structural issues. And in some cases, we are replacing sales management."

So one thing to tell you is since we made a big change in our sales organization and you remember when that happened, Michael, the attrition skyrocketed at that moment. And in fact, we're still down from what it was that first year after we made a lot of sales leadership changes, and that year was a serious change out in our sales organization. And that -- the business model that sales model essentially assumed an unusually high attrition model. The concept though was that you would hire these high quality sales people. You would give them the opportunity to make a lot of money. You hold them accountable for consistent results. And if they didn't deliver, you would give new sales reps, and you do it fairly quickly. And it was -- it worked for several years for our company, but the attrition level just kept staying high. You remember we talked about attrition on these calls for several years now. What we end up seeing is that we have -- if you look at the culture, we had a well-defined rigorous kind of value based sales process. Well, I think it's kind of an outstanding process. But the culture is an aggressive performance culture and its demands consistent quarterly performance. That model is fine. I think for a smaller company, you can afford to do that and kind of cycle through. When you're selling BSM offering, when you're selling customers on your cloud solution that's going to that they're going to bet their future revenue models on, you have to have a little more of a hybrid model. When you have account cut executives who were signing up, they may not sell a lot for 3 quarters because they're working on the large damages action. And so the pendulum little too far as what happened was, Michael, and frankly the sales management and the sales team here is made primarily, by the way fantastic sales managers, but it is still the model that believes 40% attrition is okay, and we don't believe it is okay. And the sales teams here have been working on it. There have been an awful lot of the meetings here in the last month on this subject since the end of the quarter. And I believe that everybody's got the message that we've got to get that under control. The other thing I'd tell you is that if you have -- if you close a large interaction with BMC, you can make a lot of money. But if you're selling a BSM deal, it may take you 3 or 4 quarters to close that deal. And during that window, you may be vulnerable. If you're a hot salesperson who gets called by a startup, in Silicon Valley gets called by another competitor with big guaranty, we have comparative offering. Our sales people $250,000 guaranteed first year comp, guaranteed cash comp to go to work for them. And so there's just a lot of opportunities, and it's a tough culture, and we've got to adjust that through changing kind of the way we think about attrition and develop these sales people, and they have plenty of opportunity to make a lot of money. We have a lot of sales people make a lot of money here, Michael."

We're able to hire well. We're bringing in some bright young talent, new talent. But when you lose the people that are more tenured, then you lose a lot of that sophistication and forecasting and they are more productive sales people. So what happens as a result of this went after Q2's performance is really went very, very deep into analyzing what's going on with that attrition level because we have the pipeline. We have the forecast the numbers that we trusted for several years we're in place and, in fact, it's screwed up pretty nicely after Q1 and yet they disappointed us.

Telco, I would say in general we had some nice winds that were cloud related. But the cloud deals are usually smaller ASP where they do a proof of concept are they stand up a storefront, and it's kind of the build a consort of model for cloud. They usually buy enough from us to stand the cloud up. And in our contract structure as they built cloud volume, we have the upside to do more business with them.

Earlier in our evolution when our services were struggling more, it consumes a more sales time. It still does consumes some sales but, particularly under capacity, but that is a real positive indicator.

So I give them a lot of credit for building really helping transform our company about building a great, aggressive hunter sales force. John really stepped out of the picture. His first big step out of the teacher was February 2010, whenever he went to do direct reports and Luca took over worldwide sales as Senior Vice President of worldwide sales in 2010. And Luca and then began attending staff meetings and was part of the senior team is he really ran sales himself. John stepped out of the company further in February of this year when he actually had no -- became an individual could you determine kind of consulting and mentoring and coaching, but had no line responsibilities whatsoever. At that point, it was reporting to one of my direct reports. Lucca at that point was driving the sales organization. So on October 1, soon as we finished Q2 and Luca worked very, very hard and diligently through the whole quarter, Luca and I bought agreed it was probably a good time for a change. And so he has moved on and we are in a great debt of gratitude for helping build us a great sale organization. So those are the top 2 people that you referred to. And then beneath that, we have some execution issues in a couple of areas sales. One is the forecast that drop before this the fastest in the last few days and that was U.S. Westin.

I just got an e-mail today that was forwarded to me by a customer sent it to a sales team saying that our cloud proof of concept that we put in for a couple of months is blew them away. It's absolutely blew them away. It was an architecture based on B block architecture with Cisco and suing BMC's cloud life cycle manager and the e-mail from the customer was effusive, talking about how it blew them away. So cloud business is doing excellent, I would say what maybe it's not exactly what you asked but definitely what can happen to us being under capacity is our salespeople are selling what is easy to sell or what is easier to sell, which is cloud, which is SaaS. And they're diverting to where the customers are saying I'm going to buy now in this area come to the -- let's engage in a contract negotiation. Let's engage in an evaluation. What will suffer in your other capacity is now you're not bizarrely out there driving a Remedy ITSM upgrade or to helping a customer at the new knowledge management or change management modules on top of it or taking BladeLogic up to do applications provisioning and middleware provisioning. So while those businesses are still big part of our business, I think it's the opposite. I think we're doing very well in cloud, and I think that the attention it's getting from our sales force as is the strong. And some of the stuff that we're really focused on 2 years ago is maybe taking a little bit of a backseat as we our sales model basically focuses what the customers want now.
All right. well, listen, I want to thank you very much. I appreciate you dialing in. I think we hopefully made it very clear to you that we think we've got some outstanding products. We think we're in some excellent markets. And frankly, we need to get this salesforce grown, matured.

Our second quarter performance was mixed. During the quarter, we reported solid growth in total revenue, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP EPS and cash flow from operations. Our MSM and professional services businesses again performe",1667,"Thank you, Derrick. Our second quarter performance was mixed. During the quarter, we reported solid growth in total revenue, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP EPS and cash flow from operations. Our MSM and professional services businesses again performed well. We did a good job of managing expenses. Both our ESM and MSM businesses maintained their technology leadership positions in their respective markets. One area of underperformance during the quarter was in ESM license bookings, which decreased 13% compared to the year-ago quarter. There were several factors driving this result that I will address shortly. 
Despite our mixed performance in the second quarter, we remain confident that our strategy is sound, that our solutions are the best in the industry, that our competitive position is strong and that our long-term growth prospects are encouraging. Let me provide more specifics regarding our second quarter financial performance.
Revenue grew 11%. Non-GAAP operating income rose 13%. Non-GAAP operating margin increased by 1 percentage point. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was up 6%, and operating cash flow was up 27%. Now let me provide additional perspective on our 2 business units, beginning with ESM.
ESM license bookings were, as noted, down during the second quarter. Some of the shortfall was due to external factors. Our performance in key geographic areas and market segments, most notably certain regions in EMEA and the U.S. public sector, continued to be soft due to economic and financial conditions. We saw some deals delayed towards the end of the quarter, particularly in Europe as buying cycles elongated. 
However, most of the factors driving our ESM performance were related to our own execution. While we are actively addressing these challenges, we do expect a continued negative impact in the short term and are therefore lowering our full year fiscal 2012 expectations for ESM license bookings from mid-teens growth to a mid-single digit decline. 
To provide context for our second quarter performance and full year expectations, it's helpful to review the status of 2 key areas of focus heading into this year: productive sales capacity and overall sales productivity. Related to productive sales capacity, increasing our sales footprint and our ability to directly reach customers is essential to capturing the strong market demand that we see for our solutions. 
However, our current expectation for productive sales capacity is significantly below our original expectation, which was for growth in the high teens for the year. We've experienced lower-than-expected hiring in the first quarter and higher-than-expected attrition in the first half. Additionally, we've seen a reduction in the overall mix of tenured sales representatives. As a result, we now expect productive sales capacity growth in the low- to mid-single digits for the year. 
Related to the second key area of focus, sales productivity, in both our original fiscal 2012 expectations and our revised expectations in July, we expected an increase in overall sales productivity. However, the higher-than-expected attrition rates, particularly for the more tenured and productive sales reps have hurt overall productivity. We've already taken several steps to respond to these challenges to increase capacity and productivity going forward. 
First, we aggressively ramped hiring in the second quarter, and we'll continue that ramp through the second half of our fiscal year. Although we will take these newly hired resources sometime to be fully productive, we expect to see tangible results next year. Second, we are recruiting new senior sales leadership to fill key positions to both help to grow capacity and drive increased productivity as rapidly as possible. Finally, we're very focused on retaining existing sales talent. 
As we put these steps into place to increase productive sales capacity and address overall sales productivity, it's important to note we are building on what history has shown to be a strong base and sales process, with CIO level access, leading solution suites and the industry's best training and qualification process. We have an excellent team in place. However, we need to evolve our current sales organization to increase the size of the team and make sure it has the tools required to sustain its forward momentum. 
The other key areas that are important to discuss are our growth initiatives, cloud and SaaS. I'm pleased that both of these areas are performing very well for us. One of our major goals heading into the fiscal year was to establish BMC as the leader in cloud management. As customers standardize on our cloud management suite, it positions us well for long-term revenue growth. 
We're executing well against this goal as indicated by our cloud results. During the quarter, the number of cloud wins and license bookings were well above plan, and we currently have a strong and growing clout pipeline. New cloud customers include AIG, AXYS Technologies, Duke Energy, Huawei Technologies, Telstra and sanofi-aventis. 
Another major strategic imperative is to become the leader in Software-as-a-Service management. The number of new SaaS customers closed in the quarter and the related amount of subscription annual contract value, ACV, continues to show strong growth. Our offerings include Remedyforce, which we offer directly and through Salesforce.com, and Remedy OnDemand, which we market directly through our BMC and reseller channel. New wins for Remedyforce include City College of New York and Hofstra University, and key wins for our Remedy OnDemand include the Spanish bank BBVA and City Colleges of Chicago. We are optimistic about the opportunity for these solutions. 
From a financial perspective, it's important to highlight that because our SaaS business is a subscription-based offering, it is not included in our reported ESM license bookings. We were also pleased to note that during the quarter, 18 ESM customers with licensed transactions above $1 million chose to standardize across multiple BSM disciplines. One of the keys to gaining more platform wins is a relentless focus on maintaining a competitive edge for our technology in terms of its functionality and how it is seamlessly integrated. 
One area of growing importance is the need for development and operations to collaborate closely to manage application changes successfully into production. This area is commonly referred to as  DevOps. The recent acquisition of StreamStep, a business software provider focused on accelerating enterprise application delivery and improving release quality, positions us as a leader in this rapidly growing market segment. Our focus here is to integrate StreamStep's process management capabilities into an existing BMC solution to support seamless application management from development to production. 
Another bright spot for ESM during the quarter was the performance of our professional services business. Fueled in part by increased demand for clout implementations, our professional services revenue rose 35% for the second quarter in a row with positive gross margins. 
To summarize ESM's second quarter performance, we entered fiscal 2012 with expectations that were predicated on growing productive sales capacity, improving sales productivity and winning in new markets. However, the lower-than-expected productive sales capacity and sales productivity have impacted overall ESM license bookings. We are aggressively taking actions to steam attrition and increased productivity. Our management team and entire company are focused on improving ESM's performance. In short, we have identified the issues impacting our ESM business, and we know what steps are required to increase its sales capacity and sales productivity. 
We continue to benefit from the strength of our technology and see positive trends in several key areas, including cloud management, SaaS, major BSM platform wins and our professional services business. We will continue to provide you details of our progress as I do believe the market opportunities for ESM solution remain large and growing.
Let me turn now to our MSM business. MSM had another very good quarter. Total MSM bookings for the trailing 12 months increased 25% to $939 million. Total MSM annualized bookings for the trailing 12 months were up 13%. We continue to see growth in the annual spend rate of our top 15 MSM transactions in the second quarter. 
During the quarter, we added or expanded our relationships with new and existing customers through 102 new product placements in MSM. We expanded our relationship with customers like TNT Express, Crédit Agricole Technologies and the Department of Treasury IT. We also saw continued strength in workload automation, which includes our BMC Control-M product line. As you know, workload automation represents about 1/3 of our MSM business. We added 13 new BMC Control-M customers and expanded our existing relationships with 55 new product placements. Some key workload automation wins in the second quarter included Continental Casualty Company, Macy's and ANZ Banking Group. 
The mainframe business continues to offer very good opportunities for us. In our sixth annual worldwide mainframe survey, one of the most referenced surveys in the industry, 62% of the respondents expect to grow overall mainframe capacity. That's up from 56% last year. Among respondents at large companies, 93% expected capacity to grow or remain steady. About half of all respondents said new workloads and new business applications are contributing to their capacity growth. 
Finally, it's worth noting that 60% said the top IT priority is keeping costs down. Our MSM solutions help our enterprise customers meet their key business priorities while lowering their cost of mainframe management. The need to address growing IT complexity through more efficient IT management is common to customers of both our ESM and MSM businesses. We continue to see opportunities to leverage our strengths across our distributed and mainframe IT management portfolios, among the largest enterprise customers around the world.
Let me close by summarizing why I believe we are well positioned today. While our markets are not immune from today's economic and financial uncertainties, our market opportunity is substantial and expanding. Our company is strong, focused, very profitable and committed to building shareholder value. To do so, we are intensely focused on addressing our operational challenges, and we are confident that we have the correct strategy, people, products and the technology in place to capture the opportunities ahead. 
Let me now turn the call over to Steve Solcher to provide a more detailed financial review of the quarter."

Before I begin, I would like to make a few brief comments regarding our financial performance. Despite the results in our ESM license bookings, I am pleased with the overall financial health of our company. 
Total bookings are up 11% through the first half. Our income statement reflects strong growth in total revenue and record profitability levels. Cash flow growth is strong, and we expect fiscal 2012 to be a record year for cash flow from operations. Our balance sheet remains solid with $1.6 billion in cash and marketable securities. With those thoughts in mind, let me now turn to our financial results.
Non-GAAP operating income increased by 13% from $191 million to $216 million in the second quarter. Our second quarter non-GAAP operating margin was 39%, up 1 percentage point from the year-ago quarter. For the first half of fiscal 2012, non-GAAP operating income increased 11% from $348 million to $387 million. Non-GAAP operating margin for the first half was 37%, up 1 percentage point year-over-year. 
ESM's non-GAAP operating income in the second quarter was $89 million, up 17% from the year-ago quarter. ESM's non-GAAP operating margin increased year-over-year by 1 percentage point to 26%. MSM's non-GAAP operating income in the second quarter was $127 million, up 11% from the year-ago quarter, and its non-GAAP operating margin increased 1 percentage point to 61%.
Please refer to Slide 5 in our presentation for selected non-GAAP financial information, which includes segment profitability of our ESM and MSM business units. Our non-GAAP net earnings for the second quarter were $153 million, up 4% from the second quarter of fiscal 2011. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the period was $0.87, which reflects a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 28% for the quarter. These non-GAAP results reflect diluted shares outstanding in the second quarter of $176 million versus $181 million in the year-ago period. 
GAAP operating income in the second quarter was $161 million compared with $144 million in the year-ago quarter. GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share were $115 million and $0.65 per diluted share compared to $132 million and $0.73 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2011, respectively. Prior-year second quarter GAAP net earnings were positively impacted by net income tax benefits of $18 million, which were recorded in connection with tax authority settlements related to prior year's tax matters. These tax benefits were excluded from our non-GAAP results. 
Turning now to bookings. Total bookings for the second quarter were $382 million, a 16% decrease compared to the year-ago quarter. On a constant currency basis, second quarter bookings decreased 14%. Total bookings for the first half were up 11% to $998 million. Total license bookings for the second quarter decreased by 15% year-over-year to $188 million. For the first half, license bookings rose 7% to $380 million. The weighted average contract length for total bookings on a trailing 12-month basis was 2.33 years, up 7% from 2.18 years in the year-ago period. After normalizing for contract length, trailing 12-month annualized bookings for the second quarter were $986 million, up 6% from the year-ago period. 
Please refer to Slide 7 in our presentation. Now let me turn to the performance of each of our business units. In the second quarter, total ESM license bookings were $126 million, down 13% in the year-ago quarter and up 25% sequentially compared to the first quarter. For the first half of fiscal 2012, ESM license bookings were down 8% to $227 million. 
Turning to the MSM business unit. Total MSM bookings for the trailing 12 months increased 25% to $939 million and had an average contract length of 3.23 years. On a constant currency basis, trailing 12-month MSM bookings were up 24%. After normalizing for contract length, MSM total annualized bookings for the trailing 12 months were up 13% as reported and 12% on a constant currency basis to $290 million. 
Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the quarter was $557 million, an 11% increase compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2011. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased 10%. License revenue in the second quarter was $230 million, up 10% from a year ago. ESM license revenue was $146 million, up 11%, while MSM's license revenue was $84 million, up 9% from the second quarter of last year. 
For the second quarter, maintenance revenue was $271 million, an increase of 7% compared to the year-ago quarter and up $6 million sequentially. ESM maintenance revenue was $146 million, up 7%, and MSM maintenance revenue was $125 million, up 8% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2011. We are pleased with both the continued sequential and year-over-year growth in maintenance revenue across both of our business units. 
Professional services revenue, which is included in the ESM business unit, grew 35% from the year-ago period to $57 million in the second quarter. This business delivered a non-GAAP gross margin of 8%.
Moving next to operating expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter were $340 million, up 9% from the year-ago period. On a constant currency basis, non-GAAP operating expenses were up 7% year-over-year. This increase reflects the investments we are making in growth opportunities within our ESM business around cloud, SaaS and professional services as well as the impact of acquisitions. 
Looking at our business units. ESM's non-GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter were $259 million, up 11% from the year-ago quarter. MSM's non-GAAP operating expenses were $81 million, up 5% compared to the year-ago quarter. We are focused on improving profitability and continue to identify opportunities to improve our cost structure across our businesses. Other income in the second quarter was a loss of $5 million compared to a slight gain in the year-ago quarter. This year-over-year decline is primarily due to a reduction in the net gains related to our deferred compensation plan.
Now turning to the balance sheet. Total deferred license revenue at the end of the second quarter was $647 million, up 8% year-over-year. During the quarter, we deferred $68 million of license revenue or 36% of license bookings and recorded $107 million of deferred license revenue from the balance sheet. The deferral rate for the quarter of 36% was impacted by a lower-than-expected deferral rate in our ESM business of 25%. Total deferred revenue decreased by $174 million sequentially to $1.9 billion. Their current portion of deferred revenue now stands at 52%. 
Our net capitalized software development costs were $214 million, a 6% increase over the first quarter as we capitalized $36 million and amortized $24 million. For the year, we expect net software capitalization to be down approximately $15 million over the prior year primarily due to increased amortization. Cash and marketable securities at September 30 totaled $1.6 billion, a decrease of $126 million sequentially. Our net cash position was $1.2 billion at September 30.  
For the quarter, cash flow from operations was $162 million, up 27% from the year-ago quarter. As of September 30, we have generated 51% of the midpoint of our revised full year guidance for cash flow from operations versus 38% in the previous comparable period. 
During the second quarter, we repurchased 5.4 million shares of our stock for a total cost of $225 million. Our Board of Directors has authorized an additional $1 billion per share repurchases. Along with the remaining amount from prior authorizations, we now have $1.2 billion remaining in our share repurchase program. 
Let me briefly sum up. We remain confident in the market opportunity ahead and in our ability to capture it. Our strategic ESM initiatives, including cloud, SaaS and professional services are exceeding our expectations. We are taking the necessary steps that we believe will reduce sales attrition and increase sales productivity, which should bode well for our continued success. Our MSM business continues to perform well. We remain a very profitable and strong company that is generating robust cash flows and is a leader in our field. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for his concluding remarks."

Let me assure you that we have identified the issues impacting the performance of our ESM business. We know what steps are required to increase the productive capacity and overall productivity of our ESM sales organization, and we are intently engaged in that activity now, and we'll be measuring our progress and reporting it out to you regularly. With that, let me update you on our view for the remainder of fiscal 2012. 
Due to our performance in the first half and our current outlook for the remainder of the year, we are lowering our full year expectations for bookings, revenue, cash flow and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. We now expect non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $3.21 to $3.31. At the midpoint, this would represent a 9% increase over last year. This includes approximately $0.02 dilution related to the acquisition of Coradiant. This range excludes an estimated $0.88 to $0.93 per share for non-GAAP adjustments, including expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation and severance, exit costs and related charges. 
The assumptions underlying our full year fiscal 2012 expectations include: total bookings growth in the mid-single digits; ESM license bookings decline in the mid-single digits; MSM total bookings growth in the high-single digits; revenue growth in the mid-single digits; operating margin staying flat with the prior year; license bookings ratable rate similar to the prior year; currency impact at today's rates, which is about a 1 point help in both bookings and revenue on a year-over-year basis; other income at a loss of approximately $10 million for the year; weighted shares outstanding approximately 4% lower than fiscal 2011; and a non-GAAP tax rate of 26% for the year. We now expect full year fiscal 2012 cash flow from operations to be between $800 million and $850 million, which at the midpoint represents an 8% improvement over fiscal 2011. 
With that, we will now turn the call over to questions."

And we've got to get that done before we can feel confident that we can get this thing back in the growth trajectory that we know that this market and these products will allow. So that's first. Second is, just coming off the last 2 quarters, we want to be somewhat cautious. I think that we, frankly, were disappointed with the last few days of the quarter. And when it happens 2 quarters in a row, it makes you reassess your ability to estimate what's happening out there. And as we dug into it deeper, we realize that we've got to get the sales issue under control. So we're giving out guidance that we think that we won't have to, hopefully, disappoint our shareholders again."

If you look at what really changed in the bookings number from low double to mid single, a large portion of that are transactions that are going to occur in the fourth quarter, which will actually be cash flow in Q1. The other piece I'd like to highlight is that we have been running under our expense plan, and we expect expenses growth to moderate to kind of be in lockstep with what we're looking for top line growth. So it's really a combination of some of the bookings is really Q4, which is cash flow in Q1, and then we've done a really good job of moderating expense to kind of offset that decline in bookings."

So I think we just -- we need more at bats is one of our big issue. We gotten too close to where we need to close so much in the pipeline that it's just too close to the metal. We need more coverage, and more productive reps that have been here longer will provide that coverage. I think that on the product lines, cloud is doing very well. SaaS is doing very well. Both of them well ahead of plans. We can always do better, and we have plans to improve those as well, but we feel quite good about that. In terms of geographic mix, yes, there are a few standouts. U.S. federal is really behind plan, U.S. public sector in general. And we think in that market, we're coming off some tough comps, but we knew that. I think the market is just tough. U.S. public sector is just a tough market for us right now, and I think that's a macro factor. Southern Europe, it's not a big number. It's pretty -- it's just not delivering much business right now. Northern Europe grew really nice, but that's an interesting one to talk about for a second. That group has continually done very well for us. They did well again. But in the last few days of the quarter, they had between $5 million and $10 million worth of license bookings that pushed. So we were expecting them to do well and they did, but we expect them even to do better, and we can chalk those up specifically to macro issues. But again, they did well there. In the U.S., we've got -- we had one of our regions that just has, for several quarters in a row, underperformed and that I think is self-inflicted wounds there. We've made changes in sales management there, and we just need to get that in shape. Now one of the things I'll tell you, I think we have some very good salespeople in our organization and very good methodologies, very good sales model. But this attrition issue has been with us for probably 3.5, 4 years now, and it's just not scaling. We're going to have to make a few changes to get that under control."

Let me just give you one backdrop and I'll say is I think attrition is high in our industry right now in general. Now I'm going to come back and talk about us because -- but I just want to say as the backdrop. When we talk with our peers and other people in the software industry and in tech in general, it is a hot market for enterprise software sales. BMC coming off a number of very -- several strong years has been specifically -- in fact, we just interviewed a candidate from one of our ex-employees and he said that they were specifically targeting our sales force to hire. So we know that -- I just put that as the backdrop. To answer your question specifically, we've interviewed really, if not all, almost every sales representative in the company since we kind of identified that this issue was more acute than we had realized. We put in place -- we've identified what -- they told us what they see as the key issues are. One of the things we put in place is compensation plan changes to their management where attrition and recruiting are now part of the incentive system. Culturally, it has been -- or business model-wise, this sales force gives a very strong sales force but culturally, it's intensely demanding. It's an organization that assumes -- that needs quarterly performance or they ask you to leave. Some of this attrition, by the way, is not people quitting. Some of it is us telling people you've been here 2 quarters or you've had 2 quarters of weak performance, you're out the door, and that model works for a smaller company. For us, we've got to have a hybrid. We've got to have some of that, but we also have to have account managers with multiyear targets and working with large accounts. And so we made changes in the compensation. We're making change in management compensation. We've identified the structural issues, and in some cases, we are replacing sales management."

So one thing to tell you is that since we made a big change in our sales organization and you remember when that happened, Michael, the attrition skyrocketed at that moment. And in fact, we're still down",571,"No. We didn't over hire. We under hired last year. So one thing to tell you is that since we made a big change in our sales organization and you remember when that happened, Michael, the attrition skyrocketed at that moment. And in fact, we're still down from what it was that first year after we made a lot of sales leadership changes, and that year was a serious change out in our sales organization. And that -- the business model, that sales model essentially assumed an unusually high attrition model. The concept though was that you would hire these high-quality salespeople. You would give them the opportunity to make a lot of money. You hold them accountable for consistent results, and if they didn't deliver, you would get new sales reps and you do it fairly quickly. And it was -- it worked for several years for our company, but the attrition level just kept staying high. You remember we talked about attrition on these calls for several years now. What we end up seeing is that we have -- if you look at the culture, we have a well-defined rigorous kind of value-based sales process. By the way, I think it's an outstanding process. But the culture is an aggressive performance culture and it demands consistent quarterly performance. That model is fine. I think for a smaller company, you can afford to do that and kind of cycle through. When you're selling larger BSM offerings, when you're selling customers on your cloud solution that's going to -- that they're going to bet their future revenue models on, you have to have a little more of a hybrid model where you have account executives who are assigned to accounts. And they may not sell a lot for 3 quarters because they're working on a large standard transaction. And so the pendulum swing a little too far is what happened to us, Michael. And frankly, the sales management and the sales team here is made primarily, by the way, fantastic sales managers. But it is still the model that believes that 40% attrition is okay, and we don't believe it is okay. And the sales teams here have been working on it. There've been an awful lot of deep dive meetings here in the last month on this subject or since the end of the quarter. And I believe that everybody's got the message that we've got to get that under control. The other thing I'd tell you is that if you have a -- if you close a large interaction with BMC, you can make a lot of money. But if you're selling a BSM deal, it may take you 3 or 4 quarters to close that deal, and during that window, you may be vulnerable. If you're a hot salesperson who gets called by a startup in Silicon Valley, gets called by another competitor with a big guaranteed, we have one competitor that's offering our salespeople $250,000 guaranteed first year comp, guaranteed cash comp to go to work for them. And so there's just lots of opportunities, and it's a tough culture and we've got to address that through changing kind of the way we think about attrition and develop these sales people. And they have plenty of opportunity to make a lot of money. We have a lot of salespeople who make a lot of money here, Michael."

How did we go from being able to forecast for several years in a row with pretty solid accuracy and the same sales management generally in place doing it to having this kind of performance?"" And so we went through a really deep dive on the attrition level. And what we saw, for instance, in Q2 was a jump in tenured sales reps, those who have been here 3 years, for instance, and beyond. We're able to hire well. We're bringing in some bright young talent, new talent. But when you lose the people that are more tenured, then you lose a lot of that sophistication and forecasting and more productive salespeople. So what happened as a result of this when we went after Q2's performance is we really went very, very deep into analyzing what's going on with that attrition level. Because we have the pipeline, we have the forecast. The numbers that we trusted for several years were in place and in fact, had been scrubbed pretty nicely after Q1 and yet they disappointed us. And so we went in quite a bit deeper, and we collectively in the sales -- the sales leadership would tell you -- in fact, I'd tell you specifically that if we were at capacity, we would have delivered the plan, we would delivered the numbers that you'd expected in both Q1 and Q2."

As we get better and better and grow in our services organization so that we're not capacity constrained on services, the services our project managers are able to take control of that implementation and successfully implement it rapidly, which brings the customer -- gives the customer the good feeling to come back and do more and more with you.

It still does consume some sales time, particularly under capacity, but that is a real positive indicator.

So I give him a lot of credit for building -- for truly helping transform our company about building a great, aggressive hunter sales force. John really stepped out of the picture. His first big step out of the teacher was February 2010 whenever he went to this 2 direct reports, and Luca took over worldwide sales as Senior Vice President of worldwide sales in 2010. And Luca then began kind of attending mass staff meetings and was part of the senior team as he really ran sales himself. John stepped out of the company further in February of this year when he actually had no -- he just became an individual contributor and kind of consulting and mentoring and coaching, but had no line responsibilities whatsoever. At that point, he was reporting to one of my direct reports. Luca at that point was driving the sales organization. So on October 1, as soon as we finished Q2 and Luca worked very, very hard and diligently through the whole quarter, Luca and I both agreed that it was probably a good time for change. And so he has moved on and we are all in a great debt of gratitude for helping build us a great sale organization. So those are the top 2 people you referred to.

I'll tell you why I don't think that because our cloud business is doing very well, our win rates. I just got an e-mail today that was forwarded to me by a customer who sent it to our sales team saying that our cloud proof of concept that we put in for a couple of months just blew him away, said it just absolutely blew him away. It was an architecture based on B block architecture with Cisco and using BMC's cloud life cycle manager, and the e-mail from the customer was effusive, talking about how it blew him away. So the cloud business is doing excellent. I would say that what maybe -- it's not exactly what you asked, but what definitely can happen to us being under capacity is our salespeople are selling what is easy to sell or what is easier to sell, which is cloud, which is SaaS. And they're diverting to where the customers are saying, ""I'm going to buy now in this area. Come to the -- let's engage in a contract negotiation. Let's engage in an evaluation."" What would suffer if you're under capacity is that now, you're not necessarily out there driving a Remedy ITSM upgrade or a -- to helping a customer at the new knowledge management or change management modules on top of it or taking BladeLogic up to do applications provisioning and middleware provisioning. So while those businesses are still a big part of our business, I think it's the opposite. I think we're doing very well in cloud, and I think that the attention it's getting from our sales force is strong. And some of the stuff that we're really focused on 2 years ago is maybe taking a little bit of a backseat as we -- as our fair sales model basically focuses on what the customers want now.
All right. Well, listen. I want to thank you very much. Appreciate you dialing in. I think we, hopefully, made it very clear to you that we think we've got some outstanding products. We think we're in some excellent markets. And frankly, we need to get this sales force grown, matured. We've got the best salespeople and some of the best sales management in the industry, but our company has grown past the point of a single model. We're going to be highly focused on this, and we will be reporting to you in our progress, so that you can draw your own conclusions as to our ability to get back to the growth trajectory that we know that our company and this market will get us.

Our second quarter performance was mixed. During the quarter, we reported solid growth in total revenue, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP EPS and cash flow from operations. Our MSM and professional services businesses again performe",1667,"Thank you, Derrick. Our second quarter performance was mixed. During the quarter, we reported solid growth in total revenue, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP EPS and cash flow from operations. Our MSM and professional services businesses again performed well. We did a good job of managing expenses. Both our ESM and MSM businesses maintained their technology leadership positions in their respective markets. One area of underperformance during the quarter was in ESM license bookings, which decreased 13% compared to the year-ago quarter. There were several factors driving this result that I will address shortly. 
Despite our mixed performance in the second quarter, we remain confident that our strategy is sound, that our solutions are the best in the industry, that our competitive position is strong and that our long-term growth prospects are encouraging. Let me provide more specifics regarding our second quarter financial performance.
Revenue grew 11%. Non-GAAP operating income rose 13%. Non-GAAP operating margin increased by 1 percentage point. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was up 6%, and operating cash flow was up 27%. Now let me provide additional perspective on our 2 business units, beginning with ESM.
ESM license bookings were, as noted, down during the second quarter. Some of the shortfall was due to external factors. Our performance in key geographic areas and market segments, most notably certain regions in EMEA and the U.S. public sector, continued to be soft due to economic and financial conditions. We saw some deals delayed towards the end of the quarter, particularly in Europe as buying cycles elongated. 
However, most of the factors driving our ESM performance were related to our own execution. While we are actively addressing these challenges, we do expect a continued negative impact in the short term and are therefore lowering our full year fiscal 2012 expectations for ESM license bookings from mid-teens growth to a mid-single digit decline. 
To provide context for our second quarter performance and full year expectations, it's helpful to review the status of 2 key areas of focus heading into this year: productive sales capacity and overall sales productivity. Related to productive sales capacity, increasing our sales footprint and our ability to directly reach customers is essential to capturing the strong market demand that we see for our solutions. 
However, our current expectation for productive sales capacity is significantly below our original expectation, which was for growth in the high teens for the year. We've experienced lower-than-expected hiring in the first quarter and higher-than-expected attrition in the first half. Additionally, we've seen a reduction in the overall mix of tenured sales representatives. As a result, we now expect productive sales capacity growth in the low- to mid-single digits for the year. 
Related to the second key area of focus, sales productivity, in both our original fiscal 2012 expectations and our revised expectations in July, we expected an increase in overall sales productivity. However, the higher-than-expected attrition rates, particularly for the more tenured and productive sales reps, have hurt overall productivity. We've already taken several steps to respond to these challenges to increase capacity and productivity going forward. 
First, we aggressively ramped hiring in the second quarter, and we'll continue that ramp through the second half of our fiscal year. Although we will take these newly hired resources sometime to be fully productive, we expect to see tangible results next year. Second, we are recruiting new senior sales leadership to fill key positions to both help to grow capacity and drive increased productivity as rapidly as possible. Finally, we're very focused on retaining existing sales talent. 
As we put these steps into place to increase productive sales capacity and address overall sales productivity, it's important to note we are building on what history has shown to be a strong base and sales process, with CIO level access, leading solution suites and the industry's best training and qualification process. We have an excellent team in place. However, we need to evolve our current sales organization to increase the size of the team and make sure it has the tools required to sustain its forward momentum. 
The other key areas that are important to discuss are our growth initiatives, cloud and SaaS. I'm pleased that both of these areas are performing very well for us. One of our major goals heading into the fiscal year was to establish BMC as the leader in cloud management. As customers standardize on our cloud management suite, it positions us well for long-term revenue growth. 
We're executing well against this goal as indicated by our cloud results. During the quarter, the number of cloud wins and license bookings were well above plan, and we currently have a strong and growing cloud pipeline. New cloud customers include AIG, AXYS Technologies, Duke Energy, Huawei Technologies, Telstra and sanofi-aventis. 
Another major strategic imperative is to become the leader in Software-as-a-Service management. The number of new SaaS customers closed in the quarter and the related amount of subscription annual contract value, ACV, continues to show strong growth. Our offerings include Remedyforce, which we offer directly and through Salesforce.com, and Remedy OnDemand, which we market directly through our BMC and reseller channel. New wins for Remedyforce include City College of New York and Hofstra University, and key wins for our Remedy OnDemand include the Spanish bank, BBVA, and City Colleges of Chicago. We are optimistic about the opportunity for these solutions. 
From a financial perspective, it's important to highlight that because our SaaS business is a subscription-based offering, it is not included in our reported ESM license bookings. We were also pleased to note that during the quarter, 18 ESM customers with licensed transactions above $1 million chose to standardize across multiple BSM disciplines. One of the keys to gaining more platform wins is a relentless focus on maintaining a competitive edge for our technology in terms of its functionality and how it is seamlessly integrated. 
One area of growing importance is the need for development and operations to collaborate closely to manage application changes successfully into production. This area is commonly referred to as  DevOps. The recent acquisition of StreamStep, a business software provider focused on accelerating enterprise application delivery and improving release quality, positions us as a leader in this rapidly growing market segment. Our focus here is to integrate StreamStep's process management capabilities into an existing BMC solution to support seamless application management from development to production. 
Another bright spot for ESM during the quarter was the performance of our professional services business. Fueled in part by increased demand for cloud implementations, our professional services revenue rose 35% for the second quarter in a row with positive gross margins. 
To summarize ESM's second quarter performance, we entered fiscal 2012 with expectations that were predicated on growing productive sales capacity, improving sales productivity and winning in new markets. However, the lower-than-expected productive sales capacity and sales productivity have impacted overall ESM license bookings. We are aggressively taking actions to stem attrition and increase productivity. Our management team and entire company are focused on improving ESM's performance. In short, we have identified the issues impacting our ESM business, and we know what steps are required to increase its sales capacity and sales productivity. 
We continue to benefit from the strength of our technology and see positive trends in several key areas, including cloud management, SaaS, major BSM platform wins and our professional services business. We will continue to provide you details of our progress as I do believe the market opportunities for ESM solution remain large and growing.
Let me turn now to our MSM business. MSM had another very good quarter. Total MSM bookings for the trailing 12 months increased 25% to $939 million. Total MSM annualized bookings for the trailing 12 months were up 13%. We continue to see growth in the annual spend rate of our top 15 MSM transactions in the second quarter. 
During the quarter, we added or expanded our relationships with new and existing customers through 102 new product placements in MSM. We expanded our relationship with customers like TNT Express, Crédit Agricole Technologies and the Department of Treasury IT. We also saw continued strength in workload automation, which includes our BMC Control-M product line. As you know, workload automation represents about 1/3 of our MSM business. We added 13 new BMC Control-M customers and expanded our existing relationships with 55 new product placements. Some key workload automation wins in the second quarter included Continental Casualty Company, Macy's and ANZ Banking Group. 
The mainframe business continues to offer very good opportunities for us. In our sixth annual worldwide mainframe survey, one of the most referenced surveys in the industry, 62% of the respondents expect to grow overall mainframe capacity. That's up from 56% last year. Among respondents at large companies, 93% expected capacity to grow or remain steady. About half of all respondents said new workloads and new business applications are contributing to their capacity growth. 
Finally, it's worth noting that 60% said the top IT priority is keeping costs down. Our MSM solutions help our enterprise customers meet their key business priorities while lowering their cost of mainframe management. The need to address growing IT complexity through more efficient IT management is common to customers of both our ESM and MSM businesses. We continue to see opportunities to leverage our strengths across our distributed and mainframe IT management portfolios, among the largest enterprise customers around the world.
Let me close by summarizing why I believe we are well positioned today. While our markets are not immune from today's economic and financial uncertainties, our market opportunity is substantial and expanding. Our company is strong, focused, very profitable and committed to building shareholder value. To do so, we are intently focused on addressing our operational challenges, and we are confident that we have the correct strategy, people, products and the technology in place to capture the opportunities ahead. 
Let me now turn the call over to Steve Solcher to provide a more detailed financial review of the quarter."

Before I begin, I would like to make a few brief comments regarding our financial performance. Despite the results in our ESM license bookings, I am pleased with the overall financial health of our company. 
Total bookings are up 11% through the first half. Our income statement reflects strong growth in total revenue and record profitability levels. Cash flow growth is strong, and we expect fiscal 2012 to be a record year for cash flow from operations. Our balance sheet remains solid with $1.6 billion in cash and marketable securities. With those thoughts in mind, let me now turn to our financial results.
Non-GAAP operating income increased by 13% from $191 million to $216 million in the second quarter. Our second quarter non-GAAP operating margin was 39%, up 1 percentage point from the year-ago quarter. For the first half of fiscal 2012, non-GAAP operating income increased 11% from $348 million to $387 million. Non-GAAP operating margin for the first half was 37%, up 1 percentage point year-over-year. 
ESM's non-GAAP operating income in the second quarter was $89 million, up 17% from the year-ago quarter. ESM's non-GAAP operating margin increased year-over-year by 1 percentage point to 26%. MSM's non-GAAP operating income in the second quarter was $127 million, up 11% from the year-ago quarter, and its non-GAAP operating margin increased 1 percentage point to 61%.
Please refer to Slide 5 in our presentation for selected non-GAAP financial information, which includes segment profitability of our ESM and MSM business units. Our non-GAAP net earnings for the second quarter were $153 million, up 4% from the second quarter of fiscal 2011. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the period was $0.87, which reflects a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 28% for the quarter. These non-GAAP results reflect diluted shares outstanding in the second quarter of $176 million versus $181 million in the year-ago period. 
GAAP operating income in the second quarter was $161 million compared with $144 million in the year-ago quarter. GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share were $115 million and $0.65 per diluted share compared to $132 million and $0.73 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2011, respectively. Prior-year second quarter GAAP net earnings were positively impacted by net income tax benefits of $18 million, which were recorded in connection with tax authority settlements related to prior year's tax matters. These tax benefits were excluded from our non-GAAP results. 
Turning now to bookings. Total bookings for the second quarter were $382 million, a 16% decrease compared to the year-ago quarter. On a constant currency basis, second quarter bookings decreased 14%. Total bookings for the first half were up 11% to $998 million. Total license bookings for the second quarter decreased by 15% year-over-year to $188 million. For the first half, license bookings rose 7% to $380 million. The weighted average contract length for total bookings on a trailing 12-month basis was 2.33 years, up 7% from 2.18 years in the year-ago period. After normalizing for contract length, trailing 12-month annualized bookings for the second quarter were $986 million, up 6% from the year-ago period. 
Please refer to Slide 7 in our presentation. Now let me turn to the performance of each of our business units. In the second quarter, total ESM license bookings were $126 million, down 13% in the year-ago quarter and up 25% sequentially compared to the first quarter. For the first half of fiscal 2012, ESM license bookings were down 8% to $227 million. 
Turning to the MSM business unit. Total MSM bookings for the trailing 12 months increased 25% to $939 million and had an average contract length of 3.23 years. On a constant currency basis, trailing 12-month MSM bookings were up 24%. After normalizing for contract length, MSM total annualized bookings for the trailing 12 months were up 13% as reported and 12% on a constant currency basis to $290 million. 
Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the quarter was $557 million, an 11% increase compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2011. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased 10%. License revenue in the second quarter was $230 million, up 10% from a year ago. ESM license revenue was $146 million, up 11%, while MSM's license revenue was $84 million, up 9% from the second quarter of last year. 
For the second quarter, maintenance revenue was $271 million, an increase of 7% compared to the year-ago quarter and up $6 million sequentially. ESM maintenance revenue was $146 million, up 7%, and MSM maintenance revenue was $125 million, up 8% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2011. We are pleased with both the continued sequential and year-over-year growth in maintenance revenue across both of our business units. 
Professional services revenue, which is included in the ESM business unit, grew 35% from the year-ago period to $57 million in the second quarter. This business delivered a non-GAAP gross margin of 8%.
Moving next to operating expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter were $340 million, up 9% from the year-ago period. On a constant currency basis, non-GAAP operating expenses were up 7% year-over-year. This increase reflects the investments we are making in growth opportunities within our ESM business around cloud, SaaS and professional services as well as the impact of acquisitions. 
Looking at our business units. ESM's non-GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter were $259 million, up 11% from the year-ago quarter. MSM's non-GAAP operating expenses were $81 million, up 5% compared to the year-ago quarter. We are focused on improving profitability and continue to identify opportunities to improve our cost structure across our businesses. Other income in the second quarter was a loss of $5 million compared to a slight gain in the year-ago quarter. This year-over-year decline is primarily due to a reduction in the net gains related to our deferred compensation plan.
Now turning to the balance sheet. Total deferred license revenue at the end of the second quarter was $647 million, up 8% year-over-year. During the quarter, we deferred $68 million of license revenue or 36% of license bookings and recorded $107 million of deferred license revenue from the balance sheet. The deferral rate for the quarter of 36% was impacted by a lower-than-expected deferral rate in our ESM business of 25%. Total deferred revenue decreased by $174 million sequentially to $1.9 billion. Their current portion of deferred revenue now stands at 52%. 
Our net capitalized software development costs were $214 million, a 6% increase over the first quarter as we capitalized $36 million and amortized $24 million. For the year, we expect net software capitalization to be down approximately $15 million over the prior year primarily due to increased amortization. Cash and marketable securities at September 30 totaled $1.6 billion, a decrease of $126 million sequentially. Our net cash position was $1.2 billion at September 30.  
For the quarter, cash flow from operations was $162 million, up 27% from the year-ago quarter. As of September 30, we have generated 51% of the midpoint of our revised full year guidance for cash flow from operations versus 38% in the previous comparable period. 
During the second quarter, we repurchased 5.4 million shares of our stock for a total cost of $225 million. Our Board of Directors has authorized an additional $1 billion for share repurchases. Along with the remaining amount from prior authorizations, we now have $1.2 billion remaining in our share repurchase program. 
Let me briefly sum up. We remain confident in the market opportunity ahead and in our ability to capture it. Our strategic ESM initiatives, including cloud, SaaS and professional services are exceeding our expectations. We are taking the necessary steps that we believe will reduce sales attrition and increase sales productivity, which should bode well for our continued success. Our MSM business continues to perform well. We remain a very profitable and strong company that is generating robust cash flows and is a leader in our field. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for his concluding remarks."

Let me assure you that we have identified the issues impacting the performance of our ESM business. We know what steps are required to increase the productive capacity and overall productivity of our ESM sales organization, and we are intently engaged in that activity now, and we'll be measuring our progress and reporting it out to you regularly. With that, let me update you on our view for the remainder of fiscal 2012. 
Due to our performance in the first half and our current outlook for the remainder of the year, we are lowering our full year expectations for bookings, revenue, cash flow and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. We now expect non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $3.21 to $3.31. At the midpoint, this would represent a 9% increase over last year. This includes approximately $0.02 dilution related to the acquisition of Coradiant. This range excludes an estimated $0.88 to $0.93 per share for non-GAAP adjustments, including expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation and severance, exit costs and related charges. 
The assumptions underlying our full year fiscal 2012 expectations include: total bookings growth in the mid-single digits; ESM license bookings decline in the mid-single digits; MSM total bookings growth in the high-single digits; revenue growth in the mid-single digits; operating margin staying flat with the prior year; license bookings ratable rate similar to the prior year; currency impact at today's rates, which is about a 1 point help in both bookings and revenue on a year-over-year basis; other income at a loss of approximately $10 million for the year; weighted shares outstanding approximately 4% lower than fiscal 2011; and a non-GAAP tax rate of 26% for the year. We now expect full year fiscal 2012 cash flow from operations to be between $800 million and $850 million, which at the midpoint represents an 8% improvement over fiscal 2011. 
With that, we will now turn the call over to questions."

If you look at what really changed in the bookings number from low double to mid-single, a large portion of that are transactions that are going to occur in the fourth quarter, which will actually be cash flow in Q1. The other piece I'd like to highlight is that we have been running under our expense plan, and we expect expenses growth to moderate to kind of be in lockstep with what we're looking for top line growth. So it's really a combination of some of the bookings is really Q4, which is cash flow in Q1, and then we've done a really good job of moderating expense to kind of offset that decline in bookings."

When we look at the deals that slip or the deals that we don't close, we're not, in the vast majority, we're not chalking this up to HP or IBM or somebody took the deal away from us. So I think we just -- we need more at bats is one of our big issues. We gotten too close to where we need to close so much of the pipeline that it's just too close to the metal. We need more coverage, and more productive reps that have been here longer will provide that coverage. I think that on the product lines, cloud is doing very well. SaaS is doing very well. Both of them well ahead of plans. We can always do better, and we have plans to improve those as well, but we feel quite good about that. In terms of geographic mix, yes, there are a few standouts. U.S. federal is really behind plan, U.S. public sector in general. And we think in that market, we're coming off some tough comps, but we knew that. I think the market is just tough. U.S. public sector is just a tough market for us right now, and I think that's a macro factor. Southern Europe, it's not a big number, is pretty -- it's just not delivering much business right now. Northern Europe grew really nice, but that's an interesting one to talk about for a second. That group has continually done very well for us. They did well again. But in the last 3 days of the quarter, they had between $5 million and $10 million worth of license bookings that pushed. So we were expecting them to do well and they did, but we expect them even to do better, and we can chalk those up specifically to macro issues. But again, they did well there. In the U.S., we've got -- we had one of our regions that just has, for several quarters in a row, underperformed and that I think is self-inflicted wounds there. We've made changes in sales management there, and we just need to get that in shape. Now one of the things I'll tell you, I think we have some very good salespeople in our organization and very good methodologies, very good sales model. But this attrition issue has been with us for probably 3.5, 4 years now, and it's just not scaling. We're going to have to make a few changes to get that under control."

Let me just give you one backdrop that I'll say is I think attrition is high in our industry right now in general. Now I'm going to come back and talk about us because -- but I just want to say as the backdrop. When we talk with our peers and other people in the software industry and in tech in general, it is a hot market for enterprise software sales. BMC coming off a number of very -- several strong years has been specifically -- in fact, we just interviewed a candidate from one of our ex-employees and he said that they were specifically targeting our sales force to hire. So we know that -- I just put that as the backdrop. To answer your question specifically, we've interviewed really, if not all, almost every sales representative in the company since we kind of identified that this issue was more acute than we had realized. We put in place -- we've identified what -- they told us what they see as the key issues are. One of the things we put in place is compensation plan changes to their management where attrition and recruiting are now part of the incentive system. Culturally, it has been -- or business model-wise, this sales force is a very strong sales force but culturally, it's intensely demanding. It's an organization that assumes -- that needs quarterly performance or they ask you to leave. Some of this attrition, by the way, is not people quitting. Some of it is us telling people you've been here 2 quarters or you've had 2 quarters of weak performance, you're out the door. And that model works for a smaller company. For us, we've got to have a hybrid. We've got to have some of that, but we also have to have account managers with multiyear targets and working with large accounts. And so we made changes in compensation. We're making change in management compensation. We've identified the structural issues, and in some cases, we are replacing sales management."

So one thing to tell you is that since we made a big change in our sales organization and you remember when that happened, Michael, the attrition skyrocketed at that moment. And in fact, we're still down from what it was that first year after we made a lot of sales leadership changes, and that year was a serious change out in our sales organization. And that -- the business model, that sales model essentially assumed an unusually high attrition model. The concept though was that you would hire these high-quality salespeople. You would give them the opportunity to make a lot of money. You hold them accountable for consistent results, and if they didn't deliver, you would get new sales reps and you do it fairly quickly. And it was -- it worked for several years for our company, but the attrition level just kept staying high. You remember we talked about attrition on these calls for several years now. What we end up seeing is that we have -- if you look at the culture, we have a well-defined rigorous kind of value-based sales process. By the way, I think it's an outstanding process. But the culture is an aggressive performance culture and it demands consistent quarterly performance. That model is fine, I think, for a smaller company, you can afford to do that and kind of cycle through. When you're selling larger BSM offerings, when you're selling customers on your cloud solution that's going to -- that they're going to bet their future revenue models on, you have to have a little more of a hybrid model where you have account executives who are assigned to accounts. And they may not sell a lot for 3 quarters because they're working on a large standard transaction. And so the pendulum swing a little too far is what happened to us, Michael. And frankly, the sales management and the sales team here is made primarily, by the way, fantastic sales managers. But it is still the model that believes that 40% attrition is okay, and we don't believe it is okay. And the sales teams here have been working on it. There've been an awful lot of deep dive meetings here in the last month on this subject or since the end of the quarter. And I believe that everybody's got the message that we've got to get that under control. The other thing I'd tell you is that if you have a -- if you close a large interaction with BMC, you can make a lot of money. But if you're selling a BSM deal, it may take you 3 or 4 quarters to close that deal, and during that window, you may be vulnerable. If you're a hot salesperson who gets called by a startup in Silicon Valley, gets called by another competitor with a big guaranteed. We have one competitor that's offering our salespeople $250,000 guaranteed first year comp, guaranteed cash comp to go to work for them. And so there's just lots of opportunities, and it's a tough culture and we've got to address that through changing kind of the way we think about attrition and develop these sales people. And they have plenty of opportunity to make a lot of money. We have a lot of salespeople who make a lot of money here, Michael."

We report out in our internal meetings on attrition and have been doing it for some time knowing it needed to improve. But then after -- with Q1 and then followed with Q2 we said, ""Hang on. We got to get to the root cause of what's going on with this. How did we go from being able to forecast for several years in a row with pretty solid accuracy and the same sales management generally in place doing it to having this kind of performance?"" And so we went through a really deep dive on the attrition level. And what we saw, for instance, in Q2 was a jump in tenured sales reps, those who have been here 3 years, for instance, and beyond. We're able to hire well. We're bringing in some bright young talent, new talent. But when you lose the people that are more tenured, then you lose a lot of that sophistication and forecasting and more productive salespeople. So what's happened as a result of this when we -- after Q2's performance is we really went very, very deep into analyzing what's going on with that attrition level. Because we had the pipeline, we had the forecast. The numbers that we trusted for several years were in place and in fact, had been scrubbed pretty nicely after Q1 and yet they disappointed us. And so we went in quite a bit deeper, and we collectively in the sales -- the sales leadership would tell you -- in fact, I'd tell you specifically that if we were at capacity, we would have delivered the plan, we would delivered the numbers that you'd expected in both Q1 and Q2."

We've made those changes. We expect to see attrition moderate soon, and then it just takes some time.

So we're getting deals with large banks. They've got to cut costs. They've got to modernize their IT, and they're picking us to do so. Telco, I would say in general, we had some nice telco wins that were cloud-related. But the cloud deals are usually smaller ASPs where they do a proof of concept or they stand up a store front, and it's kind of the build it and they will come sort of model for cloud. And they usually buy enough from us to stand the cloud up. And then our contracts are structured so that as they build cloud volume, we have the upside to do more business with them. So I don't have the numbers in front of me so I shouldn't speculate. But my gut tells me that financial services did well with those 2 of our largest deals, and telco's probably a little under what it normally would be."

I tell you one of the reasons it's positive is back to the sales force issue. One of the most important things that the sales force needs to do to be productive, and this is an issue when you're under capacity that can bite you, is that if you're a salesperson and you close a large, say, a $10 million deal with a customer with a lot of BMC products, you're going to be occupied with that customer on implementation. As we get better and better and grow in our services organization so that we're not capacity constrained on services, the services our project managers are able to take control of that implementation and successfully implement it rapidly, which brings the customer -- gives the customer the good feeling to come back and do more and more with you. Earlier in our evolution when our services were struggling more, it consumes more sales time. It still does consume some sales time, but particularly under capacity. But that is a real positive indicator. And also, a lot of the sales -- a lot of the services growth was cloud-related, and we've got that down to a much more cookie cutter profitable sort of business for ourselves now and that success breeds success."

So I give him a lot of credit for building -- for really helping transform our company by building a great, aggressive hunter sales force. John really stepped out of the picture. His first big step out of the picture was February 2010 whenever he went to his 2 direct reports, and Luca took over worldwide sales as Senior Vice President of worldwide sales in 2010. And Luca then began kind of attending my staff meetings and was part of the senior team as he really ran sales himself. John stepped out of the company further in February of this year when he actually had no -- he just became an individual contributor and kind of consulting and mentoring and coaching, but had no line responsibilities whatsoever. At that point, he was reporting to one of my direct reports. Luca at that point was driving the sales organization. So on October 1, as soon as we finished Q2 and Luca worked very, very hard and diligently through the whole quarter, Luca and I both agreed that it was probably a good time for change. And so he has moved on and we owe him a great debt of gratitude for helping build us out a great sale organization. So those are the top 2 people you referred to. And then beneath that, we had some execution issues in a couple of areas of sales. One is the forecast that dropped the farthest, the fastest in the last few days and that was U.S. West and that individual is no longer with the company, and we will be announcing a replacement for him very shortly. We're also interviewing and we have offers outstanding right now for some fairly senior salespeople are sales management in things like sales operations and others for companies who are perhaps a step ahead of us in maturity, so that we can evolve from not just a hunter model but a little bit of the hunter and strategic account management model that we're going to need in order to kind of take our game to the next level."

I'll tell you why I don't think that because our cloud business is doing very well, our win rates. I just got an e-mail today that was forwarded to me by a customer who sent it to our sales team saying that our cloud proof of concept that we put in for a couple of months just blew him away, said it just absolutely blew him away. It was an architecture based on B block architecture with Cisco and using BMC's cloud life cycle manager, and the e-mail from the customer was effusive, talking about how it blew him away. So the cloud business is doing excellent. I would say that what maybe -- it's not exactly what you asked, but what definitely can happen to us being under capacity is our salespeople are selling what is easy to sell or what is easier to sell, which is cloud, which is SaaS. And they're diverting to where the customers are saying, ""I'm going to buy now in this area. Come to the -- let's engage in a contract negotiation. Let's engage in an evaluation."" What would suffer if you're under capacity is that now, you're not necessarily out there driving a Remedy ITSM upgrade or a -- to helping a customer add the new knowledge management or change management modules on top of it or taking BladeLogic up to do applications provisioning and middleware provisioning. So while those businesses are still a big part of our business, I think it's the opposite. I think we're doing very well in cloud, and I think that the attention it's getting from our sales force is strong. And some of the stuff that we're really focused on 2 years ago is maybe taking a little bit of a backseat as we -- as our laissez-faire sales model basically focuses on what the customers want now.
All right. Well, listen. I want to thank you very much. Appreciate you dialing in. I think we, hopefully, made it very clear to you that we think we've got some outstanding products.
