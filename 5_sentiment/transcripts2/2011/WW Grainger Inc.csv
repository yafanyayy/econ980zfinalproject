Please be sure to reference our earnings release issued January 25 in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website to supplement this webcast.
Before we go any further, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this webcast constitute forward-looking information.

Strong sales growth and exceptional operating earnings leverage was the story for the quarter. Our record performance was driven by the U.S. business, along with solid contributions from many of the international businesses. Strong organic sales performance in the quarter further demonstrates that we have continued to gain market share.
For the company, total sales of $1.8 billion increased 12%, up 14% on a daily basis versus the 2009 fourth quarter. On a reported basis, operating earnings increased 28% and net earnings increased 36%. Reported earnings per share of $1.83 increased 44% versus the 2009 fourth quarter.
Let me walk through some unusual items in both periods to describe a normalized view of our results. Number one, consistent with the first nine months of 2010, we had a benefit in the quarter from the implementation of our new company policy where paid time off is now earned in the current year versus the preceding year as was the case under the old policy.
The $0.04 per share benefit in the fourth quarter was a bit lower than originally expected because more employees elected to carry over their remaining paid time off into 2011 than we had forecasted. The full-year benefit of this change amounted to $0.28 per share. It is important to note that this benefit will not repeat in 2011. So if you were to exclude this $0.04 item, earnings per share for the quarter would have been $1.79, up 41% versus $1.27 in 2009.
Number two, in the 2009 fourth quarter, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $9 million or $0.07 per share. And number three, in the 2009 fourth quarter, we recorded a severance charge of $7.5 million or $0.05 per share, for positions that were eliminated during that quarter. Excluding these three items from their respective years, 2010 fourth quarter earnings per share would have been up 29% versus an adjusted $1.39 in the 2009 period.
Iâ€™d also like to highlight one more item that contributed to earnings in the 2010 fourth quarter. As noted in the earnings release, we benefited from some tax credits and incentives from various states that temporarily lowered our effective tax rate to 36.6% versus a more normalized rate of 39.1%. This favorability contributed about $0.06 per share to earnings for the quarter.
In a few moments, we will take a closer look at sales results for the quarter. In the meantime, let's walk down the operating section of the income statement. Our gross profit margin for the quarter was down approximately 10 basis points versus last year.
Improved gross profit margins in the United States and in the other businesses were offset by a decline in the gross profit margin in Canada. We will provide more detail when we review results by segment.
Reported operating margins were up about 145 basis points to 11.6%. However, if you exclude the $4 million benefit in the quarter related to the change in the paid time off policy and exclude the unusual items from the 2009 quarter, the company's operating margin increased by 20 basis points to 11.3%.
Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we will cover the following topics. First, sales by segment in the quarter and in the month of December; second, our operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment and finally, we will wrap up with a discussion on our 2011 guidance and other key items of interest.
As mentioned earlier, total company sales for the quarter were up 12% versus the prior year and up 14% on a daily basis. There was one less selling day in the quarter, 63 days versus 64 in the 2009 fourth quarter. Strong volume growth was responsible for the majority of the revenue increase contributing nine of the 14% increase in daily sales.
An additional two percentage points of growth was attributable to oil spill-related sales. In addition, price, acquisitions and foreign exchange each contributed one percentage point to company sales growth in the quarter.
Let's move on to sales by segment. We reported two segments, United States and Canada. Our remaining operations in Japan, Mexico, India, Columbia, China, Puerto Rico and Panama are reported under a grouping titled Other Businesses. Sales in the United States segment, which accounts for about 83% of total company revenue, increased 9% in the quarter, 11% on a daily basis.
Volume represented seven percentage points of the 11% increase. Sales of oil spill-related products contributed two percentage points. Price and the sales of seasonal products each contributed one percentage point.
All U.S. end markets posted growth versus the 2009 fourth quarter. Here is what we saw in the quarter. Reseller, driven by oil spill-related sales, was up in the high 40s, heavy manufacturing was up in the high teens, light manufacturing was up in the low-double digits, retail was up in the high-single digits and government, commercial and contractor were up in the low-single digits.
It is important to note that our government business has been flat to growing modestly since March of 2010. More recently, this end market was down low-single digits in October and up low-single digits in November and December of 2010. While we are not anticipating growth in overall government spending in 2011, we continue to see opportunities to gain market share at many levels of government.
Now, let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represent about 12% of total company revenues. For the quarter, sales in Canada increased 20% in U.S. dollars and were up 15% in local currency. On a daily basis, sales were up 22% and 17% in Canadian dollars.
Sales in Canada benefited from share gain and the continued momentum in the Canadian economy. Volume accounted for 12 percentage points of the growth and acquisitions contributed five percentage points. For the quarter, we saw strength in the heavy manufacturing, forestry, mining and oil and gas sectors, partially offset by weakness in sales to the government.
Let's conclude our review of sales for the quarter by looking at the other businesses. Again, this group includes our operations in Japan, Mexico, India, Columbia, China, Puerto Rico and Panama and currently represents about 5% of total company sales. Sales for this group were up 48%, primarily the result of the incremental sales from the Colombian business, combined with double-digit sales growth from all of the other international businesses.
Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for October and November and shared some information regarding December sales performance during the month. Let's now take a closer look at final December results.
Total company sales were up 16% on a daily basis in December versus December of 2009. There were 21 selling days in December 2010 and 22 selling days in December 2009. Contributing to higher daily sales growth in December were 10 percentage points due to volume and three percentage points related to the oil spill.
We also believe that we benefited from the favorable placement of the Christmas and New Year's holidays, which fell on Saturdays, thus minimizing the potential business disruption during that week. In addition, acquisitions, foreign exchange and seasonal products each contributed one percentage point to sales growth for the month.
In the United States, December daily sales were up 14%. This growth consisted of nine percentage points of volume, along with three percentage points related to the oil spill. Price and seasonal products each contributed another one percentage point to the sales growth for the month.
Here is how each of our U.S. customer end markets performed in December. Reseller sales were up in the mid-60s, driven by products related to the oil spill. Heavy manufacturing was up in the low 20s, light manufacturing and retail were up in the low-double digits, commercial was up in the high-single digits, government was up in the low-single digits and contractor was down in the mid-single digits.
Daily sales in Canada for December were up 17% in U.S. dollars and up 12% in local currency. Volume accounted for about eight percentage points of the growth and acquisitions contributed another four percentage points.
From a customer sector standpoint, we saw the strongest growth in sales to the heavy manufacturing, agriculture and mining and forestry markets, while sales to government customers declined. With four selling days left in the month, January sales growth is trending at a more moderate rate than December. As of today, we are expecting daily sales growth in January to be around the midpoint of the 5% to 9% range that we forecasted for the full year.
Here are a few factors to consider as we compare sales trends in January versus December. First, we are up against more difficult comparisons in January than we had in December. Second, in December, we benefited from a three percentage point lift from oil spill-related sales. We do not expect any sales related to the oil spill in January or in any other month in 2011. As a result, the oil spill will represent about a one percentage point sales headwind for the year.
Third, strong sales of seasonal products contributed one percentage point to top-line growth in December. We do not expect this to repeat in January. In fact, the snowstorms that disrupted travel and transportation in the South and East Coast earlier in January are expected to be a drag on sales growth for the month. For example, our distribution center in Greenville, South Carolina was closed for nearly two days at the height of the snow and ice storms.
Finally, December included a half a month of sales for Highsmith, which we sold in mid December. It is important to note that despite the differential in growth rates between December and January that I just covered, the actual sales dollars per day in January is forecasted to be in line with December, excluding oil spill-related sales.
Now, I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.

Fourth quarter reported operating earnings for the company increased by 28% versus the 2009 fourth quarter. This increase was the result of positive expense leverage from the 12% sales growth in the quarter.The story behind the company's",1183,"Thanks, Laura. Fourth quarter reported operating earnings for the company increased by 28% versus the 2009 fourth quarter. This increase was the result of positive expense leverage from the 12% sales growth in the quarter.
The story behind the company's operating performance can best be told by reviewing segment performance. So let's begin with the United States. Reported operated earnings in the United States increased 24% versus the 2009 fourth quarter.
Operating performance in the United States was driven by better gross margins and positive expense leverage. The improvement in gross profit margins was primarily due to positive inflation recovery, partially offset by negative mix attributable to proportionately higher sales to large customers.
Operating expenses in the United States increased 3%, 4% after excluding the paid time off policy change. The increase in operating expenses was due exclusively to higher payroll and benefits costs such as sales commissions and bonuses tied to higher volume and improved profitability. Other operating expenses declined slightly year-over-year due to cost reduction efforts over the past 12 months.
Excluding the benefit from the paid time off policy change in 2010 and the severance and impairments charges in 2009, quarterly operating expenses in the United States increased 7%. If you exclude unusual items in both years attributable to the United States, operating earnings for this segment were up 16% and operating margins increased 90 basis points to 14.7%.
Let's spend some time looking at whatâ€™s behind the operating performance for our business in Canada. Operating earnings decreased 32% in U.S. dollars and 35% in local currency. This decline was the result of lower gross profit margins and negative expense leverage.
In the fourth quarter of 2009, we recognized a large inventory pick-up making for strong gross profit margins in the 2009 quarter, but a very difficult comparison in the 2010 quarter. As a result, our gross profit margin in Canada decreased 300 basis points versus the 2009 fourth quarter.
Early in 2010 in Canada, we implemented a new process for booking inventory adjustments to reflect changes on a more timely manner and to avoid large inventory changes at year-end. In addition to the year-over-year decline in gross margin, operating expenses in Canada increased at a faster rate than the 20% sales growth.
The 27% increase in operating expenses, 22% in local currency, was primarily driven by the following; higher commissions and bonuses tied to higher sales, higher volume-related headcount, incremental costs for the stabilization and ongoing operation of the new distribution center in Vancouver that opened in the second quarter and the additional operating expenses related to the acquisitions made in Canada during the last 12 months.
While we experienced strong sales growth in Canada, we were disappointed with the operating performance of the business in 2010. The local management team is aggressively working to attain a better balance between revenue growth and profitability.
Actions include better price discipline to protect gross profit margins, continued expansion of small customer and private-label sales initiatives, both of which carry higher gross profit margins and revised commission and bonus plans that place more weighting on profitable growth.
As a result of these and many more actions, we are expecting marked improvement in 2011. Operating performance for our other businesses improved significantly versus a year ago. These international businesses generated an operating profit of $5 million in the quarter versus a loss of $3 million a year ago.
While all of these businesses contributed to the improvement, we saw particularly strong results from our operations in Mexico, Japan, Puerto Rico and China. Lastly, let's take a look at cash flow for the quarter.
Operating cash flow was $104 million versus $223 million in 2009. This decrease was primarily due to an increase in inventory and accounts receivable tied to the strong sales growth. Despite the year-over-year inventory growth, inventory turns actually increased slightly.
Days sales outstanding or DSO was up about two days in the 2010 fourth quarter versus the prior year, due primarily to the timing of the oil spill-related sales in the quarter and the effect of the holidays on the company's cash processing schedule. We use the cash generated to invest in the business and pay $38 million in dividends, which reflects the 17% increase in the quarterly dividend and rate announced last April or $0.54 per share. Beyond dividends, we spent $56 million in the quarter on capital expenditures.
Now, let's take a look at the full year. Operating cash flow was $596 million in 2010 versus $732 million in 2009. Again, the investments in working capital to support the 15% sales growth during the year accounted for the majority of the year-over-year difference in cash flow.
Capital expenditures for the year were $128 million and $142 million in 2009. The company bought back 4.6 million shares during 2010 for $505 million and has approximately 8.1 million shares remaining on the current authorization.
In addition, we paid shareholders a total of $152 million in dividends. So for the full year, we returned a total of $657 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
At our analyst meeting in November, we issued sales and earnings guidance for 2011 and we reiterated that guidance today. We continue to expect sales in 2011 to grow in the range of 5% to 9% and 2011 EPS in the range of $7.15 to $7.90.
At the midpoint of our sales guidance, operating margins should increase about 50 basis points for the year and earnings per share should grow at about two times the rate of sales growth. Here are a few additional considerations as you refine your models.
First, sales comparisons for the year will get tougher in the first quarter and will be difficult for the remainder of the year. Second, we will have one additional selling day in the first quarter and for the year. The other quarters will have the same number of selling days as they did in 2010.
Third, the $0.28 per share benefit in 2010 related to the change in our paid time off policy will not repeat in 2011. This benefit rounds to $0.28 and will spread as follows
$0.08 in the first quarter, $0.08 in the second, $0.07 in the third and $0.04 in the fourth quarter.
Fourth, the 2010 first quarter also included a $0.15 charge for the write-down of a deferred income tax asset following the passage of the healthcare legislation. And finally, we expect the effective tax rate for 2011 to increase slightly from 2010 to a new rate of 39.2%.
This increase reflects a number of changes, including the higher income tax rate recently adopted in the state of Illinois. We are expecting that the higher Illinois state tax rate reflected in the 39.2% rate will represent about a $0.01 to $0.02 drag on EPS in 2011.

Strong sales growth, consistent execution, and impressive gross margin expansion was the story for the quarter. We are very pleased with our continued ability to gain share due to expanding our product line, our sales force, ecommerce capabilities, onsite services, and our international operations. 
As a result of the strong year-to-date performance, we have raised our full year sales and EPS guidance. We now expect sales to grow 9% to 10% and are forecasting EPS in the range of $8.40 to $8.70 for the full year 2011, excluding unusual items. 
Please note that our guidance reflects tougher comparisons on the top line, continued strong gross profit margins, and higher growth-related spending in the back half of the year. At the end of this recording, we'll talk in more detail about our revised guidance and our assumptions. 

We'll start with total company results, then dig deeper into our segments. Company sales increased 12% versus the 2010 second quarter. We had the same number of selling days this quarter as 2010, so reported sales growth and daily sales growth were the same.
Operating earnings increased 23% while net earnings increased 32%. As highlighted in our release, earnings per share of $2.34 for the quarter is an all-time company record and represents a 35% increase versus 2010. 
There was an unusual item in both the 2011 and the 2010 second quarters. The 2011 quarter included a $0.12 per share benefit, primarily from the settlement of tax examinations for 2007 and 2008. As mentioned previously, please note that this $0.12 per share tax benefit is not included in our guidance. 
The 2010 second quarter included an $0.08 per share benefit from the change in the company's paid time off, or PTO, policy. Additional details can be found in the second quarter earnings releases for 2011 and 2010. In a few moments, we'll take a closer look at sales results for the quarter. Let's now walk down the operating section of the income statement. 
Gross profit margins increased to 43.1%, up 120 basis points versus last year, as we were successful expanding gross margins in the United States, Canada, and our other businesses. Our size and scale gives us considerable advantage versus other distributors when it comes to effectively managing product cost inflation. Once again, this quarter, we were able to increase prices in line with the market and ahead of product cost inflation. We'll provide more detail when we review the business by segment.
Gross profit margins generally follow a fairly consistent seasonal pattern with lower gross margins in the second and third quarters than in the first quarter. As a reminder, supplier funding for our annual customer trade shows was a major contributor to the 44% gross margin reported in the 2011 first quarter.  
Reported company operating earnings for the quarter increased 23%, while operating margins were 13.2%, up 120 basis points versus the prior year. If you exclude the $10 million benefit in 2010 from the PTO change, operating earnings were up 30% and operating margins were up 180 basis points. This strong performance was driven by the 12% sales growth, the 120 basis point improvement in gross profit margins, and positive expense leverage, excluding the PTO benefit. Strong execution across the board in the United States, Canada, and the other businesses contributed to this impressive performance. 
Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics. First, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of June. Second, our operating performance by segment. Third, cash generation and capital deployment. And finally, we'll wrap up with a discussion of our revised 2011 guidance and other key items of interest. 
As mentioned earlier, sales for the company increased 12% for the quarter. Daily sales growth by month was as follows: 14% in April, 11% in May, and 12% in June. Of the 12% sales growth for the quarter, volume contributed 8% and price added another 2%, while acquisitions added 1%. The difficult comparison from last year's oil spill-related sales represented a drag of 1%.
Let's move on to sales by segment. We report 2 segments: The United States and Canada. Our remaining operations in Japan, Mexico, India, Puerto Rico, China, Columbia, and Panama are reported under a group titled other businesses. Sales in the United States, which account for about 81% of total company revenue, increased 9% in the quarter. 
By month, daily sales in the United States were up 10% in April, 8% in May, and 8% in June. The 9% sales growth for the quarter consisted of 7% volume growth and 3% from price, partially offset by a 1% drag from the oil spill. In May, we put through a modest price increase in the United States business tied to commodity inflation. 
Now we'll cover our sales performance by customer end market in the United States. Domestic growth initiatives including product line expansion, sales force expansion, ecommerce, and MRO-related services such as KeepStock, are helping the company grow faster than the economy and gain additional market share. As a result, sales to all customer end markets we serve in the United States were positive in the quarter as follows.
Heavy manufacturing was up in the mid-teens, light manufacturing and commercial were up in the high single digits, contractors and retail were up in the mid-single digits, and government and reseller were up in the low single digits.
Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represent about 13% of total company revenues. For the quarter, sales in Canada increased 24% in U.S. dollars and 16% in local currency. On a daily basis in Canadian dollars, sales were up 16% in April, up 15% in May, and up 17% in June. The 16% sales growth in the quarter consisted of 12% volume growth, 3% from acquisitions, and 1% from price. 
From a customer standpoint, sales growth in Canada was driven by impressive strength in the oil and gas, heavy manufacturing, agriculture and mining, and retail wholesale customer end markets. 
Let's conclude our review of sales for the quarter by looking at the other businesses. Again, this group includes our operations in Japan, Mexico, India, Puerto Rico, China, Columbia, and Panama, and currently represents about 6% of total company sales. 
Sales for this group increased 49%, primarily the result of strong growth in Japan and Mexico and sales reported from the business we acquired in Colombia. Sales for our business in Japan benefitted early in the quarter from sales of emergency supplies following the earthquake and tsunami. Although smaller in size, the remaining businesses within this group also delivered strong sales growth in the quarter. 
Early in the quarter, we reported sales results for April and May and shared some information regarding in the month. Let's now take a closer look at June. There were 22 selling days in June of 2011 and 2010. Total company sales were up 12% in June versus June of 2010. 
The 12% growth consisted of 8% volume growth, 2% each from price inflation and foreign exchange, and 1% from acquisitions, partially offset by a 1% drag from the oil spill related sales in 2010. In the United States, June sales were up 8%. This growth consisted of 6% of volume along with 3% from price, partially offset by 1% from sales related to last year's oil spill. 
Daily sales growth in June to each of our U.S. customer end markets was as follows. Heavy manufacturing was up in the mid-teens, light manufacturing and commercial were up in the high single-digits, contractors and retailers were up in the mid-single digits. Government was flat, and reseller was down high single-digits, reflecting the strong sales of oil spill-related products in 2010.
Sales in Canada for June increased 25% in U.S. dollars, up 17% in local currency. The 17% sales growth consisted of 14% volume and 3% from acquisitions. Customers in the agriculture and mining, retail wholesale, oil and gas, and heavy manufacturing end markets accounted for the largest increase in sales growth in June. 
Sales for our other businesses increased 60% in June, primarily the result of strong growth in Japan and Mexico along with sales for our business in Columbia. Consistent with the quarter, the remaining businesses within this group also delivered strong sales growth in June. As a reminder, starting in July, we passed the anniversary of the Columbian acquisition. 
Sales growth so far in the month of July is tracking roughly in line with the growth rate posted in June, excluding the headwind from oil spill-related sales. As a reminder, sales related to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill cleanup contributed 3% to the 21% daily growth in July of last year.
Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.

Since we have already covered company opening performance, let's jump right into performance by segment. Reported operating earnings in the United States increased 17% in the 2010 second quarter and operating margins increased 120 basis poin",1151,"Thanks Laura. Since we have already covered company opening performance, let's jump right into performance by segment. Reported operating earnings in the United States increased 17% in the 2010 second quarter and operating margins increased 120 basis points to 16.6%.
If you exclude the benefit from the PTO change in 2010, operating earnings in the United States increased 22% and operating margins expanded 180 basis points versus the prior year. This performance was driven by 9% sales growth and a higher gross profit margin. Gross profit margins in the United States increased 120 basis points. 
The gross margin expansion was primarily due to an effective product cost management and the ability to raise prices with the market and ahead of product cost increases. Operating expenses grew in line with sales for the quarter and were up 6% excluding the PTO benefit from the prior year.
Let's move on to our business in Canada. At the end of the 2010 fourth quarter, we shared with you the plan for improving performance. We're happy to report that we continued to make substantial progress in the 2011 second quarter as operating earnings increased 130% versus the prior year. Strong sales growth, coupled with higher gross profit margins and tight cost controls contributed to operating margins jumping 530 basis points to 11.4%. 
The gross margin expansion in Canada was driven by a number of factors, including product cost deflation tied to the tailwind created by the strength of the Canadian dollar. A first quarter price increase, less price discounting and a more favorable customer mix also contributed to the growth in gross profit margins in the second quarter. Having reached the anniversary of actions taken last year to improve gross margins, we are expecting roughly 25 to 50 basis points of year over year in the back half of the year. 
In the second half of 2011, we will be filling a number of of open volume-related positions and will be opening a new distribution center in Saskatchewan.  As a result, we expect to generate about 150 to 200 basis points of year over year operating expense leverage in the back half of the year in Canada. 
Operating performance in the quarter for our other businesses was impressive, the direct result of our focus on driving growth and improving profitability. This group posted operating earnings of $8.6 million for the quarter versus $1.9 million a year ago. Strong operating performance in Japan and Mexico led the improved results for this group.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 35.0% versus 39.1% in 2010, mainly due to the 12% per share benefit primarily related to the settlement of tax examinations for 2007 and 2008. Excluding this benefit, the effective tax rate is now expected to be 38.7% for the full year due to higher earnings forecasted in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates and a slightly lower overall effective state income tax rate.
Lastly, let's take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $190 million versus $173 million in 2010. The growth in accounts receivable resulted in a slight drag on cash flow for the quarter. This increase was greater than the growth in sales due to a postal strike in Canada and the timing of quarter end, both temporarily influencing the timeliness of cash processing.
We used the cash generated during the quarter to invest in the business and return capital to shareholders through dividends. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $52 million. Dividends paid to shareholders were $47 million, representing the 22% increase in the quarterly dividend rate announced in April. The company did not buy back any stock during the quarter, and has approximately 7.7 shares remaining on its share repurchase authorization.
As reported in our second quarter earnings release, we raised both sales and earnings per share guidance for the full year 2011. We expect sales growth in the range of 9-10% and earnings per share in the range of $8.40 to $8.70. Company guidance does not include the $0.12 per share benefit, primarily from the settlement of tax examinations for 2007 and 2008.
So let's take a look at the underlying elements of our expectations. First, as we have consistently communicated sales comparisons in the back half of the year are more difficult, in part due to sales related to the oil spill cleanup in 2010. Oil spill related sales added 3% to the 19% daily sales growth in the 2010 third quarter 2010 and 2% to the 14% daily sales growth in the fourth quarter of 2010. Additional detail can be found on the exhibits at the end of this podcast script. 
Second, we expect gross profit margins in the third and fourth quarters to be similar to the 2011 second quarter, with some slight price erosion as the year goes on, which is typical. As a reminder, supplier funding for our customer trade shows in March made the 44% gross profit margin it 2011 first quarter different for the rest of the year. Third, our investments in proven growth drivers, such as new sales representatives, ecommerce, and advertising will continue to accelerate throughout the year. In fact, we expect to add more than double the number of new sales representatives in 2011 than originally planned, going from 150 to 300 new hires.
We're also stepping up the pace of our ecommerce and advertising investments. The opening of our new 800,000-square foot superregional distribution center in Northern California in the 2011 fourth quarter will also result in additional operating expense. For the full year about $60-70 million in growth related spending should spread as follows: $8 million in the first quarter, $11 million in Q2, and $40-50 million in the second half of 2011.  
Finally, the lower effective tax rate of 38.7% projected for the year 2011, excluding the $0.12 per share benefit in the 2011 second quarter, should offset a higher average share count than we had originally forecasted since we're currently building excess cash in anticipation of potential M&A activity.
To summarize, our EPS guidance implies roughly 140-170 basis points of operating margin expansion for the full year versus the 11.5% in 2010, adjusted for the PTO benefit, which is even stronger earnings growth than we had forecasted in Apr. We are very excited about our record results in the quarter and the opportunities going forward to gain share in this large and consolidating market. Never before have businesses and institutions been so focused on driving productivity and cost savings, and we look forward to helping our customers with these initiatives given our broad array of MRO products and services.

With me is Bill Chapman, Director of Investor Relations. We are pleased to share with you an update regarding Graingerâ€™s Third Quarter 2011 Results via this audio webcast.
Please also reference our 2011 third quarter earnings release issued October 18th, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website, to supplement this webcast.
Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this webcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements.
We are excited to report that Grainger delivered another record quarter. Strong sales growth and gross margin expansion was the story for the quarter. Thanks to the success of our growth drivers, we continued to gain market share during the quarter just as we did throughout the downturn.
Our growth drivers include expanding our product line, increasing our sales force, enhancing our eCommerce capabilities, growing our inventory management services and investing in our international operations. One of the highlights of the quarter was the acquisition of the Fabory Group. Fabory is a leading European distributor of fasteners and related MRO products. The closing of the acquisition took place on August 31st.
We are also very pleased to announce that we have raised our guidance for the year. As noted in the release, we are now expecting sales for 2011 to grow 11% to 12%, with earnings per share of $8.80 to $9.00, excluding unusual items. Please note that our guidance reflects higher growth-related spending for the remainder of the year, which we will discuss later in this podcast.
Letâ€™s start with total company results, then dig deeper into our segments. Company sales increased 11% versus the 2010 third quarter. We had the same number of selling days this quarter as 2010, so reported sales growth and daily sales growth were the same.
Operating earnings and net earnings increased 21%. As highlighted in our release, earnings per share of $2.51 is an all-time record and represents a 22% increase versus 2010. As a reminder, the 2010 third quarter included a $0.07 per share benefit from the change in the Companyâ€™s paid time off, or PTO policy. Excluding the PTO benefit in 2010, third quarter earnings per share increased 26%.
In a few moments, weâ€™ll take an in-depth look at sales results for the quarter. Letâ€™s now walk down the operating section of the income statement. Gross profit margins increased to 43.2%, up 160 basis points versus last year, with higher gross margins in the United States, Canada and in our Other Businesses.
Again this quarter, we were able to manage product cost inflation below price increases. Weâ€™ll provide more detail when we review the business by segment. Reported company operating earnings for the quarter increased 21%. Company operating margins were 14.3%, up 110 basis points versus the prior year. If you exclude the $8 million benefit in 2010 from the PTO change, operating earnings were up 25% and operating margins increased 150 basis points. This strong performance was primarily driven by the 11% sales growth and the 160 basis point improvement in gross profit margins.
Letâ€™s now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, weâ€™ll cover the following topics. First, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of September; second, our operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, weâ€™ll wrap up with a discussion of other key items of interest.
As mentioned earlier, sales for the Company increased 11% for the quarter. Of the 11% sales growth for the quarter, volume contributed 8 percentage points, price added 3 percentage points, acquisitions contributed 2 percentage points, and foreign exchange added 1 percentage point.
Sales related to last yearâ€™s oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico represented a headwind of 3 percentage points. Daily sales growth by month was as follows, 10% in July, 10% in August, and 14% in September. Excluding Fabory, daily sales in September increased 10%. It's important to note that despite the uncertainty in the economy, we saw consistent, 10% sales growth throughout the quarter.
Letâ€™s move on to sales by segment. We report 2 segments, the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations, Fabory in Europe, Japan, Mexico, Colombia, India, China, Puerto Rico and Panama are reported under a grouping titled Other Businesses. Sales in the United States, which accounted for 81% of total company revenue in the quarter, increased 7%. By month, daily sales in the United States increased 5% in July, 8% in August and 7% in September.
The 7% sales growth for the quarter consisted of 7% volume growth and 3 percentage points from price, partially offset by a 3 percentage point drag from the oil spill-related sales in 2010. In August, we put through a modest price increase in the U.S. business tied to commodity inflation.
Now weâ€™ll cover our sales performance by customer end-market in the United States. Domestic growth initiatives, including product line expansion, sales force expansion, eCommerce and inventory management services are driving the company to grow faster than the economy and gain additional market share.
As a result, sales to all customer end-markets in the United States, except for reseller, were positive in the quarter as follows. Heavy manufacturing was up in the mid teens; commercial was up in the low double-digits; light manufacturing and retail were up in the high single-digits; contractors and government were up in the mid single-digits; and reseller was down in the low 20s, reflecting the strong sales of oil spill-related products in 2010.
Letâ€™s turn our attention to the Canadian business, which represented 12% of total company revenues in the 2011 third quarter. Sales in Canada increased 23% in U.S. dollars and 16% in local currency. On a daily basis in Canadian dollars, sales were up 18% in July, up 14% in August and up 15% in September. The 16% sales growth in the quarter consisted of 14% volume growth and 2 percentage points from acquisitions.
From a customer standpoint, sales growth in Canada was driven by strength in the heavy manufacturing, retail/wholesale, transportation, and agriculture and mining customer end-markets.
Letâ€™s conclude our review of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses, which accounted for 7% of total company sales in the quarter. Again, this group includes our operations in Europe, Japan, Mexico, Colombia, India, China, Puerto Rico and Panama. Sales for this group increased 66%, primarily from the incremental sales from Fabory in the month of September, along with strong growth in Japan and Mexico. All businesses contributed to the strong sales growth in the quarter.
Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for July and August. Letâ€™s now take a closer look at September. There were 21 selling days in September of 2011 and 2010. Total company sales increased 14% in September, versus September of 2010, consisting of 8% volume growth, 5 percentage points from acquisitions, 3 percentage points from price inflation and 1 percentage point from foreign exchange, partially offset by a 3 percentage point headwind from oil spill-related sales in 2010. Excluding sales from Fabory, daily sales in September increased 10%.
In the United States, September sales increased 7%. This growth consisted of 7 percentage points of volume and 3 percentage points from price, partially offset by 3 percentage points from sales related to last yearâ€™s oil spill. Daily sales growth in September to each of our U.S. customer end-markets was as follows. Heavy manufacturing was up in the mid teens; commercial and light manufacturing was up in the low double-digits; retail was up in the high single-digits; contractors was up in the mid single-digits; government was up in the low single-digits; and reseller was down in the high teens reflecting the strong sales of oil spill-related products in 2010.
Sales in Canada for September increased 19% in U.S. dollars, up 15% in local currency. The 15% sales growth consisted of 13% volume, 1% price and 1% from acquisitions. Customers in the heavy manufacturing, retail/wholesale, transportation, and agriculture and mining end markets accounted for the largest percentage increases in September.
Sales for our Other Businesses increased 117% in September, primarily the result of incremental sales from Fabory, along with strong sales growth in Japan. Company sales growth so far in the month of October is tracking roughly in line with the growth rate posted in September. As a reminder, sales related to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill clean up contributed 1 percentage point to the 11% daily growth in October of last year.
Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman."

Letâ€™s jump right into performance by segment since we have already covered company operating performance. Reported operating earnings in the United States increased 15% versus the 2010 third quarter and operating margin increased 130 basis",1137,"Thanks Laura. Letâ€™s jump right into performance by segment since we have already covered company operating performance. Reported operating earnings in the United States increased 15% versus the 2010 third quarter and operating margin increased 130 basis points to 17.7%. If you exclude the benefit from the PTO change in 2010, operating earnings in the United States increased 19% and operating margins expanded 180 basis points versus the prior year.
This performance was driven by 7% sales growth and a higher gross profit margin. Gross profit margins in the United States increased 180 basis points. The gross margin expansion was primarily due to managing product cost inflation below price increases, coupled with favorable selling price mix, strong sales of private label products and lower sales of sourced products related to the clean up of the 2010 oil spill.
Operating expenses increased 9%, 7% excluding the PTO benefit from the prior year. The growth in operating expenses was driven by volume related costs and spending on growth initiatives such as sales force expansion, eCommerce, advertising and the start up of the new distribution center in northern California.
Our business in Canada delivered improved performance in the quarter, a continuation of the strong results seen in the first half of 2011. Third quarter operating earnings increased 72% versus the prior year. Strong sales growth, coupled with higher gross margins and effective cost management, contributed to a 290 basis point increase in operating margins to 10.1%.
The gross margin expansion in Canada was driven by the same factors as seen in the United States. Operating expenses increased 12%, aided by improved productivity and lower utility costs resulting from milder weather. For the fourth quarter, start up costs for the new distribution center in Saskatchewan will result in sequential operating expense growth.
Despite these investments, we expect to generate about 150 to 200 basis points of year-over-year operating expense leverage in the 2011 fourth quarter in Canada. Operating earnings for our Other Businesses increased 139% to $11 million versus $4 million a year ago. This increase was the result of improved operating performance in Japan, Mexico and China. Faboryâ€™s September results also contributed to higher operating earnings for the Other Businesses in the quarter.
At a total company level, Faboryâ€™s earnings were essentially offset by acquisition costs, which are included in unallocated expenses. Interest expense, net of interest income, was $2 million versus $1.6 million in the prior year. The increase was due to the â‚¬120 million in new debt to finance half of the Fabory acquisition. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.7% versus 39.4%. The lower rate is primarily due to higher earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates.
Lastly, letâ€™s take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $251 million, a 22% increase versus $206 million in 2010. We used the cash generated during the quarter to invest in the business and return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $47 million versus $43 million in the prior quarter. Dividends paid to shareholders were $47 million. We also bought back 360,000 shares of stock during the quarter and have approximately 7.3 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization.
As reported in todayâ€™s release, we increased our 2011 sales and earnings guidance, reflecting our strong performance to date and the addition of Fabory, beginning in September. We now expect 2011 sales growth in the range of 11% to 12% and earnings per share in the range of $8.80 to $9.00.
Keep in mind, our EPS guidance excludes unusual items such as the $0.12 per share benefit recognized in the 2011 second quarter from the settlement of tax examinations for 2007 and 2008, and the expected $5 million after-tax gain on the sale of our minority ownership position in MRO Korea, announced on October 11, 2011.
So, letâ€™s look at the underlying elements of our expectations. First, incremental sales from Fabory, beginning in September, add about 2 percentage points to our expected top-line growth for the year. This is the primary driver of our revised guidance of 11% to 12% sales growth, versus our previous sales guidance of 9% to 10% growth issued on July 19, 2011.
Second, we expect gross profit margins in the fourth quarter to erode slightly versus the 2011 third quarter on product cost inflation catch-up related to our August price increase. Third, our investments in proven growth drivers, such as new sales representatives, eCommerce and advertising will continue to accelerate in the fourth quarter. As previously communicated, we expect to add 150 new sales representatives in the 2011 first quarter for a total of 300 new hires for the year.
We had expected some of the new sales representatives to be hired in the third quarter, but those incremental expenses will now begin in the fourth quarter. Weâ€™ll also be investing in some information technology infrastructure to support the development and phased roll out of the Companyâ€™s new eCommerce platform. Our national advertising campaign will also continue in the fourth quarter.
Finally, the ramp up of our new 800,000 square foot super regional distribution center in northern California will result in additional operating expense in the 2011 fourth quarter. To recap, we still expect $60 million to $70 million in growth-related spending in 2011 spread as follows; $8 million in the first quarter, $11 million in the second quarter, $20 million in the third quarter, and $19 million to $29 million in the fourth quarter of 2011.
To summarize, 2011 is turning out to be an exceptional year for Grainger. For the first 3 quarters, we have generated 230 basis points of operating margin expansion, excluding unusual items, on 12% sales growth. For the full year, we expect normalized operating margins to be 170 to 180 basis points higher than 2010, which is essentially 3 years worth of normal annual margin expansion.
Keep in mind however, that the 2011 fourth quarter will have lower operating margins than the first 3 quarters due to the following factors. Organic sales growth is typically lower in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter; the 2011 fourth quarter will have one less selling day than the 2011 third quarter, 63 versus 64; as noted earlier, we expect to see even more growth-related investment spending in the fourth quarter; and finally, we will have a full quarter of results from Fabory, which is expected to carry mid single-digit operating margins and be earnings neutral for 2011.

Keep in mind, our EPS guidance excludes unusual items such as the $0.12 per share benefit recognized in the 2011 second quarter from the settlement of tax examinations for 2007 and 2008, and the expected $5 million after-tax gain on the sale of our minority ownership position in MRO Korea, announced on October 11, 2011.
So, letâ€™s look at the underlying elements of our expectations. First, incremental sales from Fabory, beginning in September, add about 2 percentage points to our expected top-line growth for the year. This is the primary driver of our revised guidance of 11% to 12% sales growth, versus our previous sales guidance of 9% to 10% growth issued on July 19, 2011.
Second, we expect gross profit margins in the fourth quarter to erode slightly versus the 2011 third quarter on product cost inflation catch-up related to our August price increase. Third, our investments in proven growth drivers, such as new sales representatives, eCommerce and advertising will continue to accelerate in the fourth quarter. As previously communicated, we expect to add 150 new sales representatives in the 2011 first quarter for a total of 300 new hires for the year.
We had expected some of the new sales representatives to be hired in the third quarter, but those incremental expenses will now begin in the fourth quarter. Weâ€™ll also be investing in some information technology infrastructure to support the development and phased roll out of the Companyâ€™s new eCommerce platform. Our national advertising campaign will also continue in the fourth quarter.
Finally, the ramp up of our new 800,000 square foot super regional distribution center in northern California will result in additional operating expense in the 2011 fourth quarter. To recap, we still expect $60 million to $70 million in growth-related spending in 2011 spread as follows; $8 million in the first quarter, $11 million in the second quarter, $20 million in the third quarter, and $19 million to $29 million in the fourth quarter of 2011.
To summarize, 2011 is turning out to be an exceptional year for Grainger. For the first 3 quarters, we have generated 230 basis points of operating margin expansion, excluding unusual items, on 12% sales growth. For the full year, we expect normalized operating margins to be 170 to 180 basis points higher than 2010, which is essentially 3 years worth of normal annual margin expansion.
Keep in mind however, that the 2011 fourth quarter will have lower operating margins than the first 3 quarters due to the following factors. Organic sales growth is typically lower in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter; the 2011 fourth quarter will have one less selling day than the 2011 third quarter, 63 versus 64; as noted earlier, we expect to see even more growth-related investment spending in the fourth quarter; and finally, we will have a full quarter of results from Fabory, which is expected to carry mid single-digit operating margins and be earnings neutral for 2011.

With me is Bill Chapman, Director of Investor Relations. We are pleased to share with you an update regarding Graingerâ€™s Third Quarter 2011 Results via this audio webcast.
Please also reference our 2011 third quarter earnings release issued October 18th, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website, to supplement this webcast.
Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this webcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements.
We are excited to report that Grainger delivered another record quarter. Strong sales growth and gross margin expansion was the story for the quarter. Thanks to the success of our growth drivers, we continued to gain market share during the quarter just as we did throughout the downturn.
Our growth drivers include expanding our product line, increasing our sales force, enhancing our eCommerce capabilities, growing our inventory management services and investing in our international operations. One of the highlights of the quarter was the acquisition of the Fabory Group. Fabory is a leading European distributor of fasteners and related MRO products. The closing of the acquisition took place on August 31st.
We are also very pleased to announce that we have raised our guidance for the year. As noted in the release, we are now expecting sales for 2011 to grow 11% to 12%, with earnings per share of $8.80 to $9.00, excluding unusual items. Please note that our guidance reflects higher growth-related spending for the remainder of the year, which we will discuss later in this podcast.
Letâ€™s start with total company results, then dig deeper into our segments. Company sales increased 11% versus the 2010 third quarter. We had the same number of selling days this quarter as 2010, so reported sales growth and daily sales growth were the same.
Operating earnings and net earnings increased 21%. As highlighted in our release, earnings per share of $2.51 is an all-time record and represents a 22% increase versus 2010. As a reminder, the 2010 third quarter included a $0.07 per share benefit from the change in the Companyâ€™s paid time off, or PTO policy. Excluding the PTO benefit in 2010, third quarter earnings per share increased 26%.
In a few moments, weâ€™ll take an in-depth look at sales results for the quarter. Letâ€™s now walk down the operating section of the income statement. Gross profit margins increased to 43.2%, up 160 basis points versus last year, with higher gross margins in the United States, Canada and in our Other Businesses.
Again this quarter, we were able to manage product cost inflation below price increases. Weâ€™ll provide more detail when we review the business by segment. Reported company operating earnings for the quarter increased 21%. Company operating margins were 14.3%, up 110 basis points versus the prior year. If you exclude the $8 million benefit in 2010 from the PTO change, operating earnings were up 25% and operating margins increased 150 basis points. This strong performance was primarily driven by the 11% sales growth and the 160 basis point improvement in gross profit margins.
Letâ€™s now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, weâ€™ll cover the following topics. First, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of September; second, our operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, weâ€™ll wrap up with a discussion of other key items of interest.
As mentioned earlier, sales for the Company increased 11% for the quarter. Of the 11% sales growth for the quarter, volume contributed 8 percentage points, price added 3 percentage points, acquisitions contributed 2 percentage points, and foreign exchange added 1 percentage point.
Sales related to last yearâ€™s oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico represented a headwind of 3 percentage points. Daily sales growth by month was as follows, 10% in July, 10% in August, and 14% in September. Excluding Fabory, daily sales in September increased 10%. It's important to note that despite the uncertainty in the economy, we saw consistent, 10% sales growth throughout the quarter.
Letâ€™s move on to sales by segment. We report 2 segments, the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations, Fabory in Europe, Japan, Mexico, Colombia, India, China, Puerto Rico and Panama are reported under a grouping titled Other Businesses. Sales in the United States, which accounted for 81% of total company revenue in the quarter, increased 7%. By month, daily sales in the United States increased 5% in July, 8% in August and 7% in September.
The 7% sales growth for the quarter consisted of 7% volume growth and 3 percentage points from price, partially offset by a 3 percentage point drag from the oil spill-related sales in 2010. In August, we put through a modest price increase in the U.S. business tied to commodity inflation.
Now weâ€™ll cover our sales performance by customer end-market in the United States. Domestic growth initiatives, including product line expansion, sales force expansion, eCommerce and inventory management services are driving the company to grow faster than the economy and gain additional market share.
As a result, sales to all customer end-markets in the United States, except for reseller, were positive in the quarter as follows. Heavy manufacturing was up in the mid teens; commercial was up in the low double-digits; light manufacturing and retail were up in the high single-digits; contractors and government were up in the mid single-digits; and reseller was down in the low 20s, reflecting the strong sales of oil spill-related products in 2010.
Letâ€™s turn our attention to the Canadian business, which represented 12% of total company revenues in the 2011 third quarter. Sales in Canada increased 23% in U.S. dollars and 16% in local currency. On a daily basis in Canadian dollars, sales were up 18% in July, up 14% in August and up 15% in September. The 16% sales growth in the quarter consisted of 14% volume growth and 2 percentage points from acquisitions.
From a customer standpoint, sales growth in Canada was driven by strength in the heavy manufacturing, retail/wholesale, transportation, and agriculture and mining customer end-markets.
Letâ€™s conclude our review of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses, which accounted for 7% of total company sales in the quarter. Again, this group includes our operations in Europe, Japan, Mexico, Colombia, India, China, Puerto Rico and Panama. Sales for this group increased 66%, primarily from the incremental sales from Fabory in the month of September, along with strong growth in Japan and Mexico. All businesses contributed to the strong sales growth in the quarter.
Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for July and August. Letâ€™s now take a closer look at September. There were 21 selling days in September of 2011 and 2010. Total company sales increased 14% in September, versus September of 2010, consisting of 8% volume growth, 5 percentage points from acquisitions, 3 percentage points from price inflation and 1 percentage point from foreign exchange, partially offset by a 3 percentage point headwind from oil spill-related sales in 2010. Excluding sales from Fabory, daily sales in September increased 10%.
In the United States, September sales increased 7%. This growth consisted of 7 percentage points of volume and 3 percentage points from price, partially offset by 3 percentage points from sales related to last yearâ€™s oil spill. Daily sales growth in September to each of our U.S. customer end-markets was as follows. Heavy manufacturing was up in the mid teens; commercial and light manufacturing was up in the low double-digits; retail was up in the high single-digits; contractors was up in the mid single-digits; government was up in the low single-digits; and reseller was down in the high teens reflecting the strong sales of oil spill-related products in 2010.
Sales in Canada for September increased 19% in U.S. dollars, up 15% in local currency. The 15% sales growth consisted of 13% volume, 1% price and 1% from acquisitions. Customers in the heavy manufacturing, retail/wholesale, transportation, and agriculture and mining end markets accounted for the largest percentage increases in September.
Sales for our Other Businesses increased 117% in September, primarily the result of incremental sales from Fabory, along with strong sales growth in Japan. Company sales growth so far in the month of October is tracking roughly in line with the growth rate posted in September. As a reminder, sales related to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill clean up contributed 1 percentage point to the 11% daily growth in October of last year.
Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman."
276060,118575489,207849,"W.W. Grainger, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2011",2011-10-18,"Earnings Calls","W.W. Grainger, Inc.","Executives","Thanks Laura. Letâ€™s jump right into performance by segment since we have already covered company operating performance. Reported operating earnings in the United States increased 15% versus the 2010 third quarter and operating margin increased 130 basis",1137,"Thanks Laura. Letâ€™s jump right into performance by segment since we have already covered company operating performance. Reported operating earnings in the United States increased 15% versus the 2010 third quarter and operating margin increased 130 basis points to 17.7%. If you exclude the benefit from the PTO change in 2010, operating earnings in the United States increased 19% and operating margins expanded 180 basis points versus the prior year.
This performance was driven by 7% sales growth and a higher gross profit margin. Gross profit margins in the United States increased 180 basis points. The gross margin expansion was primarily due to managing product cost inflation below price increases, coupled with favorable selling price mix, strong sales of private label products and lower sales of sourced products related to the clean up of the 2010 oil spill.
Operating expenses increased 9%, 7% excluding the PTO benefit from the prior year. The growth in operating expenses was driven by volume related costs and spending on growth initiatives such as sales force expansion, eCommerce, advertising and the start up of the new distribution center in northern California.
Our business in Canada delivered improved performance in the quarter, a continuation of the strong results seen in the first half of 2011. Third quarter operating earnings increased 72% versus the prior year. Strong sales growth, coupled with higher gross margins and effective cost management, contributed to a 290 basis point increase in operating margins to 10.1%.
The gross margin expansion in Canada was driven by the same factors as seen in the United States. Operating expenses increased 12%, aided by improved productivity and lower utility costs resulting from milder weather. For the fourth quarter, start up costs for the new distribution center in Saskatchewan will result in sequential operating expense growth.
Despite these investments, we expect to generate about 150 to 200 basis points of year-over-year operating expense leverage in the 2011 fourth quarter in Canada. Operating earnings for our Other Businesses increased 139% to $11 million versus $4 million a year ago. This increase was the result of improved operating performance in Japan, Mexico and China. Faboryâ€™s September results also contributed to higher operating earnings for the Other Businesses in the quarter.
At a total company level, Faboryâ€™s earnings were essentially offset by acquisition costs, which are included in unallocated expenses. Interest expense, net of interest income, was $2 million versus $1.6 million in the prior year. The increase was due to the â‚¬120 million in new debt to finance half of the Fabory acquisition. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.7% versus 39.4%. The lower rate is primarily due to higher earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates.
Lastly, letâ€™s take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $251 million, a 22% increase versus $206 million in 2010. We used the cash generated during the quarter to invest in the business and return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $47 million versus $43 million in the prior quarter. Dividends paid to shareholders were $47 million. We also bought back 360,000 shares of stock during the quarter and have approximately 7.3 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization.
As reported in todayâ€™s release, we increased our 2011 sales and earnings guidance, reflecting our strong performance to date and the addition of Fabory, beginning in September. We now expect 2011 sales growth in the range of 11% to 12% and earnings per share in the range of $8.80 to $9.00.
Keep in mind, our EPS guidance excludes unusual items such as the $0.12 per share benefit recognized in the 2011 second quarter from the settlement of tax examinations for 2007 and 2008, and the expected $5 million after-tax gain on the sale of our minority ownership position in MRO Korea, announced on October 11, 2011.
