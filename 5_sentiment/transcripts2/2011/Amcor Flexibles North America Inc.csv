Today I'll discuss the results of the fourth quarter and then provide some color on our guidance for 2011. Before we get into the details, I'd like to note some of the key financial highlights from 2010. We reported record adjusted earnings per share of $2.12, our second year in a row of double-digit EPS growth in with our guidance for the year and the quarters. We recorded our second highest year ever of free cash flow in the face of increasing raw material costs, as well as higher levels of working capital related to Food Americas as we carried extra inventory during the integration of our expanded plant network. We paid down approximately $200 million of debt since the acquisition of Food Americas on March 1, and we repurchased 1.5 million shares of Bemis common stock.
Now turning to the fourth quarter. Our results were in line with our guidance and continued to demonstrate healthy growth over the prior year. Earnings per share before special charges was $0.49 for the fourth quarter of 2010, compared with $0.45 last year, an increase of 9%. Net sales increased by about 38%, including about 34% from the Food Americas acquisition. The remaining 4% organic growth reflects the increase in sales in 2010 compared to the pro forma sales of 2009. Currency did not have a significant impact on consolidated sales during the quarter. 
In the Flexible Packaging business segment, net sales increased by about 44% for the quarter, of which about 40% related to the Food Americas acquisition. The remaining 4% organic growth reflects the impact of higher raw material costs pushing up selling prices in addition to increased sales of higher-priced value-added products. Volumes in North America were somewhat higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, reflecting the continuation of volume trends that we experienced throughout 2010. 
In Latin America, now almost 20% of Bemis, sales volumes declined in the fourth quarter as customers in Brazil made inventory adjustments at the end of the year. And in our Mexico operations, we strategically reduced volumes and improved sales mix resulting in improved profitability.
Our European Flexible Packaging sales remained below last year's levels. However, we did see sequential volume improvement compared to the third quarter of 2010, which is encouraging. 
In the Pressure Sensitive Materials segment, which represented about 10% of sales this quarter, net sales increased nearly 4%, excluding the impact of currency, which represents stronger volume sales in North America and the pass-through of increased raw material costs.
Moving on to operating profit. We are very pleased with the cost savings results of our integration efforts. We have achieved the targets we set for 2010, and we are on track to achieve our run rate target of $60 million of cost savings by the end of 2011. Going forward, these integration synergy targets have been built into our existing continuous improvement programs and will no longer be separately identified as synergies. This is a positive indicator of the extent to which we have completed our integration of Food Americas. It is important to note that the lower operating profit margins associated with the newly acquired Food Americas business have reduced our overall operating margins to 2010. 
Looking sequentially at operating profit for the Flexible Packaging segment from the third quarter of 2010 to the fourth quarter, the nearly 1% decrease reflects primarily the seasonal decline in volume, coupled with increased raw material costs in the fourth quarter. 
Selling prices increased contractually and with non-contract customers during the second half of 2010 to reflect the higher costs of raw materials. Our business model uses escalator and de-escalator causes in customer contracts to mechanically adjust selling prices for changes in raw material cost on a regular basis. These causes are embedded in our multiyear customer contracts, which represent approximately 2/3 of our Flexible Packaging sales. This is a common industry contract cost and therefore, the contracts that we acquired with the Food Americas acquisition in 2010 also includes similar escalator and de-escalator causes. However, the acquired contracts have longer periods of time between selling price adjustments than Bemis' standard policies. This will prolong the negative operating profit impact in a rising raw material cost environment in 2011. 
Several years ago, we shortened the adjustment periods in our contracts to address increased volatility in raw material markets. One of our priorities is to synchronize the terms of these Food Americas customer contracts with the Bemis contracts, including shorter adjustment periods in the escalator de-escalator causes. 
Selling, general and administrative costs increased during 2010, and we expect the SG&A spending to be approximately level in 2011 with 2010. The improvement in the line item other operating income and expense reflects the fact that we had $15 million in acquisition-related expenses and 2009. Most of the other operating income in 2010 was generated by fiscal incentives we earned in Brazil. 
Turning to the cash flow statement. In the fourth quarter, we generated $119 million of cash from operations, an increase of $39 million over the same period of 2009. For the full year 2010, we recorded our second highest level of free cash flow in our history. This was less than we had planned and resulted from higher working capital largely as a result of two factors. One, just as rising raw material costs had a negative short-term impact on our earnings, they also increased the carrying cost of our inventories. Two, we carried higher inventory levels during the integration process in order to ensure that we maintain high levels of customer service as we integrated our new production facilities. 
Capital expenditures totaled $48.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2010. This is a reflection of the timing of expenditures that had been planned for 2010 and realized in the fourth quarter. This year, we repurchased about 1.5 million shares of Bemis common stock. This offset approximately 1.2 million shares issued in connection with incentive compensation programs for Bemis employees. 
As we look to 2011, our earnings per share guidance for the total year is $2.33 to $2.48. This includes an assumption of constant currency exchange rates and increasing raw material costs through the first half of this year. Our guidance also reflects an increase of about $10 million in pension costs and continued accounting for the noncontrolling interest in our Brazilian subsidiary. While we continue to pursue a tender offer for the outstanding preferred shares of our Brazilian subsidiary, the purchase of those shares is not reflected in our guidance at this point since we cannot predict the timing or certainty of the completion of that transaction.
The increase in pension costs is primarily a reflection of the amortization of asset losses experienced back in the stock market decline of 2008. Subsequent gains are expected to reduce pension costs beginning in 2012. Our guidance for the first quarter of 2011 is $0.50 to $0.55. Again, the first quarter includes the months of January and February, which are seasonally slower months. In addition, higher benefit costs and raw material cost increases are expected to create headwinds compared to the first quarter of 2010. 
For the total year 2011, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $150 million. This is below the level of depreciation plus amortization, which we expect to be about $215 million in 2011. The reason we have been able to keep capital expenditures down is because we acquired well-capitalized production capacity with the Food Americas acquisition, and world class manufacturing initiatives are contributing to our production efficiencies. Longer-term, we expect capital expenditures to be closer to D&A.
Finally, in addition to our judicious approach to capital expenditure decisions, we also remain committed to disciplined use of free cash flow. We are continuing to seek strategic and accretive acquisition opportunities. Meanwhile, we will continue to improve shareholder value by repurchasing shares opportunistically and reducing interest expense. 
Now I'll turn it over to Henry for his comments."

To start with, I'm very pleased with the performance of the company in 2010 and the progress we have made integrating the Food Americas acquisition. Our success in this effort is thanks to the talent and hard work of many dedicated Bemis employees in North America and Latin America, including sales, marketing, operations, engineering, customer service, finance, purchasing, human resources, information technology and our R&D teams. Today, I'll focus my comments on three main topics: the product development and process improvements being derived from the completion of the Food Americas integrate; the climate for raw material costs and strategic investment of 2010; and the plan for 2011. 
Our customers have been pleased with what has been a nearly seamless transition, and our focus on maintaining customer service throughout this integration has further strengthened our customer relationship. As Scott mentioned, we have begun to move production among our facilities to better align our production facilities and technologies to optimize our manufacturing footprint. Part of the integration plan for the newly acquired facilities was the opportunity to leverage the new products, technologies and manufacturing expertise that came from the Food Americas acquisition. 
Let me give you some examples of commercial opportunities arising from our joint portfolio of technologies. One example is the expansion into new markets for products from cup products from single-served coffee to cups for creamers, puddings and single-served condiments. This is a result of the combination of our unique rigid film structures with the Food Americas leading technology around heat seal, lacquer and die-cutting capabilities supplying the complete solution.
We have leveraged our film foil and sealing technologies to replace and improve the performance of our blister pack used for oral pharmaceuticals in Latin America. Now that we enjoy the leading position in pharmaceutical packaging in Brazil, bringing this production in-house gives us a great opportunity to expand our expertise in this market category and offer innovation to our pharmaceutical customers. 
And lastly, an important part of our efforts toward development of more sustainable packaging is the reduction in the use of raw materials. By combining the processing technology of Food Americas with the polymer science of Bemis, we have been able to significantly thinner serial liner while matching all current performance criteria. As I've mentioned before, we have a high-quality portfolio of facilities, and we are making changes to incorporate best practices across all facilities on a continuous basis. 
In 2011, we expect earnings per share to continue its double-digit growth trend in spite of some unexpected cost increases. We are behind the raw material cost curve for the fourth quarter of 2010. At the beginning of this quarter, most of our selling prices have been adjusted to reflect these higher costs. But we expect raw material cost to continue the upward trend during the first half of 2011, which will put downward pressure on operating margins until the trend flattens out or reverses. As we have said in the past,, while our business model, it's upward or downward trending raw materials, fairly well, to minimize the impact of operating margins, dramatic volatility can have a very sizable impact on our short-term results, we currently don't expect anything under the and the normal trends. 
Capital expenditures were higher than usual of the fourth quarter of 2010, reflecting the impact of project spending, which was somewhat delayed by integration efforts earlier in the year but ultimately needed to be accomplished in 2010 in order to be prepared to meet 2011 capacity demands. Capital expenditures in 2011 will increase to approximately $150 million, which includes the expanded nine-layered capability to support our new products for refrigerated applications such as meat and dairy. These products that the consumer-oriented Bemis package and improve various to further extend the shelf life of these refrigerated foods.
In Latin America, we are also investing in new capacity to expand our production to proprietary barrier films for the protein market in that region. We have been pleased with the positive reception from customers over the past year as we introduced these films to our local customer base. While we expect additional growth in 2011, the benefits of the new capacity will have a stronger impact on 2012.
Overall, 2010 was a great year for Bemis. We have experienced an increase of over 30% of net sales, number of facilities and number of employees. And in the process, we've put together a talented team that is learning from each other and making positive changes to the business. I am pleased with the strong decline of new products that we're commercializing in 2011. Our manufacturing operations are improving every quarter as initiatives move forward, and we are keenly focused on helping our customers benefit from all the value that we have to offer them. 
Now I'd like to open up the call for questions."

We saw strong broad volume improvement in North America and weakness in several categories in Europe. In Latin America, we have that inventory correction issues, so we didn't have quite the strength that we have in the second and third quarter in Latin America. But overall, volumes year-over-year were improved in 2010 over 2011. We had some good trends going through, and it was pretty broad-based. I think part of that is because 2009 was a challenging year for volume. So the year-over-year comparisons lent themselves to the positive numbers. And as we go into 2011, we have no reason to think that those trends will change. They've been pretty steady. There are no one-time home run type of items in there, and there are several areas where we're winning new business, and we expect to see volumes in particular categories continue to grow."

Today I'll discuss the results of the fourth quarter and then provide some color on our guidance for 2011. Before we get into the details, I'd like to note some of the key financial highlights from 2010. We reported record adjusted earnings per share of $2.12, our second year in a row of double-digit EPS growth and in line with our guidance for the year and the quarters. We recorded our second highest year ever of free cash flow in the face of increasing raw material costs, as well as higher levels of working capital related to Food Americas as we carried extra inventory during the integration of our expanded plant network. We paid down approximately $200 million of debt since the acquisition of Food Americas on March 1, and we repurchased 1.5 million shares of Bemis common stock.
Now turning to the fourth quarter. Our results were in line with our guidance and continue to demonstrate healthy growth over the prior year. Earnings per share before special charges was $0.49 for the fourth quarter of 2010, compared with $0.45 last year, an increase of 9%. Net sales increased by about 38%, including about 34% from the Food Americas acquisition. The remaining 4% organic growth reflects the increase in sales in 2010 compared to the pro forma sales of 2009. Currency did not have a significant impact on consolidated sales during the quarter. 
In the Flexible Packaging business segment, net sales increased by about 44% for the quarter, of which about 40% related to the Food Americas acquisition. The remaining 4% organic growth reflects the impact of higher raw material costs pushing up selling prices in addition to increased sales of higher priced, value-added products. Volumes in North America were somewhat higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, reflecting the continuation of volume trends that we experienced throughout 2010. In Latin America, now almost 20% of Bemis, sales volumes declined in the fourth quarter as customers in Brazil made inventory adjustments at the end of the year. And in our Mexico operations, we strategically reduced volumes and improved sales mix resulting in improved profitability. Our European Flexible Packaging sales remained below last year's levels. However, we did see sequential volume improvement compared to the third quarter of 2010, which is encouraging. 
In the Pressure Sensitive Materials segment, which represented about 10% of sales this quarter, net sales increased nearly 4%, excluding the impact of currency, which represents stronger volume sales in North America and the pass-through of increased raw material costs.
Moving on to operating profit. We are very pleased with the cost savings results of our integration efforts. We have achieved the targets we set for 2010, and we are on track to achieve our run rate target of $60 million of cost savings by the end of 2011. Going forward, these integration synergy targets have been built into our existing continuous improvement programs and will no longer be separately identified as synergies. This is a positive indicator of the extent to which we have completed our integration of Food Americas. It is important to note that the lower operating profit margins associated with the newly acquired Food Americas business have reduced our overall operating margins in 2010. 
Looking sequentially at operating profit for the Flexible Packaging segment from the third quarter of 2010 to the fourth quarter, the nearly 1% decrease reflects primarily the seasonal decline in volume, coupled with increased raw material costs in the fourth quarter. 
Selling prices increased contractually and with non-contract customers during the second half of 2010 to reflect the higher costs of raw materials. Our business model uses escalator and de-escalator clauses in customer contracts to mechanically adjust selling prices for changes in raw material costs on a regular basis. These clauses are embedded in our multi-year customer contracts, which represent approximately 2/3 of our Flexible Packaging sales. This is a common industry contract cost and therefore, the contracts that we acquired with the Food Americas acquisition in 2010 also includes similar escalator and de-escalator clauses. However, the acquired contracts have longer periods of time between selling price adjustments than Bemis' standard policies. This will prolong the negative operating profit impact in a rising raw material cost environment in 2011. 
Several years ago, we shortened the adjustment periods in our contracts to address increased volatility in raw material markets. One of our priorities is to synchronize the terms of these Food Americas customer contracts with the Bemis contracts, including shorter adjustment periods in the escalator/de-escalator clauses. 
Selling, general and administrative costs increased during 2010, and we expect SG&A spending to be approximately level in 2011 with 2010. The improvement in the line item other operating income and expense reflects the fact that we had $15 million in acquisition-related expenses in 2009. Most of the other operating income in 2010 was generated by fiscal incentives we earned in Brazil. 
Turning to the cash flow statement. In the fourth quarter, we generated $119 million of cash from operations, an increase of $39 million over the same period of 2009. For the full year 2010, we recorded our second highest level of free cash flow in our history. This was less than we had planned and resulted from higher working capital largely as a result of two factors. One, just as rising raw material costs had a negative short-term impact on our earnings, they also increased the carrying cost of our inventories. Two, we carried higher inventory levels during the integration process in order to ensure that we maintain high levels of customer service as we integrated our new production facilities. 
Capital expenditures totaled $48.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2010. This is a reflection of the timing of expenditures that had been planned for 2010 and realized in the fourth quarter. This year, we repurchased about 1.5 million shares of Bemis common stock. This offset approximately 1.2 million shares issued in connection with incentive compensation programs for Bemis employees. 
As we look to 2011, our earnings per share guidance for the total year is $2.33 to $2.48. This includes an assumption of constant currency exchange rates and increasing raw material costs through the first half of this year. Our guidance also reflects an increase of about $10 million in pension costs and continued accounting for the non-controlling interest in our Brazilian subsidiary. While we continue to pursue a tender offer for the outstanding preferred shares of our Brazilian subsidiary, the purchase of those shares is not reflected in our guidance at this point since we cannot predict the timing or certainty of the completion of that transaction.
The increase in pension costs is primarily a reflection of the amortization of asset losses experienced back in the stock market decline of 2008. Subsequent gains are expected to reduce pension costs beginning in 2012. Our guidance for the first quarter of 2011 is $0.50 to $0.55. Again, the first quarter includes the months of January and February, which are seasonally slower months. In addition, higher benefit costs and raw material cost increases are expected to create headwinds compared to the first quarter of 2010. 
For the total year 2011, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $150 million. This is below the level of depreciation plus amortization, which we expect to be about $215 million in 2011. The reason we have been able to keep capital expenditures down is because we acquired well-capitalized production capacity with the Food Americas acquisition, and World Class Manufacturing initiatives are contributing to our production efficiencies. Longer term, we expect capital expenditures to be closer to D&A.
Finally, in addition to our judicious approach to capital expenditure decisions, we also remain committed to disciplined use of free cash flow. We are continuing to seek strategic and accretive acquisition opportunities. Meanwhile, we will continue to improve shareholder value by repurchasing shares opportunistically and reducing interest expense. 
Now I'll turn it over to Henry for his comments."
255132,118360626,97712,"Bemis Company, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2011",2011-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Amcor Flexibles North America Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott. To start with, I'm very pleased with the performance of the company in 2010 and the progress we have made integrating the Food Americas acquisition. Our success in this effort is thanks to the talent and hard work of many dedicated Bemis",812,"Thank you, Scott. To start with, I'm very pleased with the performance of the company in 2010 and the progress we have made integrating the Food Americas acquisition. Our success in this effort is thanks to the talent and hard work of many dedicated Bemis employees in North America and Latin America, including sales, marketing, operations, engineering, customer service, finance, purchasing, human resources, information technology and our R&D teams. Today, I'll focus my comments on three main topics: the product development and process improvements being derived from the completion of the Food Americas integration; the climate for raw material costs and strategic investments in 2010; and the plan for 2011. 
Our customers have been pleased with what has been a nearly seamless transition, and our focus on maintaining customer service throughout this integration has further strengthened our customer relationship. As Scott mentioned, we have begun to move production among our facilities to better align our production facilities and technologies to optimize our manufacturing footprint. Part of the integration plan for the newly acquired facilities was the opportunity to leverage the new products, technologies and manufacturing expertise that came from the Food Americas acquisition. 
Let me give you some examples of commercial opportunities arising from our joint portfolio of technologies. One example is the expansion into new markets for barrier cup products from single-serve coffee to cups for creamers, puddings and single-serve condiments. This is a result of a combination of our unique rigid film structures with the Food Americas lidding technology around heat seal, lacquer and die-cutting capabilities supplying the complete solution.
We have leveraged our film/foil and sealing technologies to replace and improve the performance of our blister pack used for oral pharmaceuticals in Latin America. Now that we enjoy the leading position in pharmaceutical packaging in Brazil, bringing this production in-house gives us a great opportunity to expand our expertise in this market category and offer innovation to our pharmaceutical customers. 
And lastly, an important part of our efforts toward development of more sustainable packaging is the reduction in the use of raw materials. By combining the processing technology of Food Americas with the polymer science of Bemis, we have been able to make a significantly thinner serial liner while matching all current performance criteria. As I've mentioned before, we have a high-quality portfolio of facilities, and we are making changes to incorporate best practices across all facilities on a continuous basis. 
In 2011, we expect earnings per share to continue its double-digit growth trend in spite of some unexpected cost increases. We are behind the raw material cost curve for the fourth quarter of 2010. At the beginning of this quarter, most of our selling prices have been adjusted to reflect these higher costs. But we expect raw material cost to continue their upward trend during the first half of 2011, which will put downward pressure on operating margins until the trend flattens out or reverses. As we have said in the past, while our business model accommodates upward or downward trending raw materials, fairly well to minimize the impact of operating margins, dramatic volatility can have a more sizable impact on our short-term results. We currently don't expect anything other than the normal trends. 
Capital expenditures were higher than usual in the fourth quarter of 2010, reflecting the impact of project spending, which was somewhat delayed by integration efforts earlier in the year but ultimately needed to be accomplished in 2010 in order to be prepared to meet 2011 capacity demands. Capital expenditures in 2011 will increase to approximately $150 million, which includes the expanded nine-layer capability to support our new products for refrigerated applications such as meat and dairy. These new products that consumer-oriented convenience features to the package and improve barriers to further extend the shelf life of these refrigerated foods.
In Latin America, we are also investing in new capacity to expand our production of proprietary barrier films for the protein market in that region. We have been pleased with the positive reception from customers over the past year as we introduced these films to our local customer base. While we expect additional growth in 2011, the benefits of the new capacity will have a stronger impact on 2012.
Overall, 2010 was a great year for Bemis. We have experienced an increase of over 30% in net sales, number of facilities and number of employees. And in the process, we've put together a talented team that is learning from each other and making positive changes throughout the business. I am pleased with the strong pipeline of new products that we are commercializing in 2011. Our manufacturing operations are improving every quarter as initiatives move forward, and we are keenly focused on helping our customers benefit from all the value that we have to offer them.

What we've been focused on since then is aligning production where we want it to be across our plant network. We are partly along that path. We have more work to go, and there were two other key buckets, as you recall, from the original synergy forecast that we laid out. One was really about getting more savings out of that operations and plant optimization effort. That's still ongoing, and it's the reason why we are not going to be able to break out cost saving synergies from integration efforts versus cost savings from our ongoing normal course World Class Manufacturing initiatives. But we feel very good about the path that we're on to achieve better synergies and to really take advantage of our broader manufacturing footprint. Second, in terms of raw material purchasing opportunities, we're just at the front end of being able to negotiate, as well as possible purchasing prices for the resins and films and inks and other raw materials that we purchased as part of our business. So we think they're going to be additional cost savings that come from that.

Other areas where those kinds of things really fit is when we move into the retort area and you make a rigid tray say for a rigid meal and then you have the lid stock, and it has all the technologies that allow you to go through that retort where you cook the product under pressure and temperature, and then it has to cool off and absorb all that and it still goes through.

In Latin America, we have that inventory correction issues, so we didn't have quite the strength that we had in the second and third quarter in Latin America. But overall, volumes year-over-year were improved in 2010 over 2011. We had some good trends going through, and it was pretty broad-based. I think part of that is because 2009 was a challenging year for volume. So the year-over-year comparisons lent themselves to the positive numbers. And as we go into 2011, we have no reason to think that those trends will change. They've been pretty steady.

Today I'll discuss the results of the fourth quarter and then provide some color on our guidance for 2011. Before we get into the details, I'd like to note some of the key financial highlights from 2010. We reported record adjusted earnings per share of $2.12, our second year in a row of double-digit EPS growth and in line with our guidance for the year and the quarters. We recorded our second highest year ever of free cash flow in the face of increasing raw material costs, as well as higher levels of working capital related to Food Americas as we carried extra inventory during the integration of our expanded plant network. We paid down approximately $200 million of debt since the acquisition of Food Americas on March 1, and we repurchased 1.5 million shares of Bemis common stock.
Now turning to the fourth quarter. Our results were in line with our guidance and continue to demonstrate healthy growth over the prior year. Earnings per share before special charges was $0.49 for the fourth quarter of 2010, compared with $0.45 last year, an increase of 9%. Net sales increased by about 38%, including about 34% from the Food Americas acquisition. The remaining 4% organic growth reflects the increase in sales in 2010 compared to the pro forma sales of 2009. Currency did not have a significant impact on consolidated sales during the quarter. 
In the Flexible Packaging business segment, net sales increased by about 44% for the quarter, of which about 40% related to the Food Americas acquisition. The remaining 4% organic growth reflects the impact of higher raw material costs pushing up selling prices in addition to increased sales of higher priced, value-added products. Volumes in North America were somewhat higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, reflecting the continuation of volume trends that we experienced throughout 2010. In Latin America, now almost 20% of Bemis, sales volumes declined in the fourth quarter as customers in Brazil made inventory adjustments at the end of the year. And in our Mexico operations, we strategically reduced volumes and improved sales mix resulting in improved profitability. Our European Flexible Packaging sales remained below last year's levels. However, we did see sequential volume improvement compared to the third quarter of 2010, which is encouraging. 
In the Pressure Sensitive Materials segment, which represented about 10% of sales this quarter, net sales increased nearly 4%, excluding the impact of currency, which represents stronger volume sales in North America and the pass-through of increased raw material costs.
Moving on to operating profit. We are very pleased with the cost savings results of our integration efforts. We have achieved the targets we set for 2010, and we are on track to achieve our run rate target of $60 million of cost savings by the end of 2011. Going forward, these integration synergy targets have been built into our existing continuous improvement programs and will no longer be separately identified as synergies. This is a positive indicator of the extent to which we have completed our integration of Food Americas. It is important to note that the lower operating profit margins associated with the newly acquired Food Americas business have reduced our overall operating margins in 2010. 
Looking sequentially at operating profit for the Flexible Packaging segment from the third quarter of 2010 to the fourth quarter, the nearly 1% decrease reflects primarily the seasonal decline in volume, coupled with increased raw material costs in the fourth quarter. 
Selling prices increased contractually and with non-contract customers during the second half of 2010 to reflect the higher costs of raw materials. Our business model uses escalator and de-escalator clauses in customer contracts to mechanically adjust selling prices for changes in raw material costs on a regular basis. These clauses are embedded in our multi-year customer contracts, which represent approximately 2/3 of our Flexible Packaging sales. This is a common industry contract cost and therefore, the contracts that we acquired with the Food Americas acquisition in 2010 also includes similar escalator and de-escalator clauses. However, the acquired contracts have longer periods of time between selling price adjustments than Bemis' standard policies. This will prolong the negative operating profit impact in a rising raw material cost environment in 2011. 
Several years ago, we shortened the adjustment periods in our contracts to address increased volatility in raw material markets. One of our priorities is to synchronize the terms of these Food Americas customer contracts with the Bemis contracts, including shorter adjustment periods in the escalator/de-escalator clauses. 
Selling, general and administrative costs increased during 2010, and we expect SG&A spending to be approximately level in 2011 with 2010. The improvement in the line item other operating income and expense reflects the fact that we had $15 million in acquisition-related expenses in 2009. Most of the other operating income in 2010 was generated by fiscal incentives we earned in Brazil. 
Turning to the cash flow statement. In the fourth quarter, we generated $119 million of cash from operations, an increase of $39 million over the same period of 2009. For the full year 2010, we recorded our second highest level of free cash flow in our history. This was less than we had planned and resulted from higher working capital largely as a result of two factors. One, just as rising raw material costs had a negative short-term impact on our earnings, they also increased the carrying cost of our inventories. Two, we carried higher inventory levels during the integration process in order to ensure that we maintain high levels of customer service as we integrated our new production facilities. 
Capital expenditures totaled $48.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2010. This is a reflection of the timing of expenditures that had been planned for 2010 and realized in the fourth quarter. This year, we repurchased about 1.5 million shares of Bemis common stock. This offset approximately 1.2 million shares issued in connection with incentive compensation programs for Bemis employees. 
As we look to 2011, our earnings per share guidance for the total year is $2.33 to $2.48. This includes an assumption of constant currency exchange rates and increasing raw material costs through the first half of this year. Our guidance also reflects an increase of about $10 million in pension costs and continued accounting for the non-controlling interest in our Brazilian subsidiary. While we continue to pursue a tender offer for the outstanding preferred shares of our Brazilian subsidiary, the purchase of those shares is not reflected in our guidance at this point since we cannot predict the timing or certainty of the completion of that transaction.
The increase in pension costs is primarily a reflection of the amortization of asset losses experienced back in the stock market decline of 2008. Subsequent gains are expected to reduce pension costs beginning in 2012. Our guidance for the first quarter of 2011 is $0.50 to $0.55. Again, the first quarter includes the months of January and February, which are seasonally slower months. In addition, higher benefit costs and raw material cost increases are expected to create headwinds compared to the first quarter of 2010. 
For the total year 2011, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $150 million. This is below the level of depreciation plus amortization, which we expect to be about $215 million in 2011. The reason we have been able to keep capital expenditures down is because we acquired well-capitalized production capacity with the Food Americas acquisition, and World Class Manufacturing initiatives are contributing to our production efficiencies. Longer term, we expect capital expenditures to be closer to D&A.
Finally, in addition to our judicious approach to capital expenditure decisions, we also remain committed to disciplined use of free cash flow. We are continuing to seek strategic and accretive acquisition opportunities. Meanwhile, we will continue to improve shareholder value by repurchasing shares opportunistically and reducing interest expense. 
Now I'll turn it over to Henry for his comments."

Our success in this effort is thanks to the talent and hard work of many dedicated Bemis",812,"Thank you, Scott. To start with, I'm very pleased with the performance of the company in 2010 and the progress we have made integrating the Food Americas acquisition. Our success in this effort is thanks to the talent and hard work of many dedicated Bemis employees in North America and Latin America, including sales, marketing, operations, engineering, customer service, finance, purchasing, human resources, information technology and our R&D teams. Today, I'll focus my comments on three main topics: the product development and process improvements being derived from the completion of the Food Americas integration; the climate for raw material costs and strategic investments in 2010; and the plan for 2011. 
Our customers have been pleased with what has been a nearly seamless transition, and our focus on maintaining customer service throughout this integration has further strengthened our customer relationship. As Scott mentioned, we have begun to move production among our facilities to better align our production facilities and technologies to optimize our manufacturing footprint. Part of the integration plan for the newly acquired facilities was the opportunity to leverage the new products, technologies and manufacturing expertise that came from the Food Americas acquisition. 
Let me give you some examples of commercial opportunities arising from our joint portfolio of technologies. One example is the expansion into new markets for barrier cup products from single-serve coffee to cups for creamers, puddings and single-serve condiments. This is a result of a combination of our unique rigid film structures with the Food Americas lidding technology around heat seal, lacquer and die-cutting capabilities supplying the complete solution.
We have leveraged our film/foil and sealing technologies to replace and improve the performance of our blister pack used for oral pharmaceuticals in Latin America. Now that we enjoy the leading position in pharmaceutical packaging in Brazil, bringing this production in-house gives us a great opportunity to expand our expertise in this market category and offer innovation to our pharmaceutical customers. 
And lastly, an important part of our efforts toward development of more sustainable packaging is the reduction in the use of raw materials. By combining the processing technology of Food Americas with the polymer science of Bemis, we have been able to make a significantly thinner serial liner while matching all current performance criteria. As I've mentioned before, we have a high-quality portfolio of facilities, and we are making changes to incorporate best practices across all facilities on a continuous basis. 
In 2011, we expect earnings per share to continue its double-digit growth trend in spite of some unexpected cost increases. We are behind the raw material cost curve for the fourth quarter of 2010. At the beginning of this quarter, most of our selling prices have been adjusted to reflect these higher costs. But we expect raw material cost to continue their upward trend during the first half of 2011, which will put downward pressure on operating margins until the trend flattens out or reverses. As we have said in the past, while our business model accommodates upward or downward trending raw materials, fairly well to minimize the impact of operating margins, dramatic volatility can have a more sizable impact on our short-term results. We currently don't expect anything other than the normal trends. 
Capital expenditures were higher than usual in the fourth quarter of 2010, reflecting the impact of project spending, which was somewhat delayed by integration efforts earlier in the year but ultimately needed to be accomplished in 2010 in order to be prepared to meet 2011 capacity demands. Capital expenditures in 2011 will increase to approximately $150 million, which includes the expanded nine-layer capability to support our new products for refrigerated applications such as meat and dairy. These new products that consumer-oriented convenience features to the package and improve barriers to further extend the shelf life of these refrigerated foods.
In Latin America, we are also investing in new capacity to expand our production of proprietary barrier films for the protein market in that region. We have been pleased with the positive reception from customers over the past year as we introduced these films to our local customer base. While we expect additional growth in 2011, the benefits of the new capacity will have a stronger impact on 2012.
Overall, 2010 was a great year for Bemis. We have experienced an increase of over 30% in net sales, number of facilities and number of employees. And in the process, we've put together a talented team that is learning from each other and making positive changes throughout the business. I am pleased with the strong pipeline of new products that we are commercializing in 2011. Our manufacturing operations are improving every quarter as initiatives move forward, and we are keenly focused on helping our customers benefit from all the value that we have to offer them. 
Now I'd like to open up the call for questions."

That's still ongoing, and it's the reason why we are not going to be able to break out cost saving synergies from integration efforts versus cost savings from our ongoing normal course World Class Manufacturing initiatives.

We saw strong sort of broad volume improvements in North America and weakness in several categories in Europe. In Latin America, we have that inventory correction issues, so we didn't have quite the strength that we had in the second and third quarter in Latin America. But overall, volumes year-over-year were improved in 2010 over 2011. We had some good trends going through, and it was pretty broad-based. I think part of that is because 2009 was a challenging year for volume. So the year-over-year comparisons lent themselves to the positive numbers. And as we go into 2011, we have no reason to think that those trends will change. They've been pretty steady. There are no one-time home run type of items in there, and there are several areas where we're winning new business, and we expect to see volumes in particular categories continue to grow."

Today I'll discuss the results of the fourth quarter and then provide some color on our guidance for 2011. Before we get into the details, I'd like to note some of the key financial highlights from 2010. We reported record adjusted earnings per share of $2.12, our second year in a row of double-digit EPS growth and in line with our guidance for the year and the quarters. We recorded our second highest year ever of free cash flow in the face of increasing raw material costs, as well as higher levels of working capital related to Food Americas as we carried extra inventory during the integration of our expanded plant network. We paid down approximately $200 million of debt since the acquisition of Food Americas on March 1, and we repurchased 1.5 million shares of Bemis common stock.
Now turning to the fourth quarter. Our results were in line with our guidance and continue to demonstrate healthy growth over the prior year. Earnings per share before special charges was $0.49 for the fourth quarter of 2010, compared with $0.45 last year, an increase of 9%. Net sales increased by about 38%, including about 34% from the Food Americas acquisition. The remaining 4% organic growth reflects the increase in sales in 2010 compared to the pro forma sales of 2009. Currency did not have a significant impact on consolidated sales during the quarter. 
In the Flexible Packaging business segment, net sales increased by about 44% for the quarter, of which about 40% related to the Food Americas acquisition. The remaining 4% organic growth reflects the impact of higher raw material costs pushing up selling prices in addition to increased sales of higher priced, value-added products. Volumes in North America were somewhat higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, reflecting the continuation of volume trends that we experienced throughout 2010. In Latin America, now almost 20% of Bemis, sales volumes declined in the fourth quarter as customers in Brazil made inventory adjustments at the end of the year. And in our Mexico operations, we strategically reduced volumes and improved sales mix resulting in improved profitability. Our European Flexible Packaging sales remained below last year's levels. However, we did see sequential volume improvement compared to the third quarter of 2010, which is encouraging. 
In the Pressure Sensitive Materials segment, which represented about 10% of sales this quarter, net sales increased nearly 4%, excluding the impact of currency, which represents stronger volume sales in North America and the pass-through of increased raw material costs.
Moving on to operating profit. We are very pleased with the cost savings results of our integration efforts. We have achieved the targets we set for 2010, and we are on track to achieve our run rate target of $60 million of cost savings by the end of 2011. Going forward, these integration synergy targets have been built into our existing continuous improvement programs and will no longer be separately identified as synergies. This is a positive indicator of the extent to which we have completed our integration of Food Americas. It is important to note that the lower operating profit margins associated with the newly acquired Food Americas business have reduced our overall operating margins in 2010. 
Looking sequentially at operating profit for the Flexible Packaging segment from the third quarter of 2010 to the fourth quarter, the nearly 1% decrease reflects primarily the seasonal decline in volume, coupled with increased raw material costs in the fourth quarter. 
Selling prices increased contractually and with non-contract customers during the second half of 2010 to reflect the higher costs of raw materials. Our business model uses escalator and de-escalator clauses in customer contracts to mechanically adjust selling prices for changes in raw material costs on a regular basis. These clauses are embedded in our multi-year customer contracts, which represent approximately 2/3 of our Flexible Packaging sales. This is a common industry contract clause and therefore, the contracts that we acquired with the Food Americas acquisition in 2010 also includes similar escalator and de-escalator clauses. However, the acquired contracts have longer periods of time between selling price adjustments than Bemis' standard policies. This will prolong the negative operating profit impact in a rising raw material cost environment in 2011. 
Several years ago, we shortened the adjustment periods in our contracts to address increased volatility in raw material markets. One of our priorities is to synchronize the terms of these Food Americas customer contracts with the Bemis contracts, including shorter adjustment periods in the escalator/de-escalator clauses. 
Selling, general and administrative costs increased during 2010, and we expect SG&A spending to be approximately level in 2011 with 2010. The improvement in the line item other operating income and expense reflects the fact that we had $15 million in acquisition-related expenses in 2009. Most of the other operating income in 2010 was generated by fiscal incentives we earned in Brazil. 
Turning to the cash flow statement. In the fourth quarter, we generated $119 million of cash from operations, an increase of $39 million over the same period of 2009. For the full year 2010, we recorded our second highest level of free cash flow in our history. This was less than we had planned and resulted from higher working capital largely as a result of two factors. One, just as rising raw material costs had a negative short-term impact on our earnings, they also increased the carrying cost of our inventories. Two, we carried higher inventory levels during the integration process in order to ensure that we maintain high levels of customer service as we integrated our new production facilities. 
Capital expenditures totaled $48.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2010. This is a reflection of the timing of expenditures that had been planned for 2010 and realized in the fourth quarter. This year, we repurchased about 1.5 million shares of Bemis common stock. This offset approximately 1.2 million shares issued in connection with incentive compensation programs for Bemis employees. 
As we look to 2011, our earnings per share guidance for the total year is $2.33 to $2.48. This includes an assumption of constant currency exchange rates and increasing raw material costs through the first half of this year. Our guidance also reflects an increase of about $10 million in pension costs and continued accounting for the non-controlling interest in our Brazilian subsidiary. While we continue to pursue a tender offer for the outstanding preferred shares of our Brazilian subsidiary, the purchase of those shares is not reflected in our guidance at this point since we cannot predict the timing or certainty of the completion of that transaction.
The increase in pension costs is primarily a reflection of the amortization of asset losses experienced back in the stock market decline of 2008. Subsequent gains are expected to reduce pension costs beginning in 2012. Our guidance for the first quarter of 2011 is $0.50 to $0.55. Again, the first quarter includes the months of January and February, which are seasonally slower months. In addition, higher benefit costs and raw material cost increases are expected to create headwinds compared to the first quarter of 2010. 
For the total year 2011, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $150 million. This is below the level of depreciation plus amortization, which we expect to be about $215 million in 2011. The reason we have been able to keep capital expenditures down is because we acquired well-capitalized production capacity with the Food Americas acquisition, and World Class Manufacturing initiatives are contributing to our production efficiencies. Longer term, we expect capital expenditures to be closer to D&A.
Finally, in addition to our judicious approach to capital expenditure decisions, we also remain committed to disciplined use of free cash flow. We are continuing to seek strategic and accretive acquisition opportunities. Meanwhile, we will continue to improve shareholder value by repurchasing shares opportunistically and reducing interest expense. 
Now I'll turn it over to Henry for his comments."
255132,118360626,97881,"Bemis Company, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2011",2011-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Amcor Flexibles North America Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott. To start with, I'm very pleased with the performance of the company in 2010 and the progress we have made integrating the Food Americas acquisition. Our success in this effort is thanks to the talent and hard work of many dedicated Bemis",812,"Thank you, Scott. To start with, I'm very pleased with the performance of the company in 2010 and the progress we have made integrating the Food Americas acquisition. Our success in this effort is thanks to the talent and hard work of many dedicated Bemis employees in North America and Latin America, including sales, marketing, operations, engineering, customer service, finance, purchasing, human resources, information technology and our R&D teams. Today, I'll focus my comments on three main topics: the product development and process improvements being derived from the completion of the Food Americas integration; the climate for raw material costs and strategic investments in 2010; and the plan for 2011. 
Our customers have been pleased with what has been a nearly seamless transition, and our focus on maintaining customer service throughout this integration has further strengthened our customer relationship. As Scott mentioned, we have begun to move production among our facilities to better align our production facilities and technologies to optimize our manufacturing footprint. Part of the integration plan for the newly acquired facilities was the opportunity to leverage the new products, technologies and manufacturing expertise that came from the Food Americas acquisition. 
Let me give you some examples of commercial opportunities arising from our joint portfolio of technologies. One example is the expansion into new markets for barrier cup products from single-serve coffee to cups for creamers, puddings and single-serve condiments. This is a result of a combination of our unique rigid film structures with the Food Americas' lidding technology around heat seal, lacquer and die-cutting capabilities supplying the complete solution.
We have leveraged our film/foil and sealing technologies to replace and improve the performance of our blister pack used for oral pharmaceuticals in Latin America. Now that we enjoy the leading position in pharmaceutical packaging in Brazil, bringing this production in-house gives us a great opportunity to expand our expertise in this market category and offer innovation to our pharmaceutical customers. 
And lastly, an important part of our efforts toward development of more sustainable packaging is the reduction in the use of raw materials. By combining the processing technology of Food Americas with the polymer science of Bemis, we have been able to make a significantly thinner cereal liner while matching all current performance criteria. As I've mentioned before, we have a high-quality portfolio of facilities, and we are making changes to incorporate best practices across all facilities on a continuous basis. 
In 2011, we expect earnings per share to continue its double-digit growth trend in spite of some unexpected cost increases. We are behind the raw material cost curve for the fourth quarter of 2010. At the beginning of this quarter, most of our selling prices have been adjusted to reflect these higher costs. But we expect raw material cost to continue their upward trend during the first half of 2011, which will put downward pressure on operating margins until the trend flattens out or reverses. As we have said in the past, while our business model accommodates upward or downward trending raw materials fairly well to minimize the impact of operating margins, dramatic volatility can have a more sizable impact on our short-term results. We currently don't expect anything other than the normal trends. 
Capital expenditures were higher than usual in the fourth quarter of 2010, reflecting the impact of project spending, which was somewhat delayed by integration efforts earlier in the year but ultimately needed to be accomplished in 2010 in order to be prepared to meet 2011 capacity demands. Capital expenditures in 2011 will increase to approximately $150 million, which includes the expanded nine-layer capability to support our new products for refrigerated applications such as meat and dairy. These new products add consumer-oriented convenience features to the package and improve barriers to further extend the shelf life of these refrigerated foods.
In Latin America, we are also investing in new capacity to expand our production of proprietary barrier films for the protein market in that region. We have been pleased with the positive reception from customers over the past year as we introduced these films to our local customer base. While we expect additional growth in 2011, the benefits of the new capacity will have a stronger impact on 2012.
Overall, 2010 was a great year for Bemis. We have experienced an increase of over 30% in net sales, number of facilities and number of employees. And in the process, we've put together a talented team that is learning from each other and making positive changes throughout the business. I am pleased with the strong pipeline of new products that we are commercializing in 2011. Our manufacturing operations are improving every quarter as initiatives move forward, and we are keenly focused on helping our customers benefit from all the value that we have to offer them.

What we've been focused on since then is aligning production where we want it to be across our plant network. We are partly along that path. We have more work to go, and there were two other key buckets, as you recall, from the original synergy forecast that we laid out. One was really about getting more savings out of that operations and plant optimization effort. That's still ongoing, and it's the reason why we are not going to be able to break out cost saving synergies from integration efforts versus cost savings from our ongoing normal course World Class Manufacturing initiatives. But we feel very good about the path that we're on to achieve better synergies and to really take advantage of our broader manufacturing footprint. Second, in terms of raw material purchasing opportunities, we're just at the front end of being able to negotiate, as well as possible purchasing prices for the resins and films and inks and other raw materials that we purchased as part of our business. So we think there are going to be additional cost savings that come from that.

But overall, volumes year-over-year were improved in 2010 over 2011. We had some good trends going through, and it was pretty broad-based.

255132,130297376,119791,"Bemis Company, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2011",2011-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Amcor Flexibles North America Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone. This was a challenging quarter for Bemis, and we are disappointed to have missed the low end of our first quarter EPS guidance by $0.03. Our guidance for the first quarter incorporated our expectation of increasing raw material cos",1116,"Good morning, everyone. This was a challenging quarter for Bemis, and we are disappointed to have missed the low end of our first quarter EPS guidance by $0.03. Our guidance for the first quarter incorporated our expectation of increasing raw material cost for the first half of 2011. However, with the escalation of unrest in the Middle East and supply issues in the chemical industry, raw material cost increased dramatically during the first quarter, particularly the cost of the specialty resins Bemis relies on for our high barrier Flexible Packaging products. 
In our Flexible Packaging business segment, we use a variety of raw material inputs, including polyethylene, nylon, polyester, polypropylene and many others. Our customer contracts provide for us to adjust selling prices in response to raw material cost changes. But there is a time lag between the raw material cost changes and the scheduled selling price adjustments. Currently, the contract price adjustment lag times vary from 1 month to 6 months. However, the lag time for polyethylene-based packaging is shorter and will be longer for complex multilayer products that incorporate more specialty resins. 
During the first quarter of 2011, we experienced more dramatic raw material increases than we expected. The cost of polyethylene, polyester polypropylene and nylon increased in excess of 50% and even about 30% in some cases. While most of this impact will be recognized during the second quarter, there was still a measurable impact on first quarter gross margins.
At this point, we recognize the additional cost increases that we will be experiencing in the second quarter. Clearly, our selling prices will adjust to reflect these higher input costs, and we will continue to reduce material cost with material substitutions and efficiency improvements. We have well established continuous improvement initiatives throughout Bemis that are focused on planned efficiencies, and I am confident these projects will continue to deliver value as we move forward. 
Looking out through the rest of the year, Flexible Packaging volumes are expected to be relatively flat with last year as our customers have begun to express some concern about the impact of food price inflation on consumer buying patterns. At Bemis, we expect to see volume growth throughout the year due to the pipeline of new products that we are introducing in. Our rigid barrier platform coupled with lower Peel/Reseal technology is giving us new market access and expanding packaging formats in existing markets. Examples of some of these are creamer cups, frozen pizza and condiments. Bemis is gaining growth in these markets categories because our products offer convenient features, reduce material content and extend shelf life.
Let me illustrate some examples of our innovation. Our new frozen pizza package eliminates the need for an outside carton, therefore reducing packaging content by 30% compared to previous frozen pizza formats. The opportunity use less material is critical to our customers' sustainability goals and helps control package cost in this environment of escalating raw material cost. This new package uses our polyester platform and incorporates our EZ Peel feature for consumer convenience. This is just one example of how Bemis is providing our customers with packaging solutions that deliver affordable sustainability benefits.
Another example of our contributions to the sustainability needs of our customers is exhibited in the Creamer Cup business where our rigid barrier technology has reduced the material content by 20% and provides an improved barrier to extend product shelf life. Our Peel/Reseal polyester platform continues to grow nicely as it eliminates the need for reclosable zipper. This package is primarily used for applications for processed meat and cheese, and we see customers using this cost-effective packaging upgrade to add consumer convenience features to the current product lines. 
Bemis has also introduced an innovative new condiment package that includes easy open features, premium graphics and a design that offers both a format and a format. This new package is being launched in retail stores, as well as restaurants. 
We are also pleased to see the continued growth of our technology and value-added platforms in the medical device and pharmaceutical markets. Our world class manufacturing initiatives continue to expand into production facilities and improve efficiencies throughout the production process. Raw material waste reduction programs have become even more important as the cost of resin has increased, and we expect continuous improvement through 2011.
In 2011, we are aggressively pursuing the second phase of the Food Americas integration. In this phase, we are optimizing our manufacturing processes to ensure that the right product is produced on the best equipment for that particular process. This exercise will improve margins by improving economies of scale at certain equipment and taking advantage of best practices across the company. In addition, we are evaluating situations in which multiple product specifications are used for one particular product to feature. Reducing specifications also reduces changeovers on equipment, increases economies of scale and simplifies the manufacturing process.
Streamlining of our product and manufacturing footprint as we continue to integrate the Food Americas operations has led to some additional expenses that total approximately $0.02 during the first quarter. We expect to see the positive benefit of these initiatives in the current year. 
Our earnings per share guidance of $2.50 to $2.30 for the total year 2011 reflects the reality of this volatile and inflationary environment. This range accounts for all of the known raw material cost increases through to date. We are working diligently to execute our sales and profit growth strategy as quickly as possible and to take the opportunities to shorten the timeframes for selling price adjustments whenever possible. In this environment of specialty raw material cost increases and a cautious demand outlook resulting from food inflation, we believe our guidance reflects a realistic assessment for potential outcomes of 2011.
Our financial condition remains very strong, and while working capital absorbed cash during the first quarter due to higher resin cost, we continue to expect strong cash flow for the rest of the year. We purchased 1.7 million shares of common stock during the first quarter and will continue to balance opportunities to the best and prudent capital projects, acquisitions, debt reduction and opportunistic share repurchases to maximize our return metrics and increase shareholder value. 
In summary, expenses resin cost will pressure our margins in 2011. We expect this to be a short-term issue until we get contractual selling prices adjusted. We are progressing well on facility optimization and new business is ramping up nicely. We expect our products that extend shelf life will become even more important as food cost increase giving us a competitive advantage in the market. 
Now I'll turn it over to Scott for a more detailed analysis of the financial results."
255132,130297376,119791,"Bemis Company, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2011",2011-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Amcor Flexibles North America Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Henry. Although we are operating in a challenging raw material price environment, Bemis is in an advantageous position at the Flexible Packaging industry because of our new product platforms and pipeline. Our volume growth this year is coming f",1240,"Thank you, Henry. Although we are operating in a challenging raw material price environment, Bemis is in an advantageous position at the Flexible Packaging industry because of our new product platforms and pipeline. Our volume growth this year is coming from new products and product line extensions, which is why we are so focused as an organization around material science, chemical engineering and value-added customer relationships. Unfortunately, so far in 2011, our successes with new products have been overshadowed by the volatile and inflationary raw material costs we are experiencing. 
In the Flexible Packaging business segment, first quarter net sales increased by about 34%, of which about 22% related to the fact that we have a full quarter of Food Americas in 2011 versus just one month in the first quarter of 2010. Currency benefits increased sales by 2.5% and the remaining 9.5% growth reflects the impact of higher raw material costs pushing up selling prices in all categories. In addition, the unit volume increases in categories where Bemis sales higher-priced value-added products. 
Mexico continues to deliver improved performance, and our business in Brazil is performing well, save for the strengthening, which creates headwinds for our customers that export from Brazil. We're the largest Flexible Packaging company in Mexico and South America, with nearly a $1 billion in annualized sales. And our business in those regions continues to offer attractive long-term organic growth. We are also positioned to capture increased margins and returns as those food markets mature to require more and more high technology barrier packaging. 
On the other hand, our food Flexible Packaging business in Europe, now approximately 5% of Bemis sales, is subscale and is not meeting our margin objectives. While our Pressure Sensitive Materials and Medical Packaging businesses that sell into Europe are continuing to deliver nice results, our Food Flexible Packaging business participates in a fragmented highly competitive arena. This will continue to be the case for the foreseeable future. Our focus is European Food Flexible Packaging, continuous improvement in manufacturing operations along with volume and margin growth in the niche, meat and cheese markets we serve. The good news is that these European sales, which we're decreasing for most of 2010, stabilized in the first quarter of 2011 compared to the first quarter of last year.
Flexible Packaging operating profit for the first quarter was 9.9% of net sales. If we adjust last year's operating profit to exclude acquisition-related fees and include pro forma Food Americas results for January and February, the comparable rate would've been about 11% for the first quarter of 2010. The difference in year-over-year percentage margin reflects raw material headwinds. 
Second quarter Flexible Packaging margins will remain under pressure as the dramatic price increases from the first quarter move through our production cycle from raw materials to finished goods, but we do expect the second half of the year to return to higher margin levels if specialty resin costs stabilize, which is the assumption our EPS guidance reflects.
One of our company priorities is to increase the frequency of selling price adjustments in our customer agreements. A number of the customer agreements we inherited with the Food Americas acquisition specified 6-month periods before selling prices reset to reflect changes in raw material costs. This compares to most of our U.S. Bemis Flexible Packaging customer agreements, which generally adjust selling prices to reflect material cost changes every 30 to 90 days. Going forward, we will be working with our customers to shorten the periods between selling price adjustments.
Shifting to our Pressure Sensitive Materials segment, which represented about 11% of sales this quarter, net sales increased $4 million and operating profit increased $3 million. Operating profit for the Pressure Sensitive Materials segment trended in the right direction this quarter due to a combination of prudent cost management and good matching of selling prices with raw material cost increases. On a consolidated basis, our selling, general and administrative expenses increased sequentially over the fourth quarter, largely reflecting the amortization of losses in our pension investments when the markets declined sharply in 2008.
EBITDA for the first quarter increased by almost 20% compared to adjusted EBITDA for the same quarter of 2010, excluding all of the onetime acquisition-related charges from last year. This would have driven a healthy increase in cash flow from operations this quarter, but material cost increases resulted in much higher working capital offsetting any cash flow improvements. Consistent with past years, we expect cash flow from operations to strengthen for the remainder of the year.
For the total year 2011, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $150 million. Bemis capital investments and materials science research and development is directed at 2 areas: one, product categories that offer higher long-term volume growth and margins like semi-rigid packaging, packaging that protects food freshness and extends shelf life, as well as Medical Packaging products that require high barrier film properties. New products and targeted product line extensions will continue to be a key to our Flexible Packaging volume growth; and the second priority for CapEx is to fuel growth in geographies outside the U.S. and Europe where we can achieve attractive organic growth rates across our product portfolios. These disciplined capital investments continue to be our first priority for use of cash flow after dividends. 
Our next priority for use of cash flow estimate selected acquisitions when we have opportunities to purchase businesses that fit our strategic and financial objectives. Finally, we will manage our capital structure to give us the flexibility we need to fund growth investments while minimizing our cost of capital. Translation, we want to preserve our investment grade rating while reducing our shares outstanding through opportunistic open market repurchases. We repurchased 1.7 million shares of common stock during the first quarter, resulting in average diluted shares outstanding of $109.1 million for the earnings per share calculation for the quarter. We reported on our cash flow statement a $16 million payment for acquisitions during the first quarter that relates to a final working capital adjustment payment to Rio Tinto, primarily related to cash on hand we received at the close of the Food Americas acquisition a year ago.
We continue to pursue a tender offer for the outstanding preferred shares of our Brazilian subsidiary. The purchase of those shares is not reflected in our guidance since we could not predict the timing or certainty of the completion of that transaction. If and when we receive regulatory approval to resume the tender offer, we will move as quickly as possible to complete the transaction. 
Our guidance for the second quarter of 2011 is $0.48 to $0.54. This reflects the 15% to 30% cost increases in specialty resins that will be recognized during the second quarter with many of the related customer selling price adjustments occurring late in the second and early in the third quarters. The reduced earnings per share expectations for the first half of the year have been incorporated into the total year earnings per share guidance of $2.15 to $2.30. As Henry mentioned, the change reflects these dramatic increases in specialty resins costs, which tend to have longer lag times for selling price adjustments, some further raw material cost increases in the second quarter and then no further increases for the second half of the year.

255132,130297376,120155,"Bemis Company, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2011",2011-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Amcor Flexibles North America Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone. This was a challenging quarter for Bemis, and we are disappointed to have missed the low end of our first quarter EPS guidance by $0.03. Our guidance for the first quarter incorporated our expectation of increasing raw material cos",1117,"Good morning, everyone. This was a challenging quarter for Bemis, and we are disappointed to have missed the low end of our first quarter EPS guidance by $0.03. Our guidance for the first quarter incorporated our expectation of increasing raw material costs for the first half of 2011. However, with the escalation of unrest in the Middle East and supply issues in the chemical industry, raw material costs increased dramatically during the first quarter, particularly the cost of the specialty resins Bemis relies on for our high barrier Flexible Packaging products. 
In our Flexible Packaging business segment, we use a variety of raw material inputs, including polyethylene, nylon, polyester, polypropylene and many others. Our customer contracts provide for us to adjust selling prices in response to raw material cost changes, but there is a time lag between the raw material cost changes and the scheduled selling price adjustments. Currently, the contract price adjustment lag times vary from one month to 6 months. However, the lag time for polyethylene-based packaging is shorter and will be longer for complex multilayer products that incorporate more specialty resins. 
During the first quarter of 2011, we experienced more dramatic raw material increases than we expected. The cost of polyethylene, polyester polypropylene and nylon increased in excess of 15% and even above 30%, in some cases. While most of this impact will be recognized during the second quarter, there was still a measurable impact on first quarter gross margins. 
At this point, we recognize the additional cost increases that we will be experiencing in the second quarter. Clearly, our selling prices will adjust to reflect these higher input costs, and we will continue to reduce material costs with material substitutions and efficiency improvements. We have well-established continuous improvement initiatives throughout Bemis that are focused on plant efficiencies, and I am confident these projects will continue to deliver value as we move forward. 
Looking out through the rest of the year, Flexible Packaging volumes are expected to be relatively flat with last year as our customers have begin to express some concern about the impact of food price inflation on consumer buying patterns. At Bemis, we expect to see volume growth throughout the year due to the pipeline of new products that we are introducing. Our rigid barrier platform, coupled with our Peel Reseal technology, is giving us new market access and expanding packaging formats in existing markets. Examples of some of these are creamer cups, frozen pizza and condiments. Bemis is gaining growth in these market categories because our products offer convenient features, reduce material content and extend shelf life.
Let me illustrate some examples of our innovation. Our new frozen pizza package eliminates the need for an outside carton, therefore, reducing packaging content by 30% compared to previous frozen pizza formats. The opportunity to use less material is critical to our customers' sustainability goals and helps control package costs in this environment of escalating raw material costs. This new package uses our polyester platform and incorporates our EZ Peel feature for consumer convenience. This is just one example of how Bemis is providing our customers with packaging solutions that deliver affordable sustainability benefits. Another example of our contributions to the sustainability needs of our customers is exhibited in the creamer cup business where our rigid barrier technology has reduced the material content by 20% and provides an improved barrier to extend product shelf life. 
Our Peel Reseal polyester platform continues to grow nicely as it eliminates the need for reclosable zipper. This package is primarily used for applications for processed meat and cheese, and we see customers using this cost-effective packaging upgrade to add consumer convenience features to their current product lines. 
Bemis has also introduced an innovative new condiment package that includes easy-open features, premium graphics and a design that offers both a dip format and a pour format. This new package is being launched in retail stores as well as restaurants. We are also pleased to see the continued growth of our technology and value-added platforms in the medical device and pharmaceutical markets. 
Our world-class manufacturing initiatives continue to expand the new production facilities and improve efficiencies throughout the production process. Raw material waste reduction programs have become even more important as the cost of resin has increased, and we expect continuous improvement through 2011.
In 2011, we are aggressively pursuing the second phase of the Food Americas integration. In this phase, we are optimizing our manufacturing processes to ensure that the right product is produced on the best equipment for that particular process. This exercise will improve margins by improving economies of scale on certain equipment and taking advantage of best practices across the company. In addition, we are evaluating situations in which multiple product specifications are used for one particular product or feature. Reducing specifications also reduces changeovers on equipment, increases economies of scale and simplifies the manufacturing process.
Streamlining of our product and manufacturing footprint, as we continue to integrate the Food Americas operations, has led to some additional expenses that total approximately $0.02 during the first quarter. We expect to see the positive benefit of these initiatives in the current year. 
Our earnings per share guidance of $2.15 to $2.30 for the total year 2011 reflects the reality of this volatile and inflationary environment. This range accounts for all of the known raw material cost increases through today. We are working diligently to execute our sales and profit growth strategy as quickly as possible and to take the opportunities to shorten the timeframes for selling price adjustments whenever possible. In this environment of specialty raw material cost increases and a cautious demand outlook resulting from food inflation, we believe our guidance reflects a realistic assessment for potential outcomes of 2011.
Our financial condition remains very strong. And while working capital absorbed cash during the first quarter due to higher resin cost, we continue to expect strong cash flow for the rest of the year. We purchased 1.7 million shares of common stock during the first quarter, and we'll continue to balance opportunities to invest in prudent capital projects, acquisitions, debt reduction and opportunistic share repurchases to maximize our return metrics and to increase shareholder value. 
In summary, expensive resin costs will pressure our margins in 2011. We expect this to be a short-term issue until we get contractual selling prices adjusted. We are progressing well on facility optimization, and new business is ramping up nicely. We expect our products that extend shelf life will become even more important as food costs increase giving us a competitive advantage in the market. 
Now I'll turn it over to Scott for a more detailed analysis of the financial results."
255132,130297376,120155,"Bemis Company, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2011",2011-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Amcor Flexibles North America Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Henry. Although we are operating in a challenging raw material price environment, Bemis is in an advantageous position in the flexible packaging industry because of our new product platforms and pipeline. Our volume growth this year is coming f",1244,"Thank you, Henry. Although we are operating in a challenging raw material price environment, Bemis is in an advantageous position in the flexible packaging industry because of our new product platforms and pipeline. Our volume growth this year is coming from new products and product line extensions, which is why we are so focused, as an organization, around material science, chemical engineering and value-added customer relationships. Unfortunately, so far in 2011, our successes with new products have been overshadowed by the volatile and inflationary raw material costs we are experiencing. 
In the Flexible Packaging business segment, first quarter net sales increased by about 34%, of which about 22% is related to the fact that we have a full quarter of Food Americas in 2011 versus just one month in the first quarter of 2010; currency benefits increased sales by 2.5%; and the remaining 9.5% growth reflects the impact of higher raw material costs pushing up selling prices in all categories; in addition, the unit volume increases in categories where Bemis sells higher-priced value-added products. 
Mexico continues to deliver improved performance, and our business in Brazil is performing well, save for the strengthening real, which creates headwinds for our customers that export from Brazil. We're the largest flexible packaging company in Mexico and South America with nearly $1 billion in annualized sales. And our business in those regions continues to offer attractive long-term organic growth. We are also positioned to capture increased margins and returns as those food markets mature to require more and more high technology barrier packaging. 
On the other hand, our food Flexible Packaging business in Europe, now approximately 5% of Bemis sales, is subscale and is not meeting our margin objectives. While our Pressure Sensitive Materials and medical packaging businesses that sell into Europe are continuing to deliver nice results, our food Flexible Packaging business participates in a fragmented highly competitive arena. This will continue to be the case for the foreseeable future. 
Our focus is European food Flexible Packaging, continuous improvement in manufacturing operations along with volume and margin growth in the niche, meat and cheese markets we serve. The good news is that these European sales, which we're decreasing for most of 2010, stabilized in the first quarter of 2011 compared to the first quarter of last year.
Flexible Packaging operating profit for the first quarter was 9.9% of net sales. If we adjust last year's operating profit to exclude acquisition-related fees and include pro forma Food Americas results for January and February, the comparable rate would've been about 11% for the first quarter of 2010. The difference in year-over-year percentage margin reflects raw material headwinds. 
Second quarter Flexible Packaging margins will remain under pressure as the dramatic price increases from the first quarter move through our production cycle from raw materials to finished goods, but we do expect the second half of the year to return to higher margin levels if specialty resin costs stabilize, which is the assumption our EPS guidance reflects.
One of our company priorities is to increase the frequency of selling price adjustments in our customer agreements. A number of the customer agreements we inherited with the Food Americas acquisition specified 6-month periods before selling prices reset to reflect changes in raw material costs. This compares to most of our U.S. Bemis Flexible Packaging customer agreements, which generally adjust selling prices to reflect material cost changes every 30 to 90 days. Going forward, we will be working with our customers to shorten the periods between selling price adjustments.
Shifting to our Pressure Sensitive Materials segment, which represented about 11% of sales this quarter. Net sales increased $4 million, and operating profit increased $3 million. Operating profit for the Pressure Sensitive Materials segment trended in the right direction this quarter due to a combination of prudent cost management and good matching of selling prices with raw material cost increases. 
On a consolidated basis, our selling, general and administrative expenses increased sequentially over the fourth quarter, largely reflecting the amortization of losses in our pension investments when the markets declined sharply in 2008. EBITDA for the first quarter increased by almost 20% compared to adjusted EBITDA for the same quarter of 2010, excluding all of the onetime acquisition-related charges from last year. This would have driven a healthy increase in cash flow from operations this quarter but raw material cost increases resulted in much higher working capital, offsetting any cash flow improvements. Consistent with past years, we expect cash flow from operations to strengthen for the remainder of the year. 
For the total year 2011, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $150 million. Bemis capital investments in materials science research and development is directed at 2 areas: one, product categories that offer higher long-term volume growth and margins, like semi-rigid packaging, packaging that protects food freshness and extends shelf life, as well as medical packaging products that require high barrier film properties. New products and targeted product line extensions will continue to be a key to our Flexible Packaging volume growth. And the second priority for CapEx is to fuel growth in geographies outside the U.S. and Europe, where we can achieve attractive organic growth rates across our product portfolios. These disciplined capital investments continue to be our first priority for use of cash flow after dividends. 
Our next priority for use of cash flow is to make selected acquisitions when we have opportunities to purchase businesses that fit our strategic and financial objectives. Finally, we will manage our capital structure to give us the flexibility we need to fund growth investments while minimizing our cost of capital. Translation, we want to preserve our investment grade rating while reducing our shares outstanding through opportunistic open market repurchases. 
We repurchased 1.7 million shares of common stock during the first quarter, resulting in average diluted shares outstanding of $109.1 million for the earnings per share calculation for the quarter. We reported on our cash flow statement a $16 million payment for acquisitions during the first quarter that relates to a final working capital adjustment payment to Rio Tinto, primarily related to cash on hand we received at the close of the Food Americas acquisition a year ago.
We continue to pursue a tender offer for the outstanding preferred shares of our Brazilian subsidiary. The purchase of those shares is not reflected in our guidance since we could not predict the timing or certainty of the completion of that transaction. If and when we receive regulatory approval to resume the tender offer, we will move as quickly as possible to complete the transaction. 
Our guidance for the second quarter of 2011 is $0.48 to $0.54. This reflects the 15% to 30% cost increases in specialty resins that will be recognized during the second quarter with many of the related customer selling price adjustments occurring late in the second and early in the third quarters. The reduced earnings per share expectations for the first half of the year have been incorporated into the total year earnings per share guidance of $2.15 to $2.30. As Henry mentioned, the change reflects these dramatic increases in specialty resins costs, which tend to have longer lag times for selling price adjustments, some further raw material cost increases in the second quarter and then no further increases for the second half of the year.
Now Henry, Melanie, and I would be pleased to answer questions. Operator, please open the call to participants."

255132,130297376,120201,"Bemis Company, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2011",2011-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Amcor Flexibles North America Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone. This was a challenging quarter for Bemis, and we are disappointed to have missed the low end of our first quarter EPS guidance by $0.03. Our guidance for the first quarter incorporated our expectation of increasing raw material cos",1116,"Good morning, everyone. This was a challenging quarter for Bemis, and we are disappointed to have missed the low end of our first quarter EPS guidance by $0.03. Our guidance for the first quarter incorporated our expectation of increasing raw material costs for the first half of 2011. However, with the escalation of unrest in the Middle East and supply issues in the chemical industry, raw material costs increased dramatically during the first quarter, particularly the cost of the specialty resins Bemis relies on for our high barrier Flexible Packaging products. 
In our Flexible Packaging business segment, we use a variety of raw material inputs, including polyethylene, nylon, polyester, polypropylene and many others. Our customer contracts provide for us to adjust selling prices in response to raw material cost changes, but there is a time lag between the raw material cost changes and the scheduled selling price adjustments. Currently, the contract price adjustment lag times vary from one month to 6 months. However, the lag time for polyethylene-based packaging is shorter and will be longer for complex multilayer products that incorporate more specialty resins. 
During the first quarter of 2011, we experienced more dramatic raw material increases than we expected. The cost of polyethylene, polyester polypropylene and nylon increased in excess of 15% and even above 30%, in some cases. While most of this impact will be recognized during the second quarter, there was still a measurable impact on first quarter gross margins. 
At this point, we recognize the additional cost increases that we will be experiencing in the second quarter. Clearly, our selling prices will adjust to reflect these higher input costs, and we will continue to reduce material costs with material substitutions and efficiency improvements. We have well-established continuous improvement initiatives throughout Bemis that are focused on plant efficiencies, and I am confident these projects will continue to deliver value as we move forward. 
Looking out through the rest of the year, Flexible Packaging volumes are expected to be relatively flat with last year as our customers have begin to express some concern about the impact of food price inflation on consumer buying patterns. At Bemis, we expect to see volume growth throughout the year due to the pipeline of new products that we are introducing. Our rigid barrier platform, coupled with our Peel Reseal technology, is giving us new market access and expanding packaging formats in existing markets. Examples of some of these are creamer cups, frozen pizza and condiments. Bemis is gaining growth in these market categories because our products offer convenient features, reduce material content and extend shelf life.
Let me illustrate some examples of our innovation. Our new frozen pizza package eliminates the need for an outside carton, therefore, reducing packaging content by 30% compared to previous frozen pizza formats. The opportunity to use less material is critical to our customers' sustainability goals and helps control package costs in this environment of escalating raw material costs. This new package uses our polyester platform and incorporates our EZ Peel feature for consumer convenience. This is just one example of how Bemis is providing our customers with packaging solutions that deliver affordable sustainability benefits. Another example of our contributions to the sustainability needs of our customers is exhibited in the creamer cup business where our rigid barrier technology has reduced the material content by 20% and provides an improved barrier to extend product shelf life. 
Our Peel Reseal polyester platform continues to grow nicely as it eliminates the need for reclosable zipper. This package is primarily used for applications for processed meat and cheese, and we see customers using this cost-effective packaging upgrade to add consumer convenience features to their current product lines. 
Bemis has also introduced an innovative new condiment package that includes easy-open features, premium graphics and a design that offers both a dip format and a pour format. This new package is being launched in retail stores as well as restaurants. We are also pleased to see the continued growth of our technology and value-added platforms in the medical device and pharmaceutical markets. 
Our world-class manufacturing initiatives continue to expand the new production facilities and improve efficiencies throughout the production process. Raw material waste reduction programs have become even more important as the cost of resin has increased, and we expect continuous improvement through 2011.
In 2011, we are aggressively pursuing the second phase of the Food Americas integration. In this phase, we are optimizing our manufacturing processes to ensure that the right product is produced on the best equipment for that particular process. This exercise will improve margins by improving economies of scale on certain equipment and taking advantage of best practices across the company. In addition, we are evaluating situations in which multiple product specifications are used for one particular product or feature. Reducing specifications also reduces changeovers on equipment, increases economies of scale and simplifies the manufacturing process.
Streamlining of our product and manufacturing footprint, as we continue to integrate the Food Americas operations, has led to some additional expenses that total approximately $0.02 during the first quarter. We expect to see the positive benefit of these initiatives in the current year. 
Our earnings per share guidance of $2.15 to $2.30 for the total year 2011 reflects the reality of this volatile and inflationary environment. This range accounts for all of the known raw material cost increases through today. We are working diligently to execute our sales and profit growth strategy as quickly as possible and to take the opportunities to shorten the time selling price adjustments whenever possible. In this environment of specialty raw material cost increases and a cautious demand outlook resulting from food inflation, we believe our guidance reflects a realistic assessment for potential outcomes of 2011.
Our financial condition remains very strong. And while working capital absorbed cash during the first quarter due to higher resin cost, we continue to expect strong cash flow for the rest of the year. We purchased 1.7 million shares of common stock during the first quarter, and we'll continue to balance opportunities to invest in prudent capital projects, acquisitions, debt reduction and opportunistic share repurchases to maximize our return metrics and to increase shareholder value. 
In summary, expensive resin costs will pressure our margins in 2011. We expect this to be a short-term issue until we get contractual selling prices adjusted. We are progressing well on facility optimization, and new business is ramping up nicely. We expect our products that extend shelf life will become even more important as food costs increase giving us a competitive advantage in the market. 
Now I'll turn it over to Scott for a more detailed analysis of the financial results."

Although we are operating in a challenging raw material price environment, Bemis is in an advantageous position in the flexible packaging industry because of our new product platforms and pipeline. Our volume growth this year is coming from new products and product line extensions, which is why we are so focused, as an organization, around material science, chemical engineering and value-added customer relationships. Unfortunately, so far in 2011, our successes with new products have been overshadowed by the volatile and inflationary raw material costs we are experiencing. 
In the Flexible Packaging business segment, first quarter net sales increased by about 34%, of which about 22% is related to the fact that we have a full quarter of Food Americas in 2011 versus just one month in the first quarter of 2010; currency benefits increased sales by 2.5%; and the remaining 9.5% growth reflects the impact of higher raw material costs pushing up selling prices in all categories; in addition, the unit volume increases in categories where Bemis sells higher-priced value-added products. 
Mexico continues to deliver improved performance, and our business in Brazil is performing well, save for the strengthening real, which creates headwinds for our customers that export from Brazil. We're the largest flexible packaging company in Mexico and South America with nearly $1 billion in annualized sales. And our business in those regions continues to offer attractive long-term organic growth. We are also positioned to capture increased margins and returns as those food markets mature to require more and more high technology barrier packaging. 
On the other hand, our food Flexible Packaging business in Europe, now approximately 5% of Bemis sales, is subscale and is not meeting our margin objectives. While our Pressure Sensitive Materials and medical packaging businesses that sell into Europe are continuing to deliver nice results, our food Flexible Packaging business participates in a fragmented highly competitive arena. This will continue to be the case for the foreseeable future. 
Our focus is European food Flexible Packaging, continuous improvement in manufacturing operations along with volume and margin growth in the niche, meat and cheese markets we serve. The good news is that these European sales, which we're decreasing for most of 2010, stabilized in the first quarter of 2011 compared to the first quarter of last year.
Flexible Packaging operating profit for the first quarter was 9.9% of net sales. If we adjust last year's operating profit to exclude acquisition-related fees and include pro forma Food Americas results for January and February, the comparable rate would've been about 11% for the first quarter of 2010. The difference in year-over-year percentage margin reflects raw material headwinds. 
Second quarter Flexible Packaging margins will remain under pressure as the dramatic price increases from the first quarter move through our production cycle from raw materials to finished goods, but we do expect the second half of the year to return to higher margin levels if specialty resin costs stabilize, which is the assumption our EPS guidance reflects.
One of our company priorities is to increase the frequency of selling price adjustments in our customer agreements. A number of the customer agreements we inherited with the Food Americas acquisition specified 6-month periods before selling prices reset to reflect changes in raw material costs. This compares to most of our U.S. Bemis Flexible Packaging customer agreements, which generally adjust selling prices to reflect material cost changes every 30 to 90 days. Going forward, we will be working with our customers to shorten the periods between selling price adjustments.
Shifting to our Pressure Sensitive Materials segment, which represented about 11% of sales this quarter. Net sales increased $4 million, and operating profit increased $3 million. Operating profit for the Pressure Sensitive Materials segment trended in the right direction this quarter due to a combination of prudent cost management and good matching on selling prices with raw material cost increases. 
On a consolidated basis, our selling, general and administrative expenses increased sequentially over the fourth quarter, largely reflecting the amortization of losses in our pension investments when the markets declined sharply in 2008. EBITDA for the first quarter increased by almost 20% compared to adjusted EBITDA for the same quarter of 2010, excluding all of the onetime acquisition-related charges from last year. This would have driven a healthy increase in cash flow from operations this quarter but raw material cost increases resulted in much higher working capital, offsetting any cash flow improvements. Consistent with past years, we expect cash flow from operations to strengthen for the remainder of the year. 
For the total year 2011, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $150 million. Bemis capital investments in materials science research and development is directed at 2 areas: one, product categories that offer higher long-term volume growth and margins, like semi-rigid packaging, packaging that protects food freshness and extends shelf life, as well as medical packaging products that require high barrier film properties. New products and targeted product line extensions will continue to be a key to our Flexible Packaging volume growth. And the second priority for CapEx is to fuel growth in geographies outside the U.S. and Europe, where we can achieve attractive organic growth rates across our product portfolios. These disciplined capital investments continue to be our first priority for use of cash flow after dividends. 
Our next priority for use of cash flow is to make selected acquisitions when we have opportunities to purchase businesses that fit our strategic and financial objectives. Finally, we will manage our capital structure to give us the flexibility we need to fund growth investments while minimizing our cost of capital. Translation, we want to preserve our investment grade rating while reducing our shares outstanding through opportunistic open market repurchases. 
We repurchased 1.7 million shares of common stock during the first quarter, resulting in average diluted shares outstanding of $109.1 million for the earnings per share calculation for the quarter. We reported on our cash flow statement a $16 million payment for acquisitions during the first quarter that relates to a final working capital adjustment payment to Rio Tinto, primarily related to cash on hand we received at the close of the Food Americas acquisition a year ago.
We continue to pursue a tender offer for the outstanding preferred shares of our Brazilian subsidiary. The purchase of those shares is not reflected in our guidance since we could not predict the timing or certainty of the completion of that transaction. If and when we receive regulatory approval to resume the tender offer, we will move as quickly as possible to complete the transaction. 
Our guidance for the second quarter of 2011 is $0.48 to $0.54. This reflects the 15% to 30% cost increases in specialty resins that will be recognized during the second quarter with many of the related customer selling price adjustments occurring late in the second and early in the third quarters. The reduced earnings per share expectations for the first half of the year have been incorporated into the total year earnings per share guidance of $2.15 to $2.30. As Henry mentioned, the change reflects these dramatic increases in specialty resins costs, which tend to have longer lag times for selling price adjustments, some further raw material cost increases in the second quarter and then no further increases for the second half of the year.
Now Henry, Melanie, and I would be pleased to answer questions. Operator, please open the call to participants."

255132,130297376,120356,"Bemis Company, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2011",2011-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Amcor Flexibles North America Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone. This was a challenging quarter for Bemis, and we are disappointed to have missed the low end of our first quarter EPS guidance by $0.03. Our guidance for the first quarter incorporated our expectation of increasing raw material cos",1116,"Good morning, everyone. This was a challenging quarter for Bemis, and we are disappointed to have missed the low end of our first quarter EPS guidance by $0.03. Our guidance for the first quarter incorporated our expectation of increasing raw material costs for the first half of 2011. However, with the escalation of unrest in the Middle East and supply issues in the chemical industry, raw material costs increased dramatically during the first quarter, particularly the cost of the specialty resins Bemis relies on for our high barrier Flexible Packaging products. 
In our Flexible Packaging business segment, we use a variety of raw material inputs, including polyethylene, nylon, polyester, polypropylene and many others. Our customer contracts provide for us to adjust selling prices in response to raw material cost changes, but there is a time lag between the raw material cost changes and the scheduled selling price adjustments. Currently, the contract price adjustment lag times vary from one month to 6 months. However, the lag time for polyethylene-based packaging is shorter and will be longer for complex multilayer products that incorporate more specialty resins. 
During the first quarter of 2011, we experienced more dramatic raw material increases than we expected. The cost of polyethylene, polyester polypropylene and nylon increased in excess of 15% and even above 30%, in some cases. While most of this impact will be recognized during the second quarter, there was still a measurable impact on first quarter gross margins. 
At this point, we recognize the additional cost increases that we will be experiencing in the second quarter. Clearly, our selling prices will adjust to reflect these higher input costs, and we will continue to reduce material costs with material substitutions and efficiency improvements. We have well-established continuous improvement initiatives throughout Bemis that are focused on plant efficiencies, and I am confident these projects will continue to deliver value as we move forward. 
Looking out through the rest of the year, Flexible Packaging volumes are expected to be relatively flat with last year as our customers have begin to express some concern about the impact of food price inflation on consumer buying patterns. At Bemis, we expect to see volume growth throughout the year due to the pipeline of new products that we are introducing. Our rigid barrier platform, coupled with our Peel Reseal technology, is giving us new market access and expanding packaging formats in existing markets. Examples of some of these are creamer cups, frozen pizza and condiments. Bemis is gaining growth in these market categories because our products offer convenient features, reduce material content and extend shelf life.
Let me illustrate some examples of our innovation. Our new frozen pizza package eliminates the need for an outside carton, therefore, reducing packaging content by 30% compared to previous frozen pizza formats. The opportunity to use less material is critical to our customers' sustainability goals and helps control package costs in this environment of escalating raw material costs. This new package uses our polyester platform and incorporates our EZ Peel feature for consumer convenience. This is just one example of how Bemis is providing our customers with packaging solutions that deliver affordable sustainability benefits. Another example of our contributions to the sustainability needs of our customers is exhibited in the creamer cup business where our rigid barrier technology has reduced the material content by 20% and provides an improved barrier to extend product shelf life. 
Our Peel Reseal polyester platform continues to grow nicely as it eliminates the need for reclosable zipper. This package is primarily used for applications for processed meat and cheese, and we see customers using this cost-effective packaging upgrade to add consumer convenience features to their current product lines. 
Bemis has also introduced an innovative new condiment package that includes easy-open features, premium graphics and a design that offers both a dip format and a pour format. This new package is being launched in retail stores as well as restaurants. We are also pleased to see the continued growth of our technology and value-added platforms in the medical device and pharmaceutical markets. 
Our world-class manufacturing initiatives continue to expand the new production facilities and improve efficiencies throughout the production process. Raw material waste reduction programs have become even more important as the cost of resin has increased, and we expect continuous improvement through 2011.
In 2011, we are aggressively pursuing the second phase of the Food Americas integration. In this phase, we are optimizing our manufacturing processes to ensure that the right product is produced on the best equipment for that particular process. This exercise will improve margins by improving economies of scale on certain equipment and taking advantage of best practices across the company. In addition, we are evaluating situations in which multiple product specifications are used for one particular product or feature. Reducing specifications also reduces changeovers on equipment, increases economies of scale and simplifies the manufacturing process.
Streamlining of our product and manufacturing footprint, as we continue to integrate the Food Americas operations, has led to some additional expenses that total approximately $0.02 during the first quarter. We expect to see the positive benefit of these initiatives in the current year. 
Our earnings per share guidance of $2.15 to $2.30 for the total year 2011 reflects the reality of this volatile and inflationary environment. This range accounts for all of the known raw material cost increases through today. We are working diligently to execute our sales and profit growth strategy as quickly as possible and to take the opportunities to shorten the time selling price adjustments whenever possible. In this environment of specialty raw material cost increases and a cautious demand outlook resulting from food inflation, we believe our guidance reflects a realistic assessment for potential outcomes of 2011.
Our financial condition remains very strong. And while working capital absorbed cash during the first quarter due to higher resin cost, we continue to expect strong cash flow for the rest of the year. We purchased 1.7 million shares of common stock during the first quarter, and we'll continue to balance opportunities to invest in prudent capital projects, acquisitions, debt reduction and opportunistic share repurchases to maximize our return metrics and to increase shareholder value. 
In summary, expensive resin costs will pressure our margins in 2011. We expect this to be a short-term issue until we get contractual selling prices adjusted. We are progressing well on facility optimization, and new business is ramping up nicely. We expect our products that extend shelf life will become even more important as food costs increase giving us a competitive advantage in the market. 
Now I'll turn it over to Scott for a more detailed analysis of the financial results."

Our volume growth this year is coming f",1244,"Thank you, Henry. Although we are operating in a challenging raw material price environment, Bemis is in an advantageous position in the flexible packaging industry because of our new product platforms and pipeline. Our volume growth this year is coming from new products and product line extensions, which is why we are so focused, as an organization, around material science, chemical engineering and value-added customer relationships. Unfortunately, so far in 2011, our successes with new products have been overshadowed by the volatile and inflationary raw material costs we are experiencing. 
In the Flexible Packaging business segment, first quarter net sales increased by about 34%, of which about 22% is related to the fact that we have a full quarter of Food Americas in 2011 versus just one month in the first quarter of 2010; currency benefits increased sales by 2.5%; and the remaining 9.5% growth reflects the impact of higher raw material costs pushing up selling prices in all categories; in addition, the unit volume increases in categories where Bemis sells higher-priced value-added products. 
Mexico continues to deliver improved performance, and our business in Brazil is performing well, save for the strengthening real, which creates headwinds for our customers that export from Brazil. We're the largest flexible packaging company in Mexico and South America with nearly $1 billion in annualized sales. And our business in those regions continues to offer attractive long-term organic growth. We are also positioned to capture increased margins and returns as those food markets mature to require more and more high technology barrier packaging. 
On the other hand, our food Flexible Packaging business in Europe, now approximately 5% of Bemis sales, is subscale and is not meeting our margin objectives. While our Pressure Sensitive Materials and medical packaging businesses that sell into Europe are continuing to deliver nice results, our food Flexible Packaging business participates in a fragmented highly competitive arena. This will continue to be the case for the foreseeable future. 
Our focus is European food Flexible Packaging, continuous improvement in manufacturing operations along with volume and margin growth in the niche, meat and cheese markets we serve. The good news is that these European sales, which we're decreasing for most of 2010, stabilized in the first quarter of 2011 compared to the first quarter of last year.
Flexible Packaging operating profit for the first quarter was 9.9% of net sales. If we adjust last year's operating profit to exclude acquisition-related fees and include pro forma Food Americas results for January and February, the comparable rate would've been about 11% for the first quarter of 2010. The difference in year-over-year percentage margin reflects raw material headwinds. 
Second quarter Flexible Packaging margins will remain under pressure as the dramatic price increases from the first quarter move through our production cycle from raw materials to finished goods, but we do expect the second half of the year to return to higher margin levels if specialty resin costs stabilize, which is the assumption our EPS guidance reflects.
One of our company priorities is to increase the frequency of selling price adjustments in our customer agreements. A number of the customer agreements we inherited with the Food Americas acquisition specified 6-month periods before selling prices reset to reflect changes in raw material costs. This compares to most of our U.S. Bemis Flexible Packaging customer agreements, which generally adjust selling prices to reflect material cost changes every 30 to 90 days. Going forward, we will be working with our customers to shorten the periods between selling price adjustments.
Shifting to our Pressure Sensitive Materials segment, which represented about 11% of sales this quarter. Net sales increased $4 million, and operating profit increased $3 million. Operating profit for the Pressure Sensitive Materials segment trended in the right direction this quarter due to a combination of prudent cost management and good matching on selling prices with raw material cost increases. 
On a consolidated basis, our selling, general and administrative expenses increased sequentially over the fourth quarter, largely reflecting the amortization of losses in our pension investments when the markets declined sharply in 2008. EBITDA for the first quarter increased by almost 20% compared to adjusted EBITDA for the same quarter of 2010, excluding all of the onetime acquisition-related charges from last year. This would have driven a healthy increase in cash flow from operations this quarter but raw material cost increases resulted in much higher working capital, offsetting any cash flow improvements. Consistent with past years, we expect cash flow from operations to strengthen for the remainder of the year. 
For the total year 2011, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $150 million. Bemis capital investments in materials science research and development is directed at 2 areas: one, product categories that offer higher long-term volume growth and margins, like semi-rigid packaging, packaging that protects food freshness and extends shelf life, as well as medical packaging products that require high barrier film properties. New products and targeted product line extensions will continue to be a key to our Flexible Packaging volume growth. And the second priority for CapEx is to fuel growth in geographies outside the U.S. and Europe, where we can achieve attractive organic growth rates across our product portfolios. These disciplined capital investments continue to be our first priority for use of cash flow after dividends. 
Our next priority for use of cash flow is to make selected acquisitions when we have opportunities to purchase businesses that fit our strategic and financial objectives. Finally, we will manage our capital structure to give us the flexibility we need to fund growth investments while minimizing our cost of capital. Translation, we want to preserve our investment grade rating while reducing our shares outstanding through opportunistic open market repurchases. 
We repurchased 1.7 million shares of common stock during the first quarter, resulting in average diluted shares outstanding of $109.1 million for the earnings per share calculation for the quarter. We reported on our cash flow statement a $16 million payment for acquisitions during the first quarter that relates to a final working capital adjustment payment to Rio Tinto, primarily related to cash on hand we received at the close of the Food Americas acquisition a year ago.
We continue to pursue a tender offer for the outstanding preferred shares of our Brazilian subsidiary. The purchase of those shares is not reflected in our guidance since we could not predict the timing or certainty of the completion of that transaction. If and when we receive regulatory approval to resume the tender offer, we will move as quickly as possible to complete the transaction. 
Our guidance for the second quarter of 2011 is $0.48 to $0.54. This reflects the 15% to 30% cost increases in specialty resins that will be recognized during the second quarter with many of the related customer selling price adjustments occurring late in the second and early in the third quarters. The reduced earnings per share expectations for the first half of the year have been incorporated into the total year earnings per share guidance of $2.15 to $2.30. As Henry mentioned, the change reflects these dramatic increases in specialty resins costs, which tend to have longer lag times for selling price adjustments, some further raw material cost increases in the second quarter and then no further increases for the second half of the year.
Now Henry, Melanie, and I would be pleased to answer questions. Operator, please open the call to participants."

The interesting thing is that the store brand customers, the private label manufacturers want the same types of convenience features and quality graphics properties and, of course, all the food protection requirements as branded food manufacturers want. And so we like the private label customers just as well as we like our traditional branded customers."

255132,130297376,133871,"Bemis Company, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2011",2011-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Amcor Flexibles North America Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone. This was a challenging quarter for Bemis, and we are disappointed to have missed the low end of our first quarter EPS guidance by $0.03. Our guidance for the first quarter incorporated our expectation of increasing raw material cos",1115,"Good morning, everyone. This was a challenging quarter for Bemis, and we are disappointed to have missed the low end of our first quarter EPS guidance by $0.03. Our guidance for the first quarter incorporated our expectation of increasing raw material costs for the first half of 2011. However, with the escalation of unrest in the Middle East and supply issues in the chemical industry, raw material costs increased dramatically during the first quarter, particularly the cost of the specialty resins Bemis relies on for our high barrier Flexible Packaging products. 
In our Flexible Packaging business segment, we use a variety of raw material inputs, including polyethylene, nylon, polyester, polypropylene and many others. Our customer contracts provide for us to adjust selling prices in response to raw material cost changes, but there is a time lag between the raw material cost changes and the scheduled selling price adjustments. Currently, the contract price adjustment lag times vary from one month to 6 months. However, the lag time for polyethylene-based packaging is shorter and will be longer for complex multilayer products that incorporate more specialty resins. 
During the first quarter of 2011, we experienced more dramatic raw material increases than we expected. The cost of polyethylene, polyester polypropylene and nylon increased in excess of 15% and even above 30%, in some cases. While most of this impact will be recognized during the second quarter, there was still a measurable impact on first quarter gross margins. 
At this point, we recognize the additional cost increases that we will be experiencing in the second quarter. Clearly, our selling prices will adjust to reflect these higher input costs, and we will continue to reduce material costs with material substitutions and efficiency improvements. We have well-established continuous improvement initiatives throughout Bemis that are focused on plant efficiencies, and I am confident these projects will continue to deliver value as we move forward. 
Looking out through the rest of the year, Flexible Packaging volumes are expected to be relatively flat with last year as our customers have began to express some concern about the impact of food price inflation on consumer buying patterns. At Bemis, we expect to see volume growth throughout the year due to the pipeline of new products that we are introducing. Our rigid barrier platform, coupled with our Peel Reseal technology, is giving us new market access and expanding packaging formats in existing markets. Examples of some of these are creamer cups, frozen pizza and condiments. Bemis is gaining growth in these market categories because our products offer convenient features, reduce material content and extend shelf life.
Let me illustrate some examples of our innovation. Our new frozen pizza package eliminates the need for an outside carton, therefore, reducing packaging content by 30% compared to previous frozen pizza formats. The opportunity to use less material is critical to our customers' sustainability goals and helps control package costs in this environment of escalating raw material costs. This new package uses our polyester platform and incorporates our EZ Peel feature for consumer convenience. This is just one example of how Bemis is providing our customers with packaging solutions that deliver affordable sustainability benefits. Another example of our contributions to the sustainability needs of our customers is exhibited in the creamer cup business where our rigid barrier technology has reduced the material content by 20% and provides an improved barrier to extend product shelf life. 
Our Peel Reseal polyester platform continues to grow nicely as it eliminates the need for reclosable zipper. This package is primarily used for applications for processed meat and cheese, and we see customers using this cost-effective packaging upgrade to add consumer convenience features to their current product lines. 
Bemis has also introduced an innovative new condiment package that includes easy-open features, premium graphics and a design that offers both a dip format and a pour format. This new package is being launched in retail stores as well as restaurants. We are also pleased to see the continued growth of our technology and value-added platforms in the medical device and pharmaceutical markets. 
Our world-class manufacturing initiatives continue to expand the new production facilities and improve efficiencies throughout the production process. Raw material waste reduction programs have become even more important as the cost of resin has increased, and we expect continuous improvement through 2011.
In 2011, we are aggressively pursuing the second phase of the Food Americas integration. In this phase, we are optimizing our manufacturing processes to ensure that the right product is produced on the best equipment for that particular process. This exercise will improve margins by improving economies of scale on certain equipment and taking advantage of best practices across the company. In addition, we are evaluating situations in which multiple product specifications are used for one particular product or feature. Reducing specifications also reduces changeovers on equipment, increases economies of scale and simplifies the manufacturing process.
Streamlining of our product and manufacturing footprint, as we continue to integrate the Food Americas operations, has led to some additional expenses that total approximately $0.02 during the first quarter. We expect to see the positive benefit of these initiatives in the current year. 
Our earnings per share guidance of $2.15 to $2.30 for the total year 2011 reflects the reality of this volatile and inflationary environment. This range accounts for all of the known raw material cost increases through today. We are working diligently to execute our sales and profit growth strategy as quickly as possible and to take the opportunities to shorten the time selling price adjustments whenever possible. In this environment of specialty raw material cost increases and a cautious demand outlook resulting from food inflation, we believe our guidance reflects a realistic assessment for potential outcomes of 2011.
Our financial condition remains very strong. And while working capital absorbed cash during the first quarter due to higher resin cost, we continue to expect strong cash flow for the rest of the year. We purchased 1.7 million shares of common stock during the first quarter, and we'll continue to balance opportunities to invest in prudent capital projects, acquisitions, debt reduction and opportunistic share repurchases to maximize our return metrics and increase shareholder value. 
In summary, expensive resin costs will pressure our margins in 2011. We expect this to be a short-term issue until we get contractual selling prices adjusted. We are progressing well on facility optimization, and new business is ramping up nicely. We expect our products that extend shelf life will become even more important as food costs increase, giving us a competitive advantage in the market. 
Now I'll turn it over to Scott for a more detailed analysis of the financial results."
255132,130297376,133871,"Bemis Company, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2011",2011-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Amcor Flexibles North America Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Henry.

Our volume growth this year is coming f",1243,"Thank you, Henry. Although we are operating in a challenging raw material price environment, Bemis is in an advantageous position in the flexible packaging industry because of our new product platforms and pipeline. Our volume growth this year is coming from new products and product line extensions, which is why we are so focused, as an organization, around material science, chemical engineering and value-added customer relationships. Unfortunately, so far in 2011, our successes with new products have been overshadowed by the volatile and inflationary raw material costs we are experiencing. 
In the Flexible Packaging business segment, first quarter net sales increased by about 34%, of which about 22% related to the fact that we have a full quarter of Food Americas in 2011 versus just one month in the first quarter of 2010; currency benefits increased sales by 2.5%; and the remaining 9.5% growth reflects the impact of higher raw material costs pushing up selling prices in all categories, in addition to unit volume increases in categories where Bemis sells higher-priced value-added products. 
Mexico continues to deliver improved performance, and our business in Brazil is performing well, save for the strengthening reais, which creates headwinds for our customers that export from Brazil. We're the largest flexible packaging company in Mexico and South America with nearly $1 billion in annualized sales. And our business in those regions continues to offer attractive long-term organic growth. We are also positioned to capture increased margins and returns as those food markets mature to require more and more high technology barrier packaging. 
On the other hand, our food Flexible Packaging business in Europe, now approximately 5% of Bemis sales, is subscale and is not meeting our margin objectives. While our Pressure Sensitive Materials and medical packaging businesses that sell into Europe are continuing to deliver nice results, our food Flexible Packaging business participates in a fragmented, highly competitive arena. This will continue to be the case for the foreseeable future. 
Our focus is European food Flexible Packaging, continuous improvement in manufacturing operations along with volume and margin growth in the niche, meat and cheese markets we serve. The good news is that these European sales, which were decreasing for most of 2010, stabilized in the first quarter of 2011 compared to the first quarter of last year.
Flexible Packaging operating profit for the first quarter was 9.9% of net sales. If we adjust last year's operating profit to exclude acquisition-related fees and include pro forma Food Americas results for January and February, the comparable rate would've been about 11% for the first quarter of 2010. The difference in year-over-year percentage margin reflects raw material headwinds. 
Second quarter Flexible Packaging margins will remain under pressure as the dramatic price increases from the first quarter move through our production cycle from raw materials to finished goods, but we do expect the second half of the year to return to higher margin levels if specialty resin costs stabilize, which is the assumption our EPS guidance reflects.
One of our company priorities is to increase the frequency of selling price adjustments in our customer agreements. A number of the customer agreements we inherited with the Food Americas acquisition specified 6-month periods before selling prices reset to reflect changes in raw material costs. This compares to most of our U.S. Bemis Flexible Packaging customer agreements, which generally adjust selling prices to reflect material cost changes every 30 to 90 days. Going forward, we will be working with our customers to shorten the periods between selling price adjustments.
Shifting to our Pressure Sensitive Materials segment, which represented about 11% of sales this quarter. Net sales increased $4 million, and operating profit increased $3 million. Operating profit for the Pressure Sensitive Materials segment trended in the right direction this quarter due to a combination of prudent cost management and good matching on selling prices with raw material cost increases. 
On a consolidated basis, our selling, general and administrative expenses increased sequentially over the fourth quarter, largely reflecting the amortization of losses in our pension investments when the markets declined sharply in 2008. EBITDA for the first quarter increased by almost 20% compared to adjusted EBITDA for the same quarter of 2010, excluding all of the onetime acquisition-related charges from last year. This would have driven a healthy increase in cash flow from operations this quarter but raw material cost increases resulted in much higher working capital, offsetting any cash flow improvements. Consistent with past years, we expect cash flow from operations to strengthen for the remainder of the year. 
For the total year 2011, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $150 million. Bemis capital investments in materials science research and development is directed at 2 areas: one, product categories that offer higher long-term volume growth and margins, like semi-rigid packaging, packaging that protects food freshness and extends shelf life, as well as medical packaging products that require high barrier film properties. New products and targeted product line extensions will continue to be a key to our Flexible Packaging volume growth. And the second priority for CapEx is to fuel growth in geographies outside the U.S. and Europe, where we can achieve attractive organic growth rates across our product portfolios. These disciplined capital investments continue to be our first priority for use of cash flow after dividends. 
Our next priority for use of cash flow is to make selected acquisitions when we have opportunities to purchase businesses that fit our strategic and financial objectives. Finally, we will manage our capital structure to give us the flexibility we need to fund growth investments while minimizing our cost of capital. Translation, we want to preserve our investment grade rating while reducing our shares outstanding through opportunistic open market repurchases. 
We repurchased 1.7 million shares of common stock during the first quarter, resulting in average diluted shares outstanding of $109.1 million for the earnings per share calculation for the quarter. We reported on our cash flow statement a $16 million payment for acquisitions during the first quarter that relates to a final working capital adjustment payment to Rio Tinto, primarily related to cash on hand we received at the close of the Food Americas acquisition a year ago.
We continue to pursue a tender offer for the outstanding preferred shares of our Brazilian subsidiary. The purchase of those shares is not reflected in our guidance since we could not predict the timing or certainty of the completion of that transaction. If and when we receive regulatory approval to resume the tender offer, we will move as quickly as possible to complete the transaction. 
Our guidance for the second quarter of 2011 is $0.48 to $0.54. This reflects the 15% to 30% cost increases in specialty resins that will be recognized during the second quarter with many of the related customer selling price adjustments occurring late in the second and early in the third quarters. The reduced earnings per share expectations for the first half of the year have been incorporated into the total year earnings per share guidance of $2.15 to $2.30. As Henry mentioned, the change reflects these dramatic increases in specialty resins costs, which tend to have longer lag times for selling price adjustments, some further raw material cost increases in the second quarter and then no further increases for the second half of the year.
Now Henry, Melanie, and I would be pleased to answer questions. Operator, please open the call to participants."

Before I get into the details of our business initiatives and expectations for the rest of the year, I'd first like to update you on the challenges that our industry is facing in 2011. Since Oc",629,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before I get into the details of our business initiatives and expectations for the rest of the year, I'd first like to update you on the challenges that our industry is facing in 2011. 
Since October of 2010, we have experienced steady increases of raw material cost, especially resin and film used for our packaging business, including steep increases in Specialty Materials in the months of February and, again, in May. At this point, it appears that the momentum of deals broad raw material cost increases have subsided as costs have been fairly stable in June and July. 
Our business model is designed to meet this type of challenge by responding in a scheduled way with selling price adjustments that offset the dollar impact of the raw material cost increases. As we have explained in the past, there is a time lag for selling prices to be adjusted to incorporate cost increases, and we expect all of our adjustments to be in place on or before the start of the fourth quarter. 
The second challenge that our industry is facing is a threat of lower consumer demand for products that use our packaging. This is not related to the increase in our raw material cost but more directly is related to inflation in the cost of food ingredients. Food ingredients compromise a much larger proportion of the retail cost of our product than our packaging does, and with meaningful price increases facing retail consumers, our customers have publicly expressed concern about potential impact on demand for their products.
At Bemis, our North American volumes were healthy in the first quarter and about average overall for the second quarter with some softening late in the second quarter. In light of the commentary from our customers, we are expecting volumes for the second half of 2011 to be a few percent lower than the comparable volume for 2010. 
In Brazil, our rigid packaging operations have been dealing with substantial volatility in the cost of polypropylene, their main raw material, which is affecting our profit margins. In Mexico, we trimmed our volumes in 2010 to restore the region to profitability. As a result, while volumes are considerably lower this year compared to last year, the business is now profitable compared to last year when it was operating at a loss. We continued to be pleased with the progress and performance of our operations in Mexico and look forward to its continued growth in both sales and profit margins.
Our European operations continue to face challenges of their very competitive environment with renewed focus on World Class Manufacturing initiatives and sales strategies that prioritize niche projects. In total, we expect raw material prices to stabilize while selling prices continue to rise as pricing agreements adjust in the third quarter. In this challenging environment, which we expect to continue through the rest of the year, we are aggressively managing costs and accelerating opportunities to improve. We continue to transition production to optimum facilities and take cost out of our processes to maintain momentum and continuous improvement efforts. We have accelerated our World Class Manufacturing efforts and we are aggressively passing through raw material cost escalation to our customers. 
Outside the current operations, we continue to look for opportunities to expand our reach around the world and apply our technological expertise to products in other markets. We continue to see our largest growth opportunities in growing economies like Brazil and Asia in the growing markets like medical and pharmaceutical. This year's environment is a challenging one, but our diligent focus on process efficiency, customer service and cost control has prepared our business well for the future. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Scott."
255132,138134601,146977,"Bemis Company, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2011",2011-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Amcor Flexibles North America Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Henry. Today, I'll begin by focusing my comments on a review of the quarterly results and then review the assumptions used in our guidance for the rest of the year. Second quarter earnings per share were $0.51, in line with our guidance for the qu",743,"Thanks, Henry. Today, I'll begin by focusing my comments on a review of the quarterly results and then review the assumptions used in our guidance for the rest of the year. Second quarter earnings per share were $0.51, in line with our guidance for the quarter. This compares to last year's earnings, excluding special charges, of $0.58. The decrease in EPS compared to last year reflects higher raw material costs that were not get reflected in higher selling prices to customers. 
Net sales increased about 8% from the second quarter of 2010. Currency provided an increase of about 3.4%, driven by strengthening of the rial, euro and pound sterling versus the dollar. The remaining increase was generated by selling price increases on roughly flat volumes. 
In flexible packaging, overall volumes were also roughly flat. Volumes weakened in Latin America quarter-over-quarter, driven by several factors. Volatility in the price of polypropylene resin used for our rigid packaging operations in Latin America has increased competitive pressures and reduced operating margins in this category. While this volume may be restored in the future, as these factors change, we do not expect them to turn around during the second half of 2011. 
Separately, we purposely trimmed low-margin business to Mexico during the second half of 2010 in order to improve profitability, which was successful. So year-over-year second quarter volumes were lower. In addition, the strengthening real puts pressure on our customers exports from Brazil. Finally, the inflationary economic conditions in Argentina have not been favorable for our business in that region. 
Continuing through the income statement, consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 17.1 in the second quarter. We expect this to be the low point in 2011 as selling price increases boost gross margins during the second half of the year. 
Looking at flexible packaging operating profit, we reported $116 million or 9.5% of sales in the current quarter of 2011 compared to $130 million or 11.5% of sales in the same quarter of last year after addbacks of special charges. The decrease in 2011 primarily reflects the impact of increased raw material costs and advance of selling price adjustments. As we head into the second half of 2011, we expect operating margins to improve as selling prices are adjusted higher to reflect the raw material cost increases we experienced during the first half. We have implemented selling price increases in our flexible packaging and pressure sensitive businesses to reflect these higher raw material costs.
We reported cash flow from operations of $91 million for the second quarter. This was a substantial improvement from $8 million use of cash we reported during the first quarter. Working capital contributed slightly to cash flow during the second quarter in spite of the continuing raw material cost increases. The largest use of cash for operating activities was a pension contribution made in April totaling $15 million. No other contributions are planned for 2011.
Based on capital expenditures we have completed to date this year and our CapEx scheduled for the second half of the year, capital expenditures will likely total approximately $125 million in 2011. This is lower than our original guidance for the year of approximately $150 million. 
During the first 6 months of 2011, we repurchased a total of 3.8 million shares of our common stock for $123 million. Future share repurchases will be evaluated among other priorities for cash flow, including dividends and acquisitions. 
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, on July 8, we completed the tender offer for the outstanding preferred shares of our South American subsidiary, which were publicly traded. On July 22, the preferred shares of Dixie Toga were delisted from the Brazilian Stock Exchange. The total purchase price was approximately $90 million, and there will no longer be a reduction in our income associated with noncontrolling interest.
Now looking at our guidance for the remainder of the year, resin prices stabilized in June and our guidance assumes that they remain generally flat on average for the rest of 2011. Our selling prices are increasing to reflect this year's earlier raw material inflation and the net effect will be improving income margins in the second half of this year.

Before I get into the details of our business initiatives and expectations for the rest of the year, I'd first like to update you on the challenges that our industry is facing in 2011. Since Oc",631,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before I get into the details of our business initiatives and expectations for the rest of the year, I'd first like to update you on the challenges that our industry is facing in 2011. 
Since October of 2010, we have experienced steady increases of raw material cost, especially resin and film used for our packaging business, including steep increases in Specialty Materials in the months of February and, again, in May. At this point, it appears that the momentum of U.S. broad raw material cost increases have subsided as costs have been fairly stable in June and July. 
Our business model is designed to meet this type of challenge by responding in a scheduled way, with selling price adjustments that offset the dollar impact of the raw material cost increases. As we have explained in the past, there is a time lag for selling prices to be adjusted to incorporate the cost increases, and we expect all of our adjustments to be in place on or before the start of the fourth quarter. 
The second challenge that our industry is facing is a threat of lower consumer demand for products that use our packaging. This is not related to the increase in our raw material cost but more directly is related to inflation in the cost of food ingredients. Food ingredients compromise a much larger proportion of the retail cost of our product than our packaging does. And with meaningful price increases facing retail consumers, our customers have publicly expressed concern about potential impact on demand for their products.
At Bemis, our North American volumes were healthy in the first quarter and above average overall for the second quarter with some softening late in the second quarter. In light of the commentary from our customers, we are expecting volumes for the second half of 2011 to be a few percent lower than the comparable volume for 2010. 
In Brazil, our rigid packaging operations have been dealing with substantial volatility in the cost of polypropylene, their main raw material, which is affecting our profit margins. In Mexico, we trimmed our volumes in 2010 to restore the region to profitability. As a result, while volumes are considerably lower this year compared to last year, the business is now profitable compared to last year when it was operating at a loss. We continue to be pleased with the progress and performance of our operations in Mexico and look forward to its continued growth in both sales and profit margins.
Our European operations continue to meet the challenges of their very competitive environment, with renewed focus on World Class Manufacturing initiatives and sales strategies that prioritize niche projects. In total, we expect raw material prices to stabilize while selling prices continue to rise as pricing agreements adjust in the third quarter. In this challenging environment, which we expect to continue through the rest of the year, we are aggressively managing costs and accelerating opportunities to improve. We continue to transition production to optimum facilities and take cost out of our processes to maintain momentum and continuous improvement efforts. We have accelerated our World Class Manufacturing efforts, and we are aggressively passing through raw material cost escalation to our customers. 
Outside our current operations, we continue to look for opportunities to expand our reach around the globe and apply our technological expertise to products in other markets. We continue to see our largest growth opportunities in growing economies like Brazil and Asia in the growing markets like medical and pharmaceutical. This year's environment is a challenging one, but our diligent focus on process efficiency, customer service and cost control has prepared our business well for the future. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Scott."

Today, I'll begin by focusing my comments on a review of the quarterly results, and then review the assumptions used in our guidance for the rest of the year. Second quarter earnings per share were $0.51, in line with our guidance for the q",744,"Thanks, Henry. Today, I'll begin by focusing my comments on a review of the quarterly results, and then review the assumptions used in our guidance for the rest of the year. Second quarter earnings per share were $0.51, in line with our guidance for the quarter. This compares to last year's earnings, excluding special charges of $0.58. The decrease in EPS compared to last year reflects higher raw material costs that were not yet reflected in higher selling prices to customers. 
Net sales increased about 8% from the second quarter of 2010. Currency provided an increase of about 3.4%, driven by strengthening of the real, euro and pound sterling versus the dollar. The remaining increase was generated by selling price increases on roughly flat volumes. 
In flexible packaging, overall volumes were also roughly flat. Volumes weakened in Latin America quarter-over-quarter, driven by several factors. Volatility in the price of polypropylene resin used for our rigid packaging operations in Latin America has increased competitive pressures and reduced operating margins in this category. While this volume may be restored in the future, as these factors change, we do not expect them to turn around during the second half of 2011. 
Separately, we purposely trimmed low-margin business in Mexico during the second half of 2010 in order to improve profitability which was successful. So year-over-year second quarter volumes were lower. In addition, the strengthening real puts pressure on our customers' exports from Brazil. Finally, the inflationary economic conditions in Argentina have not been favorable for our business in that region. 
Continuing through the income statement, consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 17.1 in the second quarter. We expect this to be the low point in 2011 as selling price increases boost gross margins during the second half of the year. 
Looking at flexible packaging operating profit, we reported $116 million or 9.5% of sales in the current quarter of 2011 compared to $130 million or 11.5% of sales in the same quarter of last year after addbacks of special charges. The decrease in 2011 primarily reflects the impact of increased raw material costs in advance of selling price adjustments. As we head into the second half of 2011, we expect operating margins to improve as selling prices are adjusted higher to reflect the raw material cost increases we experienced during the first half. We have implemented selling price increases in our flexible packaging and pressure sensitive businesses to reflect these higher raw material costs.
We reported cash flow from operations of $91 million for the second quarter. This was a substantial improvement from the $8 million use of cash we reported during the first quarter. Working capital contributed slightly to cash flow during the second quarter in spite of the continuing raw material cost increases. The largest use of cash for operating activities was a pension contribution made in April totaling $15 million. No other contributions are planned for 2011.
Based on capital expenditures we have completed to date this year and our CapEx scheduled for the second half of the year, capital expenditures will likely total approximately $125 million in 2011. This is lower than our original guidance for the year of approximately $150 million. 
During the first 6 months of 2011, we repurchased a total of 3.8 million shares of our common stock for $123 million. Future share repurchases will be evaluated among other priorities for cash flow, including dividends and acquisitions. 
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, on July 8, we completed the tender offer for the outstanding preferred shares of our South American subsidiary, which were publicly traded. On July 22, the preferred shares of Dixie Toga were delisted from the Brazilian Stock Exchange. The total purchase price was approximately $90 million, and there will no longer be a reduction in our income associated with noncontrolling interest.
Now looking at our guidance for the remainder of the year, resin prices stabilized in June and our guidance assumes that they remain generally flat on average for the rest of 2011. Our selling prices are increasing to reflect this year's earlier raw material inflation, and the net effect will be improving income margins in the second half of this year. Our earnings per share guidance of $0.56 to $0.61 for the third quarter and $2.08 to $2.18 for the full year reflects this combination of stable costs and increasing selling prices. 
Now operator, we will be pleased to answer questions."

Since Oc",631,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before I get into the details of our business initiatives and expectations for the rest of the year, I'd first like to update you on the challenges that our industry is facing in 2011. 
Since October of 2010, we have experienced steady increases in raw material cost, especially resin and film used for our packaging business, including steep increases in Specialty Materials in the months of February and, again, in May. At this point, it appears that the momentum of these broad raw material cost increases have subsided as costs have been fairly stable in June and July. 
Our business model is designed to meet this type of challenge by responding in a scheduled way, with selling price adjustments that offset the dollar impact of the raw material cost increases. As we have explained in the past, there is a time lag for selling prices to be adjusted to incorporate cost increases, and we expect all of our adjustments to be in place on or before the start of the fourth quarter. 
The second challenge that our industry is facing is a threat of lower consumer demand for products that use our packaging. This is not related to the increase in our raw material costs but more directly is related to inflation in the cost of food ingredients. Food ingredients compromise a much larger portion of the retail cost of our product than our packaging does. And with meaningful price increases facing retail consumers, our customers have publicly expressed concern about the potential impact on demand for their products.
At Bemis, our North American volumes were healthy in the first quarter and above average overall for the second quarter with some softening late in the second quarter. In light of the commentary from our customers, we are expecting volumes for the second half of 2011 to be a few percent lower than the comparable volume from 2010. 
In Brazil, our rigid packaging operations have been dealing with substantial volatility in the cost of polypropylene, their main raw material, which is affecting our profit margins. In Mexico, we trimmed our volumes in 2010 to restore the region to profitability. As a result, while volumes are considerably lower this year compared to last year, the business is now profitable compared to last year when it was operating at a loss. We continue to be pleased with the progress and performance of our operations in Mexico and look forward to its continued growth in both sales and profit margins.
Our European operations continue to meet the challenges of their very competitive environment, with renewed focus on World Class Manufacturing initiatives and sales strategies that prioritize niche projects. In total, we expect raw material prices to stabilize while selling prices continue to rise as pricing agreements adjust in the third quarter. In this challenging environment, which we expect to continue through the rest of the year, we are aggressively managing costs and accelerating opportunities to improve. We continue to transition production to optimum facilities and take costs out of our processes to maintain momentum and continuous improvement efforts. We have accelerated our World Class Manufacturing efforts, and we are aggressively passing through raw material cost escalation to our customers. 
Outside our current operations, we continue to look for opportunities to expand our reach around the globe and apply our technological expertise to products in other markets. We continue to see our largest growth opportunities in growing economies like Brazil and Asia and in growing markets like medical and pharmaceutical. This year's environment is a challenging one, but our diligent focus on process efficiency, customer service and cost control has prepared our business well for the future. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Scott."

Today, I'll begin by focusing my comments on a review of the quarterly results, and then review the assumptions used in our guidance for the rest of the year.

Today, I'll begin by focusing my comments on a review of the quarterly results, and then review the assumptions used in our guidance for the rest of the year. Second quarter earnings per share were $0.51, in line with our guidance for the quarter. This compares to last year's earnings, excluding special charges of $0.58. The decrease in EPS compared to last year reflects higher raw material costs that were not yet reflected in higher selling prices to customers. 
Net sales increased about 8% from the second quarter of 2010. Currency provided an increase of about 3.4%, driven by strengthening of the real, euro and pound sterling versus the dollar. The remaining increase was generated by selling price increases on roughly flat volumes. 
In flexible packaging, overall volumes were also roughly flat. Volumes weakened in Latin America quarter-over-quarter, driven by several factors. Volatility in the price of polypropylene resin used for our rigid packaging operations in Latin America has increased competitive pressures and reduced operating margins in this category. While this volume may be restored in the future, as these factors change, we do not expect them to turn around during the second half of 2011. 
Separately, we purposely trimmed low-margin business in Mexico during the second half of 2010 in order to improve profitability which was successful. So year-over-year second quarter volumes were lower. In addition, the strengthening real puts pressure on our customers' exports from Brazil. Finally, the inflationary economic conditions in Argentina have not been favorable for our business in that region. 
Continuing through the income statement, consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 17.1 in the second quarter. We expect this to be the low-point in 2011 as selling price increases boost gross margins during the second half of the year. 
Looking at flexible packaging operating profit, we reported $116 million or 9.5% of sales in the current quarter of 2011 compared to $130 million or 11.5% of sales in the same quarter of last year after add-backs of special charges. The decrease in 2011 primarily reflects the impact of increased raw material costs in advance of selling price adjustments. As we head into the second half of 2011, we expect operating margins to improve as selling prices are adjusted higher to reflect the raw material cost increases we experienced during the first half. We have implemented selling price increases in our flexible packaging and pressure sensitive businesses to reflect these higher raw material costs.
We reported cash flow from operations of $91 million for the second quarter. This was a substantial improvement from the $8 million use of cash we reported during the first quarter. Working capital contributed slightly to cash flow during the second quarter in spite of the continuing raw material cost increases. The largest use of cash for operating activities was a pension contribution made in April totaling $15 million. No other contributions are planned for 2011.
Based on capital expenditures we have completed to date this year and our CapEx schedule for the second half of the year, capital expenditures will likely total approximately $125 million in 2011. This is lower than our original guidance for the year of approximately $150 million. 
During the first 6 months of 2011, we repurchased a total of 3.8 million shares of our common stock for $123 million. Future share repurchases will be evaluated among other priorities for cash flow, including dividends and acquisitions. 
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, on July 8, we completed the tender offer for the outstanding preferred shares of our South American subsidiary, which were publicly traded. On July 22, the preferred shares of Dixie Toga were de-listed from the Brazilian Stock Exchange. The total purchase price was approximately $90 million, and there will no longer be a reduction in our income associated with non-controlling interests.
Now looking at our guidance for the remainder of the year, resin prices stabilized in June and our guidance assumes that they remain generally flat on average for the rest of 2011. Our selling prices are increasing to reflect this year's earlier raw material inflation, and the net effect will be improving income margins in the second half of this year. Our earnings per share guidance of $0.56 to $0.61 for the third quarter and $2.08 to $2.18 for the full year, reflects this combination of stable costs and increasing selling prices. 
Now operator, we will be pleased to answer questions."

And we've been able to -- and what really allows us to go through and do this is we've been able to put in oxygen scavengers that double the shelf life. So it's quite a unique technological development to be able to put in that oxygen scavenger. And it's one of the things that really came out of the acquisition. When we put the 2 R&D groups together, we were able to add technology to their understanding of that product line. Another one would be FreshCase. Our launch, finally, after getting approval from the FDA and going through testing of a packaging concept that preserves the red color of meat in a vacuum package. And a vacuum package offers a lot of conveniences, a lot of extended shelf life. It offers a new way to go to market. It offers better economics for our customers. It fits the shelves better than the rigid tray, and we had our first minor sales where we have some sales now in the U.S. And it's kind of interesting, we also have expanding sales in Latin America, specifically in Chile. So those are 2 good examples of where material science drives new products and new concepts."

255132,141250610,178027,"Bemis Company, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2011",2011-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Amcor Flexibles North America Inc.","Executives","Good morning. The third quarter results were within our range of EPS guidance. Although volumes weakened as the quarter progressed, limiting our performance to the low end of the range, the results vary from region to region so I will go through the detai",889,"Good morning. The third quarter results were within our range of EPS guidance. Although volumes weakened as the quarter progressed, limiting our performance to the low end of the range, the results vary from region to region so I will go through the details by geography. 
In North American flexible packaging, we experienced lower volumes in most of our market categories. These meters the softening demand experienced by our customers in the product categories that we serve. In Latin America, we experienced substantial volume declines as our customers responded to the slowing economy. In addition, with the Brazilian currency weakening by nearly 10% during the quarter, raw material imports to that region became more expensive. In response, domestic suppliers took the opportunity to increase their prices to match this currency move. This created an unexpected increase in raw material costs in our Latin American operations and will put downward pressure on our operating margins during the fourth quarter as products are shipped. This is the only region of the world are we are still seeing meaningful increases in raw material costs. We raised prices in our European food flexible packaging business in response to increased raw material costs and reduced volume in more competitive products due to a combination of pricing and challenging economic conditions. I am pleased to see that the result of these actions, sales mix and operating margins in this region have improved.
In our pressure-sensitive materials business, our label commodity product lines continues to have challenges in this difficult economy. New products are helping to offset this impact. Since early June, raw material cost in North America and Europe have been generally stable. This gave us a chance to adjust our selling prices during the third quarter to reflect this increased cost. We have experienced some minor raw material cost decreases recently but expect cost to remain stable for the rest of the year.
With volumes down and not expected to improve before 2012, our management teams are working aggressively to reduce costs and adjust our workforce levels where necessary to meet lower production needs for the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter is historically a slower time for us, with most of the holiday-related food packaging shipments occurring by the end of October. November-December volumes level with fewer shipping days reflect the slower seasonal demand of the winter months and result in lower fixed cost absorption during the period. This year, we do not expect the month of October to reflect the normal seasonal volume strength. Our lower guidance for the fourth quarter and the total year has incorporated these lower volume trends.
Customer feedback leads us to believe this to be a short-term trend and not a permanent change in volume levels. We experienced a similar decline during 2007 and during the fourth quarter of 2008 when consumers were forced to tighten their belts and adjust their grocery spending. 
In each case, we found that our North American customers responded to these market conditions by introducing new products to regain consumer attention. These new products each represented an opportunity for Bemis to gain new business, reset price points and improve sales mix with value-added products.
As I mentioned, after the first quarter, our customers have been working on new products at a steady pace since our Food Americas acquisition, tapping into our new capabilities and taking the opportunity to reinvigorate the innovation process. One example that we have entirely for months is a different squeeze products, which is benefiting from a successful marketing initiative, stable, quick service restaurants man levels and their new retail version for the grocery store. In the food service business, our liquid fax, 13-layer high a barrier film is generating sales and opportunity as a replacement of the number 10 can. 
Switching to our medical device packaging business, we have developed for 2 key customers a high-barrier film used to package the new drug-eluting stents introduced into the U.S. and European markets in 2011.
In our press release this morning, we commented on new optimization initiatives that will result in workforce reductions and several small plant closings. We also expect to incur costs related to this optimization initiatives through 2012. I'll let Scott get into the more financial details, but these activities will generate savings in operating profit beginning in the first quarter of 2012.
Lastly, I want to mention that we acquired a Chinese flexible packaging business during the third quarter, Mayor Packaging. This edition provides our Asia-Pacific footprint with more complex food packaging capabilities including standup pouches and technology. This is a great complement to our existing medical device and shrink bag capabilities in that region. The operations are well capitalized and offer room for expansion in the future as we grow our presence in the Asian food packaging markets.
2012 continues to be a challenging year book ended by dramatic raw material cost increases during the first half and meaningful lower volume levels during the second half. While it's disappointing to have accomplished so much in the business with so little to show for it in bottom line, we are keenly focused on the successful execution of initiatives that will drive us toward our goal of improving operating performance and growth in the future. 
Now I'll turn it over to Scott for his comments on the financials."
255132,141250610,178027,"Bemis Company, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2011",2011-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Amcor Flexibles North America Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Henry, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.53, which included $0.03 of transaction-related costs associated with our Mayor Packaging acquisition. This adjusted EPS of $0.56 was $0.01 less than last",613,"Thanks, Henry, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.53, which included $0.03 of transaction-related costs associated with our Mayor Packaging acquisition. This adjusted EPS of $0.56 was $0.01 less than last year's third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.57. The increase in net sales of 4.9% reflects 2.3% increase due to currency translation, 1% from the addition of new sales from Mayor Packaging, our recent China acquisition, and the balance from higher selling prices, which were partially offset by lower volumes compared to the same quarter last year. On average, this quarter's volumes decreased by mid-single digits versus last year's third quarter.
Gross profit margin decreased both compared to last year's third quarter and to this year's second quarter. While we have been passing along to customers the raw material cost increases from the first half of the year, gross margins continue to be under pressure as lower production volumes reduced fixed cost absorption. Selling, general and administrative expenses were down sequentially from 2011 due principally to the reversal of incentive compensation accruals. Our effective income tax rate year-to-date was 36.2%, down from the 36.5% rate for the first half of the year. This resulted in an effective tax rate of 35.5% for the third quarter. Note that net income attributable to Bemis is higher this quarter due to the successful the purchase of preferred shares of our South American operations on July 13. This is reflected in the line item net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, which this quarter is only the $348,000 of minority income for the first couple of weeks for the quarter and in future quarters will be 0.
Looking at the balance sheet, working capital balance has remained higher than they were at the end of 2010. It would have come down by over $50 million since the high at the end of the second quarter. Working capital balances should continue to decline during the fourth quarter as higher-priced inventory is shipped and receivables are collected.
Net debt to latest 12 months adjusted EBITDA was 2.4x at the end of the third quarter. We have used our balance sheet to fund 2 growth acquisitions, Mayor Packaging and all the preferred shares of our Brazilian operations. We also repurchased an additional 1.2 million shares of be Bemis common stock during the third quarter for $38 million, bringing the total repurchase in 2011 to 5 million shares. The remaining share repurchase authorization at September 30 was 4.5 million shares.
Cash flow from operating activities for the third quarter was a record $169 million, reflecting the benefits of the decrease in working capital levels. Short term, we intend to use our future cash flow to repay our $300 million bond that matures in April of 2012.
Turning to guidance, guidance for the fourth quarter is $0.36 to $0.42, bringing total year guidance to $1.90 to $1.96. This does not include severance charges in the range of $0.04 per share. These workforce reductions alone will create annualized savings of about $0.06 per share beginning in 2012.
There will likely be additional charges associated with plant closings through 2012. However, the timing and total cost of those actions have not been finalized. We will provide more specific details for you in our year-end conference call on January 26. 
In summary, we are facing volume headwinds in our business. We have gone through short-term periods like this before. We have a resilient business model, a strong competitive position and opportunities to improve operational efficiencies. We feel positive about 2012 and look forward to laying out our full year guidance in January. 
Now we'll take any questions you have."

Although volumes weakened as the quarter progressed, limiting our performance to the low end of the range, the results vary from region to region, so I will go through the deta",894,"Good morning. The third quarter results were within our range of EPS guidance. Although volumes weakened as the quarter progressed, limiting our performance to the low end of the range, the results vary from region to region, so I will go through the details by geography. 
In North American Flexible Packaging, we experienced lower volumes in most of our market categories. These meters the softening demand experienced by our customers in the product categories that we serve. In Latin America, we experienced substantial volume declines as our customers responded to the slowing economy. In addition, with the Brazilian currency weakening by nearly 10% during the quarter, raw material imports to that region became more expensive. In response, domestic suppliers took the opportunity to increase their prices to match this currency move. This created an unexpected increase in raw material costs in our Latin American operations and will put downward pressure on our operating margins during the fourth quarter as products are shipped. This is the only region of the world where we are still seeing meaningful increases in raw material costs. We raised prices in our European food Flexible Packaging business in response to increased raw material costs and reduced volume in more competitive products due to a combination of pricing and challenging economic conditions. I am pleased to see that the result of these actions, sales mix and operating margins in this region have improved.
In our pressure sensitive materials business, our raw label commodity product line continues to have volume challenges in this difficult economy. New products are helping to offset this impact. Since early June, raw material cost in North America and Europe have been generally stable. This gave us a chance to adjust our selling prices during the third quarter to reflect this increased cost. We have experienced some minor raw material cost decreases recently but expect cost to remain stable for the rest of the year.
With volumes down and not expected to improve before 2012, our management teams are working aggressively to reduce costs and adjust our workforce levels where necessary to meet lower production needs for the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter is historically a slower time for us, with most of the holiday-related food packaging shipments occurring by the end of October. November, December volume level with fewer shipping days reflect the slower seasonal demand of the winter months and result in lower fixed cost absorption during the period. This year, we do not expect the month of October to reflect the normal seasonal volume strength. Our lower guidance for the fourth quarter and the total year has incorporated these lower volume trends.
Customer feedback leads us to believe this to be a short-term trend and not a permanent change in volume levels. We experienced a similar decline during 2007 and during the fourth quarter of 2008, when consumers were forced to tighten their belts and adjust their grocery spending. 
In each case, we found that our North American customers responded to these market conditions by introducing new products to regain consumer attention. These new products each represented an opportunity for Bemis to gain new business, reset price points and improve sales mix with value-added products.
As I mentioned, after the first quarter, our customers have been working on new products at a steady pace since our Food Americas acquisition, tapping into our new capabilities and taking the opportunity to reinvigorate the innovation process. One example that we have been touting for months is the Dip & Squeeze product, which is benefiting from a successful marketing initiative, stable, quick service restaurant demand levels and their new retail version for the grocery store. In the food service business, our Liquiflex, 13-layer high barrier film is generating sales and opportunity as a replacement of the number 10 can. 
Switching to our medical device packaging business, we have developed for 2 key customers, a high-barrier film used to package the new drug-eluting stents introduced into the U.S. and European markets in 2011.
In our press release this morning, we commented on new optimization initiatives that will result in workforce reductions and several small plant closings. We also expect to incur costs related to this optimization initiatives through 2012. I'll let Scott get into the more financial details, but these activities will generate savings in operating profit beginning in the first quarter of 2012.
Lastly, I want to mention that we acquired a Chinese flexible packaging business during the third quarter, Mayor Packaging. This edition provides our Asia Pacific footprint with more complex food packaging capabilities including standup pouches and retort technology. This is a great complement to our existing medical device and shrink bag capabilities in that region. The operations are well-capitalized and offer room for expansion in the future as we grow our presence in the Asian food packaging markets.
2012 continues to be a challenging year book ended by dramatic raw material cost increases during the first half and meaningful lower volume levels during the second half. While it's disappointing to have accomplished so much in the business with so little to show for it in bottom line, we are keenly focused on the successful execution of initiatives that will drive us toward our goal of improving operating performance and growth in the future. 
Now I'll turn it over to Scott for his comments on the financials."
255132,141250610,178143,"Bemis Company, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2011",2011-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Amcor Flexibles North America Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Henry, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.53, which included $0.03 of transaction-related costs associated with our Mayor Packaging acquisition. This adjusted EPS of $0.56 was $0.01 less than last",615,"Thanks, Henry, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.53, which included $0.03 of transaction-related costs associated with our Mayor Packaging acquisition. This adjusted EPS of $0.56 was $0.01 less than last year's third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.57. The increase in net sales of 4.9% reflects 2.3% increase due to currency translation, 1% from the addition of new sales from Mayor Packaging, our recent China acquisition, and the balance from higher selling prices, which were partially offset by lower volumes compared to the same quarter of last year. On average, this quarter's volumes decreased by mid single-digits versus last year's third quarter.
Gross profit margin decreased both compared to last year's third quarter and to this year's second quarter. While we have been passing along to customers the raw material cost increases from the first half of the year, gross margins continue to be under pressure as lower production volumes reduced fixed cost absorption. Selling, general and administrative expenses were down sequentially from the second quarter of 2011, due principally to the reversal of incentive compensation accruals. Our effective income tax rate year-to-date was 36.2%, down from the 36.5% rate for the first half of the year. This resulted in an effective tax rate of 35.5% for the third quarter. Note that net income attributable to Bemis is higher this quarter due to the successful repurchase of preferred shares of our South American operations on July 13. This is reflected in the line item net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, which this quarter, is only the $348,000 of minority income for the first couple of weeks in the quarter and in future quarters will be 0.
Looking at the balance sheet, working capital balance has remained higher than they were at the end of 2010. But have come down by over $50 million since the high at the end of the second quarter. Working capital balances should continue to decline during the fourth quarter as higher-priced inventories shipped and receivables are collected.
Net debt to latest 12 months adjusted EBITDA was 2.4x at the end of the third quarter. We have used our balance sheet to fund 2 growth acquisitions, Mayor Packaging and all the preferred shares of our Brazilian operations. We also repurchased an additional 1.2 million shares of Bemis common stock during the third quarter for $38 million, bringing the total repurchase in 2011 to 5 million shares. The remaining share repurchase authorization at September 30 was 4.5 million shares.
Cash flow from operating activities for the third quarter was a record $169 million, reflecting the benefits of the decrease in working capital levels. Short term, we intend to use our future cash flow to repay our $300 million bond that matures in April of 2012.
Turning to guidance, guidance for the fourth quarter is $0.36 to $0.42, bringing total year guidance to $1.90 to $1.96. This does not include severance charges in the range of $0.04 per share. These workforce reductions alone, will create annualized savings of about $0.06 per share beginning in 2012.
There will likely be additional charges associated with plant closings through 2012. However, the timing and total cost of those actions have not been finalized. We will provide more specific details for you in our yearend conference call on January 26. 
In summary, we are facing volume headwinds in our business. But we have gone through short-term periods like this before. We have a resilient business model, a strong competitive position and opportunities to improve operational efficiencies. We feel positive about 2012 and look forward to laying out our full year guidance in January. 
Now we'll take any questions you have."

Although volumes weakened as the quarter progressed, limiting our performance to the low end of the range. The results vary from region to region, so I will go through the details by geography. 
In North American Flexible Packaging, we experienced lower volumes in most of our market categories. These mirrors the softening demand experienced by our customers in the product categories that we serve. In Latin America, we experienced substantial volume declines as our customers responded to the slowing economy. In addition, with the Brazilian currency weakening by nearly 10% during the quarter, raw material imports to that region became more expensive. In response, domestic suppliers took the opportunity to increase their prices to match this currency move. This created an unexpected increase in raw material costs in our Latin American operations and will put downward pressure on our operating margins during the fourth quarter as products are shipped. This is the only region of the world where we are still seeing meaningful increases in raw material costs. We raised prices in our European food Flexible Packaging business in response to increased raw material costs and reduced volume in more competitive products due to a combination of pricing and challenging economic conditions. I am pleased to see that the result of these actions, sales mix and operating margins in this region have improved.
In our pressure sensitive materials business, our roll label commodity product line continues to have volume challenges in this difficult economy. New products are helping to offset this impact. Since early June, raw material costs in North America and Europe have been generally stable. This gave us a chance to adjust our selling prices during the third quarter to reflect these increased costs. We have experienced some minor raw material cost decreases recently but expect costs to remain stable for the rest of the year.
With volumes down and not expected to improve before 2012, our management teams are working aggressively to reduce costs and adjust our workforce levels where necessary to meet lower production needs for the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter is historically a slower time for us, with most of the holiday-related food packaging shipments occurring by the end of October. November, December volume level with fewer shipping days reflect the slower seasonal demand of the winter months and result in lower fixed cost absorption during the period. This year, we do not expect the month of October to reflect the normal seasonal volume strength. Our lower guidance for the fourth quarter and the total year has incorporated these lower volume trends.
Customer feedback leads us to believe this to be a short-term trend and not a permanent change in volume levels. We experienced a similar decline during 2007 and during the fourth quarter of 2008, when consumers were forced to tighten their belts and adjust their grocery spending. 
In each case, we found that our North American customers responded to these market conditions by introducing new products to regain consumer attention. These new products each represented an opportunity for Bemis to gain new business, reset price points and improve sales mix with value-added products.
As I mentioned, after the first quarter, our customers have been working on new products at a steady pace since our Food Americas acquisition, tapping into our new capabilities and taking the opportunity to reinvigorate the innovation process. One example that we have been touting for months is the Dip & Squeeze product, which is benefiting from a successful marketing initiative; stable, quick service restaurant demand levels; and their new retail version for the grocery store. In the food service business, our Liquiflex, 13-layer high barrier film is generating sales and opportunities as a replacement of the number 10 can. 
Switching to our medical device packaging business, we have developed for 2 key customers a high-barrier film used to package the new drug-eluting stents introduced into the U.S. and European markets in 2011.
In our press release this morning, we commented on new optimization initiatives that will result in workforce reductions and several small plant closings. We also expect to incur costs related to this optimization initiatives through 2012. I'll let Scott get into more of the financial details, but these activities will generate savings and operating profit beginning in the first quarter of 2012.
Lastly, I want to mention that we acquired a Chinese flexible packaging business during the third quarter, Mayor Packaging. This edition provides our Asia-Pacific footprint with more complex food packaging capabilities including standup pouches and retort technology. This is a great complement to our existing medical device and shrink bag capabilities in that region. The operations are well-capitalized and offer room for expansion in the future as we grow our presence in the Asian food packaging markets.
2012 continues to be a challenging year, bookended by dramatic raw material cost increases during the first half and meaningful lower volume levels during the second half. While it is disappointing to have accomplished so much in the business with so little to show for it in the bottom line, we are keenly focused on the successful execution of initiatives that will drive us toward our goal of improving operating performance and growth in the future. 
Now I'll turn it over to Scott for his comments on the financials."

Today, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.53, which included $0.03 of transaction-related costs associated with our Mayor Packaging acquisition. This adjusted EPS of $0.56 was $0.01 less than last",613,"Thanks, Henry, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.53, which included $0.03 of transaction-related costs associated with our Mayor Packaging acquisition. This adjusted EPS of $0.56 was $0.01 less than last year's third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.57. The increase in net sales of 4.9% reflects 2.3% increase due to currency translation, 1% from the addition of new sales from Mayor Packaging, our recent China acquisition, and the balance from higher selling prices, which were partially offset by lower volumes compared to the same quarter of last year. On average, this quarter's volumes decreased by mid-single-digits versus last year's third quarter.
Gross profit margin decreased both compared to last year's third quarter and to this year's second quarter. While we have been passing along to customers the raw material cost increases from the first half of the year, gross margins continued to be under pressure as lower production volumes reduced fixed cost absorption. Selling, general and administrative expenses were down sequentially from the second quarter of 2011, due principally to the reversal of incentive compensation accruals. Our effective income tax rate year-to-date was 36.2%, down from the 36.5% rate for the first half of the year. This resulted in an effective tax rate of 35.5% for the third quarter. Note that net income attributable to Bemis is higher this quarter due to the successful repurchase of preferred shares of our South American operations on July 13. This is reflected in the line item net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, which this quarter is only the $348,000 of minority income for the first couple of weeks of the quarter and in future quarters will be 0.
Looking at the balance sheet, working capital balances remained higher than they were at the end of 2010, but have come down by over $50 million since the high at the end of the second quarter. Working capital balances should continue to decline during the fourth quarter as higher-priced inventories shipped and receivables are collected.
Net debt to latest 12 months adjusted EBITDA was 2.4x at the end of the third quarter. We have used our balance sheet to fund 2 growth acquisitions, Mayor Packaging and all the preferred shares of our Brazilian operations. We also repurchased an additional 1.2 million shares of Bemis common stock during the third quarter for $38 million, bringing the total repurchased in 2011 to 5 million shares. The remaining share repurchase authorization at September 30 was 4.5 million shares.
Cash flow from operating activities for the third quarter was a record $169 million, reflecting the benefits of the decrease in working capital levels. Short term, we intend to use our future cash flow to repay our $300 million bond that matures in April of 2012.
Turning to guidance, guidance for the fourth quarter is $0.36 to $0.42, bringing total year guidance to $1.90 to $1.96. This does not include severance charges in the range of $0.04 per share. These workforce reductions alone will create annualized savings of about $0.06 per share beginning in 2012.
There will likely be additional charges associated with plant closings through 2012. However, the timing and total costs of those actions have not been finalized. We will provide more specific details for you in our year-end conference call on January 26. 
In summary, we are facing volume headwinds in our business. But we have gone through short-term periods like this before. We have a resilient business model, a strong competitive position and opportunities to improve operational efficiencies. We feel positive about 2012 and look forward to laying out our full year guidance in January. 
Now we'll take any questions you have."

The slowing economy in Brazil has affected our volumes, more so than we had planned at the end of the second quarter. And the currency effects, it's kind of strange because the currency effects have a change of about 10% with most of -- a lot of our raw materials being imported drastically increased the price of the raw materials and then the Brazilian manufacturers of competitive products also increased price to match this currency effect on imports.

You mentioned earlier that the new product spending and the focus from customers remains reasonably favorable so I would imagine that bodes well for mix. So just coming back to the volumes, you had a quasi-competitor today, who does play even more in kind of away from home channel, had kind of volumes that were flat to down 1%. And then -- so I'm just trying to get my arms around where you think the volumes are going?

Second is that we're in a seasonal period where fourth quarter is usually relatively weaker for us. Third, all of our customers in the supply chain has gotten exceptionally tight at this point in the year. And so that's constricting volumes as well, which has some year-end effect to it that will not -- that we expect will not be the case when we get into 2012. And then in Brazil, the volumes have fallen precipitously from where they were just a couple of months ago.

The third quarter results were within our range of EPS guidance. Although volumes weakened as the quarter progressed, limiting our performance to the low end of the range. The results vary from region to region, so I will go through the deta",895,"Good morning. The third quarter results were within our range of EPS guidance. Although volumes weakened as the quarter progressed, limiting our performance to the low end of the range. The results vary from region to region, so I will go through the details by geography. 
In North American Flexible Packaging, we experienced lower volumes in most of our market categories. These mirrors the softening demand experienced by our customers in the product categories that we serve. In Latin America, we experienced substantial volume declines as our customers responded to the slowing economy. In addition, with the Brazilian currency weakening by nearly 10% during the quarter, raw material imports to that region became more expensive. In response, domestic suppliers took the opportunity to increase their prices to match this currency move. This created an unexpected increase in raw material costs in our Latin American operations and will put downward pressure on our operating margins during the fourth quarter as products are shipped. This is the only region of the world where we are still seeing meaningful increases in raw material costs. We raised prices in our European food Flexible Packaging business in response to increased raw material costs and reduced volume in more competitive products due to a combination of pricing and challenging economic conditions. I am pleased to see that the result of these actions, sales mix and operating margins in this region have improved.
In our pressure sensitive materials business, our roll label commodity product line continues to have volume challenges in this difficult economy. New products are helping to offset this impact. Since early June, raw material costs in North America and Europe have been generally stable. This gave us a chance to adjust our selling prices during the third quarter to reflect these increased costs. We have experienced some minor raw material cost decreases recently but expect costs to remain stable for the rest of the year.
With volumes down and not expected to improve before 2012, our management teams are working aggressively to reduce costs and adjust our workforce levels where necessary to meet lower production needs for the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter is historically a slower time for us, with most of the holiday-related food packaging shipments occurring by the end of October. November, December volume level with fewer shipping days reflect the slower seasonal demand of the winter months and result in lower fixed cost absorption during the period. This year, we do not expect the month of October to reflect the normal seasonal volume strength. Our lower guidance for the fourth quarter and the total year has incorporated these lower volume trends.
Customer feedback leads us to believe this to be a short-term trend and not a permanent change in volume levels. We experienced a similar decline during 2007 and during the fourth quarter of 2008, when consumers were forced to tighten their belts and adjust their grocery spending. 
In each case, we found that our North American customers responded to these market conditions by introducing new products to regain consumer attention. These new products each represented an opportunity for Bemis to gain new business, reset price points and improve sales mix with value-added products.
As I mentioned, after the first quarter, our customers have been working on new products at a steady pace since our Food Americas acquisition, tapping into our new capabilities and taking the opportunity to reinvigorate the innovation process. One example that we have been touting for months is the Dip & Squeeze product, which is benefiting from a successful marketing initiative; stable, quick service restaurant demand levels; and their new retail version for the grocery store. In the food service business, our Liquiflex, 13-layer high barrier film is generating sales and opportunities as a replacement of the number 10 can. 
Switching to our medical device packaging business, we have developed for 2 key customers a high-barrier film used to package the new drug-eluting stents introduced into the U.S. and European markets in 2011.
In our press release this morning, we commented on new optimization initiatives that will result in workforce reductions and several small plant closings. We also expect to incur costs related to this optimization initiatives through 2012. I'll let Scott get into more of the financial details, but these activities will generate savings and operating profit beginning in the first quarter of 2012.
Lastly, I want to mention that we acquired a Chinese flexible packaging business during the third quarter, Mayor Packaging. This edition provides our Asia-Pacific footprint with more complex food packaging capabilities including standup pouches and retort technology. This is a great complement to our existing medical device and shrink bag capabilities in that region. The operations are well-capitalized and offer room for expansion in the future as we grow our presence in the Asian food packaging markets.
2012 continues to be a challenging year, bookended by dramatic raw material cost increases during the first half and meaningful lower volume levels during the second half. While it is disappointing to have accomplished so much in the business with so little to show for it in the bottom line, we are keenly focused on the successful execution of initiatives that will drive us toward our goal of improving operating performance and growth in the future. 
Now I'll turn it over to Scott for his comments on the financials."

Today, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.53, which included $0.03 of transaction-related costs associated with our Mayor Packaging acquisition.

Today, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.53, which included $0.03 of transaction-related costs associated with our Mayor Packaging acquisition. This adjusted EPS of $0.56 was $0.01 less than last year's third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.57. The increase in net sales of 4.9% reflects 2.3% increase due to currency translation, 1% from the addition of new sales from Mayor Packaging, our recent China acquisition, and the balance from higher selling prices, which were partially offset by lower volumes compared to the same quarter of last year. On average, this quarter's volumes decreased by mid-single-digits versus last year's third quarter.
Gross profit margin decreased both compared to last year's third quarter and to this year's second quarter. While we have been passing along to customers the raw material cost increases from the first half of the year, gross margins continued to be under pressure as lower production volumes reduced fixed cost absorption. Selling, general and administrative expenses were down sequentially from the second quarter of 2011, due principally to the reversal of incentive compensation accruals. Our effective income tax rate year-to-date was 36.2%, down from the 36.5% rate for the first half of the year. This resulted in an effective tax rate of 35.5% for the third quarter. Note that net income attributable to Bemis is higher this quarter due to the successful repurchase of preferred shares of our South American operations on July 13. This is reflected in the line item net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, which this quarter is only the $348,000 of minority income for the first couple of weeks of the quarter and in future quarters will be 0.
Looking at the balance sheet, working capital balances remained higher than they were at the end of 2010, but have come down by over $50 million since the high at the end of the second quarter. Working capital balances should continue to decline during the fourth quarter as higher-priced inventories shipped and receivables are collected.
Net debt to latest 12 months adjusted EBITDA was 2.4x at the end of the third quarter. We have used our balance sheet to fund 2 growth acquisitions, Mayor Packaging and all the preferred shares of our Brazilian operations. We also repurchased an additional 1.2 million shares of Bemis common stock during the third quarter for $38 million, bringing the total repurchased in 2011 to 5 million shares. The remaining share repurchase authorization at September 30 was 4.5 million shares.
Cash flow from operating activities for the third quarter was a record $169 million, reflecting the benefits of the decrease in working capital levels. Short term, we intend to use our future cash flow to repay our $300 million bond that matures in April of 2012.
Turning to guidance, guidance for the fourth quarter is $0.36 to $0.42, bringing total year guidance to $1.90 to $1.96. This does not include severance charges in the range of $0.04 per share. These workforce reductions alone will create annualized savings of about $0.06 per share beginning in 2012.
There will likely be additional charges associated with plant closings through 2012. However, the timing and total costs of those actions have not been finalized. We will provide more specific details for you in our year-end conference call on January 26. 
In summary, we are facing volume headwinds in our business. But we have gone through short-term periods like this before. We have a resilient business model, a strong competitive position and opportunities to improve operational efficiencies. We feel positive about 2012 and look forward to laying out our full year guidance in January.

So it did affect our third quarter performance, and it's part of our fourth quarter guidance. The slowing economy in Brazil has affected our volumes, more so than we had planned at the end of the second quarter. And the currency effects, it's kind of strange because the currency effects have a change of about 10% with most of -- a lot of our raw materials being imported drastically increased the price of the raw materials and then the Brazilian manufacturers of competitive products also increased price to match this currency effect on imports. And in all parts of the world, we really caught up on the raw material increases of the first half of the year.
