As noted in our release this morning, we were very pleased with our holiday results, including strong sales and earnings growth and exceptional comparable store sales in our North American Retail businesses. Our perf",1005,"Thanks, Andrea, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our release this morning, we were very pleased with our holiday results, including strong sales and earnings growth and exceptional comparable store sales in our North American Retail businesses. Our performance clearly demonstrates the brands of vibrancy across channels and geographies and bodes well for future growth. Beyond the top line, we were also very pleased with our high levels of profitability and substantial cash generation. 
In addition, we made continued progress against our global business initiatives, including international expansion, Men's, and digital media. We experienced strong response to our new collections, and our pricing and assortment strategy continued to resonate with consumers worldwide. We're well situated to build upon our leadership position and continue to gain market share. Further, the announcement today of the authorization of a new buyback program reflects our financial strength and our confidence in Coach's future.
While I will get into more detail about the outlook for the category and our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first. Some key highlights of our second fiscal quarter were: first, earnings per share rose 33% to $1 compared with $0.75 in the prior year. Second, quarterly net sales totaled $1.26 billion versus $1.1 billion a year ago, an increase of 19%. Third, Direct-to-Consumer sales rose 17% to $1.1 billion from $934 million in the prior year on a comparable basis. Fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter accelerated, writing 12.6% from prior year, while total North American Direct-to-Consumer sales rose 17%. And fifth, sales in Japan were even to prior year in constant currency and rose 8% in dollars. And finally, we continue to generate very strong sales growth and significant double digit comps in China.
During the quarter, we opened two North American retail stores both in Canada, as well as one factory store. Thus, at the end of the period, there were 347 Full Price and 129 factory stores in operation in North America. 
Moving to Japan, one Coach shop-in-shop was opened in addition to a travel retail location. At quarter end, they were 171 total locations in Japan with 20 Full Price stores, including eight flagships, 117 shop-in-shops, 27 factory stores and seven distributor operated travel retail locations.
And in China, we added three new locations all in the mainland. At the end of the quarter, they were 52 Coach locations in China, including China and Hong Kong, two in Macau and 40 locations on the mainland in 16 cities. As we've discussed previously, we are building a multichannel distribution model in China, including flagships, retail stores, shop in shops and factory stores. 
Indirect sales increased 28% to $168 million from $131 million in the same period last year. This gain reflected significant growth in shipments into international wholesale and U.S. department stores given positive POS sales trends notably in the International business. Specifically, sales for the quarter at retail and international wholesale locations were very strong driven by double-digit gains in same-store sales and new distribution, while sales at POS and U.S. department stores rose 3% for the quarter.
We estimate that the addressable U.S. Handbag and Accessory category rose at a 5% to 10% rate in the holiday quarter, similar to the increase of experience in the preceding nine months of the calendar year. At the same time, Coach's bag and accessory sales rose about 14% across all channels in North America during the most recent quarter. In our Direct businesses in North America, Handbag and Accessory sales rose 18%. Importantly, it now appears that the category will increase to $9 billion in FY '11, surpassing its previous peak achieved three years ago. 
Separately, it's worth noting that we've seen continued modest improvement in our customer's outlook for the economy with over a third of those surveyed now believing that the U.S. economy is improving, the best reading in over three years. Our intention to purchase Coach over the next year is significantly higher than where it was a year ago, with over 2/3 of consumers surveyed noting they probably or definitely would purchase a Coach product in the next 12 months.
Our total revenues in North America rose 17% with our directly operated businesses up similarly, driven by 12.6% in same-store sales increases and new distribution. Fueling these overall strong comp results were significant gains and conversion from prior year and modest traffic growth, partially offset by a slight decline in average transaction size. We were particularly pleased with the improvement and conversion since it's a driver that we have the most control over through product and service. Mike Tucci will discuss our performance in more detail in just a moment. 
In Full Price stores, conversion was the primary contributor to our comp growth, while average transaction size was also modestly higher compared to prior year. Traffic trends was slightly lower year-over-year. In factory, where our business remained remarkably strong, we saw increases in traffic and conversion, while transaction size declined modestly. Our factory store growth continued to be driven by increased spending of factory channel, loyal Coach shoppers and by new consumers entering the franchise. 
As noted, in Japan, we've posted an 8% increase in dollars on a flat performance in constant currency. Our market share further expanded against continued contraction in the category. Our growth and share reflects the relevance of our accessible luxury positioning for the Japanese consumer who is becoming more value-oriented.
Once again, I want to call out China, our fastest-growing business. During the quarter, our sales continued to rise sharply from prior year fueled by distribution growth and significant double digit comps. Clearly, the Coach proposition is resonating with this consumer who is participating in this category and increasing numbers. While Mike Devine will get into more detail on our financials and I will discuss our outlook in some detail, I wanted to give you just recap. 
Now I will turn it over to Mike Tucci to discuss our North American Retail businesses. Mike?"

Today, I'd like to review what was an exceptional holiday season touching on the three important productivity drivers within our North American business.: product performance, digital strategy and coach.com results and progress on our new Men's initiative. 
During the holiday quarter, as always, we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness, ensuring that we have a steady flow of new product throughout the period. A key to this effort was that we are somewhat less front-end loaded than in previous holiday season. In October, we relaunched the Madison collection featuring the new Sofia Satcher and core leather, gathered leather and novelty applications, along with the fresh dotted logo. The reception was excellent, and Madison was our top collection for the quarter.
We also benefited from a first-time inclusion on Oprah's favorite things for holiday featuring our large patent Sofia in Crimson and Camelot network TV. During the quarter, we also updated Poppy and added new colors in our Madison and Kristin collections. In mid-December, we introduced the Alexander tote group to capture peak sales with new products just before holiday. 
Additionally, we generated excellent sales increases in women's accessories in the quarter, notably in money pieces and small bags. Our holiday product was supported with a comprehensive marketing plan, which highlighted a powerful gifting message for the shopping season. The emphasis of our marketing was item- driven across handbags, women's accessories and other gift ideas. Our campaign spent coach.com, digital media and compelling print and in-store marketing to drive traffic into stores and on the Internet. 
Most generally, the merchandising and pricing strategies we initiated last year to create a more balanced and productive handbag assortment have become proven sustainable growth drivers in North America. Both handbags and women's accessories achieved positive comps in the quarter with handbag penetration holding over 53% of sales with a high single-digit increase and average unit retails. This pricing power was driven by mix as leather and novelty continued to trend very well. 
Looking forward, we're excited about our spring product initiatives as well. We've been pleased with our performance of our newest collection, Colette, which launched on 12/24 featuring new tote, kobo and carryall silhouettes. And for spring, our major product launch is the new Kristin collection, which will be introduced on February 18. Kristin is the strong assortment of beautiful hobos, totes and satchels offered in a range of leathers and novelty fabrications such as embossed python, linen signature and Op Art, appealing to our broad range of consumers. This relaunch will be supported by a comprehensive broad-based marketing campaign, including window vinyls, special shopping bag and a focus online and print media campaign.
On the factory side, our strong results were fueled by powerful combination of new product introductions key styles offered and great prices. Our inventory investment strategy enabled us to capture sales upside throughout the season. Our product assortments is also supported by our in-store and direct marketing campaigns. Importantly, while we're bold in our pricing strategies, the gains in our Factory business drove improved operating margins. As we enter the spring season, we continue to see opportunity to leverage our factory model and increase productivity within this business. 
A second important growth there in the quarter was digital. As we discussed last quarter, coach.com is a key marketing tool and it is becoming a very important revenue opportunity as well. We noted that our primary objective online in North America is to build top-of-mind brand awareness and drive store traffic while also maximizing e-commerce opportunities. In our second quarter, we saw the digital initiatives we've put into place for holiday such as the virtual gift guide and e-card pay off in the exceptional performance of our online business. In fact, coach.com is now hour fastest growing Full Price channel in North America where both traffic and sales continue to grow at a double-digit pace during the holiday quarter. 
Of course, our web presence is now global with informational sites in 16 countries, three of which U.S., Canada and Japan are e-commerce platforms. More generally, we will continue to use our digital capability as an enabler and customer touch point as we expand the Coach brand globally.
Moving back to our stores, as Lew mentioned, we opened two new retail stores in Q2, Pickering and Ontario and Victoria, British Columbia, taking our first half openings to five, all of which are performing very well and ahead of plan. We also opened one new factory store, taking the first half total to eight, including our first five Men's stand-alone factory stores, which opened in Q1. These stores also opened strongly and are running above our pro formas. 
In Full Price, based on the initial success of our first Men's stand-alone store in Bleecker Street and our Men's sales growth in core Coach stores, we'll be opening two additional Men's retail stores later this fiscal year, including the one that Garden State Plaza in New Jersey and one in Copley Plaza in Boston. This month, we dedicated more space and introduced a broader Men's product assortment to seven additional stores bringing our total Men's concept store count to 37 in North America, including eight flagships such as 595 Madison Avenue in New York.
On the factory side, our men stores, which are located next to or nearby our most productive factory locations, are performing extremely well. We believe the strong consumer response we experienced reflects the strength of the Coach brand and the factory consumers focus on value and function. It confirms our belief that there is a particularly large opportunity for Men's in our factory channel. During the remainder of that FY '11, we're planning to open at least five more Men's factory locations.
In summary, we are excited with the continued progress we've made in improving our Full Price productivity and our Men's initiative. We're feeling great about the spring season given the current sales trends in both old Full Price and factory channels. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Lew for a discussion of our strategies and opportunities for growth. Lew?"

Our strategies continue to be focused on expansion opportunities both here and North America and increasingly in international markets. In addition, as always, we're focused on improving performance in existing stores by increasing Coach's share of our consumers accessories wardrobe while continuing to attract new customers into the franchise. 
Mike just discussed our Men's initiative, which we're confident will be a significant contributor to global growth in the seasons and years ahead, both in North America and in international markets. 
Moving on to distribution growth, as mentioned in prior earnings calls, we expected our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 10% this year compared to 8% last year. Starting in North America, we will open about five stores in the back half of fiscal 2011, bringing the total to about 10 new North American retail stores for the year. In addition, we'll open about 12 new factory stores during the balance of the year primarily to support our Men's initiative. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 8% this year, similar to last year. 
In China, as mentioned, our sales are growing rapidly as the market continues to develop swiftly. Last year, we doubled sales to over $100 million and are on track to generate sales of over $175 million this year. We are also now targeting $500 million in sales during FY '14 of 10% market share compared with 5% today. Driving this growth in addition to same-store sales, we expect to open about 25 new locations this year, increasing square footage by about 65%. Over the next few years, we're targeting to open about 30 new locations per annum. These locations will be primarily focused on the mainland and mirror our multichannel distribution model in North America and Japan. 
In Japan, the overall consumer market remains very challenging, and the category continues to contract. Our goal continues to be market share gains, and we have done this quite well in our core Women's business. As elsewhere, we're now also focusing on Men's, where we've already seen early success. This year, we now expect to open about 10 net new Coach Japan locations, including five Men's stores. In total, we expect the net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 6% this year, similar to last year.
Beyond our directly owned businesses in China and Japan, we have a significant international wholesale business, generating over $400 million in sales at retail. Most of these sales come from other markets in Asia where the Coach brand resonates well and includes a sizable travel Retail business catering to the growing population of Asian travelers. Given our focus in this area, we're also opening about 25 new distributor operated locations in the Asian region during this fiscal year.
Moving to Europe, it is a new region of expansion for Coach. To date, we've opened six boutiques and Printemps Department stores in Japan and expect to open one additional location within Printemps during the balance of the fiscal year. And through our joint venture with Hackett, we've launched the brand with four shop-in-shops in Spain and one in Lisbon with one more to go before year end, all within El Corte Inglés. 
Last quarter, we also announced plans to our initial stores in London, a stand-alone store in the Westfield White City Mall, which is on plan to open in late February and a 5,100 square foot flagship on New Bond Street, our first global flagship store in the region coming this summer. We've been pleased with our initial results in Europe as our brand gains recognition with the domestic consumer and benefits from our popularity mall, notably those who are Asian based. 
Beyond the opportunities in the Coach concept and brand, as you know, we launched Reed Krakoff in September and a few boutiques in the U.S. and Japan, as well as two prestigious international specialty retailers such as Lane Crawford in Hong Kong and Colette in Paris. While it's still very early days, we are pleased that the product is appealing to the targeted Pinnacle luxury consumer. 
In summary, we are excited about the global opportunity for Coach especially the emerging market potential given the rapid growth of the category and the foundation, which we have begun to build in the important Asian region. 
At this time, I will turn it over to Mike Devine, our CFO, for further detail on our financials. Mike?"
526573,118380199,94606,"Coach Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2011",2011-01-25,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Lew. Lew and Mike have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our second quarter results. As mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 19% with Direct-to-Consume",951,"Thank you, Lew. Lew and Mike have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our second quarter results. As mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 19% with Direct-to-Consumer, which represents over three quarters of our business, up 17% and Indirect up 28% due to higher shipments into international wholesale accounts and the U.S. department stores. 
Earnings per share for the quarter increased 33% to $1 even as compared to $0.75 in the year ago period as net income rose to $303 million from $241 million. Our operating income totaled $453 million in the second quarter, up 19% from $381 million in the same period last year. Operating margin in the quarter was 35.9% compared to 35.8% in the year ago period. 
In the second quarter, gross profit rose 19% to $915 million from $771 million a year ago, and gross margin rate remained strong at 72.4% even with the prior year. Gross margin reflected the impact of channel mix and continued high levels of promotional activity in our factory channels, offset by sourcing cost improvements. 
Moving to expenses. We were pleased that we were able to gain modest leverage in the holiday quarter, which is our toughest quarter to do so. Specifically, SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales improved from prior year levels in the second quarter and represented 36.5% of sales versus 36.6% last year. Once again, our two primary direct businesses here in North America and in Japan both provided leverage not only to their own P&Ls but to the corporate P&L as well, more than offsetting the impact of our investment spending. We believe we're striking the right balance between driving future growth opportunities and operating efficiently.
Inventories at quarter end were $367 million, up 36% from the end of last year's Q2 but down 4% on a two-year basis. Clearly, these inventory levels were key to delivering the exceptional holiday quarter. Our current inventories support the strong underlying business trends and will allow us to maximize sales this spring. Generally, it's worth noting that we've been rightsizing our inventories this year, bringing them up to more appropriate levels to support our growing businesses, including new growth initiatives such as Men's, global expansion and our new distribution center in Asia. 
Cash and short-term investments stood at $940 million as compared with $1.1 billion a year ago, despite repurchases of nearly $1.4 billion worth of Coach common stock in the interim 12 months. During the second quarter, we repurchased and retired nearly 7 million shares of our common stock at an average cost of $55.72, spending a total of $388 million.
Net cash from operating activities in the second quarter was $408 million compared to $364 million last year during Q2. Free cash flow in the second quarter was an inflow of $382 million versus $347 million in the same period last year, due to higher net income offset by working capital items. Our CapEx spending was $26 million versus $17 million in the same quarter a year ago. As we stated on our last to earnings calls, based on our plans for the year, we expect the CapEx will be about $115 million in FY '11, primarily for the opening of new stores across all geographies. 
Naturally, we were very pleased to report these strong financial results and as Lew and Mike have said, we're well positioned for the back half of our fiscal year. While we do not give specific guidance, as you know, I always think it's helpful for you modelers out there to keep a few things in mind when looking at the year. First, and most generally, we continue to target double-digit sales increases globally with double-digit earnings growth. And given the ongoing strength in our business, we now believe that we'll achieve high single-digit same-store sales growth in North America for the balance of the fiscal year, even in the face of more difficult spring compares. This is up from last quarter when we projected mid-single-digit growth. Additionally, we expect the continuation of our positive POS trends in our Indirect businesses. However, our second-half comparisons will be impacted by the timing of shipments in those Indirect businesses and the extra week in the prior year's fourth quarter. As you may recall, that extra week contributed $70 million of sales and $0.08 of EPS. 
Second, we were excited that our top line sales growth drove higher levels of profitability in the first half, and while our previous comments regarding second-half gross margins still stand, our sales growth, coupled with controlled spending, will help offset both product cost and channel mix pressures. Therefore, we are reiterating our previous guidance of a full year FY '11 operating margin at about last year's level of about 31.5% on a 52-week basis. 
Third, our tax rate is likely to stay in the area achieved in the first six months for the balance of the year as we continue to refine our international tax strategies. 
Fourth, I wanted to briefly touch on share count. We would expect second-half share count to be similar to where we ended second quarter. 
Before we open it up for Q&A, I wanted to echo Lew's earlier words. This was an exceptional quarter for Coach. Clearly, our holiday results bode well for the future, and we're confident that we'll continue to deliver very strong sales and earnings gains over the balance of the fiscal year and beyond. 
Thank you all for joining us on our call today, and now Lew, Mike, Andrea, and I will be happy to take questions, which will be followed by brief closing remarks from Lew."

On the factory side, the quarter was extremely strong. And we felt like from a positioning standpoint,, while we were able to drive the value in terms of our proposition, we did see some upside there based on ownership of product, a very strong handbag assortment, which drove sales as we went right into peak through Christmas and a week after. So I would say across-the-board, we had strength. We are pleased with the pricing power in handbags, which drove comp in both Full Price and factory, and we had a very strong accessories quarter, and it feels like the cycle from an accessories standpoint was a driver of comp within the quarter as well."

We've never answered inventory levels with that degree of specificity, but let me just say that couple of things about it.

I would firstly say that our investment in factory inventories allowed us to capture the outperform during the holiday quarter that Mike just spoke to that we wouldn't have been able to get to this time last year or so that investment was well placed. Also, investment in our Men's initiative is a part of the inventory driver. And then lastly, feeding inventory into the Asian region through the ABC is also a subset of where the inventory growth came from.

We did have called out inflationary pressures would have a dampening impact on our gross margin rates in the back half of our FY '11. And so that's still going to hold. The way we wanted to ask everyone to think about it, however, is also the guidance that we've given previously of gross margin rates coming in for the year and the 72% to 73% range are still valid the guidance we give a couple of quarters ago. We still feel very good about, and of course, we could go on and list in addition to the inflationary pressures, all the positive things that we're doing, to move gross margin and help to offset those pressures, things like counter-sourcing materials, looking to migrate a substantial amount of our production into lower-cost countries out of China into countries like Vietnam and India as an example. And ultimately with the top line growth in the Asian region, most notably China, we'll start to get some help from channel mix as well. So there are a number of positives going on in the gross margin line that will help mitigate on the inflationary pressures."

One is a shift towards leather, which helps us from a pricing standpoint on the retail side, so we do see an opportunity to impact average unit retail in the second half on the Full Price side of the business that will carry through to the factory, and I really want to be clear on the factory side. We do have pricing power. We were aggressive in the quarter. However, we were able to protect margins from a gross margin standpoint in factory and we drove tremendous operating margins. That effort positions us very well on the back half to continue to focus on unit retail gains in the factory channel, productivity gains in the factory channel and drive operating margin."

One thing that we already have so much leverage in this holiday quarter because of the top line growth. So the fact that we outperformed in our North American business, the Japan did as well as it did with a tough market backdrop, really allowed those mature businesses to poor leverage to the P&L that help us offset our investment spending in Europe, in other parts of Asia, in the new RK brand, et cetera.

Penetrations were double-digit, north of 10%, which is very good. We will focus on Madison opportunity, particularly given that the fashion cycle that we're in around manipulated leathers, gathered leathers, treated leathers, some of the burnishing that we're doing with bags. So that offers us a pricing opportunity on the Full Price side as we move forward as we develop our assortments into spring and next fall. On the factory side, our product mix in factory was very much driven by made-for-factory product. Again, I think we were north of 80% in made-for-factory. In fact, it was 89% for the quarter, probably an all-time high, very little clearance, very little Full Price activity in the quarter in the factory channel, and that trend will continue. One of the things that we did this quarter, which helped us on the factory side, is that we corrected a flow-in balance that we had last year where we were chasing inventory in factory and doing a lot of pull-forward on spring goods to sell in the holiday quarter. We corrected that this year, and we were able to maximize the quarter with products that was actually planned within the quarter, and that also positions us very well as we entered into January."

As noted in our release this morning, we were very pleased with our holiday results, including strong sales and earnings growth and exceptional comparable store sales in our North American Retail businesses. Our perf",1001,"Thanks, Andrea, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our release this morning, we were very pleased with our holiday results, including strong sales and earnings growth and exceptional comparable store sales in our North American Retail businesses. Our performance clearly demonstrates the brands of vibrancy across channels and geographies and bodes well for future growth. Beyond the top line, we were also very pleased with our high levels of profitability and substantial cash generation. 
In addition, we made continued progress against our global business initiatives, including international expansion, Men's, and digital media. We experienced strong response to our new collections, and our pricing and assortment strategy continued to resonate with consumers worldwide. We're well situated to build upon our leadership position and continue to gain market share. Further, the announcement today of the authorization of a new buyback program reflects our financial strength and our confidence in Coach's future.
While I will get into more detail about the outlook for the category and our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first. Some key highlights of our second fiscal quarter were: First, earnings per share rose 33% to $1 compared with $0.75 in the prior year; second, quarterly net sales totaled $1.26 billion versus $1.1 billion a year ago, an increase of 19%; third, Direct-to-Consumer sales rose 17% to $1.1 billion from $934 million in the prior year on a comparable basis; fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter accelerated, writing 12.6% from prior year, while total North American Direct-to-Consumer sales rose 17%; and fifth, sales in Japan were even to prior year in constant currency and rose 8% in dollars; and finally, we continue to generate very strong sales growth and significant double digit comps in China.
During the quarter, we opened two North American retail stores both in Canada, as well as one factory store. Thus, at the end of the period, there were 347 Full Price and 129 factory stores in operation in North America. 
Moving to Japan, one Coach shop-in-shop was opened in addition to a travel retail location. At quarter end, they were 171 total locations in Japan with 20 Full Price stores, including eight flagships, 117 shop-in-shops, 27 factory stores and seven distributor-operated travel retail locations.
And in China, we added three new locations all in the mainland. At the end of the quarter, they were 52 Coach locations in China, including 10 in Hong Kong, two in Macau and 40 locations on the mainland in 16 cities. As we've discussed previously, we are building a multichannel distribution model in China, including flagships, retail stores, shop-in-shops and factory stores. 
Indirect sales increased 28% to $168 million from $131 million in the same period last year. This gain reflected significant growth in shipments into international wholesale and U.S. department stores given positive POS sales trends notably in the international business. Specifically, sales for the quarter at retail and international wholesale locations were very strong driven by double-digit gains in same-store sales and new distribution, while sales at POS and U.S. department stores rose 3% for the quarter.
We estimate that the addressable U.S. Handbag and Accessory category rose at a 5% to 10% rate in the holiday quarter, similar to the increase it experienced in the preceding nine months of the calendar year. At the same time, Coach's bag and accessory sales rose about 14% across all channels in North America during the most recent quarter. In our Direct businesses in North America, Handbag and Accessory sales rose 18%. Importantly, it now appears that the category will increase to $9 billion in FY '11, surpassing its previous peak achieved three years ago. 
Separately, it's worth noting that we've seen continued modest improvement in our customer's outlook for the economy with over a third of those surveyed now believing that the U.S. economy is improving, the best reading in over three years. Her intention to purchase Coach over the next year is significantly higher than where it was a year ago, with over 2/3 of consumers surveyed noting they probably or definitely would purchase a Coach product in the next 12 months.
Our total revenues in North America rose 17% with our directly operated businesses up similarly, driven by 12.6% in same-store sales increases and new distribution. Fueling these overall strong comp results were significant gains in conversion from prior year and modest traffic growth, partially offset by a slight decline in average transaction size. We were particularly pleased with the improvement at conversion since it's a driver that we have the most control over through product and service. Mike Tucci will discuss our performance in more detail in just a moment. 
In Full Price stores, conversion was the primary contributor to our comp growth, while average transaction size was also modestly higher compared to prior year. Traffic trends was slightly lower year-over-year. In factory, where our business remained remarkably strong, we saw increases in traffic and conversion, while transaction size declined modestly. Our factory store growth continued to be driven by increased spending of factory channel, loyal Coach shoppers and by new consumers entering the franchise. 
As noted, in Japan, we posted an 8% increase in dollars on a flat performance in constant currency. Our market share further expanded against continued contraction in the category. Our growth in share reflects the relevance of our accessible luxury positioning with the Japanese consumer who is becoming more value-oriented.
Once again, I want to call out China, our fastest-growing business. During the quarter, our sales continued to rise sharply from prior year fueled by distribution growth and significant double-digit comps. Clearly, the Coach proposition is resonating with this consumer who is participating in this category and increasing numbers. While Mike Devine will get into more detail on our financials and I will discuss our outlook in some detail, I wanted to give you this recap. 
Now I will turn it over to Mike Tucci to discuss our North American Retail businesses. Mike?"

Today, I'd like to review what was an exceptional holiday season touching on the three important productivity drivers within our North American business: product performance, digital strategy and coach.com results and progress on our new Men's initiative. 
During the holiday quarter, as always, we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness, ensuring that we had a steady flow of new product throughout the period. A key to this effort was that we are somewhat less front-end loaded than in previous holiday seasons. In October, we relaunched the Madison collection featuring the new Sophia satchel in core leather, gathered leather and novelty applications, along with the fresh dotted op art logo. The reception was excellent and Madison was our top collection for the quarter.
We also benefited from a first-time inclusion on Oprah's favorite things for holiday featuring our large patent Sophia in crimson and camel on network TV. During the quarter, we also updated Poppy and added new colors in our Madison and Kristin collections. In mid-December, we introduced the Alexandra tote group to capture peak sales with new products just before holiday. 
Additionally, we generated excellent sales increases in women's accessories in the quarter, notably in money pieces and small bags. Our holiday product was supported with a comprehensive marketing plan, which highlighted a powerful gifting message for the shopping season. The emphasis of our marketing was item-driven across handbags, women's accessories and other gift ideas. Our campaign span coach.com, digital media and compelling print and in-store marketing to drive traffic into stores and on the Internet. 
Most generally, the merchandising and pricing strategies we initiated last year to create a more balanced and productive handbag assortment have become proven sustainable growth drivers in North America. Both handbags and women's accessories achieved positive comps in the quarter with handbag penetration holding at over 53% of sales with a high single-digit increase and average unit retails. This pricing power was driven by mix as leather and novelty continued to trend very well. 
Looking forward, we're excited about our spring product initiatives as well. We've been pleased with our performance of our newest collection, Colette, which launched on 12/24 featuring new tote, hobo and carryall silhouettes. And for spring, our major product launch is the new Kristin collection, which will be introduced on February 18. Kristin is the strong assortment of beautiful hobos, totes and satchels offered in a range of leathers and novelty fabrications such as embossed python, linen signature and op art, appealing to a broad range of consumers. This relaunch will be supported by a comprehensive broad-based marketing campaign, including window vinyls, special shopping bag and a focused online and print media campaign.
On the factory side, our strong results were fueled by a powerful combination of new product introductions with key styles offered at great prices. Our inventory investment strategy enabled us to capture sales upside throughout the season. Our product assortment was also supported by our in-store and direct marketing campaigns. Importantly, while we're bold in our pricing strategies, the gains in our Factory business drove improved operating margins. As we enter the spring season, we continue to see opportunity to leverage our factory model and increase productivity within this business. 
A second important growth there in the quarter was digital. As we discussed last quarter, coach.com is a key marketing tool and it's becoming a very important revenue opportunity as well. We noted that our primary objective online in North America is to build top-of-mind brand awareness and drive store traffic while also maximizing e-commerce opportunities. In our second quarter, we saw the digital initiatives we've put into place for holiday such as the virtual gift guide and e-gift card pay off in the exceptional performance of our online business. In fact, coach.com is now our fastest growing Full Price channel in North America where both traffic and sales continue to grow at a double-digit pace during the holiday quarter. 
Of course, our web presence is now global with informational sites in 16 countries, three of which U.S., Canada and Japan are e-commerce platforms. More generally, we will continue to use our digital capability as an enabler and customer touch point as we expand the Coach brand globally.
Moving back to our stores, as Lew mentioned, we opened two new retail stores in Q2, Pickering in Ontario and Victoria, British Columbia, taking our first half openings to five, all of which are performing very well and ahead of plan. We also opened one new factory store, taking the first half total to eight, including our first five Men's stand-alone factory stores, which opened in Q1. These stores also opened strongly and are running above our pro formas. 
In Full Price, based on the initial success of our first Men's stand-alone store in Bleecker Street and our Men's sales growth in core Coach stores, we'll be opening two additional Men's retail stores later this fiscal year, including the one at Garden State Plaza in New Jersey and one in Copley Plaza in Boston. This month, we dedicated more space and introduced a broader Men's product assortment to seven additional stores bringing our total Men's concept store count to 37 in North America, including eight flagships such as 595 Madison Avenue in New York.
On the factory side, our Men's stores, which are located next to or nearby our most productive factory locations, are performing extremely well. We believe the strong consumer response we experienced reflect the strength of the Coach brand and the factory consumers focus on value and function. It confirms our belief that there is a particularly large opportunity for Men's in our factory channel. During the remainder of that FY '11, we're planning to open at least five more Men's factory locations.
In summary, we're excited with the continued progress we've made in improving our Full Price productivity and our Men's initiative. We're feeling great about the spring season given the current sales trends in both old Full Price and factory channels. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Lew for a discussion of our strategies and opportunities for growth. Lew?"
526573,118380199,94720,"Coach Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2011",2011-01-25,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike.

Our strategies continue to be focused on expansion opportunities both here in North America and increasingly, in international markets. In addition, as always, we're focused on improving performance in existing stores by increasing Coach's share of our consumers' accessories wardrobe while continuing to attract new customers into the franchise. Mike just discussed our Men's initiative, which we're confident will be a significant contributor to global growth in the seasons and years ahead, both in North America and in international markets. 
Moving on to distribution growth, as mentioned in prior earnings calls, we expected our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 10% this year compared to 8% last year. Starting in North America, we will open about five stores in the back half of fiscal 2011, bringing the total to about 10 new North American retail stores for the year. In addition, we'll open about 12 new factory stores during the balance of the year primarily to support our Men's initiative. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 8% this year, similar to last year. 
In China, as mentioned, our sales are growing rapidly as the market continues to develop swiftly. Last year, we doubled sales to over $100 million and are on track to generate sales of over $175 million this year. We are also now targeting $500 million in sales during FY '14, a 10% market share compared with 5% today. Driving this growth in addition to same-store sales, we expect to open about 25 new locations this year, increasing square footage by about 65%. Over the next few years, we're targeting to open about 30 new locations per annum. These locations will be primarily focused on the mainland and mirror our multichannel distribution model in North America and Japan. 
In Japan, the overall consumer market remains very challenging, and the category continues to contract. Our goal continues to be market share gains, and we have done this quite well in our core Women's business. As elsewhere, we're now also focusing on Men's, where we've already seen early success. This year, we now expect to open about 10 net new Coach Japan locations, including five Men's stores. In total, we expect the net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 6% this year, similar to last year.
Beyond our directly owned businesses in China and Japan, we have a significant international wholesale business, generating over $400 million in sales at retail. Most of these sales come from other markets in Asia where the Coach brand resonates well and includes a sizable travel retail business catering to the growing population of Asian travelers. Given our focus in this area, we're also opening about 25 new distributor-operated locations in the Asian region during this fiscal year.
Moving to Europe, it is a new region of expansion for Coach. To date, we've opened six boutiques in Printemps Department stores in France and expect to open one additional location within Printemps during the balance of the fiscal year. And through our joint venture with Hackett, we've launched the brand with four shop-in-shops in Spain and one in Lisbon with one more to go before year end, all within El Corte Inglés. 
Last quarter, we also announced plans for our initial stores in London, a stand-alone store in the Westfield White City Mall, which is on plan to open in late February and a 5,100 square foot flagship on New Bond Street, our first global flagship store in the region coming this summer. We've been pleased with our initial results in Europe as our brand gains recognition with the domestic consumer and benefits from our popularity among tourists notably those who are Asian based. 
Beyond the opportunities in the Coach concept and brand, as you know, we launched Reed Krakoff in September and a few boutiques in the U.S. and Japan, as well as two prestigious international specialty retailers such as Lane Crawford in Hong Kong and Colette in Paris. While it's still very early days, we are pleased that the product is appealing to the targeted pinnacle luxury consumer. 
In summary, we are excited about the global opportunity for Coach especially the emerging market potential given the rapid growth of the category and the foundation, which we have begun to build in the important Asian region. 
At this time, I will turn it over to Mike Devine, our CFO, for further detail on our financials. Mike?"
526573,118380199,94720,"Coach Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2011",2011-01-25,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Lew. Lew and Mike have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our second quarter results. As mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 19% with Direct-to-Consume",950,"Thank you, Lew. Lew and Mike have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our second quarter results. As mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 19% with Direct-to-Consumer, which represents over three quarters of our business, up 17% and Indirect up 28% due to higher shipments into international wholesale accounts and the U.S. department stores. 
Earnings per share for the quarter increased 33% to $1 even as compared to $0.75 in the year ago period as net income rose to $303 million from $241 million. Our operating income totaled $453 million in the second quarter, up 19% from $381 million in the same period last year. Operating margin in the quarter was 35.9% compared to 35.8% in the year-ago period. 
In the second quarter, gross profit rose 19% to $915 million from $771 million a year ago, and gross margin rate remained strong at 72.4% even with the prior year. Gross margin reflected the impact of channel mix and continued high levels of promotional activity in our factory channels, offset by sourcing cost improvements. 
Moving to expenses. We were pleased that we were able to gain modest leverage in the holiday quarter, which is our toughest quarter to do so. Specifically, SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales improved from prior year levels in the second quarter and represented 36.5% of sales versus 36.6% last year. Once again, our two primary direct businesses here in North America and in Japan both provided leverage not only to their own P&Ls but to the corporate P&L as well, more than offsetting the impact of our investment spending. We believe we're striking the right balance between driving future growth opportunities and operating efficiently.
Inventories at quarter end were $367 million, up 36% from the end of last year's Q2 but down 4% on a two-year basis. Clearly, these inventory levels were key to delivering the exceptional holiday quarter. Our current inventories support the strong underlying business trends and will allow us to maximize sales this spring. Generally, it's worth noting that we've been rightsizing our inventories this year, bringing them up to more appropriate levels to support our growing businesses, including new growth initiatives such as Men's, global expansion and our new distribution center in Asia. 
Cash and short-term investments stood at $940 million as compared with $1.1 billion a year ago, despite repurchases of nearly $1.4 billion worth of Coach common stock in the interim 12 months. During the second quarter, we repurchased and retired nearly 7 million shares of our common stock at an average cost of $55.72, spending a total of $388 million.
Net cash from operating activities in the second quarter was $408 million compared to $364 million last year during Q2. Free cash flow in the second quarter was an inflow of $382 million versus $347 million in the same period last year, due to higher net income offset by working capital items; our CapEx spending was $26 million versus $17 million in the same quarter a year ago. As we stated on our last two earnings calls, based on our plans for the year, we expect the CapEx will be about $150 million in FY '11, primarily for the opening of new stores across all geographies. 
Naturally, we were very pleased to report these strong financial results and as Lew and Mike have said, we're well positioned for the back half of our fiscal year. While we do not give specific guidance, as you know, I always think it's helpful for you modelers out there to keep a few things in mind when looking at the year. First, and most generally, we continue to target double-digit sales increases globally with double-digit earnings growth. And given the ongoing strength in our business, we now believe that we'll achieve high single-digit same-store sales growth in North America for the balance of the fiscal year, even in the face of more difficult spring compares. This is up from last quarter when we projected mid-single-digit growth. Additionally, we expect the continuation of our positive POS trends in our Indirect businesses. However, our second-half comparisons will be impacted by the timing of shipments in those Indirect businesses and the extra week in the prior year's fourth quarter. As you may recall, that extra week contributed $70 million of sales and $0.08 of EPS. 
Second, we were excited that our top line sales growth drove higher levels of profitability in the first half, and while our previous comments regarding second-half gross margins still stand, our sales growth, coupled with controlled spending, will help offset both product cost and channel mix pressures. Therefore, we are reiterating our previous guidance of a full year FY '11 operating margin at about last year's level of about 31.5% on a 52-week basis. 
Third, our tax rate is likely to stay in the area achieved in the first six months for the balance of the year as we continue to refine our international tax strategies. 
Fourth, I wanted to briefly touch on share count. We would expect second-half share count to be similar to where we ended second quarter. 
Before we open it up for Q&A, I wanted to echo Lew's earlier words. This was an exceptional quarter for Coach. Clearly, our holiday results bode well for the future, and we're confident that we'll continue to deliver very strong sales and earnings gains over the balance of the fiscal year and beyond. 
Thank you all for joining us on our call today, and now Lew, Mike, Andrea, and I would be happy to take questions, which will be followed by brief closing remarks from Lew."

On the factory side, the quarter was extremely strong. And we felt like from a positioning standpoint, while we were able to drive the value in terms of our proposition, we did see some upside there based on ownership of product, the very strong handbag assortment, which drove sales as we went right into peak through Christmas and the week after. So I would say across-the-board, we had strength. We are pleased with the pricing power in handbags, which drove comp in both Full Price and factory. And we had a very strong accessories quarter and it feels like the cycle, from an accessories standpoint, was a driver of comp within the quarter as well."

We've never answered inventory levels with that degree of specificity, but let me just say a couple of things about it. Our inventory investments are nicely aligned with our growth opportunities, and I think so that would spend a number of our initiatives. I would firstly say that our investment in factory inventories allowed us to capture the outperform during the holiday quarter that Mike just spoke to, that we wouldn't have been able to get to this time last year or so that investment was well placed. Also, investment in our Men's initiative is a part of the inventory driver. And then lastly, feeding inventory into the Asia region through the ABC is also a subset of where the inventory growth came from. But the thought I want to leave with in addition to enabling the growth is that our inventories are exceptionally clean and current and really position us well now that maximize sales as we move into the spring quarter, I'm sorry, the spring half of the year."

The way we wanted to ask everyone to think about it, however, is also the guidance that we've given previously, the gross margin rates coming in for the year in the 72% to 73% range are still valid. That guidance that we give a couple of quarters ago, we still feel very good about. And of course, we could go on and list. In addition to the inflationary pressures, all the positive things that we're doing to move gross margin and help to offset those pressures, things like counter-sourcing materials, looking to migrate a substantial amount of our production into lower-cost countries out of China into countries like Vietnam and India as an example. And ultimately with the top line growth in the Asian region, most notably China. We'll start to get some help from channel mix as well.

Point being that we already have so much leverage in this holiday quarter because of the top line growth. So the fact that we outperformed in our North American business, the Japan did as well as it did with a tough market backdrop, really allowed those mature businesses to pull our leverage to the P&L that help us offset our investment spending in Europe, in other parts of Asia, in the new RK brand, et cetera.

Average with handbag over $400, and that's just the benchmark, penetrations were double-digit, north of 10%, which is very good. We will focus on Madison opportunity, particularly given the fashion cycle that we're in around manipulated leathers, gathered leathers, treated leathers, some of the burnishing that we're doing on bags. So that offers us a pricing opportunity on the Full Price side as we move forward as we develop our assortments into spring and next fall. On the factory side, our product mix in factory was very much driven by made-for-factory product. Again, I think we were north of 80% in made-for-factory. In fact, it was 89% for the quarter, probably an all-time high, very little clearance, very little Full Price delete activity in the quarter in the factory channel, and that trend will continue. One of the things that we did this quarter, which helped us on the factory side, is that we corrected a flow imbalance that we had last year where we were chasing inventory in factory and doing a lot of pull-forward on spring goods to sell in the holiday quarter. We corrected that this year, and we are able to maximize the quarter with products that was actually planned within the quarter, and that also positions us very well as we entered into January."

Before we begin, we'd now point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements, including projections for our business in the current or future quarters or fiscal year. These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations and based upon a variety of risks and uncertainties, such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences. Please refer to our latest annual report on Form 10-K for a complete list of these risk factors. Also please note that the historical growth trends may not be indicative of future growth. 
Now let me outline that the speakers and topics for this conference call. Lew Frankfort will provide an overall summary of our second fiscal quarter 2011 results. He will also discuss strategies going forward. Mike Tucci will review the holiday season from the U.S. retail perspective and discuss key initiatives for the spring season ahead. Mike Devine will continue with details on financial and operational results of the quarter. Following that, we will hold a question-and-answer session that will end shortly before 9:30 a.m. We will then conclude with some brief summary comments. 
I'd now like to introduce Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO."

As noted in our release this morning, we were very pleased with our holiday results, including strong sales and earnings growth and exceptional comparable store sales in our North American Retail businesses. Our perf",1001,"Thanks, Andrea, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our release this morning, we were very pleased with our holiday results, including strong sales and earnings growth and exceptional comparable store sales in our North American Retail businesses. Our performance clearly demonstrates the brands of vibrancy across channels and geographies and bodes well for future growth. Beyond the top line, we were also very pleased with our high levels of profitability and substantial cash generation. 
In addition, we made continued progress against our global business initiatives, including international expansion, Men's, and digital media. We experienced strong response to our new collections, and our pricing and assortment strategy continued to resonate with consumers worldwide. We're well situated to build upon our leadership position and continue to gain market share. Further, the announcement today of the authorization of a new buyback program reflects our financial strength and our confidence in Coach's future.
While I will get into more detail about the outlook for the category and our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first. Some key highlights of our second fiscal quarter were: First, earnings per share rose 33% to $1 compared with $0.75 in the prior year; second, quarterly net sales totaled $1.26 billion versus $1.1 billion a year ago, an increase of 19%; third, Direct-to-Consumer sales rose 17% to $1.1 billion from $934 million in the prior year on a comparable basis; fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter accelerated, writing 12.6% from prior year, while total North American Direct-to-Consumer sales rose 17%; and fifth, sales in Japan were even to prior year in constant currency and rose 8% in dollars; and finally, we continue to generate very strong sales growth and significant double digit comps in China.
During the quarter, we opened two North American retail stores both in Canada, as well as one factory store. Thus, at the end of the period, there were 347 Full Price and 129 factory stores in operation in North America. 
Moving to Japan, one Coach shop-in-shop was opened in addition to a travel retail location. At quarter end, they were 171 total locations in Japan with 20 Full Price stores, including eight flagships, 117 shop-in-shops, 27 factory stores and seven distributor-operated travel retail locations.
And in China, we added three new locations all in the mainland. At the end of the quarter, they were 52 Coach locations in China, including 10 in Hong Kong, two in Macau and 40 locations on the mainland in 16 cities. As we've discussed previously, we are building a multichannel distribution model in China, including flagships, retail stores, shop-in-shops and factory stores. 
Indirect sales increased 28% to $168 million from $131 million in the same period last year. This gain reflected significant growth in shipments into international wholesale and U.S. department stores given positive POS sales trends notably in the international business. Specifically, sales for the quarter at retail and international wholesale locations were very strong driven by double-digit gains in same-store sales and new distribution, while sales at POS and U.S. department stores rose 3% for the quarter.
We estimate that the addressable U.S. Handbag and Accessory category rose at a 5% to 10% rate in the holiday quarter, similar to the increase it experienced in the preceding nine months of the calendar year. At the same time, Coach's bag and accessory sales rose about 14% across all channels in North America during the most recent quarter. In our Direct businesses in North America, Handbag and Accessory sales rose 18%. Importantly, it now appears that the category will increase to $9 billion in FY '11, surpassing its previous peak achieved three years ago. 
Separately, it's worth noting that we've seen continued modest improvement in our customer's outlook for the economy with over a third of those surveyed now believing that the U.S. economy is improving, the best reading in over three years. Her intention to purchase Coach over the next year is significantly higher than where it was a year ago, with over 2/3 of consumers surveyed noting they probably or definitely would purchase a Coach product in the next 12 months.
Our total revenues in North America rose 17% with our directly operated businesses up similarly, driven by 12.6% in same-store sales increases and new distribution. Fueling these overall strong comp results were significant gains in conversion from prior year and modest traffic growth, partially offset by a slight decline in average transaction size. We were particularly pleased with the improvement at conversion since it's a driver that we have the most control over through product and service. Mike Tucci will discuss our performance in more detail in just a moment. 
In Full Price stores, conversion was the primary contributor to our comp growth, while average transaction size was also modestly higher compared to prior year. Traffic trends was slightly lower year-over-year. In factory, where our business remained remarkably strong, we saw increases in traffic and conversion, while transaction size declined modestly. Our factory store growth continued to be driven by increased spending of factory channel, loyal Coach shoppers and by new consumers entering the franchise. 
As noted, in Japan, we posted an 8% increase in dollars on a flat performance in constant currency. Our market share further expanded against continued contraction in the category. Our growth in share reflects the relevance of our accessible luxury positioning with the Japanese consumer who is becoming more value-oriented.
Once again, I want to call out China, our fastest-growing business. During the quarter, our sales continued to rise sharply from prior year fueled by distribution growth and significant double-digit comps. Clearly, the Coach proposition is resonating with this consumer who is participating in this category and increasing numbers. While Mike Devine will get into more detail on our financials and I will discuss our outlook in some detail, I wanted to give you this recap. 
Now I will turn it over to Mike Tucci to discuss our North American Retail businesses. Mike?"

Today, I'd like to review what was an exceptional holiday season touching on the three important productivity drivers within our North American business: product performance, digital strategy and coach.com results and progress on our new Men's initiative. 
During the holiday quarter, as always, we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness, ensuring that we had a steady flow of new product throughout the period. A key to this effort was that we are somewhat less front-end loaded than in previous holiday seasons. In October, we relaunched the Madison collection featuring the new Sophia satchel in core leather, gathered leather and novelty applications, along with the fresh dotted op art logo. The reception was excellent and Madison was our top collection for the quarter.
We also benefited from a first-time inclusion on Oprah's favorite things for holiday featuring our large patent Sophia in crimson and camel on network TV. During the quarter, we also updated Poppy and added new colors in our Madison and Kristin collections. In mid-December, we introduced the Alexandra tote group to capture peak sales with new products just before holiday. 
Additionally, we generated excellent sales increases in women's accessories in the quarter, notably in money pieces and small bags. Our holiday product was supported with a comprehensive marketing plan, which highlighted a powerful gifting message for the shopping season. The emphasis of our marketing was item-driven across handbags, women's accessories and other gift ideas. Our campaign span coach.com, digital media and compelling print and in-store marketing to drive traffic into stores and on the Internet. 
Most generally, the merchandising and pricing strategies we initiated last year to create a more balanced and productive handbag assortment have become proven sustainable growth drivers in North America. Both handbags and women's accessories achieved positive comps in the quarter with handbag penetration holding at over 53% of sales with a high single-digit increase and average unit retails. This pricing power was driven by mix as leather and novelty continued to trend very well. 
Looking forward, we're excited about our spring product initiatives as well. We've been pleased with our performance of our newest collection, Colette, which launched on 12/24 featuring new tote, hobo and carryall silhouettes. And for spring, our major product launch is the new Kristin collection, which will be introduced on February 18. Kristin is the strong assortment of beautiful hobos, totes and satchels offered in a range of leathers and novelty fabrications such as embossed python, linen signature and op art, appealing to a broad range of consumers. This relaunch will be supported by a comprehensive broad-based marketing campaign, including window vinyls, special shopping bag and a focused online and print media campaign.
On the factory side, our strong results were fueled by a powerful combination of new product introductions with key styles offered at great prices. Our inventory investment strategy enabled us to capture sales upside throughout the season. Our product assortment was also supported by our in-store and direct marketing campaigns. Importantly, while we're bold in our pricing strategies, the gains in our Factory business drove improved operating margins. As we enter the spring season, we continue to see opportunity to leverage our factory model and increase productivity within this business. 
A second important growth area in the quarter was digital. As we discussed last quarter, coach.com is a key marketing tool and it's becoming a very important revenue opportunity as well. We noted that our primary objective online in North America is to build top-of-mind brand awareness and drive store traffic while also maximizing e-commerce opportunities. In our second quarter, we saw the digital initiatives we've put into place for holiday such as the virtual gift guide and e-gift card pay off in the exceptional performance of our online business. In fact, coach.com is now our fastest growing Full Price channel in North America where both traffic and sales continue to grow at a double-digit pace during the holiday quarter. 
Of course, our web presence is now global with informational sites in 16 countries, three of which U.S., Canada and Japan are e-commerce platforms. More generally, we will continue to use our digital capability as an enabler and customer touch point as we expand the Coach brand globally.
Moving back to our stores, as Lew mentioned, we opened two new retail stores in Q2, Pickering in Ontario and Victoria, British Columbia, taking our first half openings to five, all of which are performing very well and ahead of plan. We also opened one new factory store, taking the first half total to eight, including our first five Men's stand-alone factory stores, which opened in Q1. These stores also opened strongly and are running above our pro formas. 
In Full Price, based on the initial success of our first Men's stand-alone store in Bleecker Street and our Men's sales growth in core Coach stores, we'll be opening two additional Men's retail stores later this fiscal year, including the one at Garden State Plaza in New Jersey and one in Copley Plaza in Boston. This month, we dedicated more space and introduced a broader Men's product assortment to seven additional stores bringing our total Men's concept store count to 37 in North America, including eight flagships such as 595 Madison Avenue in New York.
On the factory side, our Men's stores, which are located next to or nearby our most productive factory locations, are performing extremely well. We believe the strong consumer response we experienced reflect the strength of the Coach brand and the factory consumers focus on value and function. It confirms our belief that there is a particularly large opportunity for Men's in our factory channel. During the remainder of that FY '11, we're planning to open at least five more Men's factory locations.
In summary, we're excited with the continued progress we've made in improving our Full Price productivity and our Men's initiative. We're feeling great about the spring season given the current sales trends in both old Full Price and factory channels. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Lew for a discussion of our strategies and opportunities for growth. Lew?"

Our strategies continue to be focused on expansion opportunities both here in North America and increasingly, in international markets. In addition, as always, we're focused on improving performance in existing stores by increasing Coach's share of our consumers' accessories wardrobe while continuing to attract new customers into the franchise. Mike just discussed our Men's initiative, which we're confident will be a significant contributor to global growth in the seasons and years ahead, both in North America and in international markets. 
Moving on to distribution growth, as mentioned in prior earnings calls, we expected our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 10% this year compared to 8% last year. Starting in North America, we will open about five stores in the back half of fiscal 2011, bringing the total to about 10 new North American retail stores for the year. In addition, we'll open about 12 new factory stores during the balance of the year primarily to support our Men's initiative. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 8% this year, similar to last year. 
In China, as mentioned, our sales are growing rapidly as the market continues to develop swiftly. Last year, we doubled sales to over $100 million and are on track to generate sales of over $175 million this year. We are also now targeting $500 million in sales during FY '14, a 10% market share compared with 5% today. Driving this growth in addition to same-store sales, we expect to open about 25 new locations this year, increasing square footage by about 65%. Over the next few years, we're targeting to open about 30 new locations per annum. These locations will be primarily focused on the mainland and mirror our multichannel distribution model in North America and Japan. 
In Japan, the overall consumer market remains very challenging, and the category continues to contract. Our goal continues to be market share gains, and we have done this quite well in our core Women's business. As elsewhere, we're now also focusing on Men's, where we've already seen early success. This year, we now expect to open about 10 net new Coach Japan locations, including five Men's stores. In total, we expect the net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 6% this year, similar to last year.
Beyond our directly owned businesses in China and Japan, we have a significant international wholesale business, generating over $400 million in sales at retail. Most of these sales come from other markets in Asia where the Coach brand resonates well and includes a sizable travel retail business catering to the growing population of Asian travelers. Given our focus in this area, we're also opening about 25 new distributor-operated locations in the Asian region during this fiscal year.
Moving to Europe, it is a new region of expansion for Coach. To date, we've opened six boutiques in Printemps Department stores in France and expect to open one additional location within Printemps during the balance of the fiscal year. And through our joint venture with Hackett, we've launched the brand with four shop-in-shops in Spain and one in Lisbon with one more to go before year end, all within El Corte Inglés. 
Last quarter, we also announced plans for our initial stores in London, a stand-alone store in the Westfield White City Mall, which is on plan to open in late February and a 5,100 square foot flagship on New Bond Street, our first global flagship store in the region coming this summer. We've been pleased with our initial results in Europe as our brand gains recognition with the domestic consumer and benefits from our popularity among tourists notably those who are Asian based. 
Beyond the opportunities in the Coach concept and brand, as you know, we launched Reed Krakoff in September and a few boutiques in the U.S. and Japan, as well as two prestigious international specialty retailers such as Lane Crawford in Hong Kong and Colette in Paris. While it's still very early days, we are pleased that the product is appealing to the targeted pinnacle luxury consumer. 
In summary, we are excited about the global opportunity for Coach especially the emerging market potential given the rapid growth of the category and the foundation, which we have begun to build in the important Asian region. 
At this time, I will turn it over to Mike Devine, our CFO, for further detail on our financials. Mike?"

Lew and Mike have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our second quarter results.

Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our second quarter results. As mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 19% with Direct-to-Consumer, which represents over three quarters of our business, up 17% and Indirect up 28% due to higher shipments into international wholesale accounts and the U.S. department stores. 
Earnings per share for the quarter increased 33% to $1 even as compared to $0.75 in the year ago period as net income rose to $303 million from $241 million. Our operating income totaled $453 million in the second quarter, up 19% from $381 million in the same period last year. Operating margin in the quarter was 35.9% compared to 35.8% in the year-ago period. 
In the second quarter, gross profit rose 19% to $915 million from $771 million a year ago, and gross margin rate remained strong at 72.4% even with the prior year. Gross margin reflected the impact of channel mix and continued high levels of promotional activity in our factory channels, offset by sourcing cost improvements. 
Moving to expenses. We were pleased that we were able to gain modest leverage in the holiday quarter, which is our toughest quarter to do so. Specifically, SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales improved from prior year levels in the second quarter and represented 36.5% of sales versus 36.6% last year. Once again, our two primary direct businesses here in North America and in Japan both provided leverage not only to their own P&Ls but to the corporate P&L as well, more than offsetting the impact of our investment spending. We believe we're striking the right balance between driving future growth opportunities and operating efficiently.
Inventories at quarter end were $367 million, up 36% from the end of last year's Q2 but down 4% on a two-year basis. Clearly, these inventory levels were key to delivering the exceptional holiday quarter. Our current inventories support the strong underlying business trends and will allow us to maximize sales this spring. Generally, it's worth noting that we've been rightsizing our inventories this year, bringing them up to more appropriate levels to support our growing businesses, including new growth initiatives such as Men's, global expansion and our new distribution center in Asia. 
Cash and short-term investments stood at $940 million as compared with $1.1 billion a year ago, despite repurchases of nearly $1.4 billion worth of Coach common stock in the interim 12 months. During the second quarter, we repurchased and retired nearly 7 million shares of our common stock at an average cost of $55.72, spending a total of $388 million.
Net cash from operating activities in the second quarter was $408 million compared to $364 million last year during Q2. Free cash flow in the second quarter was an inflow of $382 million versus $347 million in the same period last year, due to higher net income offset by working capital items; our CapEx spending was $26 million versus $17 million in the same quarter a year ago. As we stated on our last two earnings calls, based on our plans for the year, we expect the CapEx will be about $150 million in FY '11, primarily for the opening of new stores across all geographies. 
Naturally, we were very pleased to report these strong financial results and as Lew and Mike have said, we're well positioned for the back half of our fiscal year. While we do not give specific guidance, as you know, I always think it's helpful for you modelers out there to keep a few things in mind when looking at the year. First, and most generally, we continue to target double-digit sales increases globally with double-digit earnings growth. And given the ongoing strength in our business, we now believe that we'll achieve high single-digit same-store sales growth in North America for the balance of the fiscal year, even in the face of more difficult spring compares. This is up from last quarter when we projected mid-single-digit growth. Additionally, we expect the continuation of our positive POS trends in our Indirect businesses. However, our second-half comparisons will be impacted by the timing of shipments in those Indirect businesses and the extra week in the prior year's fourth quarter. As you may recall, that extra week contributed $70 million of sales and $0.08 of EPS. 
Second, we were excited that our top line sales growth drove higher levels of profitability in the first half, and while our previous comments regarding second-half gross margins still stand, our sales growth, coupled with controlled spending, will help offset both product cost and channel mix pressures. Therefore, we are reiterating our previous guidance of a full year FY '11 operating margin at about last year's level of about 31.5% on a 52-week basis. 
Third, our tax rate is likely to stay in the area achieved in the first six months for the balance of the year as we continue to refine our international tax strategies. 
Fourth, I wanted to briefly touch on share count. We would expect second-half share count to be similar to where we ended second quarter. 
Before we open it up for Q&A, I wanted to echo Lew's earlier words. This was an exceptional quarter for Coach. Clearly, our holiday results bode well for the future, and we're confident that we'll continue to deliver very strong sales and earnings gains over the balance of the fiscal year and beyond. 
Thank you all for joining us on our call today, and now Lew, Mike, Andrea, and I would be happy to take questions, which will be followed by brief closing remarks from Lew."

We continue to see that channel grow from an interaction standpoint, as well as being able to drive revenue there. So that was very pleasing to us, and that did provide some upside. On the factory side, the quarter was extremely strong. And we felt like from a positioning standpoint, while we were able to drive the value in terms of our proposition, we did see some upside there based on ownership of product, the very strong handbag assortment, which drove sales as we went right into peak through Christmas and the week after. So I would say across-the-board, we had strength. We are pleased with the pricing power in handbags, which drove comp in both Full Price and factory. And we had a very strong accessories quarter and it feels like the cycle, from an accessories standpoint, was a driver of comp within the quarter as well."

We've never answered inventory levels with that degree of specificity, but let me just say a couple of things about it. Our inventory investments are nicely aligned with our growth opportunities, and I think so that would spend a number of our initiatives. I would firstly say that our investment in factory inventories allowed us to capture the outperform during the holiday quarter that Mike just spoke to, that we wouldn't have been able to get to this time last year or so that investment was well placed. Also, investment in our Men's initiative is a part of the inventory driver. And then lastly, feeding inventory into the Asia region through the ABC is also a subset of where the inventory growth came from. But the thought I want to leave with in addition to enabling the growth is that our inventories are exceptionally clean and current and really position us well now that maximize sales as we move into the spring quarter, I'm sorry, the spring half of the year."

The way we wanted to ask everyone to think about it, however, is also the guidance that we've given previously, the gross margin rates coming in for the year in the 72% to 73% range are still valid. That guidance that we give a couple of quarters ago, we still feel very good about. And of course, we could go on and list. In addition to the inflationary pressures, all the positive things that we're doing to move gross margin and help to offset those pressures, things like counter-sourcing materials, looking to migrate a substantial amount of our production into lower-cost countries out of China into countries like Vietnam and India as an example. And ultimately with the top line growth in the Asian region, most notably China. We'll start to get some help from channel mix as well. So there are a number of positives going on in the gross margin line that will help mitigate on the inflationary pressures."

And I really want to be clear on the factory side. We do have pricing power. We were aggressive in the quarter. However, we were able to protect margins from a gross margin standpoint in factory and we drove tremendous operating margins. That effort positions us very well on the back half to continue to focus on unit retail gains and the factory channel productivity gains in the factory channel and drive operating margin."

And the reason there is, if you look across the four quarters of the year, you'll see that Q2 last year was in the mid-30s where at the balance of the quarter for the year are in the 43%, 44% range in terms of SG&A as a percentage of sales. Point being that we already have so much leverage in this holiday quarter because of the top line growth. So the fact that we outperformed in our North American business, that Japan did as well as it did with a tough market backdrop, really allowed those mature businesses to pull our leverage to the P&L that help us offset our investment spending in Europe, in other parts of Asia, in the new RK brand, et cetera.

Average with handbag over $400, and that's just the benchmark, penetrations were double-digit, north of 10%, which is very good. We will focus on that opportunity, particularly given the fashion cycle that we're in around manipulated leathers, gathered leathers, treated leathers, some of the burnishing that we're doing on bags. So that offers us a pricing opportunity on the Full Price side as we move forward as we develop our assortments into spring and next fall. On the factory side, our product mix in factory was very much driven by made-for-factory product. Again, I think we were north of 80% in made-for-factory. In fact, it was 89% for the quarter, probably an all-time high, very little clearance, very little Full Price delete activity in the quarter in the factory channel, and that trend will continue. One of the things that we did this quarter, which helped us on the factory side, is that we corrected a flow imbalance that we had last year where we were chasing inventory in factory and doing a lot of pull-forward on spring goods to sell in the holiday quarter. We corrected that this year, and we are able to maximize the quarter with products that was actually planned within the quarter, and that also positions us very well as we entered into January."

As noted in our release this morning, we were very pleased with our quarterly results, including store sales and earnings growth and the continuation of excellent comparable store sales in our North American Retail b",1975,"Thanks, Andrea, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our release this morning, we were very pleased with our quarterly results, including store sales and earnings growth and the continuation of excellent comparable store sales in our North American Retail businesses. Our performance clearly demonstrates the brand vitality across channels, geographies and bodes well for the future. Further, the ability to generate these results in light of the tragic events and their aftermath in Japan speaks to the diversification of our business model and the strength of our proposition globally. Beyond the top line, we are also very pleased with our high levels of profitability and substantial cash generation.
In addition, we make continued progress against our global business initiatives, including international expansion, men's and digital media. We experienced strong response to our new collection and our pricing and assortment strategy continued to resonate with consumers worldwide. We're well situated to build upon our leadership position and continue to gain market share. Further, the announcement today of the increased dividend reflects our financial strength and our confidence in Coach's future.
Before I review the quarter and provide an outlook for the category and our business, I would be remiss not to touch on the tragedy in Japan. Of course, we have been saddened by the devastation in Japan, but we're relieved to learn within days of the earthquake and tsunami that all Coach colleagues was  accounted for and safe. When I visited Japan this early April, I was impressed by the resiliency of the people and the progress made in restoring more normal conditions. And I was moved by the incredible spirit and tenacity of our own Coach Japan colleagues who rallied together during a very difficult time.
Moving on to some key highlights of our third fiscal quarter. First, earnings per share rose 23% to $0.62 compared with $0.50 in the prior year. Second, quarterly net sales totaled $951 million versus $831 million a year ago, an increase of 14%. Third, Direct-to-Consumer sales rose 15% to $832 million from $726 million in the prior year. Fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter are robust right in 10% from prior year, while total North American Direct-to-Consumer sales rose 16%. And fifth, sales in Japan were down 9% to prior year in constant currency and rose 1% in dollars. And finally, we continued to generate very strong sales growth and significant double digit comps in China.
During the quarter, and as part of our regular real estate review, we closed 3 North American Retail stores, while we opened 5 factory stores. Thus, at the end of the period, there were 344 full price and 134 factory stores in operation in North America.
Moving to Japan. 4 locations were opened and 1 was closed. At quarter end, there were 174 total locations in Japan with 19 Full Price stores, including 8 flagships, 119 shop-in-shops, 29 factory stores and 7 distributor-operated travel retail locations. As noted in our release, 7 stores in the Sendai area remained closed due to damage at quarter end with 3 reopened this month. And in China, we added 4 new locations all in the mainland and closed 1 store in Hong Kong. At the end of the quarter, there were 55 Coach locations in China, including 9 in Hong Kong, 2 in Macau and 44 locations on the mainland in 18 cities. As we discussed previously, there are nearly 120 cities in China with a population of 1 million or more, and we are building a multichannel distribution model with a focus on the mainland to leverage this opportunity.
Indirect Sales increased to 14% to $119 million from $105 million in the same period last year. This gain reflected significant growth in shipments and to international wholesale in U.S. department stores given positive POS sales trends in both businesses. Specifically, sales for the quarter at retail in the international wholesale locations was strong driven by new distribution, while sales at POS and U.S. department stores rose 20% for the quarter.
We estimate that the addressable U.S. Handbag and Accessory category rose at a 5% to 10% rate in the third quarter, similar to the increase it experienced in calendar year 2010. At the same time, Coach's bag and accessories sales rose about 13% across all channels in North America during the most recent quarter. And our direct business is in North America, handbag and accessory sales rose 17%. We continue to estimate that the category will increase to $9 billion this year, surpassing its previous peak achieved 3 years ago.
Separately, it's worth noting our customers outlet for the economy has been stable over the last few quarters with a third of those surveyed still believing that the U.S. economy is improving. Our intention to purchase Coach remains high with all the 2/3 of consumers surveyed noting they probably or definitely would purchase a Coach product in the next 12 months. 
Our total revenues in North America rose 16% with our directly operated businesses up similarly, driven by 10.3% in same-store sales increases and new distribution. Fueling these overall store and comp results were similarly strong gains in both channels with significant gains in conversion from prior year and a modest growth in average transaction size, partially offset by a decline in traffic due to the calendar shift. We were particularly pleased with the improvement in conversion rates since it's a driver that we have the most control over in product and service.
We have also been delighted by our traction on the web notably in the North American coach.com business. While we view this channel primarily as a marketing vehicle, traffic and sales at our site continue to grow at a double-digit pace during the third quarter, driven by our base business, as well as our efforts in social media where we now have over 1.8 million Facebook fans. 
Additionally, next month, we're looking forward to the launch of mobile commerce in North America, another digital platform for customers to engage with our brand. As noted in Japan, we posted a 1% increase in dollar, a decline of 9% in constant currency. It's worth noting that prior to the events of March 11, we were on track to deliver another quarter of slight growth in yen terms. Our market share further expanded against continued contraction in the category. 
Once again, I want to call out China, our fastest-growing business. During the quarter, our sales continued to rise rapidly from prior year, fueled by distribution growth and significant double digit comps. Clearly, the Coach proposition is resonating with this consumer who is participating in this category increasing numbers. Victor will talk more about our opportunity in China shortly.
Across all Full Price businesses, our robust results reflect the strength of our offering. As always, we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness. Beginning on December 24, we transitioned to spring with the introduction of the Colette collection across multiple fabrications and silhouettes anchored by our both hobo and toad styles. This was followed with the relaunch of Poppy in February and a new Kristin collection in March. With its distinctive hardware and soft feminine styling, Kristin is an important collection for Coach and has been a feature of our spring ad campaign. This season's product was very well received, and both handbags and women's accessories achieved strong comps in the quarter with handbag penetration in our North American Retail stores rising to 60% from 59% last year, driven by unit comp sales increases and a slight increase in average unit retails.
Just this month, we introduced the collection of Nathalie store to along the new color and a dream see print and Poppy. And last week, we launched Audrey, a modern toad store featuring perforated leather, and print concepts. Additionally, our lead collection for Mothers' Day is Madison offered in fresh colors and patterns. For June, we're introducing new leather and pattern colors at Kristin, as well as a strong new offering. Our Kristin hobo continues to be the key item within the collection.
In addition, this July, we will launch a new Chelsea collection and evolve Poppy with updated style, patterns and prints. On the factory side, our strong results were fueled by a powerful combination of new product introductions with key styles offered at great prices. Additionally, our inventory investment strategy enabled us to capture sales upside throughout the quarter. Our product assortment was also supported by our in-store and direct marketing campaigns.
I also wanted to spend a moment

, which are productive factory locations are performing extremely well. We believe the strong consumer response we're experiencing reflects the strength of the Coach brand and the factory consumers' focus on value and function. It confirms our belief that there is a particularly large opportunity for Men's in our factory channel. 
In summary, we're excited with the continued progress we've made in improving our overall Full Price productivity. In addition, we're very pleased with the current sales trends in both our Full Price and factory channels and are well positioned for Mother's Day and the balance of the spring season. Our strategies continue to be focused on expansion opportunities both here and North America and increasingly in the international markets. In addition, as always, we are focused on improving performance in existing stores by increasing Coach's share of our consumers accessories wardrobe, while continuing to attract new customers into the franchise. I just discussed our immense initiative which we're confident will be a significant contributor to global growth in the seasons and years ahead.
Moving on to distribution growth. As mentioned in previous earnings calls, we expect a lot of square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 10% this year, compared to 8% last year. Starting in North America, we will open 3 stores in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, bringing the total to 8 new North American Retail stores for the year. In addition, we will open 9 new factory stores during the balance of the year, primarily on our Men's initiative, bringing the total to 14 dedicated Men's factory stores and 8 traditional factory stores for the year. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 8% this year.
I want to finally touch on Europe, a new region of expansion for Coach. To date, we have opened 7 boutiques and Printemps Department Stores in France. And through our JV with Hackett, relaunched the brand with 4 shop-in-shops in Spain and 1 in Lisbon with 1 more to go before year end, all within our. Last month, we opened our first retail store in the U.K. in the Westfield White City Mall and have been very pleased with its early results. 
Beyond the opportunities in the Coach concept and brand, as you know, we launched in September, and a few boutiques in the U.S. and Japan, as well as prestigious international specialty retailers, While still very early days, we are pleased that the product is appealing to the targeted pinnacle larger luxury consumer, and we were very pleased to announce the appointment of Ellery Herman, as President and CEO, who joined us just this month from YSL.
Early this fiscal year, we announced the creation of a new international retail organization with 3 major Asian hubs: Japan, mainland China and other Asian markets. We also announced the addition of 3 senior executives who will enable Coach to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities that exist for the brand in the region. Key to this new organization was the promotion of Victor Luis to the newly created position as President, Coach Retail International with the responsibility for all of Coach's directly owned businesses outside North America. 
I will now and the turn the call over to Victor. Victor?"

To put the opportunity in perspective, the premium bag and accessory market in Asia, including Japan, is nearly $12 billion today. And in contrast to the global market, which is about 85% women's and 15% men's, in Asia, Men's represent nearly 1 quarter of the spend. Excluding Japan, the market is growing at a double-digit rate led by mainland China. In addition, Hong Kong, Korea and Southeast Asia are all expected to grow at more than 10% for the next several years, while Taiwan is projected to grow at a slightly slower pace. Overall, the region offers excellent potential where we can leverage our well-honed retail skills and international experience to drive the business as we have been in Japan and are now doing in China. Coach is already among the top 5 brands in these markets with at least a mid-single-digit share, and we have proven strategies in place to increase brand awareness and grow sales.
In Japan, the overall consumer market had been challenging for some years and the category has contracted. Our goal was and continues to be market share gains, and we have done this quite well in our core Women's business. As elsewhere, we're now also focusing on Men's where we've already seen early success. 
As Lew noted earlier, we do expect the continued impact from the tragedy over the next few months, primarily a function of reduced traffic as the infrastructure problems in the northern and eastern parts of the country remained resulting in transportation and power issues. However, far in further significant aftershocks or worsening of the nuclear crisis, we expect our business to continue to show steady improvement. We expect to open 2 more stores in the fourth quarter for a total of 9 new Coach Japan locations, including 5 Men's stores for the year. In total, we expect the net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 4% this year, similar to last year.
Moving on to China, our largest geographic growth opportunity, where our sales are growing rapidly against a strong market backdrop. We will be adding 11 locations in the fourth quarter, 9 on the mainland and 2 in Hong Kong, taking us to 26 openings for the year and a total of 66 locations. As you know, we doubled sales in FY '10 to over $100 million and are now on track to generate sales of about $185 million this year, up from our estimates of $175 million shared on our last earnings call. We are targeting a 10% market share of what is projected to be over a $5 billion market or about $500 million in sales by FY '14, up from about a 5% share today.
Driving this growth, we expect to add about 30 new locations per annum during our planning horizon, focused on the mainland and across a multichannel model, including flagship, stand-alone retail stores, shop-in-shops and department stores and factory stores. 
In addition, based on our conversion opportunity against already strong traffic trends as the consumer becomes increasingly qualified to purchase luxury accessories, we expect to continue to achieve double-digit comp rates over this planning horizon. In fact, our research indicates that the purchase of population is growing at nearly 20% annually, driven by the growth in the target segment, primarily through income gains and the increasing participation rate in the category itself. We would also note that in China, Men's participate heavily in the category both for self purchase and for gifting to other men and represent nearly half of the spend and up to 50% or more of our competitive set sales, yielding another opportunity for Coach. 
Further, as we grow awareness in China, we benefit globally from the growth in mainland China tourists as they visit and shop in key capitals around the world. In fact, we estimate that sales to mainland Chinese nationals represent as much as 25% of sales globally to our major competitors. Today, sales to Chinese nationals represent only 5% of Coach's global sales. Therefore, there is tremendous opportunity for us to take a larger share of a growing market where our proposition is clearly resonating and we are building our distribution, team and awareness will lead to continued growth. As you may remember, China is the market where Coach enjoys its highest repurchase intent among existing consumers with over 90% of Coach shoppers expressing a positive intent to repurchase.
In FY '12, we will make significant investments towards awareness building as we leverage a 70th anniversary campaign as a foundation to build on our positioning as the New York fashion brand grounded in heritage and history. This integrated campaign will have several key elements, including an international brand ambassador, Gwyneth Paltrow, who has proven relevancy in China and other international markets.
Beyond our directly owned business in China, we have significant wholesale businesses throughout Asia, and Lew referred to the strong sales growth we're experiencing in this channel earlier. Some months ago, we announced that we signed an agreement to take control of our Domestic Retail businesses in Singapore and Malaysia, which together generate annual sales at retail of about $50 million. The agreement provides for a phase transition of the current Coach retail businesses over the next year beginning this July with Singapore. While the impact of the transition will be small, it is an important step towards controlling our future in Asia. We are especially excited about the new Singapore flagship on prestigious Orchard Road, which will be at a directly operated store opening in spring 2012. It will immediately raise brand awareness as Singapore is an important tourist gateway in Southeast Asia, serving the Indonesian and Indian shopper, while increasingly attracting mainland Chinese consumers as well.
We also have significant and growing distributor-run businesses in Korea, the second largest market for premium leather goods after Japan and the region; and Taiwan. Together, they represent about $200 million at retail for Coach in FY '11, serving both the domestic and travel retail customer through about 80 locations, over 50 in Korea and 30 in Taiwan. Given our focus in the region during this fiscal year of the nearly 40 targeted new international wholesale locations, more than 20 will be in Asia. 
Separately, it's important to note that our Asia distribution center and Asia Shared Services Center are online, shipping globally and prepared to provide savings while also serving as a back office backbone for Coach China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and any future directly operated markets in the region. Simply put, it is ready to be scaled for leverage across the region. 
In summary, we are excited about the global opportunity for Coach especially the emerging market potential given the rapid growth of the category and the foundation, which we have begun to build in the key Asia region. 
At this time, I will turn it over to Mike Devine, our CFO, for further details on our financials. Mike?"

As mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 14% with Direct-to-Cons",1134,"Thank you, Victor. Lew and Victor had just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our third quarter results. As mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 14% with Direct-to-Consumer represents over 3 quarters of our business up 15% and Indirect up 14%. Earnings per share for the quarter increased 23% to $0.62 as compared to $0.50 in the year ago period as net income rose to $186 million from $158 million. 
As noted in the press release, we estimate that the events in Japan impacted sales by approximately $20 million and earnings per share by about $2.50 during March and the third quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, our operating income totaled $280 million in the third quarter, up 12% from $249 million in the same period last year. Operating margin in the quarter was 29.4% compared to 30% even in the year ago period.
In the third quarter, gross profit rose to $692 million from $616 million a year ago, and gross margin rate remained strong at 72.8% compared with 74.1% a year ago, reflecting the impact of higher sourcing costs.
Moving to expenses. We were pleased that we were able to gain 70 basis points of leverage in the quarter. Specifically, SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales, also on a non-GAAP basis, improved from prior year levels in the third quarter and represented 43.4% of sales versus 44.1%. Once again, our primary direct businesses here in North America and in Japan provided leverage to the corporate P&L, more than offsetting the impact of our investment spending. We believe we're striking the right balance between driving future growth opportunities and operating efficiencies.
As noted in our press release, we recorded certain onetime items during the third quarter, which resulted in a substantially lower tax rate of 26.5%. These included a favorable settlement of a multiyear tax return examination, which decreased Coach's provision for taxes by $16 million. In addition, the company made a $21 million contribution to the Coach foundation and also contributing JPY 400 million or just under $5 million to the Japanese Red Cross. Together, these contributions totaled nearly $26 million pretax, impacting GAAP SG&A expenses by that amount and precisely offsetting the benefit of the tax settlement to net income and EPS.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Inventories at quarter end were $391 million, up 28% from the end of last year's Q3 but up 9% on a two-year basis. Our current inventory support the strong underlying business trends and will allow us to maximize sales this spring. Generally, it's worth reminding everyone that we've been rightsizing our inventory this year, bring it up to more appropriate levels to support our growth. Including new initiatives such as Men's, global square footage expansion, Reed Krakoff and our new distribution center in Asia. 
Cash and short-term investments total $886 million as compared with $908 million a year ago despite repurchases of nearly $1.2 billion worth of Coach common stock in the interim 12 months. During the third quarter, we repurchased and retired 3.5 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $54.51 per share, spending a total of $192 million. At the end of the period, approximately $1.3 billion remained under our repurchase authorization.
Net cash from operating activities in the third quarter was $227 million compared to $205 million last year during Q3. Free cash flow in the third quarter was an inflow of $186 million versus $190 million in the same period last year due to higher net income, offset by working capital and fixed asset expenditures. 
Our CapEx spending was $42 million versus $15 million in the same quarter a year ago. As we stated on our last earnings call, based on our plans for the year, we expect that CapEx will be about $150 million, primarily for the opening of new stores across all geographies. Naturally, we were very pleased to report these strong financial results. And as Lew has said, we're well positioned for the remainder of the fiscal year. While we do not give specific guidance, as you know, I always think it's helpful for you modelers out there to keep a few things in mind when forecasting the finish of our year.
First and most generally, we continue to target double-digit sales increases globally with double-digit earnings growth. And given the ongoing strength in our business, we now believe that we'll achieve high single-digit same-store sales growth in North America for the fourth quarter even in the face of more difficult compares. Additionally, we expect the continuation of our positive POS trends in our Indirect businesses. 
As noted in our release, given current conditions and projections for Japan, we expect a similar impact in the full fourth quarter of about $20 million or 2% to total Coach sales and about $0.02 to $0.03 to earnings per share. However, as discussed on prior calls, our fourth quarter comparisons will be impacted by the timing of shipments in our Indirect businesses and the extra week in the prior year's fourth quarter. As you may recall, this extra week contributed $70 million of sales and $0.08 of EPS to last year's Q4.
Second, we were excited that our top line sales growth drove higher levels of profitability in the first 9 months of the year. While our previous comments regarding gross margins still stand, our sales growth, coupled with controlled spending, will help offset both cost and channel mix pressures. Therefore, we're reiterating our previous guidance of a full year FY '11 operating margin at about last year's levels of about 31.5% on a 52-week basis, despite the quake-related shortfall in our very profitable Japan business. Third, our non-GAAP tax rate is likely to stay in the area achieved in the first 9 months for the balance of the year as we further refine our international tax strategies. And fourth, I did want to update our share count guidance. We now believe that our fourth quarter average will be similar to 3Q at about $302 million on a fully diluted basis.
Before we open it up for Q&A, I want to echo Lew's earliest words. This was another excellent quarter for Coach. Clearly, our results bode well for the future, and we're confident that we'll continue to urban we strong sales and earnings gains for the foreseeable future. Thank you all for joining us and our conference call today. And now Lew, Victor, Mike Tucci, Andrea and I will take some questions, which will then be followed by a brief comment from Lew who is I'm sure you can tell is suffering from a touch of laryngitis but is hanging in boldly. So now we'll open the floor up to questions. Thank you."

Firstly, we do sell through at a premium for North America pricing in the region, not premiums as rich as Japan's but in the neighborhood. And so our gross margin rates in China are quite robust rivaling even that of the Japan business. In terms of store four-wall, we are already seeing 4 walls nicely into the 40% range and so that's driven of course by that gross margin rate. But also as you might suspect, our store wages are lower in China than they are anywhere else in the world, contributing to healthy four-wall. And as we gain in productivity and the brand gains awareness with landlords, we'll see our occupancy rate. The other big expense items on the store P&L begin to decline as a percentage of sales further enhancing store 4 walls. Victor mentioned in his prepared remarks our approach to the region with an Asian distribution center and an Asia shared service center. So we're keyed to drive an efficient backlog infrastructure to support, while the China business and Pan-Asian approach. So all of those things taken together a lot of words will drive very, very healthy rates of profit and volume of profits from the region as we move into '12 and beyond."

Clearly, with Japan being 1 of the highest gross margin regions, losing that $20 million was a gross margin rate but relatively immaterial. We certainly would've recorded a modestly higher gross margin rate, but it is a small percentage of the total company's business and we were able to absorb it. I would add, though, I have to take this opportunity that had we had the $20 million of sales and about $0.025 of earnings, we would have actually seen operating margin that leverage. We were did come up just short of Q3's op income level. Had we had the $20 million of that very profitable Japanese business, we would've seen operating margin improvement, which I have to say coming into the quarter I do not think was going to be possible. So the business operated very efficiently across all geographies and mature businesses during the quarter. Similarly, I would just say for the fourth quarter, same dynamic in our own projections that we've just kind of shared with you we will see some very modest operating margin deleverage for the quarter. We wouldn't have gotten operating margin leverage had we not had the quake impact. Of course these are all forward-looking statements now to talk about fourth quarter. But I do think it demonstrates the diversity of our business model globally that we're able to absorb this profitable loss and still project that we can hit 31.5% of op income for the year, kind of what we've been pointing to for a number of quarters now. So the way I'm thinking about that is an increasing guidance, if you will, adjusted for the quake impact."

For the balance of FY '11 you'll recall that we were 1 of the first companies to talk about inflationary pressures well over a year ago, and that's holding. That being said, there are a number of positive things going on within gross margin to help offset these pressures, and we're optimistic that we see some modest sequential improvement actually in the first half of our FY '12, the back half of this calendar year versus the second half of our FY '11. It's because of counter-sourcing efforts. Material inflation will not hit us as hard as others. The other thing that will be helpful as we also begin to anniversary those higher input costs from early last year's fiscal '11. Wage inflation is our biggest issue and we're battling that by moving product into lower-cost countries. We're ahead of schedule on this initiative, but it is still very early days there. And so while we are protecting our opening price points, we are also surgically taking advantage of pricing power, and we're doing this in both channels, both in our Full Price and our factory channel. The other thing we'll start to see, which will be very helpful is channel mix will actually begin to help us, we believe, as we move into FY '12, which will be a nice thing as growth in the Asian region that Victor spoke to helps channel mix there and also just the underlying trends at our Full Price business in our mature markets of North America and Japan will also help channel mix. So we still are feeling good about our previous guidance gross margin in the boundary of 72% to 73%. Going forward, we feel it very achievable."

In each of our geographies, we have in market merchants who constantly with the support of our consumer insights team are looking to understand the consumer and provide the design team with some logic to add to the magic that they of course do in designing the product. We have a very strong merchant team in Japan. We have today a merchant team in Shanghai, as well as Hong Kong, that is developing. And those teams provide the inputs into New York and then we'll buy from a global assortments, which occasionally of course is tweaked to meet local needs. On the whole, though, I would say that our assortments are rather global. In Japan, China, collections such as Madison, Poppy and Kristin, which today are the main drivers in the North American business are also main drivers for us in the region. There may be some functional areas that we have to tweak, whether it will be smaller goods or in handbags. As an example, for example, in handbags across Asia, across body bags given the amount of commuting that takes place do tend to have a higher penetration than say here in North America. That is something that we simply input into our buys locally. And I think 1 of the most important differences, as I mentioned in my remarks, is the Men's opportunity. In Japan, the Men's market of that $4 billion size today, represents approximately 20%. In mainland China, it can represent 50% to more to most of our competitor brands, and it's approaching about 50% of the market, again in Hong Kong, Macau and the rest of the region and we're looking at 25% to 30% as well. And so our in market merchants teams are working very, very closely with our central merchandising teams and our design team to ensure that those very specific needs of that specific Asian male consumer are met. And so it's highly collaborative efforts with a tremendous amount of consumer insights, as well as of course the design talent, which is very much focused on presenting 1 New York Coach aesthetic to the world based here in New York."

Of course, we have been saddened by the devastation in Japan, but we're relieved to learn within days of the earthquake and tsunami that all Coach colleagues was  accounted for and safe. 
When I visited Japan this early April, I was impressed by the resiliency of the people and the progress made in restoring more noble conditions. And I was moved by the incredible spirit and tenacity of our own Coach Japan colleagues, who rallied together during a very difficult time.
Moving on to some key highlights of our third fiscal quarter. First, earnings per share rose 23% to $0.62 compared with $0.50 in the prior year. Second, quarterly net sales totaled $951 million versus $831 million a year ago, an increase of 14%. Third, Direct-to-Consumer sales rose 15% to $832 million from $726 million in the prior year. Fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter are robust, rising 10% from prior year, while total North American Direct-to-Consumer sales rose 16%. And fifth, sales in Japan were down 9% to prior year in constant currency and rose 1% in dollars. And finally, we continued to generate very strong sales growth and significant double-digit comps in China.
During the quarter, and as part of our regular real estate review, we closed 3 North American Retail stores, while we opened 5 factory stores. Thus, at the end of the period, there were 344 full price and 134 factory stores in operation in North America.
Moving to Japan. 4 locations were opened and 1 was closed. At quarter end, there were 174 total locations in Japan with 19 full price stores, including 8 flagships, 119 shop-in-shops, 29 factory stores and 7 distributor-operated travel retail locations. As noted in our release, 7 stores in the Sendai area remained closed due to damage at quarter end, with 3 reopened this month. And in China, we added 4 new locations all in the mainland and closed 1 store in Hong Kong. 
At the end of the quarter, there were 55 Coach locations in China, including 9 in Hong Kong, 2 in Macau and 44 locations on the mainland in 18 cities. As we've discussed previously, there are nearly 120 cities in China with a population of 1 million or more, and we are building a multichannel distribution model with a focus on the mainland to leverage this opportunity.
Indirect sales increased 14% to $119 million from $105 million in the same period last year. This gain reflected significant growth in shipments and to international wholesale in U.S. department stores given positive POS sales trends in both businesses. Specifically, sales for the quarter at retail in international wholesale locations was strong, driven by new distribution, while sales at POS and U.S. department stores rose 4% for the quarter.
We estimate that the addressable U.S. handbag and accessory category rose at a 5% to 10% rate in the third quarter, similar to the increase it experienced in calendar year 2010. At the same time, Coach's bag and accessories sales rose about 13% across all channels in North America during the most recent quarter. In our Direct businesses in North America, handbag and accessory sales rose 17%. We continue to estimate that the category will increase to $9 billion this year, surpassing its previous peak achieved 3 years ago.
Separately, it's worth noting, our customers' outlook for the economy has been stable over the last few quarters, with a third of those surveyed still believing that the U.S. economy is improving. Their intention to purchase Coach remains high with over 2/3 of consumers surveyed noting they probably or definitely would purchase a Coach product in the next 12 months. 
Our total revenues in North America rose 16%, with our directly operated businesses up similarly, driven by 10.3% in same-store sales increases and new distribution. Fueling these overall store and comp results were similarly strong gains in both channels with significant gains in conversion from prior year and a modest growth in average transaction size, partially offset by a decline in traffic due to the calendar shift. We were particularly pleased with the improvement in conversion rates since it's a driver that we have the most control over in product and service.
We have also been delighted by our traction on the Web notably the North American coach.com business. While we view this channel primarily as a marketing vehicle, traffic and sales at our site continue to grow at a double-digit pace during the third quarter, driven by our base business, as well as our efforts in social media where we now have over 1.8 million Facebook fans. 
Additionally, next month, we're looking forward to the launch of mobile commerce in North America, another digital platform for customers to engage with our brand. As noted in Japan, we posted a 1% increase in dollar, a decline of 9% in constant currency. It's worth noting that prior to the events of March 11, we were on track to deliver another quarter of slight growth in yen terms. Our market share further expanded against continued contraction in the category. 
Once again, I want to call out China, our fastest-growing business. During the quarter, our sales continued to rise rapidly from prior year, fueled by distribution growth and significant double-digit comps. Clearly, the Coach proposition is resonating with this consumer who is participating in this category, increasing numbers. Victor will talk more about our opportunity in China shortly.
Across all Full Price businesses, our robust results reflect the strength of our offering. As always, we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness. Beginning on December 24, we transitioned to spring with the introduction of the Colette collection offered across multiple fabrications and silhouettes anchored by both our hobo and tote styles. This was followed by the relaunch of Poppy in February and a new Kristin collection in March. 
With its distinctive hardware and soft feminine styling, Kristin is an important collection for Coach and has been the feature of our spring ad campaign. This season's product was very well received, and both handbags and women's accessories achieved strong comps in the quarter with handbag penetration in our North American retail stores rising to 60% from 59% last year, driven by unit comp sales increases and a slight increase in average unit retails.
Just this month, we introduced the collection of Natalie novelty store totes along with new colors  and a Dream C print and Poppy. And last week, we launched Audrey, a modern tote story featuring perforated leather, op art and print concepts. Additionally, our lead collection for Mothers' Day is Madison offered in fresh colors and patterns. For June, we're introducing new leather and pattern colors at Kristin, as well as a strong new op art of prints. Our Kristin hobo continues to be the key item within the collection.
In addition, this July, we will launch a new Chelsea collection and evolve Poppy with updated style, patterns and prints. 
On the factory side, our strong results were fueled by a powerful combination of new product introductions with key styles offered at great prices. Additionally, our inventory investment strategy enabled us to capture sales upside throughout the quarter. Our product assortment was also supported by our in-store and direct marketing campaigns.
I also wanted to spend a moment
[Audio Gap]
, which are located next to or nearby our most productive factory locations, are performing extremely well. We believe the strong consumer response we're experiencing reflects the strength of the Coach brand and the factory consumers' focus on value and function. It confirms our belief that there is a particularly large opportunity for Men's in our factory channel. 
In summary, we're excited with the continued progress we've made in improving our overall full price productivity. In addition, we're very pleased with the current sales trends in both our full price and factory channels and are well positioned on Mother's Day and the balance of the spring season. 
Our strategies continue to be focused on expansion opportunities both here in North America and increasingly, in international markets. In addition, as always, we are focused on improving performance in existing stores by increasing Coach's share of our consumers accessories wardrobe, while continuing to attract new customers into the franchise. I just discussed our immense initiative, which we're confident will be a significant contributor to global growth in the seasons and years ahead.
Moving on to distribution growth. As mentioned in previous earnings calls, we expect a lot of square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 10% this year, compared to 8% last year. Starting in North America, we will open 3 stores in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, bringing the total to 8 new North American retail stores for the year.  In addition, we will open 9 new factory stores during the balance of the year, primarily on our Men's initiative, bringing the total to 14 dedicated men's factory stores and 8 traditional factory stores for the year. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 8% this year.
I want to finally touch on Europe, a new region of expansion for Coach. To date, we have opened 7 boutiques and Printemps department stores in France. And through our JV with Hackett, we launched the brand with 4 shop-in-shops in Spain and 1 in Lisbon, with 1 more to go before year-end, all within [indiscernible]. Last month, we opened our first retail store in the U.K. in the Westfield White City Mall and have been very pleased with its early results. 
Beyond the opportunities in the Coach concept and brand, as you know, we launched Reed Krakoff in September in a few boutiques in the U.S. and Japan, as well as through prestigious international specialty retailers, While still very early days, we are pleased that the product is appealing to the targeted pinnacle luxury consumer, and we were very pleased to announce the appointment of Valérie Herman as President and CEO, Reed Krakoff, who joined us just this month from YSL.
Earlier this fiscal year, we announced the creation of a new international retail organization with 3 major Asian hubs: Japan, mainland China and other Asian markets. We also announced the addition of 3 senior executives who will enable Coach to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities that exist for the brand in the region. Key to this new organization was the promotion of Victor Luis to the newly created position as President, Coach Retail International, with a responsibility for all of Coach's Directly-owned businesses outside North America. 
I will now and the turn the call over to Victor. Victor?"

To put the opportunity in perspective, the premium bag and accessory market in Asia, including Japan, is nearly $12 billion today. And in contrast to the global market, which is about 85% women's and 15% men's, in Asia, Men's represents nearly 1/4 of the spend. 
Excluding Japan, the market is growing at a double-digit rate led by mainland China. In addition, Hong Kong, Korea and Southeast Asia are all expected to grow at more than 10% for the next several years, while Taiwan is projected to grow at a slightly slower pace. Overall, the region offers excellent potential where we can leverage our well-honed retail skills and international experience to drive the business, as we have done in Japan and are now doing in China. Coach is already among the top 5 brands in these markets with at least a mid-single digit share, and we have proven strategies in place to increase brand awareness and grow sales.
In Japan, the overall consumer market has been challenging for some years, and the category has contracted. Our goal was and continues to be market share gains, and we have done this quite well in our core Women's business. As elsewhere, we're now also focusing on Men's where we've already seen early success. 
As Lew noted earlier, we do expect the continued impact from the tragedy over the next few months, primarily a function of reduced traffic as the infrastructure problems in the northern and eastern parts of the country remain, resulting in transportation and power issues. 
However, far in further significant aftershocks or worsening of the nuclear crisis, we expect our business to continue to show steady improvement. We expect to open 2 more stores in the fourth quarter for a total of 9 new Coach Japan locations, including 5 Men's stores for the year. In total, we expect the net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 4% this year, similar to last year.
Moving on to China, our largest geographic growth opportunity, where our sales are growing rapidly against a strong market backdrop. We will be adding 11 locations in the fourth quarter, 9 on the mainland and 2 in Hong Kong, taking us to 26 openings for the year and a total of 66 locations. As you know, we doubled sales in FY '10 to over $100 million and are now on track to generate sales of about $185 million this year, up from our estimates of $175 million shared on our last earnings call. We are targeting a 10% market share of what is projected to be over a $5 billion market or about $500 million in sales by FY '14, up from about a 5% share today.
Driving this growth, we expect to add about 30 new locations per annum during our planning horizon, focused on the mainland and across a multichannel model, including flagship, stand-alone retail stores, shop-in-shops and department stores and factory stores. 
In addition, based on our conversion opportunity against already strong traffic trends as the consumer becomes increasingly qualified to purchase luxury accessories, we expect to continue to achieve double-digit comp rates over this planning horizon. 
In fact, our research indicates that the purchasing  population is growing at nearly 20% annually, driven by the growth in the target segment, primarily through income gains and the increasing participation rate in the category itself. 
We would also note that in China, Men's participate heavily in the category both for self purchase and for gifting to other men and represent nearly half of the spend and up to 50% or more of our competitive set sales, yielding another opportunity for Coach. 
Further, as we grow awareness in China, we benefit globally from the growth in mainland China tourists as they visit and shop in key capitals around the world. In fact, we estimate that sales to mainland Chinese nationals represent as much as 25% of sales globally to our major competitors. 
Today, sales to Chinese nationals represents only 5% of Coach's global sales. Therefore, there is tremendous opportunity for us to take a larger share of a growing market where our proposition is clearly resonating and where building our distribution, team and awareness will lead to continued growth. As you may remember, China is the market where Coach enjoys its highest repurchase intent among existing consumers with over 90% of Coach shoppers expressing a positive intent to repurchase.
In FY '12, we will make significant investments towards awareness building as we leverage a 70th anniversary campaign as a foundation to build on our positioning as the New York fashion brand grounded in heritage and history. This integrated campaign will have several key elements, including an international brand ambassador, Gwyneth Paltrow, who has proven relevancy in China and other international markets. Beyond our Directly-owned business in China, we have significant wholesale businesses throughout Asia, and Lew referred to the strong sales growth we're experiencing in this channel earlier
Some months ago, we announced that we've signed an agreement to take control of our Domestic Retail businesses in Singapore and Malaysia, which, together, generate annual sales at retail of about $50 million. The agreement provides for a phase transition of the current Coach Retail businesses over the next year, beginning this July with Singapore. While the impact of the transition will be small, it is an important step towards controlling our future in Asia. 
We are especially excited about a new Singapore flagship on prestigious Orchard Road, which will be a directly-operated store opening in spring 2012. It will immediately raise brand awareness as Singapore is an important tourist gateway in Southeast Asia, serving the Indonesian and Indian shopper, while increasingly attracting mainland Chinese consumers as well.
We also have significant and growing distributor-run businesses in Korea, the second largest market for premium leather goods after Japan and the region; and Taiwan. Together, they represent about $200 million at retail for Coach in FY '11, serving both the domestic and travel retail customer through about 80 locations, over 50 in Korea and 30 in Taiwan. 
Given our focus in the region during this fiscal year, of the nearly 40 targeted new international wholesale locations, more than 20 will be in Asia. 
Separately, it's important to note that our Asia distribution center and Asia shared services center are online, shipping globally and prepared to provide savings, while also serving as a back office backbone for Coach China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and any future directly operated markets in the region. Simply put, it is ready to be scaled for leverage across the region. 
In summary, we are excited about the global opportunity for Coach, especially the emerging market potential given the rapid growth of the category and the foundation which we have begun to build in the key Asia region. 
At this time, I will turn it over to Mike Devine, our CFO, for further details on our financials. Mike?"
526573,130285239,117469,"Coach Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2011",2011-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Victor. Lew and Victor had just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our third quarter results. As mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 14% with Direct-to-Co",1132,"Thank you, Victor. Lew and Victor had just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our third quarter results. 
As mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 14% with Direct-to-Consumer, which represents over 3/4 of our business, up 15% and Indirect up 14%. Earnings per share for the quarter increased 23% to $0.62, as compared to $0.50 in the year-ago period, as net income rose to $186 million from $158 million. 
As noted in the press release, we estimate that the events in Japan impacted sales by approximately $20 million and earnings per share by about $0.025 during March and the third quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, our operating income totaled $280 million in the third quarter, up 12% from $249 million in the same period last year. Operating margin in the quarter was 29.4%, compared to 30% even in the year-ago period.
In the third quarter, gross profit rose to $692 million from $616 million a year ago, and gross margin rate remained strong at 72.8%, compared with 74.1% a year ago, reflecting the impact of higher sourcing costs.
Moving to expenses. We were pleased that we were able to gain 70 basis points of leverage in the quarter. Specifically, SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales, also on a non-GAAP basis, improved from prior year levels in the third quarter and represented 43.4% of sales versus 44.1%. 
Once again, our primary Direct businesses here in North America and in Japan provided leverage to the corporate P&L, more than offsetting the impact of our investment spending. We believe we're striking the right balance between driving future growth opportunities and operating efficiencies.
As noted in our press release, we recorded certain one-time items during the third quarter, which resulted in a substantially lower tax rate of 26.5%. These included a favorable settlement of a multiyear tax return examination, which decreased Coach's provision for taxes by $16 million. 
In addition, the company made a $21 million contribution to the Coach Foundation and also contributed JPY 400 million or just under $5 million to the Japanese Red Cross. Together, these contributions totaled nearly $26 million pretax, impacting GAAP SG&A expenses by that amount and precisely offsetting the benefit of the tax settlement to net income and EPS.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Inventories at quarter end were $391 million, up 28% from the end of last year's Q3, but up 9% on a two-year basis. Our current inventory support the strong underlying business trends and will allow us to maximize sales this spring. Generally, it's worth reminding everyone that we've been rightsizing our inventory this year, bringing it up to more appropriate levels to support our growth. Including new initiatives such as Men's, global square footage expansion, Reed Krakoff and our new distribution center in Asia. 
Cash and short-term investments totaled $886 million, as compared with $908 million a year ago despite repurchases of nearly $1.2 billion worth of Coach common stock in the interim 12 months. During the third quarter, we repurchased and retired 3.5 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $54.51 per share, spending a total of $192 million. At the end of the period, approximately $1.3 billion remained under our repurchase authorization.
Net cash from operating activities in the third quarter was $227 million, compared to $205 million last year during Q3. Free cash flow in the third quarter was an inflow of $186 million versus $190 million in the same period last year due to higher net income, offset by working capital and fixed-asset expenditures. 
Our CapEx spending was $42 million versus $15 million in the same quarter a year ago. As we stated on our last 3 earnings call, based on our plans for the year, we expect that CapEx would be about $150 million, primarily for the opening of new stores across all geographies. 
Naturally, we were very pleased to report these strong financial results. And as Lew has said, we're well positioned for the remainder of the fiscal year. While we do not give specific guidance, as you know, I always think it's helpful for you modelers out there to keep a few things in mind when forecasting the finish of our year.
First and most generally, we continue to target double-digit sales increases globally with double-digit earnings growth. And given the ongoing strength in our business, we now believe that we'll achieve high-single digit same-store sales growth in North America for the fourth quarter, even in the face of more difficult compares. Additionally, we expect the continuation of our positive POS trends in our Indirect businesses. 
As noted in our release, given current conditions and projections for Japan, we expect a similar impact in the full fourth quarter of about $20 million or 2% to total Coach sales and about $0.02 to $0.03 to earnings per share. However, as discussed on prior calls, our fourth quarter comparisons will be impacted by the timing of shipments in our Indirect businesses and the extra week in the prior year's fourth quarter. As you may recall, this extra week contributed $70 million of sales and $0.08 of EPS to last year's Q4.
Second, we were excited that our top line sales growth drove higher levels of profitability in the first 9 months of the year. While our previous comments regarding gross margins still stand, our sales growth, coupled with controlled spending, will help offset both cost and channel mix pressures. 
Therefore, we're reiterating our previous guidance of a full year FY '11 operating margin at about last year's levels of about 31.5% on a 52-week basis, despite the quake-related shortfall in our very profitable Japan business. 
Third, our non-GAAP tax rate is likely to stay in the area achieved in the first 9 months for the balance of the year, as we further refine our international tax strategies. And fourth, I did want to update our share count guidance. We now believe that our fourth quarter average will be similar to 3Q at about $302 million on a fully diluted basis.
Before we open it up for Q&A, I want to echo Lew's earliest words. This was another excellent quarter for Coach. Clearly, our results bode well for the future, and we're confident that we'll continue to deliver very strong sales and earnings gains for the foreseeable future. 
Thank you all for joining us on our conference call today. And now Lew, Victor, Mike Tucci, Andrea and I will take some questions, which will then be followed by a brief comment from Lew, who is, I'm sure you can tell, is suffering from a touch of laryngitis but is hanging in boldly. So now we'll open the floor up to questions. Thank you."

China is developing as a wonderful market for multichannel distribution, both in department stores where we have tremendous opportunity. There are today approximately 600 department stores in China, of which approximately 100 of them already have luxury cosmetics, with sales approaching the top 100 department stores in Japan as another great measure, as well as the rapidly-developing shopping mall and slowly but surely developing factory outlet mall channel, which will be another terrific opportunity for us.

Firstly, we do sell through at a premium to North America pricing in the region, not premiums as rich as Japan's but in the neighborhood. And so our gross margin rates in China are quite robust rivaling even that of the Japan business. In terms of store four-wall, we are already seeing four-walls nicely into the 40% range and so that's driven of course by that gross margin rate. But also as you might suspect, our store wages are lower in China than they are anywhere else in the world, contributing to healthy a four-wall. And as we gain in productivity and the brand gains awareness with landlords, we'll see our occupancy rate. The other big expense items on the store P&L begin to decline as a percentage of sales further enhancing store four-walls. Victor mentioned in his prepared remarks our approach to the region with a Asia distribution center and an Asia shared service center. So we're keyed to drive an efficient back office infrastructure to support both the China business and Pan-Asian approach. So all of those things taken together a lot of words will drive very, very healthy rates of profit and volume of profits from the region as we move into '12 and beyond."

Clearly, with Japan being one of our highest gross margin regions, losing that $20 million was hurtful of the gross margin rate but relatively immaterial. We certainly would've recorded a modestly higher gross margin rate, but it is a small percentage of the total company's business, and we were able to absorb it. I would add, though, I have to take this opportunity, that had we had that $20 million of sales and about $0.025 of earnings, we would have actually seen operating margin that leverage. We were -- did come up just short of Q3's op income level. Had we had the $20 million of that very profitable Japanese business, we would've seen operating margin improvement, which I have to say coming into the quarter, I do not think was going to be possible. So the business operated very efficiently across all geographies and mature businesses during the quarter. Similarly, I would just say for the fourth quarter, same dynamic. In our own projections that we've just kind of shared with you, we will see some very modest operating margin deleverage for the quarter. We would have gotten operating margin leverage had we not had the quake impact. Of course these are all forward-looking statements now to talk about fourth quarter. But I do think it demonstrates the diversity of our business model globally that we're able to absorb this profitable loss and still project that we can hit 31.5% op income for the year, kind of what we've been pointing to for a number of quarters now. So in a way I'm thinking about that as an increasing guidance, if you will, adjusted for the quake impact."

Kimberly, we're essentially in the same place and gross margin as we have been in terms of our guidance for the balance of FY '11. You'll recall that we were one of the first companies to talk about inflationary pressures well over a year ago, and that's holding. That being said, there are a number of positive things going on within gross margin to help offset these pressures. And we're guardedly optimistic that we'll see some modest sequential improvement actually in the first half of our FY '12, the back half of this calendar year versus the second half of our FY '11. It's because of counter-sourcing efforts, material inflation will not hit us as hard as others. The other thing that will be helpful is we'll also begin to anniversary those higher input costs from early last year's fiscal '11. Wage inflation is our biggest issue and we're battling that by moving products into lower-cost countries. We're ahead of schedule on this initiative, but it is still very early days there. And so while we are protecting our opening price points, we are also surgically taking advantage of pricing power, and we're doing this in both channels, both in our full price and our factory channel. The other thing we'll start to see which will be very helpful, is channel mix will actually begin to help us, we believe, as we move into FY '12, which will be a nice thing as growth in the Asian region that Victor spoke to helps channel mix there. And also just the underlying trends at our Full Price business in our mature markets of North America and Japan will also help channel mix. So we still are feeling good about our previous guidance gross margin in the boundary of 72% to 73%, going forward. We feel it very achievable."

In each of our geographies, we have in-market merchants who, constantly, with the support of our consumer insights team, are looking to understand the consumer and provide the design team with some logic to add to the magic that they of course do in designing the product. We have a very strong merchant team in Japan. We have today a merchant team in Shanghai, as well as Hong Kong, that is developing. And those teams provide the inputs into New York and then we'll buy from a global assortment, which occasionally, of course, is tweaked to meet local needs. On the whole, though, I would say that our assortments are rather global. In Japan, China, collections such as Madison, Poppy and Kristin, which today are the main drivers in the North American business, are also main drivers for us in the region. There may be some functional areas that we have to tweak, whether it be smaller goods or in handbags. As an example, for example, in handbags across Asia, across body bags, given the amount of commuting that takes place, do tend to have a higher penetration than say here in North America. That is something that we simply input into our buys locally. And I think one of the most important differences, as I've mentioned in my remarks, is the Men's opportunity. In Japan, the Men's market of that $4 billion size today, represents approximately 20%. In mainland China, it can represent 50% to more for most of our competitor brands, and it's approaching about 50% of the market, again. In Hong Kong, Macau and the rest of the region, and we're looking at 25% to 30% as well. And so our, in-market merchant teams are working very, very closely with our central merchandising teams and our design team to ensure that those very specific needs of that specific Asian male consumer are met. And so it's a highly collaborative effort with a tremendous amount of consumer insights, as well as, of course, the design talent, which is very much focused on presenting 1 New York Coach aesthetic to the world based here in New York."

As noted in our release this morning, we were very pleased with our quarterly results, including store sales and earnings growth and the continuation of excellent comparable store sales in our North American Retail b",1984,"Thanks, Andrea, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our release this morning, we were very pleased with our quarterly results, including store sales and earnings growth and the continuation of excellent comparable store sales in our North American Retail businesses. 
Our performance clearly demonstrates the brands of vitality across channels, geographies and bodes well for the future. Further, the ability to generate these results in light of the tragic events and their aftermath in Japan speaks to the diversification of our business model and the strength of our brand proposition globally. Beyond the top line, we are also very pleased with our high levels of profitability and substantial cash generation.
In addition, we make continued progress against our global business initiatives, including international expansion, men's and digital media. We experienced strong response to our new collection, and our pricing and assortment strategy continued to resonate with consumers worldwide. We're well situated to build upon our leadership position and continue to gain market share. Further, the announcement today of the increased dividend reflects our financial strength and our confidence in Coach's future.
Before I review the quarter and provide an outlook for the category and our business, I would be remiss not to touch on the tragedy in Japan. Of course, we have been saddened by the devastation in Japan, but we're relieved to learn within days of the earthquake and tsunami that all Coach colleagues was  accounted for and safe. 
When I visited Japan early April, I was impressed by the resiliency of the people and the progress made in restoring more normal conditions. And I was moved by the incredible spirit and tenacity of our own Coach Japan colleagues, who rallied together during a very difficult time.
Moving on to some key highlights of our third fiscal quarter. First, earnings per share rose 23% to $0.62 compared with $0.50 in the prior year. Second, quarterly net sales totaled $951 million versus $831 million a year ago, an increase of 14%. Third, Direct-to-Consumer sales rose 15% to $832 million from $726 million in the prior year. Fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter are robust, rising 10% from prior year, while total North American Direct-to-Consumer sales rose 16%. And fifth, sales in Japan were down 9% to prior year in constant currency and rose 1% in dollars. And finally, we continued to generate very strong sales growth and significant double-digit comps in China.
During the quarter, and as part of our regular real estate review, we closed 3 North American Retail stores, while we opened 5 factory stores. Thus, at the end of the period, there were 344 full price and 134 factory stores in operation in North America.
Moving to Japan. 4 locations were opened and 1 was closed. At quarter end, there were 174 total locations in Japan with 19 full price stores, including 8 flagships, 119 shop-in-shops, 29 factory stores and 7 distributor-operated travel retail locations. As noted in our release, 7 stores in the Sendai area remained closed due to damage at quarter end, with 3 reopened this month. And in China, we added 4 new locations all in the mainland and closed 1 store in Hong Kong. 
At the end of the quarter, there were 55 Coach locations in China, including 9 in Hong Kong, 2 in Macau and 44 locations on the mainland in 18 cities. As we've discussed previously, there are nearly 120 cities in China with a population of 1 million or more, and we are building a multichannel distribution model with a focus on the mainland to leverage this opportunity.
Indirect sales increased 14% to $119 million from $105 million in the same period last year. This gain reflected significant growth in shipments and to international wholesale in U.S. department stores given positive POS sales trends in both businesses. Specifically, sales for the quarter at retail in international wholesale locations was strong, driven by new distribution, while sales at POS and U.S. department stores rose 4% for the quarter.
We estimate that the addressable U.S. handbag and accessory category rose at a 5% to 10% rate in the third quarter, similar to the increase it experienced in calendar year 2010. At the same time, Coach's bag and accessories sales rose about 13% across all channels in North America during the most recent quarter. In our Direct businesses in North America, handbag and accessory sales rose 17%. We continue to estimate that the category will increase to $9 billion this year, surpassing its previous peak achieved 3 years ago.
Separately, it's worth noting, our customers' outlook for the economy has been stable over the last few quarters, with a third of those surveyed still believing that the U.S. economy is improving. Their intention to purchase Coach remains high with over 2/3 of consumers surveyed noting they probably or definitely would purchase a Coach product in the next 12 months. 
Our total revenues in North America rose 16%, with our directly operated businesses up similarly, driven by 10.3% in same-store sales increases and new distribution. Fueling these overall store and comp results were similarly strong gains in both channels with significant gains in conversion from prior year and a modest growth in average transaction size, partially offset by a decline in traffic due to the calendar shift. We were particularly pleased with the improvement in conversion rates since it's a driver that we have the most control over in product and service.
We have also been delighted by our traction on the Web notably the North American coach.com business. While we view this channel primarily as a marketing vehicle, traffic and sales at our site continue to grow at a double-digit pace during the third quarter, driven by our base business, as well as our efforts in social media where we now have over 1.8 million Facebook fans. 
Additionally, next month, we're looking forward to the launch of mobile commerce in North America, another digital platform for customers to engage with our brand. As noted in Japan, we posted a 1% increase in dollar, a decline of 9% in constant currency. It's worth noting that prior to the events of March 11, we were on track to deliver another quarter of slight growth in yen terms. Our market share further expanded against continued contraction in the category. 
Once again, I want to call out China, our fastest-growing business. During the quarter, our sales continued to rise rapidly from prior year, fueled by distribution growth and significant double-digit comps. Clearly, the Coach proposition is resonating with this consumer who is participating in this category, increasing numbers. Victor will talk more about our opportunity in China shortly.
Across all Full Price businesses, our robust results reflect the strength of our offering. As always, we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness. Beginning on December 24, we transitioned to spring with the introduction of the Colette collection offered across multiple fabrications and silhouettes anchored by both our hobo and tote styles. This was followed by the relaunch of Poppy in February and the new Kristin collection in March. 
With its distinctive hardware and soft feminine styling, Kristin is an important collection for Coach and has been the feature of our spring ad campaign. This season's product was very well received, and both handbags and women's accessories achieved strong comps in the quarter with handbag penetration in our North American retail stores rising to 60% from 59% last year, driven by unit comp sales increases and a slight increase in average unit retails.
Just this month, we introduced the collection of Natalie novelty store totes along with new colors  and a Dream C print and Poppy. And last week, we launched Audrey, a modern tote story featuring perforated leather, op art and print concepts. Additionally, our lead collection for Mothers' Day is Madison offered in fresh colors and patterns. For June, we're introducing new leather and pattern colors at Kristin, as well as a strong new op art  print. Our Kristin hobo continues to be the key item within the collection.
In addition, this July, we will launch a new Chelsea collection and evolve Poppy with updated styles, patterns and prints. 
On the factory side, our strong results were fueled by a powerful combination of new product introductions with key styles offered at great prices. Additionally, our inventory investment strategy enabled us to capture sales upside throughout the quarter. Our product assortment was also supported by our in-store and direct marketing campaigns.
I also wanted to spend a moment
[Audio Gap]
, which are located next to or nearby our most productive factory locations, are performing extremely well. We believe the strong consumer response we're experiencing reflects the strength of the Coach brand and the factory consumers' focus on value and function. It confirms our belief that there is a particularly large opportunity for Men's in our factory channel. 
In summary, we're excited with the continued progress we've made in improving our overall full price productivity. In addition, we're very pleased with the current sales trends in both our full price and factory channels and are well positioned on Mother's Day and the balance of the spring season. 
Our strategies continue to be focused on expansion opportunities both here in North America and increasingly, in international markets. In addition, as always, we are focused on improving performance in existing stores by increasing Coach's share of our consumers accessories wardrobe, while continuing to attract new customers into the franchise. I just discussed our Men's initiative, which we're confident will be a significant contributor to global growth in the seasons and years ahead.
Moving on to distribution growth. As mentioned in previous earnings calls, we expect that our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 10% this year, compared to 8% last year. Starting in North America, we will open 3 stores in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, bringing the total to 8 new North American retail stores for the year.  In addition, we will open 9 new factory stores during the balance of the year, primarily on our Men's initiative, bringing the total to 14 dedicated men's factory stores and 8 traditional factory stores for the year. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 8% this year.
I want to finally touch on Europe, a new region of expansion for Coach. To date, we have opened 7 boutiques and Printemps department stores in France. And through our JV with Hackett, we launched the brand with 4 shop-in-shops in Spain and 1 in Lisbon, with 1 more to go before year-end, all within El Corte Ingles. Last month, we opened our first retail store in the U.K. in the Westfield White City Mall and have been very pleased with its early results. 
Beyond the opportunities in the Coach concept and brand, as you know, we launched Reed Krakoff in September and a few boutiques in the U.S. and Japan, as well as through prestigious international specialty retailers, While still very early days, we are pleased that the product is appealing to the targeted pinnacle luxury consumer, and we were very pleased to announce the appointment of Valérie Herman as President and CEO, Reed Krakoff, who joined us just this month from YSL.
Earlier this fiscal year, we announced the creation of a new international retail organization with 3 major Asian hubs: Japan, mainland China and other Asian markets. We also announced the addition of 3 senior executives who will enable Coach to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities that exist for the brand in the region. Key to this new organization was the promotion of Victor Luis to the newly created position of President, Coach Retail International, with a responsibility for all of Coach's Directly-owned businesses outside North America. 
I will now and the turn the call over to Victor. Victor?"

To put the opportunity in perspective, the premium bag and accessory market in Asia, including Japan, is nearly $12 billion today.

To put the opportunity in perspective, the premium bag and accessory market in Asia, including Japan, is nearly $12 billion today. And in contrast to the global market, which is about 85% women's and 15% men's, in Asia, Men's represents nearly 1/4 of the spend. 
Excluding Japan, the market is growing at a double-digit rate led by mainland China. In addition, Hong Kong, Korea and Southeast Asia are all expected to grow at more than 10% for the next several years, while Taiwan is projected to grow at a slightly slower pace. Overall, the region offers excellent potential where we can leverage our well-honed retail skills and international experience to drive the business, as we have done in Japan and are now doing in China. Coach is already among the top 5 brands in these markets with at least a mid-single digit share, and we have proven strategies in place to increase brand awareness and grow sales.
In Japan, the overall consumer market has been challenging for some years, and the category has contracted. Our goal was and continues to be market share gains, and we have done this quite well in our core Women's business. As elsewhere, we're now also focusing on Men's where we've already seen early success. 
As Lew noted earlier, we do expect the continued impact from the tragedy over the next few months, primarily a function of reduced traffic as the infrastructure problems in the northern and eastern parts of the country remain, resulting in transportation and power issues. 
However, barring further significant aftershocks or worsening of the nuclear crisis, we expect our business to continue to show steady improvement. We expect to open 2 more stores in the fourth quarter for a total of 9 new Coach Japan locations, including 5 Men's stores for the year. In total, we expect the net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 4% this year, similar to last year.
Moving on to China, our largest geographic growth opportunity, where our sales are growing rapidly against a strong market backdrop. We will be adding 11 locations in the fourth quarter, 9 on the mainland and 2 in Hong Kong, taking us to 26 openings for the year and a total of 66 locations. As you know, we doubled sales in FY '10 to over $100 million and are now on track to generate sales of about $185 million this year, up from our estimates of $175 million shared on our last earnings call. We are targeting a 10% market share of what is projected to be over a $5 billion market or about $500 million in sales by FY '14, up from about a 5% share today.
Driving this growth, we expect to add about 30 new locations per annum during our planning horizon, focused on the mainland and across a multichannel model, including flagship, stand-alone retail stores, shop-in-shops and department stores and factory stores. 
In addition, based on our conversion opportunity against already strong traffic trends as the consumer becomes increasingly qualified to purchase luxury accessories, we expect to continue to achieve double-digit comp rates over this planning horizon. 
In fact, our research indicates that the purchasing  population is growing at nearly 20% annually, driven by the growth in the target segment, primarily through income gains and the increasing participation rate in the category itself. 
We would also note that in China, men participate heavily in the category both for self purchase and for gifting to other men and represent nearly half of the spend and up to 50% or more of our competitive set sales, yielding another opportunity for Coach. 
Further, as we grow awareness in China, we benefit globally from the growth in mainland China tourists as they visit and shop in key capitals around the world. In fact, we estimate that sales to mainland Chinese nationals represent as much as 25% of sales globally to our major competitors. 
Today, sales to Chinese nationals represents only 5% of Coach's global sales. Therefore, there is tremendous opportunity for us to take a larger share of a growing market where our proposition is clearly resonating and where building our distribution, team and awareness will lead to continued growth. As you may remember, China is the market where Coach enjoys its highest repurchase intent among existing consumers with over 90% of Coach shoppers expressing a positive intent to repurchase.
In FY '12, we will make significant investments towards awareness building as we leverage a 70th anniversary campaign as a foundation to build on our positioning as the New York fashion brand grounded in heritage and history. This integrated campaign will have several key elements, including an international brand ambassador, Gwyneth Paltrow, who has proven relevancy in China and other international markets. Beyond our Directly-owned business in China, we have significant wholesale businesses throughout Asia, and Lew referred to the strong sales growth we're experiencing in this channel earlier
Some months ago, we announced that we've signed an agreement to take control of our Domestic Retail businesses in Singapore and Malaysia, which, together, generate annual sales at retail of about $50 million. The agreement provides for a phase transition of the current Coach Retail businesses over the next year, beginning this July with Singapore. While the impact of the transition will be small, it is an important step towards controlling our future in Asia. 
We are especially excited about a new Singapore flagship on prestigious Orchard Road, which will be a directly-operated store opening in spring 2012. It will immediately raise brand awareness as Singapore is an important tourist gateway in Southeast Asia, serving the Indonesian and Indian shopper, while increasingly attracting mainland Chinese consumers as well.
We also have significant and growing distributor-run businesses in Korea, the second largest market for premium leather goods after Japan and the region; and Taiwan. Together, they represent about $200 million at retail for Coach in FY '11, serving both the domestic and travel retail customer through about 80 locations, over 50 in Korea and 30 in Taiwan. 
Given our focus in the region during this fiscal year, of the nearly 40 targeted new international wholesale locations, more than 20 will be in Asia. 
Separately, it's important to note that our Asia distribution center and Asia shared services center are online, shipping globally and prepared to provide savings, while also serving as a back office backbone for Coach China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and any future directly operated markets in the region. Simply put, it is ready to be scaled for leverage across the region. 
In summary, we are excited about the global opportunity for Coach, especially the emerging market potential given the rapid growth of the category and the foundation which we have begun to build in the key Asia region. 
At this time, I will turn it over to Mike Devine, our CFO, for further details on our financials. Mike?"
526573,130285239,117602,"Coach Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2011",2011-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Victor. Lew and Victor have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our third quarter results. As mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 14% with Direct-to-C",1132,"Thank you, Victor. Lew and Victor have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our third quarter results. 
As mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 14% with Direct-to-Consumer, which represents over 3/4 of our business, up 15% and Indirect up 14%. Earnings per share for the quarter increased 23% to $0.62, as compared to $0.50 in the year-ago period, as net income rose to $186 million from $158 million. 
As noted in the press release, we estimate that the events in Japan impacted sales by approximately $20 million and earnings per share by about $0.025 during March and the third quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, our operating income totaled $280 million in the third quarter, up 12% from $249 million in the same period last year. Operating margin in the quarter was 29.4%, compared to 30% even in the year-ago period.
In the third quarter, gross profit rose to $692 million from $616 million a year ago, and gross margin rate remained strong at 72.8%, compared with 74.1% a year ago, reflecting the impact of higher sourcing costs.
Moving to expenses. We were pleased that we were able to gain 70 basis points of leverage in the quarter. Specifically, SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales, also on a non-GAAP basis, improved from prior year levels in the third quarter and represented 43.4% of sales versus 44.1%. 
Once again, our primary Direct businesses here in North America and in Japan provided leverage to the corporate P&L, more than offsetting the impact of our investment spending. We believe we're striking the right balance between driving future growth opportunities and operating efficiencies.
As noted in our press release, we recorded certain one-time items during the third quarter, which resulted in a substantially lower tax rate of 26.5%. These included a favorable settlement of a multiyear tax return examination, which decreased Coach's provision for taxes by $16 million. 
In addition, the company made a $21 million contribution to the Coach Foundation and also contributed JPY 400 million or just under $5 million to the Japanese Red Cross. Together, these contributions totaled nearly $26 million pretax, impacting GAAP SG&A expenses by that amount and precisely offsetting the benefit of the tax settlement to net income and EPS.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Inventories at quarter end were $391 million, up 28% from the end of last year's Q3, but up 9% on a two-year basis. Our current inventory support the strong underlying business trends and will allow us to maximize sales this spring. Generally, it's worth reminding everyone that we've been rightsizing our inventory this year, bringing it up to more appropriate levels to support our growth. Including new initiatives such as Men's, global square footage expansion, Reed Krakoff and our new distribution center in Asia. 
Cash and short-term investments totaled $886 million, as compared with $908 million a year ago despite repurchases of nearly $1.2 billion worth of Coach common stock in the interim 12 months. During the third quarter, we repurchased and retired 3.5 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $54.51 per share, spending a total of $192 million. At the end of the period, approximately $1.3 billion remained under our repurchase authorization.
Net cash from operating activities in the third quarter was $227 million, compared to $205 million last year during Q3. Free cash flow in the third quarter was an inflow of $186 million versus $190 million in the same period last year due to higher net income, offset by working capital and fixed-asset expenditures. 
Our CapEx spending was $42 million versus $15 million in the same quarter a year ago. As we stated on our last 3 earnings call, based on our plans for the year, we expect that CapEx would be about $150 million, primarily for the opening of new stores across all geographies. 
Naturally, we were very pleased to report these strong financial results. And as Lew has said, we're well positioned for the remainder of the fiscal year. While we do not give specific guidance, as you know, I always think it's helpful for you modelers out there to keep a few things in mind when forecasting the finish of our year.
First and most generally, we continue to target double-digit sales increases globally with double-digit earnings growth. And given the ongoing strength in our business, we now believe that we'll achieve high-single digit same-store sales growth in North America for the fourth quarter, even in the face of more difficult compares. Additionally, we expect the continuation of our positive POS trends in our Indirect businesses. 
As noted in our release, given current conditions and projections for Japan, we expect a similar impact in the full fourth quarter of about $20 million or 2% to total Coach sales and about $0.02 to $0.03 to earnings per share. However, as discussed on prior calls, our fourth quarter comparisons will be impacted by the timing of shipments in our Indirect businesses and the extra week in the prior year's fourth quarter. As you may recall, this extra week contributed $70 million of sales and $0.08 of EPS to last year's Q4.
Second, we were excited that our top line sales growth drove higher levels of profitability in the first 9 months of the year. While our previous comments regarding gross margins still stand, our sales growth, coupled with controlled spending, will help offset both cost and channel mix pressures. 
Therefore, we're reiterating our previous guidance of a full year FY '11 operating margin at about last year's levels of about 31.5% on a 52-week basis, despite the quake-related shortfall in our very profitable Japan business. 
Third, our non-GAAP tax rate is likely to stay in the area achieved in the first 9 months for the balance of the year, as we further refine our international tax strategies. And fourth, I did want to update our share count guidance. We now believe that our fourth quarter average will be similar to 3Q at about $302 million on a fully diluted basis.
Before we open it up for Q&A, I want to echo Lew's earliest words. This was another excellent quarter for Coach. Clearly, our results bode well for the future, and we're confident that we'll continue to deliver very strong sales and earnings gains for the foreseeable future. 
Thank you all for joining us on our conference call today. And now Lew, Victor, Mike Tucci, Andrea and I will take some questions, which will then be followed by a brief comment from Lew, who is, I'm sure you can tell, is suffering from a touch of laryngitis but is hanging in boldly. So now we'll open the floor up to questions. Thank you."

China is developing as a wonderful market for multichannel distribution, both in department stores where we have tremendous opportunity. There are today approximately 600 department stores in China, of which approximately 100 of them already have luxury cosmetics, with sales approaching the top 100 department stores in Japan as another great measure, as well as the rapidly-developing shopping mall and slowly but surely developing factory outlet mall channel, which will be another terrific opportunity for us.

Firstly, we do sell through at a premium to North America pricing in the region, not premiums as rich as Japan's but in the neighborhood. And so our gross margin rates in China are quite robust rivaling even that of the Japan business. In terms of store four-walls, we are already seeing four-walls nicely into the 40% range and so that's driven of course by that gross margin rate. But also as you might suspect, our store wages are lower in China than they are anywhere else in the world, contributing to a healthy  four-wall. And as we gain in productivity and the brand gains awareness with landlords, we'll see our occupancy rate. The other big expense items on the store P&L begin to decline as a percentage of sales further enhancing store four-walls. Victor mentioned in his prepared remarks our approach to the region with a Asia distribution center and an Asia shared service center. So we're keyed to drive an efficient back office infrastructure to support both the China business and Pan-Asian approach. So all of those things taken together a lot of words will drive very, very healthy rates of profit and volume of profits from the region as we move into '12 and beyond."

Clearly, with Japan being one of our highest gross margin regions, losing that $20 million was hurtful of the gross margin rate but relatively immaterial. We certainly would've recorded a modestly higher gross margin rate, but it is a small percentage of the total company's business, and we were able to absorb it. I would add, though, I have to take this opportunity, that had we had that $20 million of sales and about $0.025 of earnings, we would have actually seen operating margin that leverage. We were -- did come up just short of Q3's op income level. Had we had the $20 million of that very profitable Japanese business, we would've seen operating margin improvement, which I have to say coming into the quarter, I do not think was going to be possible. So the business operated very efficiently across all geographies and mature businesses during the quarter. Similarly, I would just say for the fourth quarter, same dynamic. In our own projections that we've just kind of shared with you, we will see some very modest operating margin deleverage for the quarter. We would have gotten operating margin leverage had we not had the quake impact. Of course these are all forward-looking statements now to talk about fourth quarter. But I do think it demonstrates the diversity of our business model globally that we're able to absorb this profitable loss and still project that we can hit 31.5% op income for the year, kind of what we've been pointing to for a number of quarters now. So in a way I'm thinking about that as an increasing guidance, if you will, adjusted for the quake impact."

Kimberly, we're essentially in the same place on gross margin as we have been in terms of our guidance for the balance of FY '11. You'll recall that we were one of the first companies to talk about inflationary pressures well over a year ago, and that's holding. That being said, there are a number of positive things going on within gross margin to help offset these pressures. And we're guardedly optimistic that we'll see some modest sequential improvement actually in the first half of our FY '12, the back half of this calendar year versus the second half of our FY '11. It's because of counter-sourcing efforts, material inflation will not hit us as hard as others. The other thing that will be helpful is we'll also begin to anniversary those higher input costs from early last year's fiscal '11. Wage inflation is our biggest issue and we're battling that by moving products into lower-cost countries. We're ahead of schedule on this initiative, but it is still very early days there. And so while we are protecting our opening price points, we are also surgically taking advantage of pricing power, and we're doing this in both channels, both in our full price and our factory channel. The other thing we'll start to see which will be very helpful, is channel mix will actually begin to help us, we believe, as we move into FY '12, which will be a nice thing as growth in the Asian region that Victor spoke to helps channel mix there. And also just the underlying trends in our Full Price business in our mature markets of North America and Japan will also help channel mix. So we still are feeling good about our previous guidance gross margin in the boundary of 72% to 73%, going forward. We feel it very achievable."

In each of our geographies, we have in-market merchants who, constantly, with the support of our consumer insights team, are looking to understand the consumer and provide the design team with some logic to add to the magic that they of course do in designing the product. We have a very strong merchant team in Japan. We have today a merchant team in Shanghai, as well as Hong Kong, that is developing. And those teams provide the inputs into New York and then we'll buy from a global assortment, which occasionally, of course, is tweaked to meet local needs. On the whole, though, I would say that our assortments are rather global. In Japan, China, collections such as Madison, Poppy and Kristin, which are today  the main drivers in the North American business, are also main drivers for us in the region. There may be some functional areas that we have to tweak, whether it be in smaller goods or in handbags. As an example, for example, in handbags across Asia, across body bags, given the amount of commuting that takes place, do tend to have a higher penetration than say here in North America. That is something that we simply input into our buys locally. And I think one of the most important differences, as I've mentioned in my remarks, is the Men's opportunity. In Japan, the Men's market of that $4 billion size today, represents approximately 20%. In mainland China, it can represent 50% to more for most of our competitor brands, and it's approaching about 50% of the market, again. In Hong Kong, Macau and the rest of the region, and we're looking at 25% to 30% as well. And so our, in-market merchant teams are working very, very closely with our central merchandising teams and our design team to ensure that those very specific needs of that specific Asian male consumer are met. And so it's a highly collaborative effort with a tremendous amount of consumer insights, as well as, of course, the design talent, which is very much focused on presenting 1 New York Coach aesthetic to the world based here in New York."

Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences. Please refer to our latest annual report on Form 10-K for a complete list of these risk factors.  Also please note that historical growth trends may not be indicative of future growth. 
Now let me outline the speakers and topics for this conference call. Lew Frankfort will provide an overall summary of our third fiscal quarter 2011 results and will also discuss our strategies going forward. Victor Luis will speak to our Asian direct businesses, providing an update on China and other markets in the region. Mike Devine will continue with details on financial and operational results of the quarter. Following that, we will hold a question-and-answer session where we will be joined by Mike Tucci, President, North American Retail. We'll end the Q&A shortly before 9:30 a.m. Luke will then conclude with some brief summary comments. 
I'd now like to introduce Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO."

As noted in our release this morning, we were very pleased with our quarterly results, including store sales and earnings growth and the continuation of excellent comparable store sales in our North American Retail b",1983,"Thanks, Andrea, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our release this morning, we were very pleased with our quarterly results, including store sales and earnings growth and the continuation of excellent comparable store sales in our North American Retail businesses. 
Our performance clearly demonstrates the brands of vitality across channels, geographies and bodes well for the future. Further, the ability to generate these results in light of the tragic events and their aftermath in Japan speaks to the diversification of our business model and the strength of our brand proposition globally. Beyond the top line, we are also very pleased with our high levels of profitability and substantial cash generation.
In addition, we make continued progress against our global business initiatives, including international expansion, men's and digital media. We experienced strong response to our new collection, and our pricing and assortment strategy continued to resonate with consumers worldwide. We're well situated to build upon our leadership position and continue to gain market share. Further, the announcement today of the increased dividend reflects our financial strength and our confidence in Coach's future.
Before I review the quarter and provide an outlook for the category and our business, I would be remiss not to touch on the tragedy in Japan. Of course, we have been saddened by the devastation in Japan, but we're relieved to learn within days of the earthquake and tsunami that all Coach colleagues was accounted for and safe. 
When I visited Japan  early April, I was impressed by the resiliency of the people and the progress made in restoring more normal conditions. And I was moved by the incredible spirit and tenacity of our own Coach Japan colleagues, who rallied together during a very difficult time.
Moving on to some key highlights of our third fiscal quarter. First, earnings per share rose 23% to $0.62 compared with $0.50 in the prior year. Second, quarterly net sales totaled $951 million versus $831 million a year ago, an increase of 14%. Third, Direct-to-Consumer sales rose 15% to $832 million from $726 million in the prior year. Fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter are robust, rising 10% from prior year, while total North American Direct-to-Consumer sales rose 16%. And fifth, sales in Japan were down 9% to prior year in constant currency and rose 1% in dollars. And finally, we continued to generate very strong sales growth and significant double-digit comps in China.
During the quarter, and as part of our regular real estate review, we closed 3 North American Retail stores, while we opened 5 factory stores. Thus, at the end of the period, there were 344 full price and 134 factory stores in operation in North America.
Moving to Japan. 4 locations were opened and 1 was closed. At quarter end, there were 174 total locations in Japan with 19 full price stores, including 8 flagships, 119 shop-in-shops, 29 factory stores and 7 distributor-operated travel retail locations. As noted in our release, 7 stores in the Sendai area remained closed due to damage at quarter end, with 3 reopened this month. And in China, we added 4 new locations all in the mainland and closed 1 store in Hong Kong. 
At the end of the quarter, there were 55 Coach locations in China, including 9 in Hong Kong, 2 in Macau and 44 locations on the mainland in 18 cities. As we've discussed previously, there are nearly 120 cities in China with a population of 1 million or more, and we are building a multichannel distribution model with a focus on the mainland to leverage this opportunity.
Indirect sales increased 14% to $119 million from $105 million in the same period last year. This gain reflected significant growth in shipments and to international wholesale in U.S. department stores given positive POS sales trends in both businesses. Specifically, sales for the quarter at retail in international wholesale locations was strong, driven by new distribution, while sales at POS and U.S. department stores rose 4% for the quarter.
We estimate that the addressable U.S. handbag and accessory category rose at a 5% to 10% rate in the third quarter, similar to the increase it experienced in calendar year 2010. At the same time, Coach's bag and accessories sales rose about 13% across all channels in North America during the most recent quarter. In our Direct businesses in North America, handbag and accessory sales rose 17%. We continue to estimate that the category will increase to $9 billion this year, surpassing its previous peak achieved 3 years ago.
Separately, it's worth noting, our customers' outlook for the economy has been stable over the last few quarters, with a third of those surveyed still believing that the U.S. economy is improving. Their intention to purchase Coach remains high with over 2/3 of consumers surveyed noting they probably or definitely would purchase a Coach product in the next 12 months. 
Our total revenues in North America rose 16%, with our directly operated businesses up similarly, driven by 10.3% in same-store sales increases and new distribution. Fueling these overall store and comp results were similarly strong gains in both channels with significant gains in conversion from prior year and a modest growth in average transaction size, partially offset by a decline in traffic due to the calendar shift. We were particularly pleased with the improvement in conversion rates since it's a driver that we have the most control over in product and service.
We have also been delighted by our traction on the Web notably the North American coach.com business. While we view this channel primarily as a marketing vehicle, traffic and sales at our site continue to grow at a double-digit pace during the third quarter, driven by our base business, as well as our efforts in social media where we now have over 1.8 million Facebook fans. 
Additionally, next month, we're looking forward to the launch of mobile commerce in North America, another digital platform for customers to engage with our brand. As noted in Japan, we posted a 1% increase in dollar, a decline of 9% in constant currency. It's worth noting that prior to the events of March 11, we were on track to deliver another quarter of slight growth in yen terms. Our market share further expanded against continued contraction in the category. 
Once again, I want to call out China, our fastest-growing business. During the quarter, our sales continued to rise rapidly from prior year, fueled by distribution growth and significant double-digit comps. Clearly, the Coach proposition is resonating with this consumer who is participating in this category, increasing numbers. Victor will talk more about our opportunity in China shortly.
Across all Full Price businesses, our robust results reflect the strength of our offering. As always, we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness. Beginning on December 24, we transitioned to spring with the introduction of the Colette collection offered across multiple fabrications and silhouettes anchored by both our hobo and tote styles. This was followed by the relaunch of Poppy in February and the new Kristin collection in March. 
With its distinctive hardware and soft feminine styling, Kristin is an important collection for Coach and has been the feature of our spring ad campaign. This season's product was very well received, and both handbags and women's accessories achieved strong comps in the quarter with handbag penetration in our North American retail stores rising to 60% from 59% last year, driven by unit comp sales increases and a slight increase in average unit retails.
Just this month, we introduced the collection of Natalie novelty store totes along with new colors  and a Dream C print and Poppy. And last week, we launched Audrey, a modern tote story featuring perforated leather, op art and print concepts. Additionally, our lead collection for Mothers' Day is Madison offered in fresh colors and patterns. For June, we're introducing new leather and pattern colors at Kristin, as well as a strong new op art  print. Our Kristin hobo continues to be the key item within the collection.
In addition, this July, we will launch a new Chelsea collection and evolve Poppy with updated styles, patterns and prints. 
On the factory side, our strong results were fueled by a powerful combination of new product introductions with key styles offered at great prices. Additionally, our inventory investment strategy enabled us to capture sales upside throughout the quarter. Our product assortment was also supported by our in-store and direct marketing campaigns.
I also wanted to spend a moment
[Audio Gap]
Which are located next to or nearby our most productive factory locations, are performing extremely well. We believe the strong consumer response we're experiencing reflects the strength of the Coach brand and the factory consumers' focus on value and function. It confirms our belief that there is a particularly large opportunity for Men's in our factory channel. 
In summary, we're excited with the continued progress we've made in improving our overall full price productivity. In addition, we're very pleased with the current sales trends in both our full price and factory channels and are well positioned on Mother's Day and the balance of the spring season. 
Our strategies continue to be focused on expansion opportunities both here in North America and increasingly, in international markets. In addition, as always, we are focused on improving performance in existing stores by increasing Coach's share of our consumers accessories wardrobe, while continuing to attract new customers into the franchise. I just discussed our Men's initiative, which we're confident will be a significant contributor to global growth in the seasons and years ahead.
Moving on to distribution growth. As mentioned in previous earnings calls, we expect that our  square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 10% this year, compared to 8% last year. Starting in North America, we will open 3 stores in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, bringing the total to 8 new North American retail stores for the year.  In addition, we will open 9 new factory stores during the balance of the year, primarily on our Men's initiative, bringing the total to 14 dedicated men's factory stores and 8 traditional factory stores for the year. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 8% this year.
I want to finally touch on Europe, a new region of expansion for Coach. To date, we have opened 7 boutiques and Printemps department stores in France. And through our JV with Hackett, we launched the brand with 4 shop-in-shops in Spain and 1 in Lisbon, with 1 more to go before year-end, all within El Corte Ingles. Last month, we opened our first retail store in the U.K. in the Westfield White City Mall and have been very pleased with its early results. 
Beyond the opportunities in the Coach concept and brand, as you know, we launched Reed Krakoff in September and a few boutiques in the U.S. and Japan, as well as through prestigious international specialty retailers, While still very early days, we are pleased that the product is appealing to the targeted pinnacle luxury consumer, and we were very pleased to announce the appointment of Valérie Herman as President and CEO, Reed Krakoff, who joined us just this month from YSL.
Earlier this fiscal year, we announced the creation of a new international retail organization with 3 major Asian hubs: Japan, mainland China and other Asian markets. We also announced the addition of 3 senior executives who will enable Coach to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities that exist for the brand in the region. Key to this new organization was the promotion of Victor Luis to the newly created position of President, Coach Retail International, with a responsibility for all of Coach's Directly-owned businesses outside North America. 
I will now and the turn the call over to Victor. Victor?"
526573,130285239,117702,"Coach Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2011",2011-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Lew. To put the opportunity in perspective, the premium bag and accessory market in Asia, including Japan, is nearly $12 billion today.

To put the opportunity in perspective, the premium bag and accessory market in Asia, including Japan, is nearly $12 billion today. And in contrast to the global market, which is about 85% women's and 15% men's, in Asia, Men's represents nearly 1/4 of the spend. 
Excluding Japan, the market is growing at a double-digit rate led by mainland China. In addition, Hong Kong, Korea and Southeast Asia are all expected to grow at more than 10% for the next several years, while Taiwan is projected to grow at a slightly slower pace. Overall, the region offers excellent potential where we can leverage our well-honed retail skills and international experience to drive the business, as we have done in Japan and are now doing in China. Coach is already among the top 5 brands in these markets with at least a mid-single digit share, and we have proven strategies in place to increase brand awareness and grow sales.
In Japan, the overall consumer market has been challenging for some years, and the category has contracted. Our goal was and continues to be market share gains, and we have done this quite well in our core Women's business. As elsewhere, we're now also focusing on Men's where we've already seen early success. 
As Lew noted earlier, we do expect the continued impact from the tragedy over the next few months, primarily a function of reduced traffic as the infrastructure problems in the northern and eastern parts of the country remain, resulting in transportation and power issues. 
However, barring  further significant aftershocks or worsening of the nuclear crisis, we expect our business to continue to show steady improvement. We expect to open 2 more stores in the fourth quarter for a total of 9 new Coach Japan locations, including 5 Men's stores for the year. In total, we expect the net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 4% this year, similar to last year.
Moving on to China, our largest geographic growth opportunity, where our sales are growing rapidly against a strong market backdrop. We will be adding 11 locations in the fourth quarter, 9 on the mainland and 2 in Hong Kong, taking us to 26 openings for the year and a total of 66 locations. As you know, we doubled sales in FY '10 to over $100 million and are now on track to generate sales of about $185 million this year, up from our estimates of $175 million shared on our last earnings call. We are targeting a 10% market share of what is projected to be over a $5 billion market or about $500 million in sales by FY '14, up from about a 5% share today.
Driving this growth, we expect to add about 30 new locations per annum during our planning horizon, focused on the mainland and across a multichannel model, including flagship, stand-alone retail stores, shop-in-shops and department stores and factory stores. 
In addition, based on our conversion opportunity against already strong traffic trends as the consumer becomes increasingly qualified to purchase luxury accessories, we expect to continue to achieve double-digit comp rates over this planning horizon. 
In fact, our research indicates that the purchasing  population is growing at nearly 20% annually, driven by the growth in the target segment, primarily through income gains and the increasing participation rate in the category itself. 
We would also note that in China, men participate heavily in the category both for self purchase and for gifting to other men and represent nearly half of the spend and up to 50% or more of our competitive set sales, yielding another opportunity for Coach. 
Further, as we grow awareness in China, we benefit globally from the growth in mainland China tourists as they visit and shop in key capitals around the world. In fact, we estimate that sales to mainland Chinese nationals represent as much as 25% of sales globally to our major competitors. 
Today, sales to Chinese nationals represents only 5% of Coach's global sales. Therefore, there is tremendous opportunity for us to take a larger share of a growing market where our proposition is clearly resonating and where building our distribution, team and awareness will lead to continued growth. As you may remember, China is the market where Coach enjoys its highest repurchase intent among existing consumers with over 90% of Coach shoppers expressing a positive intent to repurchase.
In FY '12, we will make significant investments towards awareness building as we leverage a 70th anniversary campaign as a foundation to build on our positioning as the New York fashion brand grounded in heritage and history. This integrated campaign will have several key elements, including an international brand ambassador, Gwyneth Paltrow, who has proven relevancy in China and other international markets. Beyond our Directly-owned business in China, we have significant wholesale businesses throughout Asia, and Lew referred to the strong sales growth we're experiencing in this channel earlier
Some months ago, we announced that we've signed an agreement to take control of our Domestic Retail businesses in Singapore and Malaysia, which, together, generate annual sales at retail of about $50 million. The agreement provides for a phase transition of the current Coach Retail businesses over the next year, beginning this July with Singapore. While the impact of the transition will be small, it is an important step towards controlling our future in Asia. 
We are especially excited about a new Singapore flagship on prestigious Orchard Road, which will be a directly-operated store opening in spring 2012. It will immediately raise brand awareness as Singapore is an important tourist gateway in Southeast Asia, serving the Indonesian and Indian shopper, while increasingly attracting mainland Chinese consumers as well.
We also have significant and growing distributor-run businesses in Korea, the second largest market for premium leather goods after Japan and the region; and Taiwan. Together, they represent about $200 million at retail for Coach in FY '11, serving both the domestic and travel retail customer through about 80 locations, over 50 in Korea and 30 in Taiwan. 
Given our focus in the region during this fiscal year, of the nearly 40 targeted new international wholesale locations, more than 20 will be in Asia. 
Separately, it's important to note that our Asia distribution center and Asia shared services center are online, shipping globally and prepared to provide savings, while also serving as a back office backbone for Coach China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and any future directly operated markets in the region. Simply put, it is ready to be scaled for leverage across the region. 
In summary, we are excited about the global opportunity for Coach, especially the emerging market potential given the rapid growth of the category and the foundation which we have begun to build in the key Asia region. 
At this time, I will turn it over to Mike Devine, our CFO, for further details on our financials. Mike?"
526573,130285239,117702,"Coach Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2011",2011-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Victor. Lew and Victor have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our third quarter results. As mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 14% with Direct-to-C",1132,"Thank you, Victor. Lew and Victor have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our third quarter results. 
As mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 14% with Direct-to-Consumer, which represents over 3/4 of our business, up 15% and Indirect up 14%. Earnings per share for the quarter increased 23% to $0.62, as compared to $0.50 in the year-ago period, as net income rose to $186 million from $158 million. 
As noted in the press release, we estimate that the events in Japan impacted sales by approximately $20 million and earnings per share by about $0.025 during March and the third quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, our operating income totaled $280 million in the third quarter, up 12% from $249 million in the same period last year. Operating margin in the quarter was 29.4%, compared to 30% even in the year-ago period.
In the third quarter, gross profit rose to $692 million from $616 million a year ago, and gross margin rate remained strong at 72.8%, compared with 74.1% a year ago, reflecting the impact of higher sourcing costs.
Moving to expenses. We were pleased that we were able to gain 70 basis points of leverage in the quarter. Specifically, SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales, also on a non-GAAP basis, improved from prior year levels in the third quarter and represented 43.4% of sales versus 44.1%. 
Once again, our primary Direct businesses here in North America and in Japan provided leverage to the corporate P&L, more than offsetting the impact of our investment spending. We believe we're striking the right balance between driving future growth opportunities and operating efficiencies.
As noted in our press release, we recorded certain one-time items during the third quarter, which resulted in a substantially lower tax rate of 26.5%. These included a favorable settlement of a multiyear tax return examination, which decreased Coach's provision for taxes by $16 million. 
In addition, the company made a $21 million contribution to the Coach Foundation and also contributed JPY 400 million or just under $5 million to the Japanese Red Cross. Together, these contributions totaled nearly $26 million pretax, impacting GAAP SG&A expenses by that amount and precisely offsetting the benefit of the tax settlement to net income and EPS.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Inventories at quarter end were $391 million, up 28% from the end of last year's Q3, but up 9% on a two-year basis. Our current inventory support the strong underlying business trends and will allow us to maximize sales this spring. Generally, it's worth reminding everyone that we've been rightsizing our inventory this year, bringing it up to more appropriate levels to support our growth. Including new initiatives such as Men's, global square footage expansion, Reed Krakoff and our new distribution center in Asia. 
Cash and short-term investments totaled $886 million, as compared with $908 million a year ago despite repurchases of nearly $1.2 billion worth of Coach common stock in the interim 12 months. During the third quarter, we repurchased and retired 3.5 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $54.51 per share, spending a total of $192 million. At the end of the period, approximately $1.3 billion remained under our repurchase authorization.
Net cash from operating activities in the third quarter was $227 million, compared to $205 million last year during Q3. Free cash flow in the third quarter was an inflow of $186 million versus $190 million in the same period last year due to higher net income, offset by working capital and fixed-asset expenditures. 
Our CapEx spending was $42 million versus $15 million in the same quarter a year ago. As we stated on our last 3 earnings call, based on our plans for the year, we expect that CapEx would be about $150 million, primarily for the opening of new stores across all geographies. 
Naturally, we were very pleased to report these strong financial results. And as Lew has said, we're well positioned for the remainder of the fiscal year. While we do not give specific guidance, as you know, I always think it's helpful for you modelers out there to keep a few things in mind when forecasting the finish of our year.
First and most generally, we continue to target double-digit sales increases globally with double-digit earnings growth. And given the ongoing strength in our business, we now believe that we'll achieve high-single digit same-store sales growth in North America for the fourth quarter, even in the face of more difficult compares. Additionally, we expect the continuation of our positive POS trends in our Indirect businesses. 
As noted in our release, given current conditions and projections for Japan, we expect a similar impact in the full fourth quarter of about $20 million or 2% to total Coach sales and about $0.02 to $0.03 to earnings per share. However, as discussed on prior calls, our fourth quarter comparisons will be impacted by the timing of shipments in our Indirect businesses and the extra week in the prior year's fourth quarter. As you may recall, this extra week contributed $70 million of sales and $0.08 of EPS to last year's Q4.
Second, we were excited that our top line sales growth drove higher levels of profitability in the first 9 months of the year. While our previous comments regarding gross margins still stand, our sales growth, coupled with controlled spending, will help offset both cost and channel mix pressures. 
Therefore, we're reiterating our previous guidance of a full year FY '11 operating margin at about last year's levels of about 31.5% on a 52-week basis, despite the quake-related shortfall in our very profitable Japan business. 
Third, our non-GAAP tax rate is likely to stay in the area achieved in the first 9 months for the balance of the year, as we further refine our international tax strategies. And fourth, I did want to update our share count guidance. We now believe that our fourth quarter average will be similar to 3Q at about $302 million on a fully diluted basis.
Before we open it up for Q&A, I want to echo Lew's earliest words. This was another excellent quarter for Coach. Clearly, our results bode well for the future, and we're confident that we'll continue to deliver very strong sales and earnings gains for the foreseeable future. 
Thank you all for joining us on our conference call today. And now Lew, Victor, Mike Tucci, Andrea and I will take some questions, which will then be followed by a brief comment from Lew, who is, I'm sure you can tell, is suffering from a touch of laryngitis but is hanging in boldly. So now we'll open the floor up to questions. Thank you."

China is developing as a wonderful market for multichannel distribution, both in department stores where we have tremendous opportunity. There are today approximately 600 department stores in China, of which approximately 100 of them already have luxury cosmetics, with sales approaching the top 100 department stores in Japan as another great measure, as well as the rapidly-developing shopping mall and slowly but surely developing factory outlet mall channel, which will be another terrific opportunity for us.

Firstly, we do sell through at a premium to North America pricing in the region, not premiums as rich as Japan's but in the neighborhood. And so our gross margin rates in China are quite robust rivaling even that of the Japan business. In terms of store four-walls, we are already seeing four-walls nicely into the 40% range and so that's driven of course by that gross margin rate. But also as you might suspect, our store wages are lower in China than they are anywhere else in the world, contributing to a healthy  four-wall. And as we gain in productivity and the brand gains awareness with landlords, we'll see our occupancy rate. The other big expense items on the store P&L begin to decline as a percentage of sales further enhancing store four-walls. Victor mentioned in his prepared remarks our approach to the region with a Asia distribution center and an Asia shared service center. So we're keyed to drive an efficient back office infrastructure to support both the China business and Pan-Asian approach. So all of those things taken together a lot of words will drive very, very healthy rates of profit and volume of profits from the region as we move into '12 and beyond."

Clearly, with Japan being one of our highest gross margin regions, losing that $20 million was hurtful of the gross margin rate but relatively immaterial. We certainly would've recorded a modestly higher gross margin rate, but it is a small percentage of the total company's business, and we were able to absorb it. I would add, though, I have to take this opportunity, that had we had that $20 million of sales and about $0.025 of earnings, we would have actually seen operating margin that leverage. We were -- did come up just short of Q3's op income level. Had we had the $20 million of that very profitable Japanese business, we would've seen operating margin improvement, which I have to say coming into the quarter, I do not think was going to be possible. So the business operated very efficiently across all geographies and mature businesses during the quarter. Similarly, I would just say for the fourth quarter, same dynamic. In our own projections that we've just kind of shared with you, we will see some very modest operating margin deleverage for the quarter. We would have gotten operating margin leverage had we not had the quake impact. Of course these are all forward-looking statements now to talk about fourth quarter. But I do think it demonstrates the diversity of our business model globally that we're able to absorb this profitable loss and still project that we can hit 31.5% op income for the year, kind of what we've been pointing to for a number of quarters now. So in a way I'm thinking about that as an increasing guidance, if you will, adjusted for the quake impact."

Kimberly, we're essentially in the same place on gross margin as we have been in terms of our guidance for the balance of FY '11. You'll recall that we were one of the first companies to talk about inflationary pressures well over a year ago, and that's holding. That being said, there are a number of positive things going on within gross margin to help offset these pressures. And we're guardedly optimistic that we'll see some modest sequential improvement actually in the first half of our FY '12, the back half of this calendar year versus the second half of our FY '11. It's because of counter-sourcing efforts, material inflation will not hit us as hard as others. The other thing that will be helpful is we'll also begin to anniversary those higher input costs from early last year's fiscal '11. Wage inflation is our biggest issue and we're battling that by moving products into lower-cost countries. We're ahead of schedule on this initiative, but it is still very early days there. And so while we are protecting our opening price points, we are also surgically taking advantage of pricing power, and we're doing this in both channels, both in our full price and our factory channel. The other thing we'll start to see which will be very helpful, is channel mix will actually begin to help us, we believe, as we move into FY '12, which will be a nice thing as growth in the Asian region that Victor spoke to helps channel mix there. And also just the underlying trends in our Full Price business in our mature markets of North America and Japan will also help channel mix. So we still are feeling good about our previous guidance gross margin in the boundary of 72% to 73%, going forward. We feel it very achievable."

In each of our geographies, we have in-market merchants who, constantly, with the support of our consumer insights team, are looking to understand the consumer and provide the design team with some logic to add to the magic that they of course do in designing the product. We have a very strong merchant team in Japan. We have today a merchant team in Shanghai, as well as Hong Kong, that is developing. And those teams provide the inputs into New York and then we'll buy from a global assortment, which occasionally, of course, is tweaked to meet local needs. On the whole, though, I would say that our assortments are rather global. In Japan, China, collections such as Madison, Poppy and Kristin, which are today  the main drivers in the North American business, are also main drivers for us in the region. There may be some functional areas that we have to tweak, whether it be in smaller goods or in handbags. As an example, for example, in handbags across Asia, across body bags, given the amount of commuting that takes place, do tend to have a higher penetration than say here in North America. That is something that we simply input into our buys locally. And I think one of the most important differences, as I've mentioned in my remarks, is the Men's opportunity. In Japan, the Men's market of that $4 billion size today, represents approximately 20%. In mainland China, it can represent 50% to more for most of our competitor brands, and it's approaching about 50% of the market, again. In Hong Kong, Macau and the rest of the region, and we're looking at 25% to 30% as well. And so our, in-market merchant teams are working very, very closely with our central merchandising teams and our design team to ensure that those very specific needs of that specific Asian male consumer are met. And so it's a highly collaborative effort with a tremendous amount of consumer insights, as well as, of course, the design talent, which is very much focused on presenting 1 New York Coach aesthetic to the world based here in New York."

As noted in our release this morning, we were very pleased with our fourth quarter results, including excellent sales and earnings growth. This quarter's performance demonstrated a continuation of the momentum we have been experiencing throughout FY '11, as we continue to improve productivity while expanding our distribution in new and existing geographies. Our results reflect a growing recognition of the Coach brand globally and the success of our new initiatives. 
Before I review the highlights of the quarter, I wanted to mention our CFO transition. First, as you know, Mike DeVine announced his retirement earlier this year effective later this month. This will be his last earnings call with Coach and we will miss Mike greatly. Mike has played a critical role in developing and executing the strategies that have driven our superior sales and earnings growth during his tenure with the company. We wish him every success in the future. At the same time, we are pleased to welcome Jane Austen, as our new who will be officially starting in early September.
Moving on in some key highlights of our quarter and fiscal year. Our performance in FY '11 was highlighted by increases of 18% in revenues, 20% in operating income and 30% in earnings per share, all on a comparable 52-week basis. It was a year of many milestones, including first, Coach surpassed $4 billion in sales, driven by gains in all of our business units. Second, we placed an increased emphasis on the globalization of our business, as we accelerated our international distribution growth, especially in Asia while we continued to open new stores and gain market share in Northern America. Third, we successfully refocused on the men's opportunity for Coach, as we began to open dedicated men's and dual gender locations globally, doubling the business year-over-year. And fourth, we increased our quarterly dividend by 50% and authorized another $1.5 billion buyback in January, demonstrating our financial strength, cash flow generation and our commitment to shareholder return. This annual performance was capped off by an excellent fourth quarter. Some key metrics were; first, net sales totaled $1.03 billion, an increase of 17% on a comparable 13-week to 13-week basis. Second, earnings per share totaled $0.68, up 22% from the $0.56 in the prior year on a same 13-week basis. Third, direct-to-consumer sales rose 18% on a comparable 13-week to 13-week basis. Fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter rose 10% on a comparable basis from prior year while total North American store sales rose 18%. Fifth, sales in Japan rose 6% in dollars and declined 7% in constant currency, also on a comparable basis, modestly impacted by the ongoing effects of the earthquake and tsunami. And finally, we continue to generate very strong sales and comps in China.
During the quarter, we opened three North American Retail stores, including two in new markets for Coach. For Pittsburgh, Virginia and Albuquerque, New Mexico, as well as our first mall-based men's store in Copley Plaza in Boston. We also closed two locations. In addition, we opened nine factory stores, including six men's dedicated locations. 
At the end of FY '11, there were 345 full priced at 143 factory stores in operation in North America. This was a net increase of three full priced stores including one men's retail store, as well as eight factory stores and 14 men's factory stores from the end of FY '10. 
Total square footage grew 7% for the year. 
Moving to Japan, two locations were added, a shop-in-shop and a men's factory store. Separately, all but two of the stores were closed due to the earthquake and tsunami had reopened by year-end. And over the last month, the remaining two have reopened. 
At year-end, there were 176 total locations in Japan with 20 stand-alone full priced stores, including eight flagships, 119 shop-in-shops, 30 factory stores and seven Duty Free locations. In total, a net of nine locations were added in Japan during FY '11 and three were expanding, yielding total square footage growth of about 4%. 
And in China, we added 11 new locations, nine on the mainland and two in Hong Kong. At the end of the quarter, there were 66 Coach locations in China, including 53 locations in the mainland and 22 cities. Additionally, there were 11 locations in Hong Kong and two in Macau. In aggregate, there was an increase of 25 net new locations for the fiscal year for square footage increase of 62%. 
Indirect sales which represented about 13% of Coach's sales on an annualized basis increased 12% on a comparable 13 to 13-week basis or 4% as reported to $113 million. This increase was driven by both international wholesale shipment and shipments into U.S. department stores. 
At POS, international sales rose significantly, driven by both distribution and comps while U.S. department store sales rose high single digits. 
We estimate that the addressable U.S. women's handbag and accessory category rose 5% to 10% during our fiscal fourth quarter. Over the same period, Coach's bag and accessories sales rose about 14% across all channels in North America, including in our own stores. 
For the fiscal year ended June, we estimate that the addressable category rose about 10% to approximately $9.3 billion while Coach's North America bag and accessories sales rose 14% across all channels and 17% in our own stores over the same period. 
Separately, it's worth noting our customers' outlook for the economy has been stable over the last few quarters, with a third of those surveyed still believing that the U.S. economy is improving. Our intention to purchase Coach remains high, with over 2/3 of consumers surveyed noting they probably or definitely would purchase a Coach product in the next 12 months.
Our total revenues in North America was up 17% in the quarter on a comparable 13-week to 13-week basis with our directly operated stores up 18%, as distribution growth augmented the comp performance. 
Fueling these overall comp results were strong gains in both the full priced and factory channels, driven by significant increases in conversion from prior year while ticket and traffic was essentially the same. We were particularly pleased with the improvement in the conversion rate since it is the driver that we have the most control over through product and service. 
We also are delighted by the very strong sales trends we are experiencing in our North American Coach.COM business, our largest store which of course is also extremely profitable. While we have long viewed this channel primarily as a marketing vehicle, sales growth accelerated at a significant double-digit pace during the fourth quarter. We expect that Internet sales will grow rapidly in the years ahead while also importantly driving consumers into the stores. 
While the full season is just underway, we are pleased with our current trends and consumers' continued response of our product and positioning. As noted for the quarter, we posted a 7% decrease in local currency in Japan and a 6% gain in dollars, excluding the extra week from last year's results. Five of the seven stores that remain closed at the end of March due to earthquake and tsunami damage reopened during the fourth quarter and the remaining two just reopened in this month as mentioned. 
Generally, business in Japan was trending where it was prior to the events of March 11, as business improved over the period. 
Naturally, I want to call on China which is our single largest geographic growth opportunity. During the fourth quarter, as all previous quarters this year, we achieved significant double-digit comp growth. And as I referenced earlier, we are opening stores primarily on the mainland where increasing numbers of consumers are participating in the category. 
Moving on to product. During the fourth quarter, we've maintained a high level of product innovation in respective units. In April, we introduced a collection of Natalie novelty store tote, along with new colors and the Dream C print and Poppy. In May, we launched Audrey a modern tote story featuring perforated leather are bought and print concepts. Additionally, our lead collection for Mother's Day was Matt is on offered in fresh colors and patterns. For June, we introduced new leather impact and Pollard and Crystal, as well as the strong new Op Art print. Our hobo continues to be the key item within the collection. This season's product was very well-received and both handbags and women's accessories achieved strong comps in the quarter, with handbag penetration in our North American Retail stores remaining at 55%. 
In addition, in July, we launched the new Chelsea collection and evolved Poppy with updated stills, patterns and prints. The Chelsea collection features a modern faceted turn lock inspired by our heritage and office primaries silhouettes. Poppy has been updated look with new leather and local fabrics and you push the closers. And August, we offered new Full fabrications and colors and patterns in Madison and a new shoulder bag Chelsea. On the factories side, our strong results were fueled by a powerful combination of new product introductions with key styles offered a great prices. Additionally, our inventory investment strategy enabled us to capture sales upside throughout the quarter. Our product assortment was also supported by our in-store and direct marketing campaigns. 
Naturally, I also want to touch on men's of global initiatives. As many of you know, we decided about 18 months ago that we would create a strong capability to leverage our reputation in the marketplace for quality leather men's products. Over this period, we built a team and infrastructure to become a market either in the men's category. And we began to expand our global footprint in men's. In the U.S., we've opened 3 full-priced dedicated men stores. 3 in New York, Copley Plaza in Boston and most recently Garden State in New Jersey. 
In addition, we've created about 40 dedicated men's concept shops in select full-priced flagships. We also opened a total of 14 North American men's dedicated factory stores as mentioned. Our results have exceeded our expectations and underscore the opportunity for Coach men's in the U.S. 
Outside of the U.S., with a male customer tends to be more style conscious, we've also opened a number of men's dedicated stores notably in Japan where we have seven men's stores today. Our future store growth in Japan will primarily be dedicated men's locations. More generally in Asia, including China, we are seeing excellent early results from dual gender stores. 
Our first year results have been excellent, as our men's sales doubled to over $200 million in FY '11. This performance underscores our confidence in men's as a significant growth driver for Coach, and we now believe it could contribute 25% or more of the company's growth over the next several years. 
As we enter FY '12 beyond the men's initiative, our overarching strategies remain largely unchanged. We will continue to focus on expansion opportunities, both in North America and increasingly in international markets. In addition, as always, we are focused on improving performance in existing stores by increasing Coach's share of our consumers' accessories wardrobe while continuing to attract new customers into the franchise.
Moving on to distribution growth, we expect that our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 12% in FY '12 compared to 9% last year. 
Starting in North America, we will open about 40 new stores in FY '12, with more than half being dedicated men's locations. In total, we expect to open about 15 net new full-priced locations, about half will be men's and 25 factory outlets, including 15 men's stores. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 7% this year in line with last year and driven by men's.
As we've discussed many times outside of North America, China is clearly our largest geographic opportunity, given the size of the market and the rate of growth. The Chinese consumer has embraced Coach, as evidenced by the significant double-digit comps we're consistently generating and extremely high repurchase intent among existing customers. 
Our sales in China totaled over $185 million, up from $108 million last year, as the market grew rapidly and we increased our share to 6% on the mainland. In addition, our unaided brand awareness among PRC consumers jumped to 16%, about double last year's level. This year, we will accelerate new store openings, with about 30 locations planned for the mainland. The vast majority will be dual gender stores given the size of the men's opportunity in China. Overall, we're now projecting sales of between $280 million and $300 million for FY '12, up from our previous guidance of $250 million. We also intend to open a few locations in Hong Kong in FY '12, along with the one or two in Singapore where we just acquired the operations of our distributor last month as planned. 
In FY '12, we will make significant investments towards increasing awareness in China, as we leverage our 70th anniversary campaign to build on our positioning as a New York fashion brand grounded at heritage and history. This integrated campaign will have several key elements, including an international brand ambassador, Gwyneth Paltrow who has proven relevancy in China and other international markets. 
In Japan, the overall consumer market remains very challenging and the category continues to contract. Our focus continues to be on gaining market share, and we have done this quite well in our core women's business. As discussed, we're now also focusing on men's where we have seen early success.
During FY '12, we expect to open about 15 net new locations in Japan, nearly all of them dedicated men's doors. In total, we expect the net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 10% this year compared to about 3% last year. 
Finally, beyond our directly-owned international businesses in Japan, China and now Singapore, we do have significant and growing distributor-run businesses in other Asian countries. We're also pleased to announce distribution agreements to open the first Coach store in Brazil which are expected to open next spring and in Vietnam with the first openings expected late this calendar year. During FY '12, we expect to open between 35 to 40 net new international wholesale locations, bringing our total number to nearly 250. 
Touching on Europe, last year, we opened a total of 14 locations, including 7 in front and in France for our JV with Hackett. 6 shops in El Corte Ingles, 5 in Spain and 1 in Lisbon, along with 1 retail store in the U.K. We've been pleased with our initial performance and the early reaction of domestic shopping and international tourists to the Coach proposition. For FY '12, we expect 3 additional openings in front on including 2 men's shops, as well as the number of new locations in Spain, the U.K. and Ireland through our joint venture. Naturally, we are very excited about our New Bond Street traction which is on target for the ice September opening and will be supported by our new ad campaign featuring Gwyneth Paltrow. 
Beyond the opportunities in the Coach brand as you know, we launched Reed Krakoff in September and a few boutiques in the U.S. and Japan, as well as through prestigious international specialty retailers. We are pleased that the product is appealing to the targeted pinnacle luxury consumer. As we mentioned on the 3Q call, Valérie Hermann joined Reed Krakoff as President and CEO of this April from Y. S. L. and has been a valuable addition to the leadership team. 
What I have just reviewed are our strategies to drive our business at a double-digit pace, given the continuing strength of the Coach business and our increasing global expansion. We have significant runway ahead of us, both in North America which remains a growing market and worldwide while our refocus on men's provides additional opportunities for growth. At this time, I will turn it over to Mike Devine, our CFO for further details on our financials. Mike?"

Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our fourth quarter results. As mentioned, on a comparable non-GAAP basis, our quarterly revenues rose 17% with direct-to-consumer, which represents about 87% of our business, up 18% and our indirect segment up 12%. 
Similarly, operating income rose over 20%. Net income for the quarter increased 18% and totaled $202 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.68, up 22%. 
On a reported basis, sales rose 9%. Net income rose 4% and earnings per share gained 7%. For the fiscal year, sales rose 18% on a comparable non-GAAP basis totaling $4.16 billion while earnings per share were $2.92, up 30% and net income was $881 million, up 24%. On a reported basis for the full year, sales rose 15%, net income gained 20% and earnings per share increased 26% from fiscal 2010.
For the quarter, operating income totaled $312 million, up 20% from the prior year on a comparable non-GAAP basis. And 5% above the 207 -- $297 million reported in the year-ago period. Operating margin was 30.3%, 80 basis points better than the 29.5% generated in the prior year on a comparable basis and versus 31.2% on a reported basis.
During the quarter, gross profit rose 6% to $740 million from $697 million reported a year ago while gross margin rate was 71.8%, versus 73.3%, reflecting the impact of higher sourcing cost, partially offset by channel mix and modestly lower levels of promotional activity in our North American Factory business. 
SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales totaled 41.5% compared to the 42.1% reported in the year-ago quarter. We were pleased that we were able to gain 60 basis points of leverage on a reported basis in the quarter as our primary direct businesses here in North America and in Japan provided leverage to the corporate P&L, more than offsetting the impact of our investment spending. We believe we are striking the right balance between driving the future growth opportunities and operating efficiencies.
For the full year, operating income totaled $1.3 billion and 32% of sales, up 20% from the prior year on a comparable basis and 14% above the $1.15 billion reported in the year-ago period. On a comparable basis, operating margin expanded 50 basis points and was above our stated objectives and last year's actual margin of 31.5%. On a reported basis, operating margin was 31.4% versus 31.9%. 
During the year, gross profit rose 15%, a $3.02 billion from $2.63 billion a year ago. Gross margin was 72.7% versus 73.0% a year ago. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales totaled 41.3% compared to the 41.1% reported in fiscal 2010.
As a reminder, there were number of items that affected comparability for the fourth quarter and the full year. First, the 53rd week in FY can contributed about $17 million to sales, $24 million to net income or $0.08 to earnings. 
In addition, as noted in our press release, we recorded certain one-time items during the third quarter of 2011 which resulted in a substantially lower tax rate of 26.5% in that quarter. These included a favorable settlement of a multi-year tax return examination which decreased Coach's provision for taxes by $15 million. In addition, the company made a $21 million contribution to the Coach Foundation and also contributed 400 million yen or just under $5 million to the Japanese Red Cross.
Together, these contributions totaled nearly $26 million pretax, impacting GAAP SG&A expenses by that amount and precisely offsetting the benefit of the tax settlement to both net income and EPS.
Moving to the balance sheet. Inventory levels at quarter end were $422 million, up about 16% from FY '10 year end consistent with our expectations and sales growth. This inventory level allows us to support 25 net new North American stores, 8 net new locations at Coach Japan and 25 additional Coach China stores from the year-ago period, as well as the Asia distribution center, the Reed Krakoff brand and our men's initiatives. Further, our current inventory support the strong underlying business trends and will allow us to maximize sales this summer and fall. 
Cash and short-term investments stood at $702 million essentially even with $696 million a year ago after $1.1 billion of share repurchase in the interim 12 months. During the fourth fiscal quarter alone, we repurchased and retired about 6.3 million shares of our common stock at an average cost of $60.08, spending a total of $381 million. At the end of the year, approximately $962 million remain under our present repurchase authorization.
Net cash from operating activities in the fourth quarter was $221 million compared to $182 million last year during Q4. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was an inflow of $164 million versus $152 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending was $57 million versus $29 million in the same quarter a year ago. 
For the full fiscal year 2011, net cash from operating activities was $1 billion compared to $991 million a year ago. Free cash flow in fiscal year '11 was an inflow of $886 million versus $910 million in fiscal year '10. CapEx spending totaled $148 million for the year compared to $81 million in the prior year. 
It's important to note that based on our current plans for FY '12, we expect the CapEx for next year will be up in the area of $200 million, up to the area of $200 million, driven by the timing shifts of certain projects for primarily for the opening of new stores across all geographies and investments in technology, necessary to enable our global expansion. 
While we are not giving specific guidance for FY '12, we see the year unfolding very similarly to FY '11, with strong revenue trends, robust core businesses delivering leverage while we continue to invest in the future. 
First, and most generally, we do expect to achieve double-digit sales, with earnings per share growth ahead of the top line. Our sales will be driven in part by at least mid single-digit comp store sales in North America. Second, as we said before, our gross margin is likely to improve sequentially in the first half of the year versus the second half of FY '11 though it will still contract on a year-over-year basis. The second half is expected to be slightly easier as we anniversary increased sourcing cost of channel mix and our sourcing initiatives contribute to profitability. On balance, we expect gross margin to remain high and 72% to 73% range for FY '12. Third, on SG&A, we expect our core businesses to continue to deliver leverage while we will also continue to invest in global growth for the future.
Fourth, we are committed to delivering an operating margin similar to what we've generated over the past 2 years. And fifth, our tax rate is likely to be in the area of 33% for the year, as we further refine our international tax strategies.
In summary, our fourth quarter and FY '11 results demonstrated our ability to manage our business nimbly while investing prudently in longer-term opportunities. We're accelerating our distribution plans to leverage the emerging market opportunity, with a particular focus on China, while also exploring new geographies, capitalizing on the increasing popularity and recognition of the Coach brand with discerning consumers globally. We are also optimizing the brand's potential on men's, leveraging our long heritage in this category. And with a business model that generate significant cash flow and with virtually no debt, we are in a position to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities globally while continuing to return capital to shareholders.
As Lou mentioned, this will be my last earnings call. So before I open it to questions, I just wanted to say that this has been the most remarkable and rewarding 10 years of my professional career. I'm quite proud of what Coach has accomplished over this time. And in addition to all the many people at Coach I need to thank at this time I'd especially like to thank all of my many, many buy side and sell side friends out there.  Your support has been tremendous. I'd also like to welcome Jane who I know is listening as she takes the best CFO job in global branded retail and close by saying that I plan to be a long-time shareholder as Coach's prospects have never been brighter and I look forward to watching its continued success as I pursue my boardwork and spend more time with my family. Thank you. I would now like to open it up to questions and answers."

That was a significant driver and I think it speaks to the longer-term rebalancing of the assortment and driving a focus on balance in our assortment in handbags. Additionally, we are starting to see men's become a comp driver contributing to overall productivity in our stores, particularly in the significant high profile stores where we have men and a more definitive and larger format within those stores. As you well know, we tend to be conservative planners. And while it's early in the quarter in Q1, the trends and capital of the business that we saw coming out of Q4, we really see that continuing in the early stages of July.

But Kimberly, we're yes, what we're asking people to model is essentially a flat gross margin rate. At this point in the year, it's still very early days of the year, but we're actually feeling guardedly optimistic about gross margin. We do believe that the quarter just reported is likely the low point, and we feel that we can continue to deliver margin rate similar to '10, '11 for FY '12 with some gradual upside improvement in the out years and that's in spite of continued sourcing pressures. The most worrisome of which is wage inflation in China. And as we've talked about, we're at the beginning of the very aggressive program to move 50% of our units produced out of China and days were ahead of schedule on this one then we'll continue to battle this. We are now actually hearing some rumblings of wage inflation elsewhere. But in terms of materials, our design, merchandising, sourcing teams have done just a remarkable job in designing into cost in counter sourcing and of course our cost of materials is not as dramatically impacted as some of the apparel brands that you might be following, and we do feel that as we move into the second half of the year, we will be anniversarying the works of the material cost inflation. Really all the other dynamics of the business will be helpful the gross margin, as we move forward, most notably channel mix, as our full price business is in our mature markets continue to trend positive and notably China grows far more quickly than total Coach. Also the conversion of these distributor businesses, namely Singapore thus far, with Malaysia on the rise will also be helpful to gross margin rate. And I think all of them long-term as men's shares increases, we could also drive gross margin rate longer-term, as our relatively new men's team get their legs under them and frankly, we believe that our male consumers are not as bargain-obsessed as their wives and girlfriends. So the last thing that can be helpful to gross margin rate is our overall economy generally improves, I think we'll continue to see full price trending nicely and perhaps over time have a little bit of pricing power in the factory channel as well. So we're looking for, to model relatively flat FY '12 as the year plays out, the wildcard will be the promotional levels probably in factory, but there is gradual improvement in upside into the out years."

Couple of things that are happening in the market that are favorable to is. One, with a strong leather cycle which affords us the ability to get higher retail. And that will drive average unit retails up and our handbag category had an impact on Q4 where you see average handbags over $400 contributing 17% store overall handbag sales of versus '11 in the prior year. That's a big deal. The refinement of the Poppy strategy allows us to work the mix with inside the Poppy for some potential retail upside. And one other significant opportunity is what we are calling small bags and cross body which offers the pricing opportunity and also protect our opening price points both within Poppy, as well as in the overall mix. That's a very important element. So while we dial back to a target of $300 and land it in the $280 a couple of years back, we are now working our way back in trying to capture that $20 of upside in average unit retail in handbag and I think overtime, we see that as a real opportunity. On the factory side, it's a similar story with a strong leather trend and also being very creative there on our pricing strategy to create differentiation in our retail strategy between leather offer and signature offer which the customer accepts on the factory side and allow us to gain average unit retail increases in our handbag category. That was also helpful and a driver and we see that continuing."

I think we're looking probably for listing sometime in the early fall. But going back to SG&A, we were very pleased actually for the fourth quarter and the way we just delivered, as we talked about, we delivered. On an as reported basis 60 basis points of leverage to the SG&A line, and we did that in spite of losing some of our healthiest revenue from Japan, as a result of the earthquake. And again that's on the 14 versus 13 week compare. So we're continuing to see great leverage being delivered by our mature businesses here in North America and in Japan while we continue some investment spend. So we talked about that has spending as we direct for RK, the infrastructure build in China and in other parts of Asia to allow us to capitalize on the opportunity there as being an investment in the neighborhood of about $0.08 this most recent year. I think we can look to see that investment continue to improve into '12 and into the out years. Valérie Hermann has come in and is really doing a number of the right things around RK.  We're likely to pick up a couple of pennies in investments spend there. What will happen is that in the first half of the fiscal year, we will pick up the Singapore direct expenses. And while relatively modest to total Coach, that will be a drag to the SG&A rate. It will take Victor Luis and his team a little bit of time to bring that business to its full profit potential.  We will get there, but get there quickly. It takes a while for us to install our retail processes, adjust the assortment. And remember, when we transition a business from the distributor to a direct business, we're buying that inventory back at wholesale prices. So the first six months of selling is also at somewhat reduced gross margin rates. But going forward into FY '12, the balance of all these investments and the leverage we expect to get from our mature businesses looks like we're going to have a pretty flat SG&A rate for the year while we grow the business very strong double-digit top-line."

That's when we talk dual gender. That's the format that we want to get into the marketplace.

First on the second opportunity perspective, if it is important to understand the scale of the opportunity that stands in front of us. We're looking at a premium handbag and accessories market in Asia of about $12 billion today, of which approximately 25% is men's. That would be approximate penetration in Japan and in PRC in mainland China, we see the penetration of men closer to 50%, so a truly tremendous opportunity for us. From a distribution perspective, of course you're all aware that we have a more mature distribution in Japan and as Lew mentioned in his speakers notes today, we already have 7 location in Japan, 3 full priced locations and four factory locations. We're planning to open 15 doors in FY '12, the vast majority of which will be men's freestanding location. Increasingly, we'll also experimenting with bringing men into current women's doors where it makes sense from a distribution perspective. This is slightly more difficult in Japan given that most of our locations are in department stores were often on the women's handbag floor. In China, the opportunity is truly founded as we like to say. We have a today 53 locations in the mainland combined with 13 in Hong Kong and Macau as you know, of those 53 locations in the mainland, already 23 of those are those dual gender locations that Mike referred to earlier. And of the 30 locations that we plan to open in FY '12, approximately 27 of those will also be dual gender locations, so it is very much at the center of our strategy.
We have the opportunity to go boldly there, given that of course we are building distribution from scratch. Across other Asian markets, we are looking at both strategies as we are in Japan and here in the U.S. where we have the opportunity to stop with new doors and works, we're going with the dual gender location and we're not -- we're going in with the men's standalone locations."

As noted in our release this morning, we were very pleased with our fourth quarter results, including excellent sales and earnings growth. This quarter's performance demonstrated a continuation of the momentum we have been experiencing throughout FY '11, as we continue to improve productivity while expanding our distribution in new and existing geographies. Our results reflect a growing recognition of the Coach brand globally and the success of our new initiatives. 
Before I review the highlights of the quarter, I wanted to mention our CFO transition. First, as you know, Mike Devine announced his retirement earlier this year effective later this month. This will be his last earnings call with Coach, and we will miss Mike greatly. Mike has played a critical role in developing and executing the strategies that have driven our superior sales and earnings growth during his tenure with the company. We wish him every success in the future. At the same time, we're pleased to welcome Jane Nielsen, as our new CFO who will be officially starting in early September.
Moving on with some key highlights of our quarter and fiscal year. Our performance in FY '11 was highlighted by increases of 18% in revenues, 20% in operating income and 30% in earnings per share, all on a comparable 52-week basis. It was a year of many milestones including, first, Coach surpassed $4 billion in sales, driven by gains in all of our business units. Second, we placed an increased emphasis on the globalization of our business, as we accelerated our international distribution growth, especially in Asia while we continued to open new stores and gain market share in North America. Third, we successfully refocused on the men's opportunity for Coach, as we began to open dedicated men's and dual gender locations globally, doubling the business year-over-year. And fourth, we increased our quarterly dividend by 50% and authorized another $1.5 billion buyback in January, demonstrating our financial strength, cash flow generation and our commitment to shareholder return. 
This annual performance was capped off by an excellent fourth quarter. Some key metrics were: first, net sales totaled $1.03 billion, an increase of 17% on a comparable 13-week to 13-week basis. Second, earnings per share totaled $0.68, up 22% from the $0.56 in the prior year on a same 13-week basis. Third, direct-to-consumer sales rose 18% on a comparable 13-week to 13-week basis. Fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter rose 10% on a comparable basis from prior year while total North American store sales rose 18%. Fifth, sales in Japan rose 6% in dollars and declined 7% in constant currency, also on a comparable basis, modestly impacted by the ongoing effects of the earthquake and tsunami. And finally, we continue to generate very strong sales and comps in China.
During the quarter, we opened 3 North American Retail stores, including 2 new markets for Coach, Fredericksburg, Virginia and Albuquerque, New Mexico, as well as our first mall-based men's store in Copley Plaza in Boston. We also closed 2 locations. In addition, we opened 9 factory stores, including 6 men's dedicated locations. 
At the end of FY '11, there were 345 full price and 143 factory stores in operation in North America. This was a net increase of 3 full price stores, including one men's retail store, as well as 8 factory stores and 14 men's factory stores from the end of FY '10. Total square footage grew 7% for the year. 
Moving to Japan, 2 locations were added, a shop-in-shop and a men's factory store. Separately, all but 2 of the stores that were closed due to the earthquake and tsunami had reopened by year end. And over the last month, the remaining 2 have reopened. 
At year end, there were 176 total locations in Japan, with 20 stand-alone full price stores, including 8 flagships, 119 shop-in-shops, 30 factory stores and 7 Duty Free locations. In total, a net of 9 locations were added in Japan during FY '11 and 3 were expanding, yielding total square footage growth of about 4%. 
And in China, we added 11 new locations, 9 on the Mainland and 2 in Hong Kong. At the end of the quarter, there were 66 Coach locations in China, including 53 locations in the Mainland and 22 cities. Additionally, there were 11 locations in Hong Kong and 2 in Macau. In aggregate, there was an increase of 25 net new locations for the fiscal year for a square footage increase of 62%. 
Indirect sales, which represent about 13% of Coach's sales on an annualized basis, increased 12% on a comparable 13 to 13-week basis or 4% as reported to $113 million. This increase was driven by both international wholesale shipment and shipments into U.S. department stores. 
At POS, international sales rose significantly, driven by both distribution and comps, while U.S. department store sales rose high single digits. 
We estimate that the addressable U.S. women's handbag and accessory category rose 5% to 10% during our fiscal fourth quarter. Over the same period, Coach's bag and accessories sales rose about 14% across all channels in North America including in our own stores. 
For the fiscal year ended June, we estimate that the addressable category rose about 10% to approximately $9.3 billion, while Coach's North American bag and accessories sales rose 14% across all channels and 17% in our own stores over the same period. 
Separately, it's worth noting our customers' outlook for the economy has been stable over the last few quarters, with 1/3 of those surveyed still believing that the U.S. economy is improving. Our intention to purchase Coach remains high, with over 2/3 of consumers surveyed noting they probably or definitely would purchase a Coach product in the next 12 months.
Our total revenues in North America was up 17% in the quarter on a comparable 13-week to 13-week basis, with our directly operated stores up 18%, as distribution growth augmented the comp performance. 
Fueling these overall comp results was strong gains in both the full price and factory channels, driven by significant increases in conversion from prior year while ticket and traffic was essentially the same. We were particularly pleased with the improvement in the conversion rate since it is the driver that we have the most control over through product and service. 
We also have been delighted by very strong sales trends we're experiencing in our North American coach.com business, our largest store which of course is also extremely profitable. While we have long viewed this channel primarily as a marketing vehicle, sales growth accelerated at a significant double-digit pace during the fourth quarter. We expect that Internet sales will grow rapidly in the years ahead while also importantly driving consumers into the stores. 
While the full season is just underway, we are pleased with our current trends and consumers' continued response to our product and positioning. As noted for the quarter, we posted a 7% decrease in local currency in Japan and a 6% gain in dollars, excluding the extra week from last year's results. Five of the seven stores that remain closed at the end of March due to earthquake and tsunami damage reopened during the fourth quarter and the remaining 2 just reopened this month as mentioned. Generally, business in Japan is trending where it was prior to the events of March 11, as business improved over the period. 
Naturally, I want to call out China, which is our single largest geographic growth opportunity. During the fourth quarter, as for all previous quarters this year, we achieved significant double-digit comp growth. And as I referenced earlier, we are opening stores primarily on the Mainland where increasing numbers of consumers are participating in the category. 
Moving on to product. During the fourth quarter, we maintained the high level of product innovation in distinctive units. In April, we introduced the collection of Natalie novelty store totes along with new colors and a Dream C print and Poppy. In May, we launched Audrey, a modern tote story featuring perforated leather, op art and print concepts. Additionally, our lead collection for Mother's Day was Madison offered in fresh colors and patterns. For June, we introduced new leather and pattern colors in Kristin, as well as the strong new op art print. Our Kristin hobo continues to be the key item within the collection. This season's product was very well-received, and both handbags and women's accessories achieved strong comps in the quarter, with handbag penetration in our North American Retail stores remaining at 55%. 
In addition, in July, we launched the new Chelsea collection and evolved the Poppy with updated styles, patterns and prints. The Chelsea collection features a modern faceted turnlock inspired by our heritage and offered in timeless silhouettes. Poppy has an updated look with new leather and local fabrics and new pushlock closures. 
In August, we're offering new fall fabrications, colors and patterns in Madison and a new shoulder bag in Chelsea. On the factory side, our strong results were fueled by a powerful combination of new product introductions with key styles offered at great prices. Additionally, our inventory investment strategy enabled us to capture sales upside throughout the quarter. Our product assortment was also supported by our in-store and direct marketing campaigns. 
Naturally, I also want to touch on men's, a global initiative. As many of you know, we decided about 18 months ago that we would create a strong capability to leverage our reputation in the marketplace for quality leather men's products. Over this period, we've built a team and the infrastructure to become a market leader in the men's category. And we began to expand our global footprint in men's. In the U.S., we've opened 3 full price dedicated men stores: Bleecker Street in New York, Copley Plaza in Boston and most recently, Garden State in New Jersey. In addition, we've created about 40 dedicated men's concept shops in select full price flagships. We also opened a total of 14 North American men's dedicated factory stores as mentioned. Our results have exceeded our expectations and underscore the opportunity for Coach men's in the U.S. 
Outside of the U.S., with the male customer tends to be more style conscious, we've also opened a number of men's dedicated stores, notably in Japan where we have 7 men's stores today. Our future store growth in Japan will primarily be dedicated men's locations. More generally, in Asia, including China, we are seeing excellent early results from dual gender stores. 
Our first year results have been excellent, as our men's sales doubled to over $200 million in FY '11. This performance underscores our confidence in men's as a significant growth driver for Coach, and we now believe it could contribute 25% or more of the company's growth over the next several years. 
As we enter FY '12 beyond the men's initiative, our overarching strategies remain largely unchanged. We will continue to focus on expansion opportunities, both in North America and increasingly in international markets. In addition, as always, we're focused on improving performance in existing stores by increasing Coach's share of our consumers' accessories, wardrobe while continuing to attract new customers into the franchise.
Moving on to distribution growth. We expect that our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 12% in FY '12 compared to 9% last year. 
Starting in North America, we will open about 40 new stores in FY '12, with more than half being dedicated men's locations. In total, we expect to open about 15 net new full price locations, about half will be men's and 25 factory outlets, including 15 men's stores. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 7% this year in line with last year and driven by men's.
As we've discussed many times, outside of North America, China is clearly our largest geographic opportunity, given the size of the market and the rate of growth. The Chinese consumer has embraced Coach, as evidenced by the significant double-digit comps we're consistently generating and the extremely high repurchase intent among existing customers. 
Our sales in China totaled over $185 million, up from $108 million last year, as the market grew rapidly, and we increased our share to 6% on the Mainland. In addition, our unaided brand awareness among PRC consumers jumped to 16%, about double last year's level. This year, we will accelerate new store openings, with about 30 locations planned for the Mainland. The vast majority will be dual gender stores, given the size of the men's opportunity in China. Overall, we're now projecting sales of between $280 million and $300 million for FY '12, up from our previous guidance of $250 million. We also intend to open a few locations in Hong Kong in FY '12, along with 1 or 2 in Singapore where we just acquired the operations of our distributor last month as planned. 
In FY '12, we will make significant investments towards increasing awareness in China, as we leverage our 70th anniversary campaign to build on our positioning as a New York fashion brand grounded in heritage and history. This integrated campaign will have several key elements, including an international brand ambassador, Gwyneth Paltrow, who has proven relevancy in China and other international markets. 
In Japan, the overall consumer market remains very challenging and the category continues to contract. Our focus continues to be on gaining market share, and we have done this quite well in our core women's business. As discussed, we're now also focusing on men's where we have seen early success.
During FY '12, we expect to open about 15 net new locations in Japan, nearly all of them dedicated men's doors. In total, we expect the net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 10% this year compared to about 3% last year. 
Finally, beyond our directly-owned international businesses in Japan, China and now Singapore, we do have significant and growing distributor-run businesses in other Asian countries. We're also pleased to announce distribution agreements to open the first Coach stores in Brazil which are expected to open next spring, and in Vietnam with the first openings expected late this calendar year. During FY '12, we expect to open between 35 to 40 net new international wholesale locations, bringing our total number to nearly 250. 
Touching on Europe, last year, we opened a total of 14 locations, including 7 in Prenton and France and to our JV with Hackett. 6 shop-in-shops in El Corte Inglés, 5 in Spain and 1 in Lisbon, along with 1 retail store in the U.K. We've been pleased with our initial performance and the early reaction of domestic shopping and international tourists to the Coach proposition. For FY '12, we expect 3 additional openings in Prenton, including 2 men's shops, as well as a number of new locations in Spain, the U.K. and Ireland through our joint venture. Naturally, we're very excited about our New Bond Street flagship, which is on target for a September opening and will be supported by our new ad campaign featuring Gwyneth Paltrow. 
Beyond the opportunities in the Coach brand, as you know, we launched Reed Krakoff last September in a few boutiques in the U.S. and Japan, as well as through prestigious international specialty retailers. We are pleased that the product is appealing to the targeted pinnacle luxury consumer. As we mentioned on the 3Q call, Valérie Hermann joined Reed Krakoff as President and CEO this April from YSL and has been a valuable addition to the leadership team. 
What I have just reviewed are our strategies to drive our business at a double-digit pace, given the continuing strength of the Coach business and our increasing global expansion. We have significant runway ahead of us, both in North America which remains a growing market and worldwide while our refocus on men's provides an additional opportunity for growth. At this time, I will turn it over to Mike Devine, our CFO, for further details on our financials. Mike?"

Lew has just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our fourth quarter results. As mentioned, on a comparable non-GAAP basis, our quarterly revenues rose 17%",1456,"Thank you, Lew. Lew has just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our fourth quarter results. As mentioned, on a comparable non-GAAP basis, our quarterly revenues rose 17% with Direct-to-Consumer, which represents about 87% of our business, up 18%, and our indirect segment, up 12%. 
Similarly, operating income rose over 20%. Net income for the quarter increased 18% and totaled $202 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.68, up 22%. On a reported basis, sales rose 9%. Net income rose 4%, and earnings per share gained 7%. For the fiscal year, sales rose 18% on a comparable non-GAAP basis, totaling $4.16 billion, while earnings per share were $2.92, up 30%, and net income was $881 million, up 24%. On a reported basis for the full year, sales rose 15%, net income gained 20%, and earnings per share increased 26% from fiscal 2010.
For the quarter, operating income totaled $312 million, up 20% from the prior year on a comparable non-GAAP basis and 5% above the $297 million reported in the year-ago period. Operating margin was 30.3%, 80 basis points better than the 29.5% generated in the prior year on a comparable basis and versus 31.2% on a reported basis.
During the quarter, gross profit rose 6% to $740 million from $697 million reported a year ago, while gross margin rate was 71.8% versus 73.3%, reflecting the impact of higher sourcing cost, partially offset by channel mix and modestly lower levels of promotional activity in our North American factory business. 
SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales totaled 41.5% compared to the 42.1% reported in the year-ago quarter. We were pleased that we were able to gain 60 basis points of leverage on a reported basis in the quarter, as our primary direct businesses here in North America and in Japan provided leverage to the corporate P&L, more than offsetting the impact of our investment spending. We believe we're striking the right balance between driving future growth opportunities and operating efficiencies.
For the full year, operating income totaled $1.3 billion and 32% of sales up 20% from the prior year on a comparable basis and 14% above the $1.15 billion reported in the year-ago period. On a comparable basis, operating margin expanded 50 basis points and was above our stated objective and last year's actual margin of 31.5%. On a reported basis, operating margin was 31.4% versus 31.9%. 
During the year, gross profit rose 15% to $3.02 billion from $2.63 billion a year ago. Gross margin was 72.7% versus 73.0% a year ago. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales totaled 41.3% compared to the 41.1% reported in fiscal 2010.
As a reminder, there were a number of items that affected comparability for the fourth quarter and the full year. First, the 53rd week in FY '10 contribute about $70 million to sales, $24 million to net income or $0.08 to earnings. 
In addition, as noted in our press release, we recorded certain onetime items during the third quarter of 2011, which resulted in a substantially lower tax rate of 26.5% in that quarter. These included a favorable settlement of a multiyear tax return examination, which decreased Coach's provision for taxes by $16 million. In addition, the company made a $21 million contribution to the Coach Foundation and also contributed JPY 400 million or just under $5 million to the Japanese Red Cross.
Together, these contributions totaled nearly $26 million pretax, impacting GAAP SG&A expenses by that amount and precisely offsetting the benefit of the tax settlement to both net income and EPS.
Moving to the balance sheet. Inventory levels at quarter end were $422 million, up about 16% from FY '10 year end, consistent with our expectations and sales growth. This inventory level allows us to support 25 net new North American stores, 8 net new locations at Coach Japan and 25 additional Coach China stores from the year-ago period, as well as the Asia distribution center, the Reed Krakoff brand and our men's initiatives. Further, our current inventory support the strong underlying business trends and will allow us to maximize sales this summer and fall. 
Cash and short-term investments stood at $702 million, essentially even with $696 million a year ago after $1.1 billion of share repurchase in the interim 12 months. During the fourth fiscal quarter alone, we repurchased and retired about 6.3 million shares of our common stock at an average cost of $60.08, spending a total of $381 million. At the end of the year, approximately $962 million remain under our present repurchase authorization.
Net cash from operating activities in the fourth quarter was $221 million compared to $182 million last year during Q4. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was an inflow of $164 million versus $152 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending was $57 million versus $29 million in the same quarter a year ago. 
For the full fiscal year 2011, net cash from operating activities was $1 billion compared to $991 million a year ago. Free cash flow in fiscal year '11 was an inflow of $886 million versus $910 million in fiscal year '10. CapEx spending totaled $148 million for the year compared to $81 million in the prior year. 
It's important to note that based on our current plans for FY '12, we expect the CapEx for next year will be up in the area of $200 million -- up to the area of $200 million, driven by the timing shifts of certain projects or primarily for the opening of new stores across all geographies and investments in technology necessary to enable our global expansion. 
While we are not giving specific guidance for FY '12, we see the year unfolding very similarly to FY '11, with strong revenue trends, robust core businesses delivering leverage while we continue to invest in the future. 
First, and most generally, we do expect to achieve double-digit sales, with earnings per share growth ahead of the top line. Our sales will be driven in part by at least mid-single-digit comp store sales in North America. Second, as we've said before, our gross margin is likely to improve sequentially in the first half of the year versus the second half of FY '11 though it will still contract on a year-over-year basis. The second half is expected to be slightly easier as we anniversary increased sourcing cost of channel mix and our sourcing initiatives contribute to profitability. On balance, we expect gross margin to remain high and in the 72% to 73% range for FY '12. Third, on SG&A, we expect our core businesses to continue to deliver leverage while we will also continue to invest in global growth for the future. Fourth, we are committed to delivering an operating margin similar to what we've generated over the past 2 years. And fifth, our tax rate is likely to be in the area of 33% for the year, as we further refine our international tax strategies.
In summary, our fourth quarter and FY '11 results demonstrated our ability to manage our business nimbly while investing prudently in longer-term opportunities. We're accelerating our distribution plans to leverage the emerging market opportunity, with a particular focus on China, while also exploring new geographies, capitalizing on the increasing popularity and recognition of the Coach brand with discerning consumers globally. We are also optimizing the brand's potential on men's, leveraging our long heritage in this category. And with a business model that generate significant cash flow and with virtually no debt, we are in a position to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities globally while continuing to return capital to shareholders.
As Lew mentioned, this will be my last earnings call. So before I open it to questions, I just wanted to say that this has been the most remarkable and rewarding 10 years of my professional career. I'm quite proud of what Coach has accomplished over this time. And in addition to all the many people at Coach I need to thank, at this time, I'd especially like to thank all of my many, many good buy-side and sell-side friends out there. Your support has been tremendous. I'd also like to welcome Jane, who I know is listening as she takes the best CFO job in global branded retail, and close by saying that I plan to be a long-time shareholder as Coach's prospects have never been brighter. And I look forward to watching its continued success as I pursue my board work and spend more time with my family. Thank you. I would now like to open it up to questions and answers."

That was a significant driver, and I think it speaks to the longer-term rebalancing of the assortment and driving a focus on balance in our assortment in handbags. Additionally, we're starting to see men's become a comp driver contributing to overall productivity in our stores, particularly in the significant high profile stores where we have men and a more definitive and larger format within those stores. As you well know, we tend to be conservative planners. And while it's early in the quarter of Q1, the trends and the capital of the business that we saw coming out of Q4, we really see that continuing in the early stages of July. We like what we see happening with the response to product, largely driven by Chelsea, a very strong response to what I would call a more a refined look within Poppy and continued reaction to newness in our factory channel where we continue to refine our flow strategies there.

At this point in the year",449,"Why don't I take the latter half of that first, and then, perhaps Mike or Lew could jump in on the first part of the question. But Kimberly, we're -- yes, what we're asking people to model is essentially a flat gross margin rate. At this point in the year, it's still very early days of the year, but we're actually feeling guardedly optimistic about gross margin. We do believe that the quarter just reported is likely the low point. And we feel that we can continue to deliver margin rate similar to '10 and '11 for FY '12 with some gradual upside improvement in the out years, and that's in spite of continued sourcing pressures. The most worrisome of which is wage inflation in China. As we've talked about, we're at the beginning of a very aggressive program to move 50% of our units produced out of China. And while it's early days, we're ahead of schedule on this one then we'll continue to battle this. We're now actually hearing some rumblings of wage inflation elsewhere. But in terms of materials, our design, merchandising and sourcing teams have done just a remarkable job in designing into cost and counter-sourcing. And of course, our cost of materials are not as dramatically impacted as some of the apparel brands you might be following. And we do feel that as we move into the second half of the year, we'll be anniversarying the worst of the material cost inflation. Really, all the other dynamics of the business will be helpful to gross margin as we move forward, most notably, channel mix, as our full price businesses in our mature markets continue to trend positive. And notably, China grows far more quickly than total Coach. Also the conversion of these distributor businesses, namely Singapore, thus far with Malaysia on horizon will also be helpful to gross margin rate. And I think all of them is long term as men's shares increases, we can also drive gross margin rate longer-term, as our relatively new men's team get their legs under them. And frankly, we believe that our male consumers are not as bargain-obsessed as their wives and girlfriends. So the last thing I think that can be helpful to gross margin rate is our overall economy generally improves, I think we'll continue to see full price trending nicely, and perhaps over time have a little bit of pricing power in the factory channel as well. So we're looking for -- to model relatively flat FY '12 as the year plays out, the wildcard will be the promotional levels probably in factory, but there is gradual improvement in upside into the out years."

Couple of things that are happening in the market that are favorable to us. One is we're in strong leather cycle which affords us the ability to get higher retail, and that will drive average unit retails up. And our handbag category had an impact on Q4 where you see average handbags over $400 contributing 17% to our overall handbag sales versus '11 in the prior year. That's a big deal. The refinement of the Poppy strategy allows us to work the mix with insight of Poppy for some potential retail upside. And one other significant opportunity is what we're calling small bags and cross body, which offers us the pricing opportunity, and also protect our opening price points both within Poppy, as well as in the overall mix. That's a very important element. So while we dial back to a target of $300 and land it in the $280 range a couple of years back, we're now working our way back in trying to capture that $20 of upside in average unit retail in handbag. And I think overtime, we see that as a real opportunity. On the factory side, it's a similar story with a strong leather trend and also being very creative there on our pricing strategy to create differentiation in our retail strategy between leather offer and signature offer which the customer accepts on the factory side and allows us to gain average unit retail increases in our handbag category. That was also helpful and a driver and we see that continuing."

And we're currently going back and forth with the exchange answering some questions based on the documents we've submitted, required to get listed. I think we're looking probably for listing some time in the early fall. But going back to SG&A, we were very pleased actually in the fourth quarter and the way we just delivered, as we talked about, we delivered. On an as reported basis, 60 basis points of leverage to the SG&A line, and we did that in spite of losing some of our healthiest revenue from Japan as a result of the earthquake. And again, that's on the 14 versus 13-week compare. So we're continuing to see great leverage being delivered by our mature businesses here in North America and in Japan while we continue the investment spend. So we talked about that investment spending as it was directed for RK, the infrastructure build in China and in other parts of Asia to allow us to capitalize on the opportunity there as being an investment in the neighborhood of about $0.08 this most recent year. I think we can look to see that investment continue to improve into '12 and into the out years. Valérie Hermann has come in and is really doing, I think, a number of the right things around RK.  We're likely to pick up a couple of pennies in investment spend there. What will happen is that in the first half of the fiscal year, we will pick up the Singapore direct expenses. And while relatively modest to total Coach, that will be a drag to the SG&A rate. It will take Victor Luis and his team a little bit of time to bring that business to its full profit potential. We will get there, but to get there quickly, it takes a while for us to install our retail processes, adjust the assortment. And remember, when we transition a business from the distributor to a direct business, we're buying that inventory back at wholesale prices. So the first 6 months of selling is also at somewhat reduced gross margin rates. But going forward into FY '12, the balance of all these investments and the leverage we expect to get from our mature businesses looks like we're going to have a pretty flat SG&A rate for the year while we grow the business very strong double-digit top line."

First, from the side of opportunity perspective, I think it's important to understand the scale of the opportunity that stands in front of us. We're looking at a premium handbag and accessories market in Asia of about $12 billion today, of which approximately 25% is men's. That would be the approximate penetration in Japan and in P.R.C. In Mainland, China, we see the penetration of men's closer to 50%, so a truly tremendous opportunity for us. From a distribution perspective, of course, you're all aware that we have a more mature distribution in Japan. And as Lew mentioned in the speakers notes, today, we have already 7 locations in Japan, 3 full price locations and 4 factory locations. We're planning to open 15 doors in FY '12, the vast majority of which will be men's freestanding location. Increasingly, we're also experimenting with bringing men's into current women's doors where it makes sense from a distribution perspective. This is slightly more difficult in Japan, given that most of our locations are in department stores, where often we're on the women's handbag floor. In China, the opportunity is truly founded, as we like to say. We have a, today, 53 locations in the Mainland combined with 13 in Hong Kong and Macau, as you know. Of those 53 locations in the Mainland, already 23 of those are those dual gender locations that Mike referred to earlier. And of the 30 locations that we plan to open in FY '12, approximately 27 of those will also be dual gender locations, so it is very much at the center of our strategy.
We have the opportunity to go boldly there, given that, of course, we are building distribution from scratch. Across other Asian markets, we are looking at both strategies as we are in Japan, and here in the U.S. where we have the opportunity to start with new doors. And if it works, we're going in with the dual gender location, and we're not -- we're going in with the men's standalone locations."

These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences. Please refer to our latest annual report on Form 10-K for a complete list of these risk factors. Also please note that historical growth trends may not be indicative of future growth.
Please note that the results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ending July 2, 2011, included 13 and 52 weeks, respectively, while the same periods in fiscal 2010 included 14 and 53 weeks, respectively.

This will be his last earnings call with Coach, and we will miss Mike greatly. Mike has played a critical role in developing and executing the strategies that have driven our superior sales and earnings growth during his tenure with the company. We wish him every success in the future. At the same time, we're pleased to welcome Jane Nielsen as our new CFO who will be officially starting in early September.

It was a year of many milestones including, first, Coach surpassed $4 billion in sales, driven by gains in all of our business units. Second, we placed an increased emphasis on the globalization of our business, as we accelerated our international distribution growth, especially in Asia while we continued to open new stores and gain market share in North America. Third, we successfully refocused on the men's opportunity for Coach, as we began to open dedicated men's and dual gender locations globally, doubling the business year-over-year. And fourth, we increased our quarterly dividend by 50% and authorized another $1.5 billion buyback in January, demonstrating our financial strength, cash flow generation and our commitment to shareholder return. 
This annual performance was capped off by an excellent fourth quarter. Some key metrics were: first, net sales totaled $1.03 billion, an increase of 17% on a comparable 13-week to 13-week basis. Second, earnings per share totaled $0.68, up 22% from the $0.56 in the prior year on a same 13-week basis. Third, direct-to-consumer sales rose 18% on a comparable 13-week to 13-week basis. Fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter rose 10% on a comparable basis from prior year while total North American store sales rose 18%. Fifth, sales in Japan rose 6% in dollars and declined 7% in constant currency, also on a comparable basis, modestly impacted by the ongoing effects of the earthquake and tsunami. And finally, we continue to generate very strong sales and comps in China.
During the quarter, we opened 3 North American Retail stores, including 2 in new markets for Coach, Fredericksburg, Virginia and Albuquerque, New Mexico, as well as our first mall-based men's store in Copley Plaza in Boston. We also closed 2 locations. In addition, we opened 9 factory stores, including 6 men's dedicated locations. 
At the end of FY '11, there were 345 full price and 143 factory stores in operation in North America. This was a net increase of 3 full price stores, including one men's retail store, as well as 8 factory stores and 14 men's factory stores from the end of FY '10. Total square footage grew 7% for the year. 
Moving to Japan, 2 locations were added, a shop-in-shop and a men's factory store. Separately, all but 2 of the stores that were closed due to the earthquake and tsunami had reopened by year end. And over the last month, the remaining 2 have reopened. 
At year end, there were 176 total locations in Japan, with 20 stand-alone full price stores, including 8 flagships, 119 shop-in-shops, 30 factory stores and 7 Duty Free locations. In total, a net of 9 locations were added in Japan during FY '11, and 3 were expanding, yielding total square footage growth of about 4%. 
And in China, we added 11 new locations, 9 on the Mainland and 2 in Hong Kong. At the end of the quarter, there were 66 Coach locations in China, including 53 locations in the Mainland and 22 cities. Additionally, there were 11 locations in Hong Kong and 2 in Macau. In aggregate, there was an increase of 25 net new locations for the fiscal year for a square footage increase of 62%. 
Indirect sales, which represent about 13% of Coach's sales on an annualized basis, increased 12% on a comparable 13 to 13-week basis or 4% as reported to $113 million. This increase was driven by both international wholesale shipments and shipments into U.S. department stores. 
At POS, international sales rose significantly, driven by both distribution and comps, while U.S. department store sales rose high single digits. 
We estimate that the addressable U.S. women's handbag and accessory category rose 5% to 10% during our fiscal fourth quarter. Over the same period, Coach's bag and accessories sales rose about 14% across all channels in North America including in our own stores. 
For the fiscal year ended June, we estimate that the addressable category rose about 10% to approximately $9.3 billion, while Coach's North American bag and accessories sales rose 14% across all channels and 17% in our own stores over the same period. 
Separately, it's worth noting our customers' outlook for the economy has been stable over the last few quarters with 1/3 of those surveyed still believing that the U.S. economy is improving. Our intention to purchase Coach remains high, with over 2/3 of consumers surveyed noting they probably or definitely would purchase a Coach product in the next 12 months.
Our total revenues in North America was up 17% in the quarter on a comparable 13-week to 13-week basis, with our directly operated stores up 18%, as distribution growth augmented the comp performance. 
Fueling these overall comp results were strong gains in both the full price and factory channels, driven by significant increases in conversion from prior year while ticket and traffic were essentially the same. We were particularly pleased with the improvement in the conversion rate since it is the driver that we have the most control over through product and service. 
We also have been delighted by the very strong sales trends we're experiencing in our North American coach.com business, our largest store which, of course, is also extremely profitable. While we have long viewed this channel primarily as a marketing vehicle, sales growth accelerated at a significant double-digit pace during the fourth quarter. We expect that Internet sales will grow rapidly in the years ahead while also importantly driving consumers into the stores. 
While the fall season is just underway, we are pleased with our current trends and consumers' continued response to our product and positioning. As noted for the quarter, we posted a 7% decrease in local currency in Japan and a 6% gain in dollars, excluding the extra week from last year's results. Five of the 7 stores that remain closed at the end of March due to earthquake and tsunami damage reopened during the fourth quarter, and the remaining 2 just reopened this month as mentioned. Generally, business in Japan is trending where it was prior to the events of March 11, as business improved over the period. 
Naturally, I want to call out China, which is our single largest geographic growth opportunity. During the fourth quarter, as for all previous quarters this year, we achieved significant double-digit comp growth. And as I referenced earlier, we are opening stores primarily on the Mainland where increasing numbers of consumers are participating in the category. 
Moving on to product. During the fourth quarter, we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness. In April, we introduced a collection of Natalie novelty straw totes along with new colors and a Dream C print in Poppy. In May, we launched Audrey, a modern tote story featuring perforated leather, op art and print concepts. Additionally, our lead collection for Mother's Day was Madison, offered in fresh colors and patterns. For June, we introduced new leather and pattern colors in Kristin, as well as a strong new op art print. Our Kristin hobo continues to be the key item within the collection. This season's product was very well-received, and both handbags and women's accessories achieved strong comps in the quarter with handbag penetration in our North American Retail stores remaining at 55%. 
In addition, in July, we launched the new Chelsea collection and evolved Poppy with updated styles, patterns and prints. The Chelsea collection features a modern faceted turnlock inspired by our heritage and offered in timeless silhouettes. Poppy has an updated look with new leather and local fabrics and new pushlock closures. 
In August, we're offering new fall fabrications, colors and patterns in Madison and a new shoulder bag in Chelsea. On the factory side, our strong results were fueled by a powerful combination of new product introductions with key styles offered at great prices. Additionally, our inventory investment strategy enabled us to capture sales upside throughout the quarter. Our product assortment was also supported by our in-store and direct marketing campaigns. 
Naturally, I also want to touch on men's, a global initiative. As many of you know, we decided about 18 months ago that we would create a strong capability to leverage our reputation in the marketplace for quality leather men's products. Over this period, we've built a team and the infrastructure to become a market leader in the men's category. And we’ve begun to expand our global footprint in men's. In the U.S., we've opened 3 full price dedicated men stores: Bleecker Street in New York, Copley Plaza in Boston and, most recently, Garden State in New Jersey. In addition, we've created about 40 dedicated men's concept shops in select full price flagships. We also opened a total of 14 North American men's dedicated factory stores as mentioned. Our results have exceeded our expectations and underscore the opportunity for Coach men's in the U.S. 
Outside of the U.S., where the male customer tends to be more style conscious, we've also opened a number of men's dedicated stores, notably in Japan where we have 7 men's stores today. Our future store growth in Japan will primarily be dedicated men's locations. More generally, in Asia, including China, we are seeing excellent early results from dual gender stores. 
Our first year results have been excellent, as our men's sales doubled to over $200 million in FY '11. This performance underscores our confidence in men's as a significant growth driver for Coach, and we now believe it could contribute 25% or more of the company's growth over the next several years. 
As we enter FY '12 beyond the men's initiative, our overarching strategies remain largely unchanged. We will continue to focus on expansion opportunities, both in North America and increasingly in international markets. In addition, as always, we're focused on improving performance in existing stores by increasing Coach's share of our consumers' accessories wardrobe while continuing to attract new customers into the franchise.
Moving on to distribution growth. We expect that our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 12% in FY '12 compared to 9% last year. 
Starting in North America, we will open about 40 new stores in FY '12 with more than half being dedicated men's locations. In total, we expect to open about 15 net new full price locations, about half will be men's, and 25 factory outlets, including 15 men's stores. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 7% this year in line with last year and driven by men's.
As we've discussed many times, outside of North America, China is clearly our largest geographic opportunity, given the size of the market and the rate of growth. The Chinese consumer has embraced Coach, as evidenced by the significant double-digit comps we're consistently generating and the extremely high repurchase intent among existing customers. 
Our sales in China totaled over $185 million, up from $108 million last year, as the market grew rapidly, and we increased our share to 6% on the Mainland. In addition, our unaided brand awareness among P.R.C. consumers jumped to 16%, about double last year's level. This year, we will accelerate new store openings with about 30 locations planned for the Mainland. The vast majority will be dual gender stores, given the size of the men's opportunity in China. Overall, we're now projecting sales of between $280 million and $300 million for FY '12, up from our previous guidance of $250 million. We also intend to open a few locations in Hong Kong in FY '12, along with 1 or 2 in Singapore where we just acquired the operations of our distributor last month as planned. 
In FY '12, we will make significant investments towards increasing awareness in China, as we leverage our 70th anniversary campaign to build on our positioning as a New York fashion brand grounded in heritage and history. This integrated campaign will have several key elements, including an international brand ambassador, Gwyneth Paltrow, who has proven relevancy in China and other international markets. 
In Japan, the overall consumer market remains very challenging, and the category continues to contract. Our focus continues to be on gaining market share, and we have done this quite well in our core women's business. As discussed, we're now also focusing on men's where we have seen early success.
During FY '12, we expect to open about 15 net new locations in Japan, nearly all of them dedicated men's doors. In total, we expect the net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 10% this year compared to about 3% last year. 
Finally, beyond our directly owned international businesses in Japan, China and now Singapore, we do have significant and growing distributor-run businesses in other Asian countries. We're also pleased to announce distribution agreements to open the first Coach stores in Brazil, which are expected to open next spring, and in Vietnam with the first openings expected late this calendar year. During FY '12, we expect to open between 35 to 40 net new international wholesale locations, bringing our total number to nearly 250. 
Touching on Europe. Last year, we opened a total of 14 locations, including 7 in Printemps in France and through our JV with Hackett, 6 shop-in-shops in El Corte Inglés, 5 in Spain and 1 in Lisbon, along with 1 retail store in the U.K. We've been pleased with our initial performance and the early reaction of domestic shoppers and international tourists to the Coach proposition. For FY '12, we expect 3 additional openings in Printemps, including 2 men's shops, as well as a number of new locations in Spain, the U.K. and Ireland through our joint venture. Naturally, we're very excited about our New Bond Street flagship, which is on target for a September opening and will be supported by our new ad campaign featuring Gwyneth Paltrow. 
Beyond the opportunities in the Coach brand, as you know, we launched Reed Krakoff last September in a few boutiques in the U.S. and Japan, as well as through prestigious international specialty retailers. We are pleased that the product is appealing to the targeted pinnacle luxury consumer. As we mentioned on the 3Q call, Valérie Hermann joined Reed Krakoff as President and CEO this April from YSL and has been a valuable addition to the leadership team. 
What I have just reviewed are our strategies to drive our business at a double-digit pace, given the continuing strength of the Coach business and our increasing global expansion. We have significant runway ahead of us, both in North America, which remains a growing market, and worldwide, while our refocus on men's provides an additional opportunity for growth. At this time, I will turn it over to Mike Devine, our CFO, for further details on our financials. Mike?"
526573,138378332,150597,"Coach, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2011",2011-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Lew. Lew has just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our fourth quarter results. As mentioned, on a comparable non-GAAP basis, our quarterly revenues rose 17%",1456,"Thank you, Lew. Lew has just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our fourth quarter results. As mentioned, on a comparable non-GAAP basis, our quarterly revenues rose 17% with Direct-to-Consumer, which represents about 87% of our business, up 18%, and our indirect segment, up 12%. 
Similarly, operating income rose over 20%. Net income for the quarter increased 18% and totaled $202 million with earnings per diluted share of $0.68, up 22%. On a reported basis, sales rose 9%. Net income rose 4%, and earnings per share gained 7%. For the fiscal year, sales rose 18% on a comparable non-GAAP basis, totaling $4.16 billion, while earnings per share were $2.92, up 30%, and net income was $881 million, up 24%. On a reported basis for the full year, sales rose 15%, net income gained 20%, and earnings per share increased 26% from fiscal 2010.
For the quarter, operating income totaled $312 million, up 20% from the prior year on a comparable non-GAAP basis and 5% above the $297 million reported in the year-ago period. Operating margin was 30.3%, 80 basis points better than the 29.5% generated in the prior year on a comparable basis and versus 31.2% on a reported basis.
During the quarter, gross profit rose 6% to $740 million from $697 million reported a year ago, while gross margin rate was 71.8% versus 73.3%, reflecting the impact of higher sourcing costs, partially offset by channel mix and modestly lower levels of promotional activity in our North American factory business. 
SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales totaled 41.5% compared to the 42.1% reported in the year-ago quarter. We were pleased that we were able to gain 60 basis points of leverage on a reported basis in the quarter, as our primary direct businesses here in North America and in Japan provided leverage to the corporate P&L, more than offsetting the impact of our investment spending. We believe we're striking the right balance between driving future growth opportunities and operating efficiencies.
For the full year, operating income totaled $1.3 billion and 32% of sales, up 20% from the prior year on a comparable basis and 14% above the $1.15 billion reported in the year-ago period. On a comparable basis, operating margin expanded 50 basis points and was above our stated objective and last year's actual margin of 31.5%. On a reported basis, operating margin was 31.4% versus 31.9%. 
During the year, gross profit rose 15% to $3.02 billion from $2.63 billion a year ago. Gross margin was 72.7% versus 73.0% a year ago. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales totaled 41.3% compared to the 41.1% reported in fiscal 2010.
As a reminder, there were a number of items that affected comparability for the fourth quarter and the full year. First, the 53rd week in FY '10 contributed about $70 million to sales, $24 million to net income or $0.08 to earnings. 
In addition, as noted in our press release, we recorded certain onetime items during the third quarter of 2011 which resulted in a substantially lower tax rate of 26.5% in that quarter. These included a favorable settlement of a multiyear tax return examination, which decreased Coach's provision for taxes by $16 million. In addition, the company made a $21 million contribution to the Coach Foundation and also contributed JPY 400 million or just under $5 million to the Japanese Red Cross.
Together, these contributions totaled nearly $26 million pretax, impacting GAAP SG&A expenses by that amount and precisely offsetting the benefit of the tax settlement to both net income and EPS.
Moving to the balance sheet. Inventory levels at quarter end were $422 million, up about 16% from FY '10 year end, consistent with our expectations and sales growth. This inventory level allows us to support 25 net new North American stores, 8 net new locations at Coach Japan and 25 additional Coach China stores from the year-ago period, as well as the Asia distribution center, the Reed Krakoff brand and our men's initiatives. Further, our current inventory support the strong underlying business trends and will allow us to maximize sales this summer and fall. 
Cash and short-term investments stood at $702 million, essentially even with $696 million a year ago after $1.1 billion of share repurchase in the interim 12 months. During the fourth fiscal quarter alone, we repurchased and retired about 6.3 million shares of our common stock at an average cost of $60.08, spending a total of $381 million. At the end of the year, approximately $962 million remained under our present repurchase authorization.
Net cash from operating activities in the fourth quarter was $221 million compared to $182 million last year during Q4. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was an inflow of $164 million versus $152 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending was $57 million versus $29 million in the same quarter a year ago. 
For the full fiscal year 2011, net cash from operating activities was $1 billion compared to $991 million a year ago. Free cash flow in fiscal year '11 was an inflow of $886 million versus $910 million in fiscal year '10. CapEx spending totaled $148 million for the year compared to $81 million in the prior year. 
It's important to note that based on our current plans for FY '12, we expect the CapEx for next year will be up in the area of $200 million -- up to the area of $200 million, driven by the timing shifts of certain projects or primarily for the opening of new stores across all geographies and investments in technology necessary to enable our global expansion. 
While we are not giving specific guidance for FY '12, we see the year unfolding very similarly to FY '11 with strong revenue trends, robust core businesses delivering leverage while we continue to invest in the future. 
First, and most generally, we do expect to achieve double-digit sales with earnings per share growth ahead of the top line. Our sales will be driven in part by at least mid-single-digit comp store sales in North America. Second, as we've said before, our gross margin is likely to improve sequentially in the first half of the year versus the second half of FY '11, though it will still contract on a year-over-year basis. The second half is expected to be slightly easier as we anniversary increased sourcing costs, while channel mix and our sourcing initiatives contribute to profitability. On balance, we expect gross margin to remain high and in the 72% to 73% range for FY '12. Third, on SG&A, we expect our core businesses to continue to deliver leverage while we will also continue to invest in global growth for the future. Fourth, we are committed to delivering an operating margin similar to what we've generated over the past 2 years. And fifth, our tax rate is likely to be in the area of 33% for the year, as we further refine our international tax strategies.
In summary, our fourth quarter and FY '11 results demonstrated our ability to manage our business nimbly while investing prudently in longer-term opportunities. We're accelerating our distribution plans to leverage the emerging market opportunity, with a particular focus on China, while also exploring new geographies, capitalizing on the increasing popularity and recognition of the Coach brand with discerning consumers globally. We are also optimizing the brand's potential on men's, leveraging our long heritage in this category. And with a business model that generates significant cash flow and with virtually no debt, we are in a position to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities globally while continuing to return capital to shareholders.
As Lew mentioned, this will be my last earnings call. So before I open it to questions, I just wanted to say that this has been the most remarkable and rewarding 10 years of my professional career. I'm quite proud of what Coach has accomplished over this time. And in addition to all the many people at Coach I need to thank, at this time, I'd especially like to thank all of my many, many good buy-side and sell-side friends out there. Your support has been tremendous. I'd also like to welcome Jane, who I know is listening as she takes the best CFO job in global branded retail, and close by saying that I plan to be a long-time shareholder as Coach's prospects have never been brighter. And I look forward to watching its continued success as I pursue my board work and spend more time with my family. Thank you. I would now like to open it up to questions and answers."

Additionally, we're starting to see men's become a comp driver, contributing to overall productivity in our stores, particularly in the significant high profile stores where we have men’s in a more definitive and larger format within those stores. As you well know, we tend to be conservative planners. And while it's early in the quarter in Q1, the trends and tempo of the business that we saw coming out of Q4, we really see that continuing in the early stages of July. We like what we see happening with the response to product, largely driven by Chelsea, a very strong response to what I would call a more a refined look within Poppy and continued reaction to newness in our factory channel where we continue to refine our flow strategies there. And I think the other important channel to mention is that our digital opportunity continues to be a growth driver for us, not only from a sales and revenue standpoint, but in terms of visitation and browse. And we know that a large reason for our consumers coming to our site is to pre-shop our stores, so we see that as a continued opportunity as we enter into Q1."

But Kimberly, we're -- yes, what we're asking people to model is essentially a flat gross margin rate. At this point in the year, it's still very early days of the year, but we're actually feeling guardedly optimistic about gross margin. We do believe that the quarter just reported is likely the low point. And we feel that we can continue to deliver margin rates similar to '10 and '11 for FY '12 with some gradual upside improvement in the out years, and that's in spite of continued sourcing pressures, the most worrisome of which is wage inflation in China. As we've talked about, we're at the beginning of a very aggressive program to move 50% of our units produced out of China. And while it's early days, we're ahead of schedule on this one, and we'll continue to battle it as we're now actually hearing some rumblings of wage inflation elsewhere. But in terms of materials, our design, merchandising and sourcing teams have done just a remarkable job in designing into cost and counter-sourcing. And of course, our cost of materials are not as dramatically impacted as some of the apparel brands you might be following. And we do feel like as we move into the second half of the year, we'll be anniversary-ing the worst of the material cost inflation. Really, all the other dynamics of the business will be helpful to gross margin as we move forward, most notably, channel mix, as our full price businesses in our mature markets continue to trend positive. And notably, China grows far more quickly than total Coach. Also the conversion of these distributor businesses, namely Singapore thus far, with Malaysia on horizon will also be helpful to gross margin rate. And I think, ultimately, long term as men's shares increases, we can also drive gross margin rate longer-term, as our relatively new men's team gets their legs under them. And frankly, we believe that our male consumers are not as bargain-obsessed as their wives and girlfriends. So the last thing I think that can be helpful to gross margin rate is as the overall economy generally improves, I think we'll continue to see full price trending nicely and perhaps over time have a little bit of pricing power in the factory channel as well. So we're looking for -- to model relatively flat FY '12 as the year plays out. The wildcard will be the promotional levels probably in factory, but there is gradual improvement in upside into the out years."

Couple of things that are happening in the market that are favorable to us. One is we're in a strong leather cycle, which affords us the ability to get higher retails, and that will drive average unit retails up in our handbag category, had an impact on Q4 where you see average handbags over $400 contributing 17% to our overall handbag sales versus '11 in the prior year. That's a big deal. The refinement of the Poppy strategy allows us to work the mix with inside of Poppy for some potential retail upside. And one other significant opportunity is what we're calling small bags and cross body, which offers us a pricing opportunity and also protects our opening price points both within Poppy, as well as in the overall mix. That's a very important element. So while we dialed back to a target of $300 and landed in the $280 range a couple of years back, we're now working our way back in trying to capture that $20 of upside in average unit retail in handbags. And I think overtime, we see that as a real opportunity. On the factory side, it's a similar story with a strong leather trend and also being very creative there on our pricing strategy to create differentiation in our retail strategy between leather offer and signature offer which the customer accepts on the factory side and allows us to gain average unit retail increases in our handbag category. That was also helpful and a driver, and we see that continuing."

It’s proving to be complex. And we're currently going back and forth with the exchange answering some questions based on the documents we've submitted, required to get listed. I think we're looking probably for a listing sometime in the early fall. But going back to SG&A, we were very pleased actually in the fourth quarter and the way we just delivered, as we talked about, we delivered, on an as reported basis, 60 basis points of leverage to the SG&A line, and we did that in spite of losing some of our healthiest revenue from Japan as a result of the earthquake. And again, that's on the 14 versus 13-week compare. So we're continuing to see great leverage being delivered by our mature businesses here in North America and in Japan while we continue the investment spend. So we talked about that investment spending as it was directed for RK, the infrastructure build in China and in other parts of Asia to allow us to capitalize on the opportunity there as being an investment in the neighborhood of about $0.08 this most recent year. I think we can look to see that investment continue to improve into '12 and into the out years. Valérie Hermann has come in and is really doing, I think, a number of the right things around RK.  We're likely to pick up a couple of pennies of investment spend there. What will happen is that in the first half of the fiscal year, we will pick up the Singapore direct expenses. And while relatively modest to total Coach, that will be a drag to the SG&A rate. It will take Victor Luis and his team a little bit of time to bring that business to its full profit potential. We will get there, but to get there quickly, it takes a while for us to install our retail processes, adjust the assortment. And remember, when we transition a business from the distributor to a direct business, we're buying that inventory back at wholesale prices. So the first 6 months of selling is also at somewhat reduced gross margin rates. But going forward into FY '12, the balance of all these investments and the leverage we expect to get from our mature businesses looks like we're going to have a pretty flat SG&A rate for the year while we grow the business very strong double-digit top line."

On the full price side, we're really pleased with what we see happening in the couple of stores that we have open outside of Bleecker Street, and we’ve committed to a handful of stores this year that we're working on, including a format where we have men's and women's side-by-side with a pass-through that will open in the spring in Pentagon Center Mall outside of D.C.

First, from the size of opportunity perspective, I think it's important to understand the scale of the opportunity that stands in front of us. We're looking at a premium handbag and accessories market in Asia of about $12 billion today, of which approximately 25% is men's. That would be the approximate penetration in Japan and in P.R.C., in Mainland, China, we see the penetration of men's closer to 50%, so a truly tremendous opportunity for us. From a distribution perspective, of course, you're all aware that we have a more mature distribution in Japan. And as Lew mentioned in the speakers’ notes, today, we have already 7 locations in Japan, 3 full price locations and 4 factory locations. We're planning to open 15 doors in FY '12, the vast majority of which will be men's freestanding locations. Increasingly, we're also experimenting with bringing men's into current women's doors where it makes sense from a distribution perspective. This is slightly more difficult in Japan, given that most of our locations are in department stores, where often we're on the women's handbag floor. In China, the opportunity is truly boundless, as we like to say. We have, today, 53 locations in the Mainland combined with 13 in Hong Kong and Macau, as you know. Of those 53 locations in the Mainland, already 23 of those are those dual gender locations that Mike referred to earlier. And of the 30 locations that we’ve plan to open in FY '12, approximately 27 of those will also be dual gender locations, so it is very much at the center of our strategy.
We have the opportunity to go boldly there, given that, of course, we are building distribution from scratch. Across other Asian markets, we are looking at both strategies as we are in Japan and here in the U.S. where we have the opportunity to start with new doors and it works, we're going in with the dual gender location, and where not, we're going in with the men's standalone locations."

In North America, we are continuing to grow our share of an expanding market. While in developing geographies, we are leveraging the inherent opportunity, investing in distribution and marketing initiatives. Beyond the top line, we are also very pleased with our high levels of profitability and substantial cash generation in Q1. Looking forward, and given the strength of our product pipeline, breadth of our assortment and shoppers' strong interest in accessories, gifts and self-purchase poses we're clearly well positioned for another excellent holiday season.
While I will get into further detail about current condition and the outlook of business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first. Some highlights were: first, net sales totaled $1.05 billion versus $912 million a year ago, an increase of 15%; second, earnings per share totaled $0.73, up 16% from prior year; third, direct-to-consumer sales, which now included our single business rose 17% to $910 million from $777 million in the prior year on a comparable basis; fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter rose 9.2% from prior year, while total store sales rose 15%; fifth, sales in Japan rose 1% on a constant currency basis and 10% in dollars; and finally, in China, we continue to generate very strong growth with the continuation of significant double-digit comps.
We're also very pleased to announce the acquisition of our domestic retail business in Taiwan, which is expected to occur in early January. During the quarter, we opened 2 North American retail stores, including one in the new market for Coach, Winnipeg in Canada and the men's mall store in Garden State Plaza in New Jersey. Two retail stores were also closed. In addition, we opened 9 factory stores, including 8 men's stand-alone factory stores. At the end of the period, there were 345 full-priced and 152 factory stores in operation in North America.
Moving on to China, during the quarter, we opened 5 net new locations, 4 in the mainland, one in Macau, bringing the total to 71 locations. In Singapore, as planned, we took control of our retail businesses this quarter and opened 1 new store as well. We now have 6 company-operated locations in that country.
And in Japan, 3 locations were added during the quarter, all of them dedicated men's shops, while one retail location was closed. At quarter end, of the 178 total locations in Japan with 20 stand-alone full-priced stores, including 8 flagships, 119 shop-in-shops, 32 factory stores and 7 distributor-operated locations.
Indirect sales, which were context represent about 13% of Coach's sales on an annualized basis increased 4% to $140 million from $134 million in the same period last year on a comparable basis. At POS, U.S. department store sales rose slightly on a year-over-year basis in the quarter. At the same time, international retail sales rose at a double-digit pace, driven primarily by distribution growth. It should be noted that the international traveler all represents a meaningful growth opportunity as Coach's global awareness and presence increases.
Moving on, we estimate that the addressable women's U.S. handbag and accessories category rose about 5% to 10% last quarter. At the same time, in our own North American stores and on the Internet, Coach's handbag and accessory sales rose 12%. It's worth noting that our men's business with a significant driver of our overall all sales growth in Q1. Our North American performance is also benefiting from our rising global awareness, which is visible by the sharp increase in select stores in travel markets around the country, including Hawaii, Las Vegas, Florida and, of course, New York. In these locations, Coach has become a key shopping destination. 
Our total revenues in North America rose 13% for the quarter with our directly operated stores up 15% as distribution growth augmented comp. As noted, total Q1 same-store sales rose 9.2%, fueling the strong overall comp with similarly strong gains in both channels, driven by significant increases in conversion from prior year while tickets rose as well and store traffic declined.
It's important to note, however, that we continue to experience significant gains in traffic and sales on the Internet. Looking at online traffic in combination with store traffic, it's more representative of our consumers' shopping behaviors in this growing digitally enabled environment, notably for the full-priced channel. In aggregating this metric, traffic into our retail channel actually rose, with increases on coach.com, more than offsetting the modest declines in store. This is consistent with our increased emphasis on digital, both through our own website and social media.
In Japan, we posted a 1% increase in constant currency and a 10% increase in dollars as mentioned. Coach now holds the #2 place within the Japanese imported accessories market, with a 17% yen share. Our position reflects the strength and relevance of the Coach brand, and the Japanese consumer will become increasingly value oriented. 
As we discussed many times outside of North America, China is clearly our largest geographic growth opportunity, given the size of the market and the rate of growth. During the quarter, our sales rose sharply from prior year fueled by distribution and significant double-digit same-store sales. Clearly, the Chinese consumer has embraced Coach as evidenced by the extremely high repurchase intent among existing customers.
While Jane will get into more detail on our financials and I will discuss our outlook in some detail shortly, I wanted to give you this recap. As you know, mike Tucci has joined us today to discuss our product performance for Q1 and our holiday sales initiative. Mike?"

During the first quarter, as always, we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness, driving higher conversion levels and improved productivity. In addition to our relaunch of an evolved collection in July with updated styles, patterns and prints, we launched the new Chelsea collection featuring a modern faceted turn lock inspired by heritage and offered in timeless silhouettes. In August, we offered new fall fabrications colors and patterns in Madison and a new shareholder bag style in Chelsea. During September, we focused on Kirsten with several new totes and styles. Clearly, our balanced and more refined handbag assortment continues to drive sustainable growth in North America.
Handbags once again posted strong comps in the quarter, the penetration rising to 58%, the low single-digit increase and average unit retail. To open the second quarter, we brought in Madison, our core holiday collection, completely updated and featuring several new silhouettes. Lindsay, a new style and feature of our holiday ad campaign was an immediate hit with consumers. Abigail is also a new fashion silhouette and key item. Both are available in the range of fabrications including gathered leather and price from a $358 up to $898 for limited-editions.
Also new to Madison are the mini-Sophia, the smaller version of this foundational style, the flat carryall and the Caroline satchel. With this being the most fully developed the Madison offering, we are seeing the highest penetration level for the collection ever, eclipsing its entirely successful launch 3 years ago.
For November, we're excited about Poppy, offered the new style including 2 totes, holdover cross body silhouette, and a satchel. With gloss, lightweight fabrics will bring additional excitement and color to the collection. We'll also be adding some newness to Chelsea only into introduced this fall with features chain detail with compelling price point. Right before Thanksgiving, we'll refresh the assortment with updates to Madison and Kirsten along with a new drawstring tote in Chelsea giving her additional reasons to revisit and repurchase during the key holiday season. Of course, we'll also have a comprehensive assortment of great gifts, tag covers in a wide range of items under $100 as well.
In addition, our holiday product will be supported by a comprehensive marketing plan, beginning in mid-November featuring a powerful gifting message. The emphasis of our marketing will be product and item-driven across our core categories and other gifting ideas. Our campaign will span coach.com social and rich media advertising and compelling print and in-store marketing to drive traffic. We'll also be adding digital media to select high-profile store windows as the new element of our in-store marketing.
We also like to take this opportunity to provide an update on our digital strategy and the benefits that we're seeing from it. As mentioned in previous calls, coach.com is our most important marketing tool. Our primary objective online in North America is to build top-of-mind brand awareness while maximizing e-commerce opportunity. In fact, within North America, coach.com is our fastest-growing retail store with double-digit sales growth. Additionally, we're especially pleased with the early results of our mobile commerce sites with over 15% of coach.com's total site traffic coming from a mobile device. Our digital presence expands far beyond our own website. We continue to evolve our engagement with our customers in a very relevant and authentic way through social media, with Facebook being the most important platform where Coach enthusiasts actively participate in our brand. 
Also in the U.S., we recently launched our factory sales site. Offered by invitation-only to our factory loyal consumers, this highly profitable 48-hour private sale event complement our store strategy and give our customers another way with that channel. While this is a snapshot of our North American retail digital initiatives, our web presence is global. We also have an e-commerce site in Japan and informational site in 16 important countries. We'll continue to use our digital capability to build awareness and as a customer touch point as we expand the Coach brand globally.
Moving to our stores, Lew already mentioned our store openings in North America this quarter. As you heard, our new distribution is primarily focused on growing our men's business, 9 of the aggregate 11 stores opened in Q1 dedicated men's location. While we're only one-year into our focus on the men's initiative, we've been extremely pleased with our results as our business doubled on a global basis last year. In North America, we see men's as both a comp driver in existing stores and a substantial new distribution opportunity. Similar to the way we view the brand's potential in the women's category and in late 1990s, we believe that Coach can be the authority in men's bags and accessories in the years ahead. As we created the world of Coach for women across categories, we're now doing the same for men, my designing collections with a distinct point of view, sharing the modern classic aesthetic that is hallmark of Coach. Clearly, the male shopper is engaging with the brand in increasing numbers.
In summary, we're excited with the continued progress we've made in improving our full-priced productivity and our growing men's business. We're feeling great about the holiday season given the current sales trends in both our full-priced and factory channel. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Lew for a discussion of our strategy and further opportunities for growth."

Mike just discussed a number of our productivity initiatives, including men's, which we're confident will be a significant contributor to top line sales in the seasons and years ahead, both in North America and international market. 
I would like to now focus on distribution growth.  As mentioned in August, we expect that our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 12% this year compared to 9% in FY '11. Starting in North America, we will open about 40 new stores this year, including about 15 full-priced and 25 factory outlets, with more than 1/2 and each channel being dedicated men's locations. In total, we expect North American square footage growth for about 7% this year, in line with last year, but, primarily driven by men's.
Turning to China, this year, we're accelerating new store openings with about 30 locations planned or an additional 25 for the balance of the fiscal year, with the vast majority on the mainland. Virtually all of these openings will be dual-gender stores adjourned to the size of the men's opportunity. Given the continued strength we're experiencing in China, we are now projecting sales of at least $300 million for FY '12, the top end of the range we articulated in August.
As previously mentioned, we are making significant investments towards increasing awareness in China as we leverage our 70th anniversary campaign to build on our positioning as a New York fashion brand grounded in heritage and history. This integrated campaign has several key elements, including an international brand ambassador, Gwyneth Paltrow who has proven relevancy in China and other international markets. In November, she'll be traveling to China with us, participating in several key press events.
In Japan, spending has stabilized from the post-earthquake and tsunami period. Our focus continues to be on gaining market share. During FY '12, we expect to open about 15 net new locations in Japan, nearly all of them dedicated men's stores. In total, we anticipate that net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 10% of this year compared to 3% in FY '11.
Consistent with our strategy of directly operating select Asian markets, in as I mentioned briefly, we are pleased to announce that we've reached an agreement to take control of our domestic retail business in Taiwan, which has 24 locations and generates about $50 million of sales at retail. This transition is expected to occur in early January. And as previously announced, our Malaysia distribution will be acquired next July.
It's important to note that these acquisitions will allow us to leverage the investments we've already made in the region, utilizing the infrastructure created over the last few years, including our Asia, JF services center and the Asia distribution center. Outside of our directly operated markets, we do have driving distributor-run businesses in other countries. During FY '12, we expect to open about 35 net new international wholesale locations, expanding to new markets, including Brazil and Vietnam as noted on our last earnings call.
Touching on Europe, during Q1, we added one location within France, 2 in Ireland and one in Spain. Of course, we're excited about our new Bond Street flagship, which opened last month. Our international brand ambassador, Gwyneth Paltrow, cohosted a number of events heralding our opening, which helped raise brand awareness. During the balance of FY '12, we expect to open about 8 additional locations in Europe.
In closing, as most of you know, we have 3 overarching growth strategies: build first, building our women's business in the growing North America market; second, leveraging the global opportunity; and third, tapping into the large and growing men's category. Taken together, we are confident that they will drive our business at a double-digit pace during our planning horizon.
At this time, I would like to introduce to you Jane Nielsen, our new CFO, for further detail on our financials. Jane?"

Lew and Mike have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let may now take you through some of the important financial detail of our first quarter results. 
As mentioned, our quarterly revenues increased 15%, with direct-to-consumer up 17% and indirect up 4%. Net income for the quarter totaled $215 million, up 14% with earnings per diluted share of $0.73, up 16%. This compared to net income of $189 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.63 in the prior year's first quarter. Our operating income totaled $322 million, 13% above the $286 million reported last year. While operating margin was 30.7% versus 31.3%. We were extremely pleased with this level of growth and at the high level of profitability.
During this quarter, gross profit totaled $765 million versus $676 million a year ago, an increase of 13%. As expected, gross margin rate was 72.8%, a sequential improvement from the 71.8% reported in Q4 '11. This compared to 74.2% a year ago, reflecting the impact of higher sourcing cost this year.
Our expense ratio in Q1 totaled 42.1% compared to 42.8% reported in the year ago quarter. We were able to gain 70 basis points of leverage in the quarter as our primary direct businesses here in North America and in Japan provided leverage to the corporate P&L, more than offsetting the impact of our investment spending. We believe we're striking the right balance between driving future growth opportunities and operating efficiencies.
Inventory levels at the end of the quarter were $520 million, 13% above the $459 million reported at the end of last year's Q1. This inventory level allows us to support 24 net new North American stores, 8 net new locations at Coach Japan, 22 additional Coach China store, the 6 stores from our acquisition in Singapore and our men's initiative. Further, it will support strong underlying business trends, enabling us to maximize sales this holiday. Cash and short-term investments stood at $848 million as compared with $712 million a year ago. During the first quarter, we repurchased and retired nearly 1.1 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $55.30, spending a total of $59 million. This brought our trailing 12-month repurchase total to nearly 18 million shares, equaling about $1 billion.
At the end of the quarter, approximately $900 million remained under our company's present repurchase authorization. Net cash from operating activities in the first quarter was $225 million compared to $177 million last year during Q1. Free cash flow in the first quarter was an inflow of $194 million versus $154 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending was $31 million versus $23 million in the same quarter a year ago.
Consistent with our previous expectations, and reflective our global growth initiatives, CapEx for the year will be the area of $200 million, driven primarily by the opening of new stores across all geographies and investments in technology necessary to enable our expansion. We were very pleased we once again reported strong financial results, and as Lew and Mike said, we're well positioned for the holiday quarter and the rest of the year. To elaborate, first, we expect to achieve double-digit sales with earnings per share growth ahead of the top line. Our sales will be driven in part by at least mid-single-digit comp store sales growth in North America for the balance of the year; second, as we said before, we still expect our gross margin to improve sequentially in the first half of the year versus the second half of FY '11, though our gross margin will still contract in the first half on a year-over-year basis. However, the second half is expected to improve over last year as we anniversary increased sourcing costs. On balance, we anticipate the gross margin will remain in the 72% to 73% range for the year.
Third, on SG&A, we expect our developed businesses to continue to deliver leverage while we will also continue to invest global growth for the future. Fourth, we are committed to delivering an operating margin similar to what we've generated over the past 2 years. And fifth, our tax rate is likely to be in the area of 33% for the remainder of the year.
In summary, our first quarter results demonstrate our ability to manage our business nimbly while investing prudently in longer-term opportunities. We have accelerated our distribution plant to leverage the emerging market opportunity, with a particular focus on China while also exploring new geographies, capitalizing on the increased popularity and recognition of the Coach brand with discerning consumers globally. We are also optimizing the brand's potential in men, leveraging our long heritage in equity in this category. And with the business model that generates significant cash flow and with virtually no debt, we are positioned to take full advantage of profitable growth opportunities globally while continuing to return capital to our shareholders.
I'd now like to open it up to Q&A."

I guess what I found at Coach is a lot what you see in our Q1 earnings, great, just incredible passion for the business. It's an incredibly knowledge-driven management team that's both numerous and really knows the business. As CFO, I really appreciate the disciplined and rigorous processes that really support all the decision-making but really retains the sense of flexibility to respond to the market. And I guess what I appreciate most is the passion that everybody approaches the business with and everyone has for the brand. As CFO, I clearly think that finance can contribute in 4 important ways. I love the finance and to be viewed as a business partner. That really takes I great ideas and makes them great businesses. Really be a model of stewardship and at least by example and to really be a driver of well-controlled organization that's committed to delivering results the right way."

We are seeing the opportunity in full price to add men's presence in our best locations in the United States. And that's either going to occur with an expansion within our most productive stores or malls or taking existing real estate in those most highly productive stores and dedicating more space to men's as we've done, for example, in our Madison Avenue store at 57th Street, at 342 Madison store and others throughout the country. The approach in men's will be top-down. We're going to go from our most productive locations, most highly productive, highly traffic, most premium locations in North America and attack those first. And that is really what we're working on. A format that we're most excited about it we need to get built out is what we're calling a side-by-side format where, for example, in Pentagon Mall in Washington this spring, we'll take our existing store, which is a women's-only store relocate it to a larger format with a side-by-side men's, women's location in about 3,700 square feet, bringing men's to the lease line and creating a dual-gender view to get a customer. We believe that, on the full-priced side, is an enormous growth opportunity for us. In factory, we are seeing incredible response to our men's. And there, we have 2 formats. One is a separate men's store in the neighborhood of our women store or again, combining our men's and women's presence under one roof side-by-side. And we see both of those opportunities is viable, and I think long term going deep into our fleet in terms of penetration. Our men's productivity is significant. It's very comparable to women's a very high margins and very high returns."

I'd now like to introduce Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO."

As noted in our press release, we posted another strong quarter, reflecting the global resonance of our brand proposition with both women and men, based on innovation, relevance and value, as wel",994,"Good morning, and thank you, Andrea. And welcome, everyone. As noted in our press release, we posted another strong quarter, reflecting the global resonance of our brand proposition with both women and men, based on innovation, relevance and value, as well as the vitality of the category in all markets as our customers look to update their wardrobes through our fashion right, leather goods and lifestyle accessories.
In North America, we are continuing to grow our share of an expanding market, while in developing geographies, we are leveraging the inherent opportunity, investing in distribution and marketing initiatives. Beyond the top line, we are also very pleased with our high levels of profitability and substantial cash generation in Q1. Looking forward, and given the strength of our product pipeline, breadth of our assortment and shoppers' strong interest in accessories, gifts and self-purchase, Coach is clearly well positioned for another excellent holiday season.
While I will get into further detail about current condition and the outlook of business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first. Some highlights were: first, net sales totaled $1.05 billion versus $912 million a year ago, an increase of 15%; second, earnings per share totaled $0.73, up 16% from prior year; third, direct-to-consumer sales, which now include our Singapore business rose 17% to $910 million from $777 million in the prior year on a comparable basis; fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter rose 9.2% from prior year, while total store sales rose 15%; fifth, sales in Japan rose 1% on a constant currency basis and 10% in dollars; and finally, in China, we continue to generate very strong growth with the continuation of significant double-digit comps.
We're also very pleased to announce the acquisition of our domestic retail business in Taiwan, which is expected to occur in early January. During the quarter, we opened 2 North American retail stores, including one in the new market for Coach, Winnipeg in Canada, and the men's mall store in Garden State Plaza in New Jersey. Two retail stores were also closed. In addition, we opened 9 factory stores, including 8 men's stand-alone factory stores. At the end of the period, there were 345 full-priced and 152 factory stores in operation in North America.
Moving on to China. During the quarter, we opened 5 net new locations, 4 in the mainland, one in Macau, bringing the total to 71 locations. 
In Singapore, as planned, we took control of our retail businesses this quarter and opened one new store as well. We now have 6 company-operated locations in that country.
And in Japan, 3 locations were added during the quarter, all of them dedicated men's shops, while one retail location was closed. At quarter end, of 178 total locations in Japan with 20 stand-alone full-priced stores, including 8 flagships, 119 shop-in-shops, 32 factory stores and 7 distributor-operated locations.
Indirect sales, which in context represent about 13% of Coach's sales on an annualized basis, increased 4% to $140 million from $134 million in the same period last year on a comparable basis. At POS, U.S. department store sales rose slightly on a year-over-year basis in the quarter. At the same time, international retail sales rose at a double-digit pace, driven primarily by distribution growth. It should be noted that the international traveler represents a meaningful growth opportunity as Coach's global awareness and presence increases.
Moving on. We estimate that the addressable women's U.S. handbag and accessory category rose about 5% to 10% last quarter. At the same time, in our own North American stores and on the Internet, Coach's handbag and accessory sales rose 12%. It's worth noting that our men's business was a significant driver of our overall all sales growth in Q1. Our North American performance is also benefiting from our rising global awareness, which is visible by the sharp increase of tourists in select stores in travel markets around the country, including Hawaii, Las Vegas, Florida, and of course, New York. In these locations, Coach has become a key shopping destination. 
Our total revenues in North America rose 13% for the quarter with our directly operated stores up 15% as distribution growth augmented comp. As noted, total Q1 same-store sales rose 9.2%, fueling the strong overall comp with similarly strong gains in both channels, driven by significant increases in conversion from prior year, while tickets rose as well and store traffic declined.
It's important to note, however, that we continue to experience significant gains in traffic and sales on the Internet. Looking at online traffic in combination with store traffic, it's more representative of our consumers' shopping behaviors in this growing digitally enabled environment, notably for the full-priced channel. In aggregating this metric, traffic into our retail channel actually rose with increases on coach.com more than offsetting the modest declines in store. This is consistent with our increased emphasis on digital, both through our own website and social media.
In Japan, we posted a 1% increase in constant currency and a 10% increase in dollars, as mentioned. Coach now holds the #2 place within the Japanese imported accessories market with a 17% yen share. Our position reflects the strength and relevance of the Coach brand, and the Japanese consumer will become increasingly value oriented. 
As we've discussed many times outside of North America, China is clearly our largest geographic growth opportunity given the size of the market and the rate of growth. During the quarter, our sales rose sharply from prior year, fueled by distribution and significant double-digit same-store sales. Clearly, the Chinese consumer has embraced Coach, as evidenced by the extremely high repurchase intent among existing customers.
While Jane will get into more detail on our financials and I will discuss our outlook in some detail shortly, I wanted to give you this recap. As you know, Mike Tucci has joined us today to discuss our product performance for Q1 and our holiday sales initiative. Mike?"

During the first quarter, as always, we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness, driving higher conversion levels and improved productivity. In addition to our relaunch of an evolved Poppy collection in July with",919,"Thanks, Lew. During the first quarter, as always, we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness, driving higher conversion levels and improved productivity. In addition to our relaunch of an evolved Poppy collection in July with updated styles, patterns and prints, we launched the new Chelsea collection featuring a modern, faceted turnlock inspired by our heritage and offered in timeless silhouettes. In August, we offered new fall fabrications, colors and patterns in Madison and a new shareholder bag style in Chelsea. During September, we focused on Kristin with several new totes and satchel styles. Clearly, our balanced and more refined handbag assortment continues to drive sustainable growth in North America.
Handbags once again posted strong comps in the quarter, the penetration rising to 58%, the low single-digit increase and average unit retail. To open the second quarter, we brought in Madison, our core holiday collection, completely updated and featuring several new silhouettes. Lindsey, a new style and feature of our holiday ad campaign, was an immediate hit with consumers. Abigail is also a new fashion silhouette and key item. Both are available in the range of fabrications, including gathered leather, and price from a $358 up to $898 for limited edition.
Also new to Madison are the Mini Sophia, the smaller version of this foundational style, the flat carryall and the Caroline Dowel satchel. With this being the most fully developed the Madison offering, we are seeing the highest penetration level for the collection ever, eclipsing its highly successful launch 3 years ago.
For November, we're excited about Poppy, offered in new styles including 2 totes, a foldover crossbody silhouette, a hippie and a satchel. With the gloss or soft patent lightweight fabric, we'll bring additional excitement and color to the collection. We'll also be adding some newness to Chelsea. Only into introduced this fall was a tote that features chain detail with compelling price point. Right before Thanksgiving, we'll refresh the assortment with updates to Madison and Kirsten, along with a new drawstring tote in Chelsea, giving her additional reasons to revisit and repurchase during the key holiday season. Of course, we'll also have a comprehensive assortment of great gifts, from tag covers to wrist list and a wide range of items under $100 as well.
In addition, our holiday product will be supported by a comprehensive marketing plan beginning in mid-November featuring a powerful gifting message. The emphasis of our marketing will be product and item-driven across our core categories and other gifting ideas. Our campaign will span coach.com, social and rich media advertising and compelling print and in-store marketing to drive traffic. We'll also be adding digital media to select high-profile store windows as the new element of our in-store marketing.
I'd also like to take this opportunity to provide an update on our digital strategy and the benefits that we're seeing from it. As mentioned in previous calls, coach.com is our most important marketing tool. Our primary objective online in North America is to build top-of-mind brand awareness while maximizing e-commerce opportunity. In fact, within North America, coach.com is our fastest-growing retail store with double-digit sales growth. 
Additionally, we're especially pleased with the early results of our mobile commerce site with over 15% of coach.com's total site traffic coming from a mobile device. Our digital presence expands far beyond our own website. We continue to evolve our engagement with our customers in a very relevant and authentic way through social media, with Facebook being the most important platform where Coach enthusiasts actively participate in our brand. 
Also in the U.S., we recently launched our factory flash sale site. Offered by invitation-only to our factory loyal consumers, this highly-profitable 48-hour private sale events complement our store strategy and give our customers another way to engage with that channel. While this is a snapshot of our North American retail digital initiatives, our web presence is global. We also have an e-commerce site in Japan and informational site in 16 important countries. We'll continue to use our digital capability to build awareness and as a customer touchpoint as we expand the Coach brand globally.
Moving to our stores. Lew already mentioned our store openings in North America this quarter. As you heard, our new distribution is primarily focused on growing our men's business, with 9 of the aggregate 11 stores opened in Q1 dedicated men's location. While we're only 1-year into our focus on the men's initiative, we've been extremely pleased with our results as our business doubled on a global basis last year. In North America, we see men's as both a comp driver in existing stores and a substantial new distribution opportunity.
 Similar to the way we view the brand's potential in the women's category in the late 1990s, we believe that Coach can be the authority in men's bags and accessories in the years ahead. As we created the world of Coach for women across categories, we're now doing the same for men, designing collections with a distinct point of view, sharing the modern, classic aesthetic that is a hallmark of Coach. Clearly, the male shopper is engaging with the brand in increasing numbers.
In summary, we're excited with the continued progress we've made in improving our full-priced productivity and our growing men's business. We're feeling great about the holiday season given the current sales trends in both our full-priced and factory channel. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Lew for a discussion of our strategy and further opportunities for growth."
526573,141790658,177127,"Coach, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2011",2011-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike.

I w",657,"Thanks, Mike. Mike just discussed a number of our productivity initiatives, including men's, which we're confident will be a significant contributor to top line sales in the seasons and years ahead, both in North America and in international market. 
I would like to now focus on distribution growth.  As mentioned in August, we expect that our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 12% this year compared to 9% in FY '11. Starting in North America, we will open about 40 new stores this year, including about 15 full-priced and 25 factory outlets with more than 1/2 and each channel being dedicated men's locations. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 7% this year, in line with last year but primarily driven by men's.
Turning to China. This year, we're accelerating new store openings with about 30 locations planned or an additional 25 for the balance of the fiscal year, with the vast majority on the mainland. Virtually, all of these openings will be dual-gender stores due to the size of the men's opportunity. Given the continued strength we're experiencing in China, we are now projecting sales of at least $300 million for FY '12, the top end of the range we articulated in August.
As previously mentioned, we are making significant investments towards increasing awareness in China as we leverage our 70th anniversary campaign to build on our positioning as a New York fashion brand grounded in heritage and history. This integrated campaign has several key elements, including an international brand ambassador, Gwyneth Paltrow, who has proven relevancy in China and other international markets. In November, she'll be traveling to China with us and participating in several key press events.
In Japan, spending has stabilized from the post-earthquake and tsunami period. Our focus continues to be on gaining market share. During FY '12, we expect to open about 15 net new locations in Japan, nearly all of them dedicated men's stores. In total, we anticipate that net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 10% this year compared to 3% in FY '11.
Consistent with our strategy of directly operating select Asian markets, and as I mentioned briefly, we are pleased to announce that we've reached an agreement to take control of our domestic retail business in Taiwan, which has 24 locations and generates about $50 million of sales at retail. This transition is expected to occur in early January. And as previously announced, our Malaysia distribution will be acquired next July.
It's important to note that these acquisitions will allow us to leverage the investments we've already made in the region, utilizing the infrastructure created over the last few years, including our Asia shared services center and the Asia distribution center. Outside of our directly operated markets, we do have thriving distributor-run businesses in other countries. During FY '12, we expect to open about 35 net new international wholesale locations, expanding to new markets, including Brazil and Vietnam, as noted on our last earnings call.
Touching on Europe. During Q1, we added one location within Printemps in France, 2 in Ireland and one in Spain. Of course, we're excited about our new Bond Street flagship, which opened last month. Our international brand ambassador, Gwyneth Paltrow, cohosted a number of events heralding our opening, which helped raise brand awareness. During the balance of FY '12, we expect to open about 8 additional locations in Europe.
In closing, as most of you know, we have 3 over-arching growth strategies: build -- first, building our women's business in the growing North America market; second, leveraging the global opportunity; and third, tapping into the large and growing men's category. Taken together, we are confident that they will drive our business at a double-digit pace during our planning horizon.
At this time, I would like to introduce to you Jane Nielsen, our new CFO, for further detail on our financials. Jane?"
526573,141790658,177127,"Coach, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2011",2011-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Lew.

Lew and Mike have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let may now take you through some of the important financial detail of our first quarter results. 
As mentioned, our quarterly revenues increased 15% with direct-to-consumer up 17% and indirect up 4%. Net income for the quarter totaled $215 million, up 14%, with earnings per diluted share of $0.73, up 16%. This compared to net income of $189 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.63 in the prior year's first quarter. Our operating income totaled $322 million, 13% above the $286 million reported last year, while operating margin was 30.7% versus 31.3%. We were extremely pleased with this level of growth and at the high level of profitability.
During this quarter, gross profit totaled $765 million versus $676 million a year ago, an increase of 13%. As expected, gross margin rate was 72.8%, a sequential improvement from the 71.8% reported in Q4 '11. This compared to 74.2% a year ago, reflecting the impact of higher sourcing cost this year.
Our expense ratio in Q1 totaled 42.1% compared to 42.8% reported in the year-ago quarter. We were able to gain 70 basis points of leverage in the quarter as our primary direct businesses here in North America and in Japan provided leverage to the corporate P&L, more than offsetting the impact of our investment spending. We believe we're striking the right balance between driving future growth opportunities and operating efficiencies.
Inventory levels at the end of the quarter were $520 million, 13% above the $459 million reported at the end of last year's Q1. This inventory level allows us to support 24 net new North American stores, 8 net new locations at Coach Japan, 22 additional Coach China stores, the 6 stores from our acquisition in Singapore and our men's initiative. Further, it will support strong underlying business trends, enabling us to maximize sales this holiday. 
Cash and short-term investments stood at $848 million as compared with $712 million a year ago. During the first quarter, we repurchased and retired nearly 1.1 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $55.30, spending a total of $59 million. This brought our trailing 12-month repurchase total to nearly 18 million shares, equaling about $1 billion.
At the end of the quarter, approximately $900 million remained under our company's present repurchase authorization. Net cash from operating activities in the first quarter was $225 million compared to $177 million last year during Q1. Free cash flow in the first quarter was an inflow of $194 million versus $154 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending was $31 million versus $23 million in the same quarter a year ago.
Consistent with our previous expectations and reflective our global growth initiatives, CapEx for the year will be in the area of $200 million, driven primarily by the opening of new stores across all geographies and investments in technology necessary to enable our expansion. We were very pleased we once again reported a strong financial results, and as Lew and Mike said, we're well positioned for the holiday quarter and the rest of the year. 
To elaborate, first, we expect to achieve double-digit sales with earnings per share growth ahead of the top line. Our sales will be driven in part by at least mid-single-digit comp store sales growth in North America for the balance of the year. Second, as we said before, we still expect our gross margin to improve sequentially in the first half of the year versus the second half of FY '11, though our gross margin will still contract in the first half on a year-over-year basis. However, the second half is expected to improve over last year as we anniversary increased sourcing costs. On balance, we anticipate the gross margin will remain in the 72% to 73% range for the year. Third, on SG&A, we expect our developed businesses to continue to deliver leverage while we will also continue to invest in global growth for the future. Fourth, we are committed to delivering an operating margin similar to what we've generated over the past 2 years. And fifth, our tax rate is likely to be in the area of 33% for the remainder of the year.
In summary, our first quarter results demonstrate our ability to manage our business nimbly while investing prudently in longer-term opportunities. We have accelerated our distribution plant to leverage the emerging market opportunity with a particular focus on China while also exploring new geographies, capitalizing on the increased popularity and recognition of the Coach brand with discerning consumers globally. We are also optimizing the brand's potential in men, leveraging our long heritage in equity in this category. And with the business model that generates significant cash flow and with virtually no debt, we are positioned to take full advantage of profitable growth opportunities globally while continuing to return capital to our shareholders.
I'd now like to open it up to Q&A."

We are seeing the opportunity in full price to add men's presence in our best locations in the United States. And that's either going to occur with an expansion within our most productive stores or malls or taking existing real estate in those most highly productive stores and dedicating more space to men's, as we've done, for example, in our Madison Avenue store at 57th Street, at 342 Madison store and others throughout the country. The approach in men's will be top-down. We're going to go from our most productive locations, most highly productive, highly traffic, most premium locations in North America and attack those first. And that is really what we're working on. A format that we're most excited about that we need to get built out is what we're calling a side-by-side format where, for example, in Pentagon Mall in Washington this spring, we'll take our existing store, which is a women's-only store, relocate it to a larger format with a side-by-side men's, women's location in about 3,700 square feet, bringing men's to the lease line and creating a dual-gender view to the customer. We believe that, that, on the full-priced side, is an enormous growth opportunity for us. In factory, we are seeing incredible response to our men's. And there, we have 2 formats: one is a separate men's store in the neighborhood of our women store; or again, combining our men's and women's presence under one roof side by side. And we see both of those opportunities as viable and I think, long term, going deep into our fleet in terms of penetration. Our men's productivity is significant.

And welcome, everyone. As noted in our press release, we posted another strong quarter, reflecting the global resonance of our brand proposition with both women and men, based on innovation, relevance and value, as well as the vitality of the category in all markets as our customers look to update their wardrobes through our fashion right, leather goods and lifestyle accessories.
In North America, we are continuing to grow our share of an expanding market, while in developing geographies, we are leveraging the inherent opportunity, investing in distribution and marketing initiatives. Beyond the top line, we are also very pleased with our high levels of profitability and substantial cash generation in Q1. Looking forward, and given the strength of our product pipeline, breadth of our assortment and shoppers' strong interest in accessories, gifts and self-purchase, Coach is clearly well positioned for another excellent holiday season.
While I will get into further detail of our current condition and the outlook of business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first. Some highlights were: first, net sales totaled $1.05 billion versus $912 million a year ago, an increase of 15%; second, earnings per share totaled $0.73, up 16% from prior year; third, direct-to-consumer sales, which now include our Singapore business rose 17% to $910 million from $777 million in the prior year on a comparable basis; fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter rose 9.2% from prior year, while total store sales rose 15%; fifth, sales in Japan rose 1% on a constant currency basis and 10% in dollars; and finally, in China, we continue to generate very strong growth with the continuation of significant double-digit comps.
We're also very pleased to announce the acquisition of our domestic retail business in Taiwan, which is expected to occur in early January. During the quarter, we opened 2 North American retail stores, including one in the new market for Coach, Winnipeg in Canada, and the men's mall store in Garden State Plaza in New Jersey. Two retail stores were also closed. In addition, we opened 9 factory stores, including 8 men's stand-alone factory stores. At the end of the period, there were 345 full-priced and 152 factory stores in operation in North America.
Moving on to China. During the quarter, we opened 5 net new locations, 4 in the mainland, one in Macau, bringing the total to 71 locations. 
In Singapore, as planned, we took control of our retail businesses this quarter and opened one new store as well. We now have 6 company-operated locations in that country.
And in Japan, 3 locations were added during the quarter, all of them dedicated men's shops, while one retail location was closed. At quarter end, of 178 total locations in Japan with 20 stand-alone full-priced stores, including 8 flagships, 119 shop-in-shops, 32 factory stores and 7 distributor-operated locations.
Indirect sales, which for context represent about 13% of Coach's sales on an annualized basis, increased 4% to $140 million from $134 million in the same period last year on a comparable basis. At POS, U.S. department store sales rose slightly on a year-over-year basis in the quarter. At the same time, international retail sales rose at a double-digit pace, driven primarily by distribution growth. It should be noted that the international traveler represents a meaningful growth opportunity as Coach's global awareness and presence increases.
Moving on. We estimate that the addressable women's U.S. handbag and accessory category rose about 5% to 10% last quarter. At the same time, in our own North American stores and on the Internet, Coach's handbag and accessory sales rose 12%. It's worth noting that our men's business was a significant driver of our overall all sales growth in Q1. Our North American performance is also benefiting from our rising global awareness, which is visible by the sharp increase of tourists in select stores in travel markets around the country, including Hawaii, Las Vegas, Florida, and of course, New York. In these locations, Coach has become a key shopping destination. 
Our total revenues in North America rose 13% for the quarter with our directly operated stores up 15% as distribution growth augmented comp. As noted, total Q1 same-store sales rose 9.2%, fueling the strong overall comp with similarly strong gains in both channels, driven by significant increases in conversion from prior year, while tickets rose as well and store traffic declined.
It's important to note, however, that we continue to experience significant gains in traffic and sales on the Internet. Looking at online traffic in combination with store traffic, it's more representative of our consumers' shopping behaviors in this growing digitally enabled environment, notably for the full-priced channel. In aggregating this metric, traffic into our retail channel actually rose with increases on coach.com more than offsetting the modest declines in store. This is consistent with our increased emphasis on digital, both through our own website and social media.
In Japan, we posted a 1% increase in constant currency and a 10% increase in dollars, as mentioned. Coach now holds the #2 place within the Japanese imported accessories market with a 17% yen share. Our position reflects the strength and relevance of the Coach brand, as the Japanese consumer will become increasingly value oriented. 
As we've discussed many times outside of North America, China is clearly our largest geographic growth opportunity given the size of the market and the rate of growth. During the quarter, our sales rose sharply from prior year, fueled by distribution and significant double-digit same-store sales. Clearly, the Chinese consumer has embraced Coach, as evidenced by the extremely high repurchase intent among existing customers.
While Jane will get into more detail on our financials and I will discuss our outlook in some detail shortly, I wanted to give you this recap. As you know, Mike Tucci has joined us today to discuss our product performance for Q1 and our holiday sales initiatives. Mike?"

During the first quarter, as always, we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness, driving higher conversion levels and improved productivity.

During the first quarter, as always, we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness, driving higher conversion levels and improved productivity. In addition to our relaunch of an evolved Poppy collection in July with updated styles, patterns and prints, we launched the new Chelsea collection featuring a modern, faceted turnlock inspired by our heritage and offered in timeless silhouettes. In August, we offered new fall fabrications, colors and patterns in Madison and a new shoulderbag style in Chelsea. During September, we focused on Kristin with several new totes and satchel styles. Clearly, our balanced and more refined handbag assortment continues to drive sustainable growth in North America.
Handbags once again posted strong comps in the quarter, the penetration rising to 58%, the low single-digit increase and average unit retail. To open the second quarter, we brought in Madison, our core holiday collection, completely updated and featuring several new silhouettes. Lindsey, a new style and feature of our holiday ad campaign, was an immediate hit with consumers. Abigail is also a new fashion silhouette and key item. Both are available in the range of fabrications, including gathered leather, and price from a $358 up to $898 for limited edition.
Also new to Madison are the Mini Sophia, the smaller version of this foundational style, the flat carryall and the Caroline Dowel satchel. With this being the most fully developed the Madison offering, we are seeing the highest penetration level for the collection ever, eclipsing its highly successful launch 3 years ago.
For November, we're excited about Poppy, offered in new styles including 2 totes, a foldover crossbody silhouette, a hippie and a satchel. Liquid gloss or soft patent lightweight fabric, we'll bring additional excitement and color to the collection. We'll also be adding some newness to Chelsea. Only introduced this fall was a tote that features chain detail at compelling price points. Right before Thanksgiving, we'll refresh the assortment with updates to Madison and Kirsten, along with a new drawstring tote in Chelsea, giving her additional reasons to revisit and repurchase during the key holiday season. Of course, we'll also have a comprehensive assortment of great gifts, from ipad covers to wrist list and a wide range of items under $100 as well.
In addition, our holiday product will be supported by a comprehensive marketing plan beginning in mid-November featuring a powerful gifting message. The emphasis of our marketing will be product and item-driven across our core categories and other gifting ideas. Our campaign will span coach.com, social and rich media advertising and compelling print and in-store marketing to drive traffic. We'll also be adding digital media to select high-profile store windows as the new element of our in-store marketing.
I'd also like to take this opportunity to provide an update on our digital strategy and the benefits that we're seeing from it. As mentioned in previous calls, coach.com is our most important marketing tool. Our primary objective online in North America is to build top-of-mind brand awareness while maximizing e-commerce opportunity. In fact, within North America, coach.com is our fastest-growing retail store with double-digit sales growth. 
Additionally, we're especially pleased with the early results of our mobile commerce site with over 15% of coach.com's total site traffic coming from a mobile device. Our digital presence expands far beyond our own website. We continue to evolve our engagement with our customers in a very relevant and authentic way through social media, with Facebook being the most important platform where Coach enthusiasts actively participate in our brand. 
Also in the U.S., we recently launched our factory flash sale site. Offered by invitation-only to our factory loyal consumers, this highly-profitable 48-hour private sale events complement our store strategy and give our customers another way to engage with that channel. While this is a snapshot of our North American retail digital initiatives, our web presence is global. We also have an e-commerce site in Japan and informational site in 16 important countries. We'll continue to use our digital capability to build awareness and as a customer touchpoint as we expand the Coach brand globally.
Moving to our stores. Lew already mentioned our store openings in North America this quarter. As you heard, our new distribution is primarily focused on growing our men's business, with 9 of the aggregate 11 stores opened in Q1 dedicated men's locations. While we're only 1-year into our focus on the men's initiative, we've been extremely pleased with our results as our business doubled on a global basis last year. In North America, we see men's as both a comp driver in existing stores and a substantial new distribution opportunity.
 Similar to the way we viewed the brand's potential in the women's category in the late 1990s, we believe that Coach can be the authority in men's bags and accessories in the years ahead. As we created the world of Coach for women across categories, we're now doing the same for men, designing collections with a distinct point of view, sharing the modern, classic aesthetic that is a hallmark of Coach. Clearly, the male shopper is engaging with the brand in increasing numbers.
In summary, we're excited with the continued progress we've made in improving our full-priced productivity and our growing men's business. We're feeling great about the holiday season given the current sales trends in both our full-priced and factory channel. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Lew for a discussion of our strategy and further opportunities for growth."

I",658,"Thanks, Mike. Mike just discussed a number of our productivity initiatives, including men's, which we're confident will be a significant contributor to top line sales in the seasons and years ahead, both in North America and in international markets. 
I would like to now focus on distribution growth.  As mentioned in August, we expect that our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 12% this year compared to 9% in FY '11. Starting in North America, we will open about 40 new stores this year, including about 15 full-priced and 25 factory outlets with more than 1/2 and each channel being dedicated men's locations. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 7% this year, in line with last year but primarily driven by men's.
Turning to China. This year, we're accelerating new store openings with about 30 locations planned or an additional 25 for the balance of the fiscal year, with the vast majority on the mainland. Virtually, all of these openings will be dual-gender stores due to the size of the men's opportunity. Given the continued strength we're experiencing in China, we are now projecting sales of at least $300 million for FY '12, the top end of the range we articulated in August.
As previously mentioned, we are making significant investments towards increasing awareness in China as we leverage our 70th anniversary campaign to build on our positioning as a New York fashion brand grounded in heritage and history. This integrated campaign has several key elements, including an international brand ambassador, Gwyneth Paltrow, who has proven relevancy in China and other international markets. In November, she'll be traveling to China with us and participating in several key press events.
In Japan, spending has stabilized from the post-earthquake and tsunami period. Our focus continues to be on gaining market share. During FY '12, we expect to open about 15 net new locations in Japan, nearly all of them dedicated men's stores. In total, we anticipate that net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 10% this year compared to 3% in FY '11.
Consistent with our strategy of directly operating select Asian markets, and as I mentioned briefly, we are pleased to announce that we've reached an agreement to take control of our domestic retail business in Taiwan, which has 24 locations and generates about $50 million of sales at retail. This transition is expected to occur in early January. And as previously announced, our Malaysia distribution will be acquired next July.
It's important to note that these acquisitions will allow us to leverage the investments we've already made in the region, utilizing the infrastructure created over the last few years, including our Asia shared services center and the Asia distribution center. Outside of our directly operated markets, we do have thriving distributor-run businesses in other countries. During FY '12, we expect to open about 35 net new international wholesale locations, expanding to new markets, including Brazil and Vietnam, as noted on our last earnings call.
Touching on Europe. During Q1, we added one location within Printemps in France, 2 in Ireland and one in Spain. Of course, we're excited about our new Bond Street flagship, which opened last month. Our international brand ambassador, Gwyneth Paltrow, co hosted a number of events heralding our opening, which helped raise brand awareness. During the balance of FY '12, we expect to open about 8 additional locations in Europe.
In closing, as most of you know, we have 3 over-arching growth strategies: build -- first, building our women's business in the growing North America market; second, leveraging the global opportunity; and third, tapping into the large and growing men's category. Taken together, we are confident that they will drive our business at a double-digit pace during our planning horizon.
At this time, I would like to introduce to you Jane Nielsen, our new CFO, for further detail on our financials. Jane?"

Lew and Mike have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our first quarter results. 
As mentioned, our quarterly revenues increased 15% with direct-to-consumer up 17% and indirect up 4%. Net income for the quarter totaled $215 million, up 14%, with earnings per diluted share of $0.73, up 16%. This compared to net income of $189 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.63 in the prior year's first quarter. Our operating income totaled $322 million, 13% above the $286 million reported last year, while operating margin was 30.7% versus 31.3%. We were extremely pleased with this level of growth and at the high level of profitability.
During this quarter, gross profit totaled $765 million versus $676 million a year ago, an increase of 13%. As expected, gross margin rate was 72.8%, a sequential improvement from the 71.8% reported in Q4 '11. This compared to 74.2% a year ago, reflecting the impact of higher sourcing cost this year.
Our expense ratio in Q1 totaled 42.1% compared to 42.8% reported in the year-ago quarter. We were able to gain 70 basis points of leverage in the quarter as our primary direct businesses here in North America and in Japan provided leverage to the corporate P&L, more than offsetting the impact of our investment spending. We believe we're striking the right balance between driving future growth opportunities and operating efficiencies.
Inventory levels at the end of the quarter were $520 million, 13% above the $459 million reported at the end of last year's Q1. This inventory level allows us to support 24 net new North American stores, 8 net new locations at Coach Japan, 22 additional Coach China stores, the 6 stores from our acquisition in Singapore and our men's initiative. Further, it will support strong underlying business trends, enabling us to maximize sales this holiday. 
Cash and short-term investments stood at $848 million as compared with $712 million a year ago. During the first quarter, we repurchased and retired nearly 1.1 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $55.30, spending a total of $59 million. This brought our trailing 12-month repurchase total to nearly 18 million shares, equaling about $1 billion.
At the end of the quarter, approximately $900 million remained under our company's present repurchase authorization. Net cash from operating activities in the first quarter was $225 million compared to $177 million last year during Q1. Free cash flow in the first quarter was an inflow of $194 million versus $154 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending was $31 million versus $23 million in the same quarter a year ago.
Consistent with our previous expectations and reflective of our global growth initiatives, CapEx for the year will be in the area of $200 million, driven primarily by the opening of new stores across all geographies and investments in technology necessary to enable our expansion. We were very pleased to once again report these strong financial results, and as Lew and Mike said, we're well positioned for the holiday quarter and the rest of the year. 
To elaborate, first, we expect to achieve double-digit sales with earnings per share growth ahead of the top line. Our sales will be driven in part by at least mid-single-digit comp store sales growth in North America for the balance of the year. Second, as we said before, we still expect our gross margin to improve sequentially in the first half of the year versus the second half of FY '11, though our gross margin will still contract in the first half on a year-over-year basis. However, the second half is expected to improve over last year as we anniversary increased sourcing costs. On balance, we anticipate the gross margin will remain in the 72% to 73% range for the year. Third, on SG&A, we expect our developed businesses to continue to deliver leverage while we will also continue to invest in global growth for the future. Fourth, we are committed to delivering an operating margin similar to what we've generated over the past 2 years. And fifth, our tax rate is likely to be in the area of 33% for the remainder of the year.
In summary, our first quarter results demonstrate our ability to manage our business nimbly while investing prudently in longer-term opportunities. We have accelerated our distribution plans to leverage the emerging market opportunity with a particular focus on China while also exploring new geographies, capitalizing on the increased popularity and recognition of the Coach brand with discerning consumers globally. We are also optimizing the brand's potential in men, leveraging our long heritage and equity in this category. And with the business model that generates significant cash flow and with virtually no debt, we are positioned to take full advantage of profitable growth opportunities globally while continuing to return capital to our shareholders.
I'd now like to open it up to Q&A."

We are seeing the opportunity in full price to add men's presence in our best locations in the United States. And that's either going to occur with an expansion within our most productive stores or malls or taking existing real estate in those most highly productive stores and dedicating more space to men's, as we've done, for example, in our Madison Avenue store at 57th Street, at 342 Madison store and others throughout the country. The approach in men's will be top-down. We're going to go from our most productive locations, most highly productive, highly traffic, most premium locations in North America and attack those first. And that is really what we're working on. A format that we're most excited about that we need to get built out is what we're calling a side-by-side format where, for example, in Pentagon Mall in Washington this spring, we'll take our existing store, which is a women's-only store, relocate it to a larger format with a side-by-side men's, women's location in about 3,700 square feet, bringing men's to the lease line and creating a dual-gender view to the customer. We believe that, that, on the full-price side, is an enormous growth opportunity for us. In factory, we are seeing incredible response to our men's. And there, we have 2 formats: one is a separate men's store in the neighborhood of our women store; or again, combining our men's and women's presence under one roof side by side. And we see both of those opportunities as viable and I think, long term, going deep into our fleet in terms of penetration. Our men's productivity is significant.

Consumers are cautious and concerned. However, unlike what occurred in '08 and '09, there's been no increase in the percentage of consumers that believe we're going to go into a deep recession. So even though there is worry, there isn't a feeling that the bottom is going to fall out, point one. Second, when we look at our consumer, she and he skews towards college graduates. And when we look at college grads, which represents about 1/3 of the total labor force, the unemployment rate is only about 4,%, higher than it should be, but it's only 4%. So the middle and upper middle class as the professional classes are doing a lot better than America overall, and those brands that are able to provide innovation, relevance and perceived excellent value are continuing to thrive. And we, as an acceptable luxury brand, are extremely well positioned to do that."

Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences.

And welcome, everyone. As noted in our press release, we posted another strong quarter, reflecting the global resonance of our brand proposition with both women and men, based on innovation, relevance and value, as well as the vitality of the category in all markets as our customers look to update their wardrobes through our fashion right, leather goods and lifestyle accessories.
In North America, we are continuing to grow our share of an expanding market, while in developing geographies, we are leveraging the inherent opportunity, investing in distribution and marketing initiatives. Beyond the top line, we are also very pleased with our high levels of profitability and substantial cash generation in Q1. Looking forward, and given the strength of our product pipeline, breadth of our assortment and shoppers' strong interest in accessories, gifts and self-purchase, Coach is clearly well positioned for another excellent holiday season.
While I will get into further detail of our current condition and the outlook of business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first. Some highlights were: first, net sales totaled $1.05 billion versus $912 million a year ago, an increase of 15%; second, earnings per share totaled $0.73, up 16% from prior year; third, direct-to-consumer sales, which now include our Singapore business rose 17% to $910 million from $777 million in the prior year on a comparable basis; fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter rose 9.2% from prior year, while total store sales rose 15%; fifth, sales in Japan rose 1% on a constant currency basis and 10% in dollars; and finally, in China, we continue to generate very strong growth with the continuation of significant double-digit comps.
We're also very pleased to announce the acquisition of our domestic retail business in Taiwan, which is expected to occur in early January. During the quarter, we opened 2 North American retail stores, including one in the new market for Coach, Winnipeg in Canada, and the men's mall store in Garden State Plaza in New Jersey. Two retail stores were also closed. In addition, we opened 9 factory stores, including 8 men's stand-alone factory stores. At the end of the period, there were 345 full-priced and 152 factory stores in operation in North America.
Moving on to China. During the quarter, we opened 5 net new locations, 4 in the mainland, one in Macau, bringing the total to 71 locations. 
In Singapore, as planned, we took control of our retail businesses this quarter and opened one new store as well. We now have 6 company-operated locations in that country.
And in Japan, 3 locations were added during the quarter, all of them dedicated men's shops, while one retail location was closed. At quarter end, of 178 total locations in Japan with 20 stand-alone full-priced stores, including 8 flagships, 119 shop-in-shops, 32 factory stores and 7 distributor-operated locations.
Indirect sales, which for context represent about 13% of Coach's sales on an annualized basis, increased 4% to $140 million from $134 million in the same period last year on a comparable basis. At POS, U.S. department store sales rose slightly on a year-over-year basis in the quarter. At the same time, international retail sales rose at a double-digit pace, driven primarily by distribution growth. It should be noted that the international traveler represents a meaningful growth opportunity as Coach's global awareness and presence increases.
Moving on. We estimate that the addressable women's U.S. handbag and accessory category rose about 5% to 10% last quarter. At the same time, in our own North American stores and on the Internet, Coach's handbag and accessory sales rose 12%. It's worth noting that our men's business was a significant driver of our overall all sales growth in Q1. Our North American performance is also benefiting from our rising global awareness, which is visible by the sharp increase of tourists in select stores in travel markets around the country, including Hawaii, Las Vegas, Florida, and of course, New York. In these locations, Coach has become a key shopping destination. 
Our total revenues in North America rose 13% for the quarter with our directly operated stores up 15% as distribution growth augmented comp. As noted, total Q1 same-store sales rose 9.2%, fueling the strong overall comp with similarly strong gains in both channels, driven by significant increases in conversion from prior year, while tickets rose as well and store traffic declined.
It's important to note, however, that we continue to experience significant gains in traffic and sales on the Internet. Looking at online traffic in combination with store traffic, it's more representative of our consumers' shopping behaviors in this growing digitally enabled environment, notably for the full-priced channel. In aggregating this metric, traffic into our retail channel actually rose with increases on coach.com more than offsetting the modest declines in store. This is consistent with our increased emphasis on digital, both through our own website and social media.
In Japan, we posted a 1% increase in constant currency and a 10% increase in dollars, as mentioned. Coach now holds the #2 place within the Japanese imported accessories market with a 17% yen share. Our position reflects the strength and relevance of the Coach brand, as the Japanese consumer will become increasingly value oriented. 
As we've discussed many times outside of North America, China is clearly our largest geographic growth opportunity given the size of the market and the rate of growth. During the quarter, our sales rose sharply from prior year, fueled by distribution and significant double-digit same-store sales. Clearly, the Chinese consumer has embraced Coach, as evidenced by the extremely high repurchase intent among existing customers.
While Jane will get into more detail on our financials and I will discuss our outlook in some detail shortly, I wanted to give you this recap. As you know, Mike Tucci has joined us today to discuss our product performance for Q1 and our holiday sales initiatives. Mike?"

During the first quarter, as always, we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness, driving higher conversion levels and improved productivity. In addition to our relaunch of an evolved Poppy collection in July with updated styles, patterns and prints, we launched the new Chelsea collection featuring a modern, faceted turnlock inspired by our heritage and offered in timeless silhouettes. In August, we offered new fall fabrications, colors and patterns in Madison and a new shoulderbag style in Chelsea. During September, we focused on Kristin with several new totes and satchel styles. Clearly, our balanced and more refined handbag assortment continues to drive sustainable growth in North America.
Handbags once again posted strong comps in the quarter, the penetration rising to 58%, the low single-digit increase and average unit retail. To open the second quarter, we brought in Madison, our core holiday collection, completely updated and featuring several new silhouettes. Lindsey, a new style and feature of our holiday ad campaign, was an immediate hit with consumers. Abigail is also a new fashion silhouette and key item. Both are available in the range of fabrications, including gathered leather, and price from a $358 up to $898 for limited edition.
Also new to Madison are the Mini Sophia, the smaller version of this foundational style, the flat carryall and the Caroline Dowel satchel. With this being the most fully developed the Madison offering, we are seeing the highest penetration level for the collection ever, eclipsing its highly successful launch 3 years ago.
For November, we're excited about Poppy, offered in new styles including 2 totes, a foldover crossbody silhouette, a hippie and a satchel. Liquid gloss or soft patent lightweight fabric, we'll bring additional excitement and color to the collection. We'll also be adding some newness to Chelsea. Only introduced this fall was a tote that features chain detail at compelling price points. Right before Thanksgiving, we'll refresh the assortment with updates to Madison and Kirsten, along with a new drawstring tote in Chelsea, giving her additional reasons to revisit and repurchase during the key holiday season. Of course, we'll also have a comprehensive assortment of great gifts, from iPad covers to wrist list and a wide range of items under $100 as well.
In addition, our holiday product will be supported by a comprehensive marketing plan beginning in mid-November featuring a powerful gifting message. The emphasis of our marketing will be product and item-driven across our core categories and other gifting ideas. Our campaign will span coach.com, social and rich media advertising and compelling print and in-store marketing to drive traffic. We'll also be adding digital media to select high-profile store windows as the new element of our in-store marketing.
I'd also like to take this opportunity to provide an update on our digital strategy and the benefits that we're seeing from it. As mentioned in previous calls, coach.com is our most important marketing tool. Our primary objective online in North America is to build top-of-mind brand awareness while maximizing e-commerce opportunity. In fact, within North America, coach.com is our fastest-growing retail store with double-digit sales growth. 
Additionally, we're especially pleased with the early results of our mobile commerce site with over 15% of coach.com's total site traffic coming from a mobile device. Our digital presence expands far beyond our own website. We continue to evolve our engagement with our customers in a very relevant and authentic way through social media, with Facebook being the most important platform where Coach enthusiasts actively participate in our brand. 
Also in the U.S., we recently launched our factory flash sale site. Offered by invitation-only to our factory loyal consumers, this highly-profitable 48-hour private sale events complement our store strategy and give our customers another way to engage with that channel. While this is a snapshot of our North American retail digital initiatives, our web presence is global. We also have an e-commerce site in Japan and informational site in 16 important countries. We'll continue to use our digital capability to build awareness and as a customer touchpoint as we expand the Coach brand globally.
Moving to our stores. Lew already mentioned our store openings in North America this quarter. As you heard, our new distribution is primarily focused on growing our men's business, with 9 of the aggregate 11 stores opened in Q1 dedicated men's locations. While we're only 1-year into our focus on the men's initiative, we've been extremely pleased with our results as our business doubled on a global basis last year. In North America, we see men's as both a comp driver in existing stores and a substantial new distribution opportunity.
 Similar to the way we viewed the brand's potential in the women's category in the late 1990s, we believe that Coach can be the authority in men's bags and accessories in the years ahead. As we created the world of Coach for women across categories, we're now doing the same for men, designing collections with a distinct point of view, sharing the modern, classic aesthetic that is a hallmark of Coach. Clearly, the male shopper is engaging with the brand in increasing numbers.
In summary, we're excited with the continued progress we've made in improving our full-priced productivity and our growing men's business. We're feeling great about the holiday season given the current sales trends in both our full-priced and factory channel. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Lew for a discussion of our strategy and further opportunities for growth."

I",658,"Thanks, Mike. Mike just discussed a number of our productivity initiatives, including men's, which we're confident will be a significant contributor to top line sales in the seasons and years ahead, both in North America and in international markets. 
I would like to now focus on distribution growth.  As mentioned in August, we expect that our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 12% this year compared to 9% in FY '11. Starting in North America, we will open about 40 new stores this year, including about 15 full-priced and 25 factory outlets with more than 1/2 and each channel being dedicated men's locations. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 7% this year, in line with last year but primarily driven by men's.
Turning to China. This year, we're accelerating new store openings with about 30 locations planned or an additional 25 for the balance of the fiscal year, with the vast majority on the mainland. Virtually, all of these openings will be dual-gender stores due to the size of the men's opportunity. Given the continued strength we're experiencing in China, we are now projecting sales of at least $300 million for FY '12, the top end of the range we articulated in August.
As previously mentioned, we are making significant investments towards increasing awareness in China as we leverage our 70th anniversary campaign to build on our positioning as a New York fashion brand grounded in heritage and history. This integrated campaign has several key elements, including an international brand ambassador, Gwyneth Paltrow, who has proven relevancy in China and other international markets. In November, she'll be traveling to China with us and participating in several key press events.
In Japan, spending has stabilized from the post-earthquake and tsunami period. Our focus continues to be on gaining market share. During FY '12, we expect to open about 15 net new locations in Japan, nearly all of them dedicated men's stores. In total, we anticipate that net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 10% this year compared to 3% in FY '11.
Consistent with our strategy of directly operating select Asian markets, and as I mentioned briefly, we are pleased to announce that we've reached an agreement to take control of our domestic retail business in Taiwan, which has 24 locations and generates about $50 million of sales at retail. This transition is expected to occur in early January. And as previously announced, our Malaysia distribution will be acquired next July.
It's important to note that these acquisitions will allow us to leverage the investments we've already made in the region, utilizing the infrastructure created over the last few years, including our Asia shared services center and the Asia distribution center. Outside of our directly operated markets, we do have thriving distributor-run businesses in other countries. During FY '12, we expect to open about 35 net new international wholesale locations, expanding to new markets, including Brazil and Vietnam, as noted on our last earnings call.
Touching on Europe. During Q1, we added one location within Printemps in France, 2 in Ireland and one in Spain. Of course, we're excited about our new Bond Street flagship, which opened last month. Our international brand ambassador, Gwyneth Paltrow, co hosted a number of events heralding our opening, which helped raise brand awareness. During the balance of FY '12, we expect to open about 8 additional locations in Europe.
In closing, as most of you know, we have 3 over-arching growth strategies: build -- first, building our women's business in the growing North America market; second, leveraging the global opportunity; and third, tapping into the large and growing men's category. Taken together, we are confident that they will drive our business at a double-digit pace during our planning horizon.
At this time, I would like to introduce to you Jane Nielsen, our new CFO, for further detail on our financials. Jane?"
526573,141790658,177802,"Coach, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2011",2011-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Lew.

Lew and Mike have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our first quarter results. 
As mentioned, our quarterly revenues increased 15% with direct-to-consumer up 17% and indirect up 4%. Net income for the quarter totaled $215 million, up 14%, with earnings per diluted share of $0.73, up 16%. This compared to net income of $189 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.63 in the prior year's first quarter. Our operating income totaled $322 million, 13% above the $286 million reported last year, while operating margin was 30.7% versus 31.3%. We were extremely pleased with this level of growth and at the high level of profitability.
During this quarter, gross profit totaled $765 million versus $676 million a year ago, an increase of 13%. As expected, gross margin rate was 72.8%, a sequential improvement from the 71.8% reported in Q4 '11. This compared to 74.2% a year ago, reflecting the impact of higher sourcing cost this year.
Our expense ratio in Q1 totaled 42.1% compared to 42.8% reported in the year-ago quarter. We were able to gain 70 basis points of leverage in the quarter as our primary direct businesses here in North America and in Japan provided leverage to the corporate P&L, more than offsetting the impact of our investment spending. We believe we're striking the right balance between driving future growth opportunities and operating efficiencies.
Inventory levels at the end of the quarter were $520 million, 13% above the $459 million reported at the end of last year's Q1. This inventory level allows us to support 24 net new North American stores, 8 net new locations at Coach Japan, 22 additional Coach China stores, the 6 stores from our acquisition in Singapore and our men's initiative. Further, it will support strong underlying business trends, enabling us to maximize sales this holiday. 
Cash and short-term investments stood at $848 million as compared with $712 million a year ago. During the first quarter, we repurchased and retired nearly 1.1 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $55.30, spending a total of $59 million. This brought our trailing 12-month repurchase total to nearly 18 million shares, equaling about $1 billion.
At the end of the quarter, approximately $900 million remained under our company's present repurchase authorization. Net cash from operating activities in the first quarter was $225 million compared to $177 million last year during Q1. Free cash flow in the first quarter was an inflow of $194 million versus $154 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending was $31 million versus $23 million in the same quarter a year ago.
Consistent with our previous expectations and reflective of our global growth initiatives, CapEx for the year will be in the area of $200 million, driven primarily by the opening of new stores across all geographies and investments in technology necessary to enable our expansion. We were very pleased to once again report these strong financial results, and as Lew and Mike said, we're well positioned for the holiday quarter and the rest of the year. 
To elaborate, first, we expect to achieve double-digit sales with earnings per share growth ahead of the top line. Our sales will be driven in part by at least mid-single-digit comp store sales growth in North America for the balance of the year. Second, as we said before, we still expect our gross margin to improve sequentially in the first half of the year versus the second half of FY '11, though our gross margin will still contract in the first half on a year-over-year basis. However, the second half is expected to improve over last year as we anniversary increased sourcing costs. On balance, we anticipate the gross margin will remain in the 72% to 73% range for the year. Third, on SG&A, we expect our developed businesses to continue to deliver leverage while we will also continue to invest in global growth for the future. Fourth, we are committed to delivering an operating margin similar to what we've generated over the past 2 years. And fifth, our tax rate is likely to be in the area of 33% for the remainder of the year.
In summary, our first quarter results demonstrate our ability to manage our business nimbly while investing prudently in longer-term opportunities. We have accelerated our distribution plans to leverage the emerging market opportunity with a particular focus on China while also exploring new geographies, capitalizing on the increased popularity and recognition of the Coach brand with discerning consumers globally. We are also optimizing the brand's potential in men, leveraging our long heritage and equity in this category. And with the business model that generates significant cash flow and with virtually no debt, we are positioned to take full advantage of profitable growth opportunities globally while continuing to return capital to our shareholders.
I'd now like to open it up to Q&A."

That was driven by an increased contribution penetration of handbags over $400, particularly on the back of the strength of Madison. And as you know, Madison is our lead collection for Q2. It's performing very, very well out of the gate.

We are seeing the opportunity in full price to add men's presence in our best locations in the United States.

The approach in men's will be top-down. We're going to go from our most productive locations, most highly productive, highly traffic, most premium locations in North America and attack those first. And that is really what we're working on. A format that we're most excited about that we need to get built out is what we're calling a side-by-side format where, for example, in Pentagon Mall in Washington this spring, we'll take our existing store, which is a women's-only store, relocate it to a larger format with a side-by-side men's, women's location in about 3,700 square feet, bringing men's to the lease line and creating a dual-gender view to the customer. We believe that, that, on the full-price side, is an enormous growth opportunity for us. In factory, we are seeing incredible response to our men's. And there, we have 2 formats: one is a separate men's store in the neighborhood of our women store; or again, combining our men's and women's presence under one roof side by side. And we see both of those opportunities as viable and I think, long term, going deep into our fleet in terms of penetration. Our men's productivity is significant.

So for us, key is really building awareness that we have a very broad and excellent assortment and for those men on the call we invite you to visit our stores or the Internet."

While the easy one is on the comp performance between the 2 channels, very, very consistent with prior quarters and both channels performing very, very similarly. On men's, I think it's important to understand that it's still early. We're very enthusiastic about what we're seeing. The men's opportunity on the factory side of the business is demonstrated. And there, I would say we are in more than a rollout in distribution growth mode. On the full-price side, real estate acquisition and positioning in the marketplace, frankly, is more of a long-term challenge and will take more time. And we continue to experiment with what the optimal format is in men's on the full-price side. So I would say there, we need a little bit more time to commit to how large the opportunity can be. Confidently, we're going to double our men's business this year in North America and build it to a meaningful base and a meaningful penetration to our total company business. It is also providing comp and productivity to the overall channels in full-price and factory. Long-term target, I see men's as being -- I would go out on a limb and say that men's can be 15% to 20% of our women's business over time, which obviously sets it up as a substantial growth opportunity, both within North America, as well as from a global standpoint. Lew, do you want to add?"

Consumers are cautious and concerned. However, unlike what occurred in '08 and '09, there's been no increase in the percentage of consumers that believe we're going to go into a deep recession. So even though there is worry, there isn't a feeling that the bottom is going to fall out, point one. Second, when we look at our consumer, she and he skews towards college graduates. And when we look at college grads, which represents about 1/3 of the total labor force, the unemployment rate is only about 4,%, higher than it should be, but it's only 4%. So the middle and upper middle class as the professional classes are doing a lot better than America overall, and those brands that are able to provide innovation, relevance and perceived excellent value are continuing to thrive. And we, as an acceptable luxury brand, are extremely well positioned to do that."
