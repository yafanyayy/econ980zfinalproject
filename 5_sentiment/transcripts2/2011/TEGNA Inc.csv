We are pleased with a positive results that we delivered for the fourth quarter and full year. We recognized that the media landscape was changing and that we would need to take proactive measures to ensure the Gannet is best positioned to adapt to the changing environment and continues to operate successfully. Over the last year, we have strengthened our balance sheet and enhanced our financial flexibility, created and customized attractive multiplatform content for our customers, improved our production and distribution functions, enhanced our local market presence in both our Publishing and Broadcast segments and restructured costs and created efficiencies throughout the organization, among others. As a result of our actions, we've improved the profitability of each of our business segments and generated operating cash flow of $1.3 billion this year despite the challenging operating environment. 
Now let me turn to the fourth quarter results.  Our were fourth quarter results reflect another quarter of significantly better profitability and overall revenue growth. Our Broadcasting and Digital segment revenue growth was higher compared to last year, dramatically higher in the case of Broadcasting. We progressed on the year-over-year comparisons in our Publishing segment, although our results mirrored the state of the economy here and in the U.K. Domestically, results were strong in auto and employment, while real estate continues to show slower growth. 
In the U.K., operating environment remains very challenging for us. Our focus on strategically identifying efficiency opportunities resulted in substantially growth in our profitability overall compared to the fourth quarter last year. 
I am pleased to report another quarter of significant earnings per share growth. Excluding special items, our EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.83, up about 19% from the fourth quarter of 2009. Most importantly, we generated operating cash flow of almost $400 million in the quarter. Gracia will discuss our quarterly results in more detail in just a moment.
But before that, let me raise a few things that I want to discuss about our strategic initiatives in more detail, the three key actions that reflect our commitment to enhancing and customizing our marketing solutions for advertisers to help their businesses grow, extending our reach and broadening our engagement in our local markets and delivering content on any platform consumers want anywhere they want it. 
Our partnership with Yahoo! is a great example of our ability to adapt to changing advertiser choices and customizing our advertisers solutions to help their business. In this environment, it is critically important for us to have Digital solutions for advertisers in our local markets, and Yahoo! enhances the digital alternatives turn it did for our marketing and sales team. 
To be clear, the partnership with Yahoo! leverages the strength of our local market presence, our trusted brands and our local advertising relationships with Yahoo!'s audience and display advertising leadership. With Yahoo!, we have a significant competitive advantage in our markets. We can offer our advertisers unmatched audience reach and the ability to target their customers precisely based on attributes like demography, geography and behavior. 
Thus far, the partnership is working as planned. In U.S. Community Publishing, 39 sites rollout the owl and several other sites will be completed by the end of March. Our local Digital sales teams have started the remaining launches.
In Broadcasting, all seven of our targeted markets have launched Yahoo! The final market, KPNX, launched about two weeks ago with the Arizona Republic. Building on our already strong presence in our local TV markets is a top priority for our Broadcasting management team. 
As we have reported in the past, we our partnered with Data Sphere to launch hyper-local sites in an effort to deliver localized content to our consumers and a digital ad solution to small local businesses, something that we have not offered in the past. 
Our final market, Sacramento, launched January 20 with 30 sites. That brings our total to 264 hyper-local neighborhood websites that have been launched in 10 markets. We are showing month-over-month growth in page views per neighborhood site. 
To further drive audits gains, we are rolling out marketing initiatives. We have delivered over 1.9 million total community site page views and 30,000 stories published to community sites across a bare nine markets in 2010.  Revenue associated with Data Sphere is running ahead of projections. 
We are launching a similar local focus effort in U.S. Community Publishing for classified employment. As I noted, a bright spot and our results for almost the entire year has been our classified employment growth of 10% and our local markets. To further that success, USC team news, advertising and Digital department introduced a division-wide initiative to foster employment growth in our local communities. 
At local sites, employment advertising has been moved to the main section of the newspaper, elevating its profile. It has a new banner and page layout and is coupled with related content from CareerBuilder. 
On Sundays during the first quarter, newsroom stories will explore hard job growth can be stimulated. Many sites have one major reporting projects with other sites that are partnering with community agencies to hold public forums and creating state-wide collaborative projects. We continue to deliver strong content that is trusted and relevant. USCP also focused on growing pay Sunday home delivery circulation by giving consumers an enhanced Sunday product and advertisers deeper reach. 
Advertisers, especially national preprint advertisers, want to have their advertising in the Sunday newspaper because it's a warm, lean-forward environment, meaning consumers deeply engage with the Sunday product. Both the content, including the depth and variety and the advertising, which serves as a weekly shopping guide. 
So we decided to enrich the consumer experience even more by enhancing content and design. As a result, we have been successful promoting the benefit of Sunday home delivery. Sunday home delivery was up on average compared to 2009 for the largest 32 local products that we have. 20 sites achieved year-over-year growth on the annual average. 
Our content is valued in our local markets, and we continue to assess that value through paid content models in three of our domestic publishing sites. As Bob Dickey noted that the UBS conference, we have learned some important lessons thus far. The first is that subscriber engagement is much higher than nonsubscribers to a significant extent. Second, the three sites have delivered all their local online advertising campaigns through this testing period, and overall retention rates remain strong. And finally, promotion is critical. Page view increases at each site are being driven by comprehensive promotion strategies that use several platforms, including email and social media.
The spectrum at St. George, for example, continues to show improvement in the year-over-year difference in page views since their August launch. In December, they experienced a dramatic increase, logging an 18% year-over-year increase in page views and a 7% year-over-year increase in unique visitors. The jump reflects the power of being the dominant source for news and information in a local market.
Our Digital content continues to be popular and growing, particularly, our USA TODAY news apps. Through January, our downloads totaled 7.3 million, 3.6 million for the iPhone, $1.4 million for the iPad and $2.140 million for the Android. As you can see, the Apple products account for almost 70% of the downloads. However, the Android accounted almost half of the downloads in January.
As I am sure you are aware, mobile content consumption continues to grow, and 2010 was an absolutely huge year. more then 234 million Americans age 13 and over use mobile devices in 2010 according to ComScore, and over 30% of mobile subscribers use smartphones. And our mobile statistics reflect that growth. We experienced a significant jump in mobile page views in 2010 from USA TODAY and our local sites, up 267% to 1.6 billion. 
We also began to see signs of an emerging market for mobile advertising on both national and local levels. Obviously, the demands of mobile users are growing, and we wanted to deliver rich content and advertising that continually evolve to meet those demands. 
To deliver on that commitment, we announced plans last September to implement a common Gannett-wide software platform for mobile site development and hosting. USA TODAY site launched in December. And during the first quarter, we will launch over 100 sites for all local U.S. news properties across Gannett.
The sites will have a new look and feel and support on-demand video for higher-end devices, such as an iPhone. Markets will have the ability to customize their sites. As importantly, we will be enhancing the sites throughout the year. 
We continue to extend our strategy to make content available to consumers in any form that they want it. We announced the launch of on goal last week. On go is a digital news service that provides subscribers with a new approach to reading, discovering and sharing news. The new, paid subscription service response to changing customer demand and preferences, allowing subscribers to create, customize, personalize and access the news and information that matters most of them, all in one place.
On go is accessible through major web browsers on computers, smart phones and tablets, so subscribers enjoy their favorite publications on all of the devices they own for a single monthly fee. As you can see, we successfully executed on several initiatives throughout 2010. And their results reflect those efforts. Against the backdrop of an uneven economic recovery, we delivered sequential improvement in our total operating revenues for each quarter of this year. 
Now I'd like to briefly discuss our results by segment.  For the fiscal year, earnings per share, excluding special items, was 32% higher. Our Broadcasting segment revenues were up substantially this year as expected. Our ratings for the Olympics and on election night were unparalleled, and market strength resulted in about $107 million in revenue associated with those events. 
At the same time, core advertising remains strong. We increased our retransmission revenues over 12% this year. That growth enabled us to greatly expand the profitability of our Broadcasting segment. Operating income, excluding special items, was up 50% this year compared to last and exceeded operating income on the same basis in 2008 by $20 million, even though 2008 was a presidential election year, quite an effort.
Digital segment revenues were up this year as well, and operating income, excluding special items, was about 43% higher. Results for CareerBuilder, PointRoll and ShopLocal all contributed to the profitability growth. Each business is already a leader in their respective sectors, and we expect them to continue their strong performance. 
In the Publishing segment, revenue growth is still elusive. We are not where we would like to be, but we are working diligently to get there. We are committed to keeping our expenses in line with our revenue. We delivered on that commitment this year with the result was a 50% increase in operating income x special items. 
In short, we improved the profitability of each of our business segments, specifically and as a result, generated $1.3 billion in operating cash flow. Look that another way, we generated free cash flow per diluted share of $3.44 compared to $3.29 last year. We further strengthened our balance sheet through debt reduction of $710 million during 2010 and made discretionary contributions to the pension plan, totaling $130 million.
We reshaped our debt structure, and through some well executed longer-term bond issues, create an extremely manageable maturity schedule. And we ensured our financial flexibility through the extension of our revolving credit facility. 
In sum, all of our strategic efforts have enabled us to dramatically increase the results for our business. At the same time, we positioned the company for growth as a multimedia enterprise with valuable local franchises and national scale. Without a doubt, we are a much, much stronger and better company than we were just one year ago. And with that, I will turn the call over to Gracia."
20571,118431282,97137,"Gannett Co., Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2011",2011-01-31,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Craig. I'll cover our quarterly results in more detail particularly each of our business segments and then some balance sheet items. I'd also like to echo Craig's comments.

I'll cover our quarterly results in more detail particularly each of our business segments and then some balance sheet items. 
I'd also like to echo Craig's comments. We are certainly a stronger company today than we were a year ago, and the results speak to that. We generated positive growth for our total operating revenues this quarter, which continued the sequential improvement in our year-over-year comparisons. 
On a two-year comparison basis, the improvement was significant, up nine percentage points. We managed our expenses in the quarter, continuing our efficiency efforts, and the result was a 3% reduction in operating expenses, excluding special items.
Publishing, Digital and corporate expenses were all lower, while Broadcast segment expenses were higher as expected, reflecting the substantial increase in revenue. Higher revenue and lower operating expenses overall led to substantially higher profitability. Earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis were $0.72, an increase of 33% from last year. However, excluding special items, our EPS for the quarter was $0.83 compared to $0.70 in the fourth quarter last year, a 19% increase.
We summarized the special items that we are talking about in our release this morning. They totaled approximately $40.3 million this quarter on a pretax basis. In both this year and last year, the special items were the result principally of facility consolidations and asset impairments. 
We also provided reconciliations of several non-GAAP items to our GAAP schedules on our release this morning as well. We sold The Honolulu Advertiser and its related assets in a small directory Publishing business in the second quarter of 2010. Results for these former properties have been reclassified to discontinued operations.
Revenue from these properties totaled approximately $30 million in the fourth quarter last year and were absent this year. These properties generated about $23 million in revenues in the first quarter of 2010. Therefore, for modeling purposes and appropriate year-over-year comparisons, you should again adjust first quarter numbers to remove those revenues from of the previously reported revenues for the first quarter of 2010. 
Now let's turn to our segment results and I'll begin with Publishing. Total revenues in there were down in the mid- single-digit reflecting the state of the domestic economy as well as the U.K.'s economic challenges, although there was sequential improvement in retail and classified. Circulation revenue and other Publishing revenue comparisons were also better than the third quarter this year. 
A significant decline in national advertising, particularly in December against difficult comp comparisons, offset positive comparisons. Revenue comparisons for the Publishing segment on a two-year basis were the best quarterly comparisons of the year and about eight percentage points better than the two-year comparison for the third quarter.
Classified advertising on a two-year comparison basis was over 14 percentage points better than the two-year comparison for the last quarter. Q2, the two-year comparisons for the best of the year. 
Domestic Publishing revenues were approximately 4% lower compared to the fourth quarter last year. Classified lagged by about 2% as the automotive and categories were up solidly again in the quarter, increases of 7% and 10%, respectively. That continues the positive year-over-year comparisons for those categories that were started in the second quarter this year. The real estate category reflecting continued housing challenges nationwide continued to lag.
National advertising, as I noted, was lower in the quarter. We did have stronger national advertising our U.S. Community Publishing, but that was offset by softer ad demand at USA TODAY and its associated distances. There was strength in the travel and financial categories there, both of which were in the top five categories in the quarter. However, several key categories lagged last year. If you exclude USA TODAY and USA WEEKEND, national advertising for the total Publishing segment was up almost 3% in the quarter.
At Newsquest, Publishing revenue was down about 5% in pounds. Comparisons, however, were about one percentage point better than the third quarter. Similar to our domestic results, circulation and other revenue category comparisons were better than the third quarter. National, unlike our domestic operations, was eight percentage points better than the third quarter comparison and down just 2% compared to the fourth quarter last year.
The economic situation in the U.K. remains a challenge as evidenced by the recent announcement that the economy contracted in the fourth quarter after a year of growth. The horrendous December weather there also had an impact. Some funded however are suggesting the slowdown they indicate that consumer retrenchment and fiscal tightening are having an impact an important components of the U.K. economy, such as the construction and services sectors. we will clearly to an eye on that, particularly as the year unfolds.
Digital advertising continues to be a significant focus for us. The growth in Digital advertising in our Publishing segment continued again this quarter and reflects those efforts. Digital advertising revenue for the U.S. Community Publishing, Newsquest and USA TODAY were all up nicely in the quarter, particularly U.S. community Publishing was up 16% and USA TODAY, which jumped 19%.
Turning to expenses, Publishing expenses, excluding special items, were down about 5% in line with revenue declines. The impact of strategic efforts to identify operating efficiencies as well as facility consolidations in previous quarters and this quarter drove the expense decrease. 
The decline, however, was partially offset by significantly higher newsprint expense, which was up over 18%. Higher newsage prices were partially offset by a decline in consumption of about 6.5%. 
Let me say a couple of words on the current newsprint landscape. Last year, newsprint prices rose on the strength of demand and exports, but continued growth in those markets was now uncertain due to the increased offshore customer inventories. 
Domestic prices have been relatively stable since the second half of 2010, although an East-West regional price variance persists. Having said that, we expect newsage price comparisons in the first quarter of this year to be unfavorable compared to the first quarter of 2010 when we had the lowest prices of 2010. But our consumption is expected to be lower. The connection between pricing and demand can be tenuous, suggesting that a moderate approach by produces to price recovery would support a stable environment for both industries. 
Publishing segment operating income, excluding special items, was just 2% lower in the quarter. The decline was driven principally by newsprint expense. Excluding newsprint expense and special items, operating income and cash flow would have both increased in the low single digits in the fourth quarter, compared to the fourth quarter last year. 
Now let me switch over to Broadcast. Revenue results and profitability were substantially stronger this quarter. Revenue growth of 27% reflects the strength of our local franchises. Several factors contributed to that increase: Ad demand related to November elections, which totaled approximately $52 million for the quarter; solid core advertising revenues, an increase in retransmission fees of 60% to about $16.5 million; and finally, 44% increase in Captivates revenue.
Although politically related spending was strong, television advertising demand, excluding political, was up in the quarter. The increase was tempered by the displacement effect of heavy political ad demand, which I will discuss more about that in a moment. 
If you exclude special items, Broadcasting expenses were up about 12% in the quarter as expected, reflecting primarily higher sales and marketing costs and the ramp-up of some initiatives. Broadcasting revenue growth greatly outpaced expense increases. The result, a 47% increase in operating income, excluding special items and a 41% increase in operating cash flow on the same basis.
As Craig noted, the more suitable comparison maybe to the fourth quarter of 2008, given the level of political spending in that presidential election year. Excluding special items, we generated almost 20% more in operating income in the fourth quarter this year on an increase in total Broadcasting revenue of just 9% and lower political revenue than in 2008, which again, was the presidential election year. In short, our margins this quarter were better than the fourth quarter 2008, reflecting the improved efficiency of our Broadcasting operations and our significant operating leverage.
Looking to the first quarter of 2011, we may face some headwinds in comparison to our combined revenue success of last year. The biggest, of course, is the Winter Olympic Games, which generated almost $19 million in ad demand on our NBC-affiliated stations. We also enjoyed election-related advertising of $3.3 million, and a little over $2 million related to the Super Bowl on our CBS stations. And as you know, that's approved role will be on Fox of this year. 
Still, solid core advertising in the fourth quarter and particularly for December, which was not impacted by the displacement effect of political spending, bodes well for the first quarter. Despite the level of ad revenue that will be absent relative to the first quarter last year, given current trends, we expect total television revenues to be up in a very low single digits.
While the Broadcasting segment had an outstanding quarter, our Digital segment also generated much higher profitability from a 5% increase in revenues. The revenue increase was due principally to higher revenues at CareerBuilder. Operating expenses in the Digital segment overall were tightly manage. And as a result, Digital segment operating income, excluding special items, totaled approximately $38 million, an increase from the fourth quarter last year of over 45%. Operating cash flow in the same basis was up significantly as well, about 31%. Digital advertising revenue company-wide was over $271 million in the quarter and 10% higher than in the fourth quarter last year, as each business segment increased their digital revenues. 
Now let me turn quickly to the balance sheet. As we previously announced, we completed a bond financing at the beginning of the quarter. These transactions in addition to our debt reduction had an impact on our interest expense. Interest expense was up about $1.5 million in the quarter, reflecting significantly lower average debt balances but also a higher average interest rate due to these longer-term fixed rate debt issuances.
As a reminder, we also extended our revolving credit facilities. Total commitments under the amended facilities are now $1.63 billion through March 15, 2012, and total extended commitments from the middle of March 2012 to the end of September 2014 will be $1.14 billion, more than ample capacity. 
As Craig noted, the combined impact of these transactions is significant. We again have created the debt maturity profile that is easily manageable as well as the financial flexibility to invest in our businesses, explore opportunities and better position the company for future growth.
As we have noted, we generated significantly more cash flow this quarter than in the fourth quarter last year. We used a portion of it to reduce debt by about $67 million. We also made a $100 million pretax voluntary contribution to our pension plan in the quarter, bringing those contributions to $130 million in total. We also had a strong investment performance in the plan, which all resulted in a substantial improvement in the funded status of the plan.
So taking all of that into consideration, long-term debt at the end of the year was $2.35 billion, and cash totaled $183 million. At this point, our all-in-cost debt is approximately 6.8%, including the impact of the new debt that I noted. And our debt to EBITDA covenant at the end of the period was again below 2x.  One final financial item. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $32 million, bringing the total for the year to stay $69 million. 
So in summary, the fourth quarter capped a year of improved beat results for the Gannett Co. Revenues overall were positive compared to last year's first quarter and completed the run of sequential improvement for the year. And we maintained our focus on restructuring our cost base. The operating leverage created as a result dramatically improved the profitability of our company.
And as Craig mentioned, we further strengthened our balance sheet. We at Gannett are well positioned to adapt to the evolving media landscape and the prospect of a firmer economy in the year ahead. And with that, we will open it up for questions. Sarah?"

On one hand, we see some numbers and statistics that would suggest that things are picking up more than what it appears in the marketplace. And then in other areas, for instance, in retail sales, while there was a fairly powerful spending done around Thanksgiving, it seemed as though the consumers tightened up in their pocketbooks in the month of December. And retails sales in some situations were not quite as robust as those Thanksgiving numbers would have suggested they might be. So I think in total, I think there's still a lot of uncertainty surrounding the economy. I think there's a lot of concern about what's going to happen to the municipalities and the states and the talk surrounding potential bankruptcies and the like. And that, obviously, can have an impact on what goes on in the community if jobs are at stake as a result of municipalities cutting back, et cetera. So I think it's kind of similar to what we've said all along, which is that we've never seen an economic recovery that's gone in a straight line. There have always been those moments where peers stake hold and then exuberant takes hold and then you could to get to go back-and-forth as each number comes out in each do think pops up. But I think, overall, we're real pleased with what we accomplished, both for the year and for the fourth quarter. We'll see how the economy zigs and zags as we get into 2011 in a more meaningful way. And we'll do what is necessary to produce strong results. Obviously, in the U.K., a little bit of a different scenario with the contraction in the economy there in the fourth quarter after four quarters of growth. And they've certainly taken a different position on retrenchment in government spending and the like that a lot we have in the U.S. thus far. So we're going to have to see how that all plays out. But we will keep you posted, and we'll share with you anything that we see, either positive or negative."

We are pleased with a positive results that we delivered for the fourth quarter and full year. We recognized that the media landscape was changing and that we would need to take proactive measures to ensure the Gannet is best positioned to adapt to the changing environment and continues to operate successfully. Over the last year, we have strengthened our balance sheet and enhanced our financial flexibility, created and customized attractive multi-platform content for our customers, improved our production and distribution functions, enhanced our local market presence in both our Publishing and Broadcast segments and restructured costs and created efficiencies throughout the organization, among others. As a result of our actions, we've improved the profitability of each of our business segments and generated operating cash flow of $1.3 billion this year despite the challenging operating environment. 
Now let me turn to the fourth quarter results. Our were fourth quarter results reflect another quarter of significantly better profitability and overall revenue growth. Our Broadcasting and Digital segment revenue growth was higher compared to last year, dramatically higher in the case of Broadcasting. We progressed on the year-over-year comparisons in our Publishing segment, although our results mirrored the state of the economy here and in the U.K. Domestically, results were strong in auto and employment, while real estate continued to show slower growth. 
In the U.K., operating environment remains very challenging for us. Our focus on strategically identifying efficiency opportunities resulted in substantial growth in our profitability overall compared to the fourth quarter last year. I am pleased to report another quarter of significant earnings per share growth. Excluding special items, our EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.83, up about 19% from the fourth quarter of 2009. Most importantly, we generated operating cash flow of almost $400 million in the quarter. Gracia will discuss our quarterly results in more detail in just a moment.
But before that, let me raise a few things that I want to discuss about our strategic initiatives in more detail, the three key actions that reflect our commitment to enhancing and customizing our marketing solutions for advertisers to help their businesses grow, extending our reach and broadening our engagement in our local markets and delivering content on any platform consumers want, anywhere they want it. 
Our partnership with Yahoo! is a great example of our ability to adapt to changing advertiser choices and customizing our advertisers solutions to help their business. In this environment, it is critically important for us to have Digital solutions for advertisers in our local markets, and Yahoo! enhances the digital alternatives turn it did for our marketing and sales team. 
To be clear, the partnership with Yahoo! leverages the strength of our local market presence, our trusted brands and our local advertising relationships with Yahoo!'s audience and display advertising leadership. With Yahoo!, we have a significant competitive advantage in our markets. We can offer our advertisers unmatched audience reach and the ability to target their customers precisely based on attributes like demography, geography and behavior. Thus far, the partnership is working as planned. In U.S. Community Publishing, 39 sites have rollout Yahoo and several other sites will be completed by the end of March. Our local Digital sales teams have started the remaining launches.
In Broadcasting, all seven of our targeted markets have launched Yahoo! The final market, KPNX, launched about two weeks ago with the Arizona Republic. Building on our already strong presence in our local TV markets is a top priority for our Broadcasting management team. As we have reported in the past, we have partnered with DataSphere to launch hyper-local sites in an effort to deliver localized content to our consumers and a digital ad solution to small local businesses, something that we have not offered in the past. 
Our final market, Sacramento, launched January 20 with 30 sites. That brings our total to 264 hyper-local neighborhood websites that have been launched in 10 markets. We are showing month-over-month growth in page views per neighborhood site. 
To further drive audits gains, we are rolling out marketing initiatives. We have delivered over 1.9 million total community site page views and 30,000 stories published to community sites across our nine markets in 2010.  Revenue associated with DataSphere is running ahead of projections. 
We are launching a similar local focus effort in U.S. Community Publishing for classified employment. As I noted, a bright spot and our results for almost the entire year has been our classified employment growth of 10% in our local markets. To further that success, USCP news, advertising and Digital department introduced a division-wide initiative to foster employment growth in our local communities. 
At local sites, employment advertising has been moved to the main section of the newspaper, elevating its profile. It has a new banner and page layout and is coupled with related content from CareerBuilder. On Sundays during the first quarter, newsroom stories will explore hard job growth can be stimulated. Many sites have one major reporting projects with other sites that are partnering with community agencies to hold public forums and creating state-wide collaborative projects. We continue to deliver strong content that is trusted and relevant. USCP also focused on growing paid Sunday home delivery circulation by giving consumers an enhanced Sunday product and advertisers deeper reach.  Advertisers, especially national preprint advertisers, want to have their advertising in the Sunday newspaper because it's a warm, lean-forward environment, meaning consumers deeply engage with the Sunday product. Both the content, including the depth and variety and the advertising, which serves as a weekly shopping guide. 
So we decided to enrich the consumer experience even more by enhancing content and design. As a result, we have been successful promoting the benefit of Sunday home delivery. Sunday home delivery was up on average compared to 2009 for the largest 32 local products that we have. 20 sites achieved year-over-year growth on the annual average. 
Our content is valued in our local markets, and we continue to assess that value through paid content models at three of our domestic publishing sites. As Bob Dickey noted at the UBS conference, we have learned some important lessons thus far: The first is that subscriber engagement is much higher than nonsubscribers to a significant extent; second, the three sites have delivered all their local online advertising campaigns through this testing period, and overall retention rates remain strong; and finally, promotion is critical. Page view increases at each site are being driven by comprehensive promotion strategies that use several platforms, including email and social media.
The spectrum at St. George, for example, continues to show improvement in the year-over-year difference in page views since their August launch. In December, they experienced a dramatic increase, logging an 18% year-over-year increase in page views and a 7% year-over-year increase in unique visitors. The jump reflects the power of being the dominant source for news and information in a local market.
Our Digital content continues to be popular and growing, particularly, our USA TODAY news apps. Through January, our downloads totaled 7.3 million, 3.6 million for the iPhone, 1.4 million for the iPad and 2.1 million for the Android. As you can see, the Apple products account for almost 70% of the downloads. However, the Android accounted for almost half of the downloads in January.
As I am sure you are aware, mobile content consumption continues to grow, and 2010 was an absolutely huge year. More then 234 million Americans age 13 and over use mobile devices in 2010 according to ComScore, and over 30% of mobile subscribers use smartphones. And our mobile statistics reflect that growth. We experienced a significant jump in mobile page views in 2010 from USA TODAY and our local sites, up 267% to 1.6 billion. 
We also began to see signs of an emerging market for mobile advertising on both national and local levels. Obviously, the demands of mobile users are growing, and we wanted to deliver rich content and advertising that continually evolve to meet those demands. To deliver on that commitment, we announced plans last September to implement a common Gannett-wide software platform for mobile site development and hosting. USA TODAY site launched in December, and during the first quarter, we will launch over 100 sites for all local U.S. news properties across Gannett.
The sites will have a new look and feel and support on-demand video for higher-end devices, such as an iPhone. Markets will have the ability to customize their sites. As importantly, we will be enhancing these sites throughout the year. We continue to extend our strategy to make content available to consumers in any form that they want it. We announced the launch of Ongo last week. Ongo is a digital news service that provides subscribers with a new approach to reading, discovering and sharing news. The new, paid subscription service response to changing customer demand and preferences, allowing subscribers to create, customize, personalize and access the news and information that matters most to them, all in one place. On go is accessible through major web browsers on computers, smart phones and tablets, so subscribers enjoy their favorite publications on all of the devices they own for a single monthly fee. 
As you can see, we successfully executed on several initiatives throughout 2010, and their results reflect those efforts. Against the backdrop of an uneven economic recovery, we delivered sequential improvement in our total operating revenues for each quarter of this year. 
Now I'd like to briefly discuss our results by segment. For the fiscal year, earnings per share, excluding special items, was 32% higher. Our Broadcasting segment revenues were up substantially this year as expected. Our ratings for the Olympics and on election night were unparalleled, and market strength resulted in about $107 million in revenue associated with those events. 
At the same time, core advertising remains strong. We increased our retransmission revenues over 12% this year. That growth enabled us to greatly expand the profitability of our Broadcasting segment. Operating income, excluding special items, was up 50% this year compared to last and exceeded operating income on the same basis in 2008 by $20 million, even though 2008 was a presidential election year, quite an effort.
Digital segment revenues were up this year as well, and operating income, excluding special items, was about 43% higher. Results for CareerBuilder, PointRoll and ShopLocal all contributed to the profitability growth. Each business is already a leader in their respective sectors, and we expect them to continue their strong performance. 
In the Publishing segment, revenue growth is still elusive. We are not where we had liked to be, but we are working diligently to get there. We are committed to keeping our expenses in line with our revenue. We delivered on that commitment this year with the result -- was a 50% increase in operating income x special items. 
In short, we improved the profitability of each of our business segments, specifically and as a result, generated $1.3 billion in operating cash flow. Look that another way, we generated free cash flow per diluted share of $3.44 compared to $3.29 last year. We further strengthened our balance sheet through debt reduction of $710 million during 2010 and made discretionary contributions to the pension plan, totaling $130 million.
We reshaped our debt structure, and through some well executed longer-term bond issues, create an extremely manageable maturity schedule. And we ensured our financial flexibility through the extension of our revolving credit facility. 
In sum, all of our strategic efforts have enabled us to dramatically increase the results for our business. At the same time, we positioned the company for growth as a multimedia enterprise with valuable local franchises and national scale. Without a doubt, we are a much, much stronger and better company than we were just one year ago. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to Gracia."

I'll cover our quarterly results in more detail particularly each of our business segments and then some balance sheet items. 
I'd also like to echo Craig's comments. We are certainly a stronger company today than we were a year ago, and the results speak to that. We generated positive growth for our total operating revenues this quarter, which continued the sequential improvement in our year-over-year comparisons. 
On a two-year comparison basis, the improvement was significant, up nine percentage points. We managed our expenses in the quarter, continuing our efficiency efforts, and the result was a 3% reduction in operating expenses, excluding special items.
Publishing, Digital and corporate expenses were all lower, while Broadcast segment expenses were higher as expected, reflecting the substantial increase in revenue. Higher revenue and lower operating expenses overall led to substantially higher profitability. Earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis were $0.72, an increase of 33% from last year. However, excluding special items, our EPS for the quarter was $0.83 compared to $0.70 on the fourth quarter last year, a 19% increase.
We summarized the special items that we are talking about in our release this morning. They totaled approximately $40.3 million this quarter on a pretax basis. In both this year and last year, the special items were the result principally of facility consolidations and asset impairments. We also provided reconciliations of several non-GAAP items to our GAAP schedules on our release this morning as well. We sold The Honolulu Advertiser and its related assets and a small directory Publishing business in the second quarter of 2010. Results for these former properties have been reclassified to discontinued operations.
Revenue from these properties totaled approximately $30 million in the fourth quarter last year and were absent this year. These properties generated about $23 million in revenues in the first quarter of 2010. Therefore, for modeling purposes and appropriate year-over-year comparisons, you should again adjust first quarter numbers to remove those revenues from of the previously reported revenues for the first quarter of 2010. 
Now let's turn to our segment results and I'll begin with Publishing. Total revenues in there were down in the mid- single-digit reflecting the state of the domestic economy as well as the U.K.'s economic challenges, although there was sequential improvement in retail and classified. Circulation revenue and other Publishing revenue comparisons were also better than the third quarter this year. 
A significant decline in national advertising, particularly in December against difficult comp comparisons, offset positive comparisons. Revenue comparisons for the Publishing segment on a two-year basis were the best quarterly comparisons of the year and about eight percentage points better than the two-year comparison for the third quarter.
Classified advertising on a two-year comparison basis was over 14 percentage points better than the two-year comparison for the last quarter. Q2, the two-year comparisons were the best of the year. 
Domestic Publishing revenues were approximately 4% lower compared to the fourth quarter last year. Classified lagged by just 2% as the automotive and employment categories were up solidly again in the quarter, increases of 7% and 10%, respectively. That continues the positive year-over-year comparisons for those categories that were started in the second quarter this year. The real estate category reflecting continued housing challenges nationwide continued to lag.
National advertising, as I noted, was lower in the quarter. We did have stronger national advertising at our U.S. Community Publishing, but that was offset by softer ad demand at USA TODAY and its associated businesses. There was strength in the travel and financial categories there, both of which were in the top five categories in the quarter. However, several key categories lagged last year. If you exclude USA TODAY and USA WEEKEND, national advertising for the total Publishing segment was up almost 3% in the quarter.
At Newsquest, Publishing revenue was down about 5% in pounds. Comparisons, however, were about one percentage point better than the third quarter. Similar to our domestic results, circulation and other revenue category comparisons were better than the third quarter. National, unlike our domestic operations, was eight percentage points better than the third quarter comparison and down just 2% compared to the fourth quarter last year.
The economic situation in the U.K. remains a challenge as evidenced by the recent announcement that the economy contracted in the fourth quarter after a year of growth. The horrendous December weather there also had an impact. Some pundits, however, are suggesting the slowdown they indicate that consumer retrenchment and fiscal tightening are having an impact on important components of the U.K. economy, such as the construction and services sectors. We will clearly keep an eye on that, particularly as the year unfolds.
Digital advertising continues to be a significant focus for us. The growth in Digital advertising in our Publishing segment continued again this quarter and reflects those efforts. Digital advertising revenue for the U.S. Community Publishing, Newsquest and USA TODAY were all up nicely in the quarter, particularly U.S. community publishing which was up 16% and USA TODAY, which jumped 19%.
Turning to expenses, Publishing expenses, excluding special items, were down about 5% in line with revenue declines. The impact of strategic efforts to identify operating efficiencies as well as facility consolidations in previous quarters and this quarter drove the expense decrease. The decline, however, was partially offset by significantly higher newsprint expense, which was up over 18%. Higher newsprint usage prices were partially offset by a decline in consumption of about 6.5%. 
Let me say a couple of words on the current newsprint landscape. Last year, newsprint prices rose on the strength of demand and exports, but continued growth in those markets is now uncertain due to the increased offshore customer inventories. Domestic prices have been relatively stable since the second half of 2010, although an East-West regional price variance persists. Having said that, we expect newsprint usage price comparisons in the first quarter of this year to be unfavorable compared to the first quarter of 2010 when we had the lowest prices of 2010, but our consumption is expected to be lower. The connection between pricing and demand can be tenuous, suggesting that a moderate approach by producers to price recovery would support a stable environment for both industries. 
Publishing segment operating income, excluding special items, was just 2% lower in the quarter. The decline was driven principally by newsprint expense. Excluding newsprint expense and special items, operating income and cash flow would have both increased in the low single digits in the fourth quarter, compared to the fourth quarter last year. 
Now let me switch over to Broadcast. Revenue results and profitability were substantially stronger this quarter. Revenue growth of 27% reflects the strength of our local franchises. Several factors contributed to that increase: Ad demand related to November elections, which totaled approximately $52 million for the quarter; solid core advertising revenues, an increase in retransmission fees of 16% to about $16.5 million; and finally, a 44% increase in Captivate's revenue.
Although politically-related spending was strong, television advertising demand, excluding political, was up in the quarter. The increase was tempered by the displacement effect of heavy political ad demand, which I will discuss more about that in a moment. If you exclude special items, Broadcasting expenses were up about 12% in the quarter as expected, reflecting primarily higher sales and marketing costs and the ramp-up of some initiatives. Broadcasting revenue growth greatly outpaced expense increases. The result, a 47% increase in operating income, excluding special items and a 41% increase in operating cash flow on the same basis.
As Craig noted, the more suitable comparison maybe to the fourth quarter of 2008, given the level of political spending in that presidential election year. Excluding special items, we generated almost 20% more in operating income in the fourth quarter this year on an increase in total Broadcasting revenue of just 9% and lower political revenue than in 2008, which again, was a presidential election year. In short, our margins this quarter were better than the fourth quarter of 2008, reflecting the improved efficiency of our Broadcasting operations and our significant operating leverage.
Looking to the first quarter of 2011, we may face some headwinds in comparison to our combined revenue success of last year. The biggest, of course, is the Winter Olympic Games, which generated almost $19 million in ad demand on our NBC-affiliated stations. We also enjoyed election-related advertising of $3.3 million, and a little over $2 million related to the Super Bowl on our CBS stations. And as you know, the Superbowl will be on Fox this year. Still, solid core advertising in the fourth quarter and particularly for December, which was not impacted by the displacement effect of political spending, bodes well for the first quarter. Despite the level of ad revenue that will be absent relative to the first quarter last year, given current trends, we expect total television revenues to be up in the very low single digits.
While the Broadcasting segment had an outstanding quarter, our Digital segment also generated much higher profitability from a 5% increase in revenues. The revenue increase was due principally to higher revenues at CareerBuilder. Operating expenses in the Digital segment overall were tightly managed and as a result, Digital segment operating income, excluding special items, totaled approximately $38 million, an increase from the fourth quarter last year of over 45%. Operating cash flow in the same basis was up significantly as well, about 31%. Digital advertising revenue company-wide was over $271 million in the quarter and 10% higher than in the fourth quarter last year, as each business segment increased their digital revenues. 
Now let me turn quickly to the balance sheet. As we previously announced, we completed a bond financing at the beginning of the quarter. These transactions in addition to our debt reduction, had an impact on our interest expense. Interest expense was up about $1.5 million in the quarter, reflecting significantly lower average debt balances but also a higher average interest rate due to these longer-term fixed rate debt issuances.
As a reminder, we also extended our revolving credit facilities. Total commitments under the amended facilities are now $1.63 billion through March 15, 2012, and total extended commitments from the middle of March 2012 to the end of September 2014 will be $1.14 billion, more than ample capacity. As Craig noted, the combined impact of these transactions is significant. We again have created the debt maturity profile that is easily manageable as well as the financial flexibility to invest in our businesses, explore opportunities and better position the company for future growth.
As we have noted, we generated significantly more cash flow this quarter than in the fourth quarter last year. We used a portion of it to reduce debt by about $67 million. We also made a $100 million pretax voluntary contribution to our pension plan in the quarter, bringing those contributions to $130 million in total. We also had a strong investment performance in the plan, which all resulted in a substantial improvement in the funded status of the plan.
So taking all of that into consideration, long-term debt at the end of the year was $2.35 billion, and cash totaled $183 million. At this point, our all-in-cost debt is approximately 6.8%, including the impact of the new debt I noted. And our debt-to-EBITDA covenant at the end of the period was again below 2x. One final financial item, capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $32 million, bringing the total for the year to $69 million. 
So in summary, the fourth quarter capped a year of improving results for the Gannett Co. Revenues overall were positive compared to last year's fourth quarter and completed the run of sequential improvement for the year. And we maintained our focus on restructuring our cost base. The operating leverage created as a result dramatically improved the profitability of our company.
And as Craig mentioned, we further strengthened our balance sheet. We at Gannett are well-positioned to adapt to the evolving media landscape and the prospect of a firmer economy in the year ahead. 
And with that, we will open it up for questions. Sarah?"

Actually, taking a look at, for instance, in the classified area, for the quarter, while overall rates were down in the very, very low single digits, we did have some bright spots, for instance, in automotive and employment, which we indicated there were volume gains and revenue gains. And we also saw rates increase in those two categories. In real estate, obviously, that continues to be more challenged. We didn't have that kind of a rate pickup. So I'd say that it is a combination more, I think, strongly focused on the volume side than on the rate side, Craig. And as to circulation, morning circulation was down about 4.1% in the quarter. Sunday, down a little over 3%. And at USA TODAY, within a few thousand copies of being flat with last year.

Other than in national, we are very  much in line with all of the numbers that we showed at UBS.

On one hand, we see some numbers and statistics that would suggest that things are picking up more than what it appears in the marketplace. And then in other areas, for instance, in retail sales, while there was a fairly powerful spending done around Thanksgiving, it seemed as though the consumers tightened up in their pocketbooks in the month of December. And retails sales in some situations were not quite as robust as those Thanksgiving numbers would have suggested they might be. So I think in total, I think there's still a lot of uncertainty surrounding the economy. I think there's a lot of concern about what's going to happen to the municipalities and the states and the talk surrounding potential bankruptcies and the like. And that, obviously, can have an impact on what goes on in the community if jobs are at stake as a result of municipalities cutting back, et cetera. So I think it's kind of similar to what we've said all along, which is that we've never seen an economic recovery that's gone in a straight line. There have always been those moments where fears take hold and then exuberance takes hold and then you continue to go back-and-forth as each number comes out and each new thing pops up. But I think, overall, we're real pleased with what we accomplished, both for the year and for the fourth quarter. We'll see how the economy zigs and zags as we get into 2011 in a more meaningful way. And we'll do what is necessary to produce strong results. Obviously, in the U.K., a little bit of a different scenario with the contraction in the economy there in the fourth quarter after four quarters of growth. And they've certainly taken a different position on retrenchment in government spending and the like than we have in the U.S, thus far. So we're going to have to see how that all plays out. But we will keep you posted, and we'll share with you anything that we see, either positive or negative."

We are pleased with the positive results that we delivered for the fourth quarter and full year. We recognized that the media landscape was changing and that we would need to take proactive measures to ensure that Gannet is best positioned to adapt to the changing environment and continues to operate successfully. Over the last year, we have strengthened our balance sheet and enhanced our financial flexibility, created and customized attractive multi-platform content for our customers, improved our production and distribution functions, enhanced our local market presence in both our Publishing and Broadcast segments and restructured costs and created efficiencies throughout the organization, among others. As a result of our actions, we have improved the profitability of each of our business segments and generated operating cash flow of $1.3 billion this year, despite the challenging operating environment. 
Now let me turn to the fourth quarter results. Our fourth quarter results reflect another quarter of significantly better profitability and overall revenue growth. Our Broadcasting and Digital segment revenue growth was higher compared to last year, dramatically higher in the case of Broadcasting. We progressed on the year-over-year comparisons in our Publishing segment, although our results mirrored the state of the economy here and in the U.K. Domestically, results were strong in auto and employment, while real estate continued to show slower growth. 
In the U.K., operating environment remains very challenging for us. Our focus on strategically identifying efficiency opportunities resulted in substantial growth in our profitability overall, compared to the fourth quarter last year. I am pleased to report another quarter of significant earnings per share growth. Excluding special items, our EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.83, up about 19% from the fourth quarter of 2009. Most importantly, we generated operating cash flow of almost $400 million in the quarter. Gracia will discuss our quarterly results in more detail in just a moment. But before that, let me raise a few things that I want to discuss about our strategic initiatives in more detail.
The three key actions that reflect our commitment to enhancing and customizing our marketing solutions for advertisers to help their businesses grow, extending our reach and broadening our engagement in our local markets and delivering content on any platform consumers want, anywhere they want it. 
Our partnership with Yahoo! is a great example of our ability to adapt to changing advertiser choices and customizing our advertisers' solutions to help their business. In this environment, it is critically important for us to have digital solutions for advertisers in our local markets, and Yahoo! enhances the digital alternatives for our marketing and sales teams.  
To be clear, the partnership with Yahoo! leverages the strength of our local market presence, our trusted brands and our local advertising relationships with Yahoo!'s audience and display advertising leadership. With Yahoo!, we have a significant competitive advantage in our markets. We can offer our advertisers unmatched audience reach and the ability to target their customers precisely, based on attributes like demography, geography and behavior. Thus far, the partnership is working as planned. In U.S. Community Publishing, 39 sites have rolled out Yahoo! and several other sites will be completed by the end of March. Our local Digital sales teams have started the remaining launches.
In Broadcasting, all seven of our targeted markets have launched Yahoo! The final market, KPNX, launched about two weeks ago with The Arizona Republic. Building on our already strong presence in our local TV markets is a top priority for our Broadcasting management team. As we have reported in the past, we have partnered with DataSphere to launch hyper-local sites in an effort to deliver localized content to our consumers and a digital ad solution to small local businesses, something that we have not offered in the past. 
Our final market, Sacramento, launched January 20 with 30 sites. That brings our total to 264 hyper-local neighborhood websites that have been launched in 10 markets. We are showing month-over-month growth in page views per neighborhood site. 
To further drive audience gains, we are rolling out marketing initiatives. We have delivered over 1.9 million total community site page views and 30,000 stories published to community sites across our nine markets in 2010.  Revenue associated with DataSphere is running ahead of projections. 
We are launching a similar local focus effort in U.S. Community Publishing for classified employment. As I noted, a bright spot in our results for almost the entire year has been our classified employment growth of 10% in our local markets. To further that success, USCP news, advertising and Digital department introduced a division-wide initiative to foster employment growth in our local communities. 
At local sites, employment advertising has been moved to the main section of the newspaper, elevating its profile. It has a new banner and page layout and is coupled with related content from CareerBuilder. On Sundays during the first quarter, newsroom stories will explore how job growth can be stimulated. Many sites have planned major reporting projects with other sites that are partnering with community agencies to hold public forums and creating statewide collaborative projects. We continue to deliver strong content that is trusted and relevant. USCP also focused on growing paid Sunday home delivery circulation by giving consumers an enhanced Sunday product and advertisers deeper reach.  Advertisers, especially national preprint advertisers, want to have their advertising in the Sunday newspaper because it's a warm, lean-forward environment, meaning consumers deeply engage with the Sunday product; both the content, including the depth and variety and the advertising, which serves as a weekly shopping guide. So we decided to enrich the consumer experience even more by enhancing content and design. As a result, we have been successful promoting the benefit of Sunday home delivery. Sunday home delivery was up on average compared to 2009 for the largest 32 local products that we have. 20 sites achieved year-over-year growth on the annual average. 
Our content is valued in our local markets, and we continue to assess that value through paid content models at three of our domestic publishing sites. As Bob Dickey noted at the UBS conference, we have learned some important lessons thus far: The first is that subscriber engagement is much higher than nonsubscribers to a significant extent; second, the three sites have delivered all their local online advertising campaigns through this testing period, and overall retention rates remain strong; and finally, promotion is critical. Page view increases at each site are being driven by comprehensive promotion strategies that use several platforms, including email and social media.
The spectrum at St. George, for example, continues to show improvement in the year-over-year difference in page views since their August launch. In December, they experienced a dramatic increase, logging an 18% year-over-year increase in page views and a 7% year-over-year increase in unique visitors. The jump reflects the power of being the dominant source for news and information in a local market.
Our Digital content continues to be popular and growing, particularly our USA TODAY news apps. Through January, our downloads totaled 7.3 million, 3.6 million for the iPhone, 1.4 million for the iPad and 2.1 million for the Android. As you can see, the Apple products account for almost 70% of the downloads. However, the Android accounted for almost half of the downloads in January.
As I am sure you are aware, mobile content consumption continues to grow, and 2010 was an absolutely huge year. More then 234 million Americans age 13 and over use mobile devices in 2010 according to ComScore, and over 30% of mobile subscribers use smartphones, and our mobile statistics reflect that growth. We experienced a significant jump in mobile page views in 2010 from USA TODAY and our local sites, up 267% to 1.6 billion. 
We also began to see signs of an emerging market for mobile advertising on both national and local levels. Obviously, the demands of mobile users are growing, and we want to deliver rich content and advertising that continually evolve to meet those demands. To deliver on that commitment, we announced plans last September to implement a common Gannett-wide software platform for mobile site development and hosting. USA TODAY site launched in December and during the first quarter, we will launch over 100 sites for all local U.S. news properties across Gannett.
The sites will have a new look and feel and support on-demand video for higher-end devices, such as an iPhone. Markets will have the ability to customize their sites. As importantly, we will be enhancing these sites throughout the year. We continue to extend our strategy to make content available to consumers in any form that they want it. We announced the launch of Ongo last week. Ongo is a digital news service that provides subscribers with a new approach to reading, discovering and sharing news. The new, paid subscription service responds to changing customer demand and preferences, allowing subscribers to create, customize, personalize and access the news and information that matters most to them, all in one place. Ongo is accessible through major web browsers on computers, smart phones and tablets, so subscribers enjoy their favorite publications on all of the devices they own for a single monthly fee. 
As you can see, we successfully executed on several initiatives throughout 2010, and their results reflect those efforts. Against the backdrop of an uneven economic recovery, we delivered sequential improvement in our total operating revenues for each quarter of this year. 
Now I'd like to briefly discuss our results by segment. For the fiscal year, earnings per share, excluding special items, was 32% higher. Our Broadcasting segment revenues were up substantially this year, as expected. Our ratings for the Olympics and on election night were unparalleled, and market strength resulted in about $107 million in revenue associated with those events. 
At the same time, core advertising remains strong. We increased our retransmission revenues over 12% this year. That growth enabled us to greatly expand the profitability of our Broadcasting segment. Operating income, excluding special items, was up 50% this year compared to last and exceeded operating income on the same basis in 2008 by $20 million, even though 2008 was a presidential election year. Quite an effort.
Digital segment revenues were up this year as well, and operating income, excluding special items, was about 43% higher. Results for CareerBuilder, PointRoll and ShopLocal all contributed to the profitability growth. Each business is already a leader in their respective sectors, and we expect them to continue their strong performance. 
In the Publishing segment, revenue growth is still elusive. We are not where we'd like to be, but we are working diligently to get there. We are committed to keeping our expenses in line with our revenue. We delivered on that commitment this year with the result -- was a 50% increase in operating income x special items. 
In short, we improved the profitability of each of our business segments, specifically and as a result generated $1.3 billion in operating cash flow. Looked at another way, we generated free cash flow per diluted share of $3.44, compared to $3.29 last year. We further strengthened our balance sheet through debt reduction of $710 million during 2010 and made discretionary contributions to the pension plan totaling $130 million.
We reshaped our debt structure and through some well-executed longer-term bond issues, created an extremely manageable maturity schedule. And we ensured our financial flexibility through the extension of our revolving credit facility. 
In sum, all of our strategic efforts have enabled us to dramatically increase the results of our business. At the same time, we positioned the company for growth as a multimedia enterprise with valuable local franchises and national scale. Without a doubt, we are a much, much stronger and better company than we were just one year ago. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to Gracia."
20571,118431282,97340,"Gannett Co., Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2011",2011-01-31,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Craig. I'll cover our quarterly results in more detail, particularly each of our business segments, and then some balance sheet items. I'd also like to echo Craig's comments. We are certainly a stronger company today than we were a year ago, and",2041,"Thanks, Craig. I'll cover our quarterly results in more detail, particularly each of our business segments, and then some balance sheet items. 
I'd also like to echo Craig's comments. We are certainly a stronger company today than we were a year ago, and the results speak to that. We generated positive growth for our total operating revenues this quarter, which continued the sequential improvement in our year-over-year comparisons. 
On a two-year comparison basis, the improvement was significant, up nine percentage points. We managed our expenses in the quarter, continuing our efficiency efforts, and the result was a 3% reduction in operating expenses, excluding special items.
Publishing, Digital and corporate expenses were all lower, while Broadcast segment expenses were higher, as expected, reflecting the substantial increase in revenue. Higher revenue and lower operating expenses overall led to substantially higher profitability. Earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis were $0.72, an increase of 33% from last year. However, excluding special items, our EPS for the quarter was $0.83, compared to $0.70 in the fourth quarter last year, a 19% increase.
We summarized the special items that we are talking about in our release this morning. They totaled approximately $40.3 million this quarter on a pretax basis. In both this year and last year, the special items were the result principally of facility consolidations and asset impairments. We also provided reconciliations of several non-GAAP items to our GAAP schedules in our release this morning as well. We sold The Honolulu Advertiser and its related assets and a small directory publishing business in the second quarter of 2010. Results for these former properties have been reclassified to discontinued operations.
Revenue from these properties totaled approximately $30 million in the fourth quarter last year and were absent this year. These properties generated about $23 million in revenues in the first quarter of 2010. Therefore, for modeling purposes and appropriate year-over-year comparisons, you should again adjust first quarter numbers to remove those revenues from of the previously reported revenues for the first quarter of 2010. 
Now let's turn to our segment results and I'll begin with Publishing. Total revenues there were down in the mid- single-digits, reflecting the state of the domestic economy as well as the U.K.'s economic challenges, although there was sequential improvement in retail and classified. Circulation revenue and other Publishing revenue comparisons were also better than the third quarter this year. 
A significant decline in national advertising, particularly in December against difficult comp comparisons, offset positive comparisons. Revenue comparisons for the Publishing segment on a two-year basis were the best quarterly comparisons of the year and about eight percentage points better than the two-year comparison for the third quarter.
Classified advertising on a two-year comparison basis was over 14 percentage points better than the two-year comparison for the last quarter. Hereto, the two-year comparisons were the best of the year. 
Domestic Publishing revenues were approximately 4% lower compared to the fourth quarter last year. Classified lagged by just 2%, as the automotive and employment categories were up solidly again in the quarter, increases of 7% and 10%, respectively. That continues the positive year-over-year comparisons for those categories that were started in the second quarter this year. The real estate category reflecting continued housing challenges nationwide continued to lag.
National advertising, as I noted, was lower in the quarter. We did have stronger national advertising at our U.S. Community Publishing, but that was offset by softer ad demand at USA TODAY and its associated businesses. There was strength in the travel and financial categories there, both of which were in the top five categories in the quarter. However, several key categories lagged last year. If you exclude USA TODAY and USA WEEKEND, national advertising for the total Publishing segment was up almost 3% in the quarter.
At Newsquest, Publishing revenue was down about 5% in pounds. Comparisons, however, were about one percentage point better than the third quarter. Similar to our domestic results, circulation and other revenue category comparisons were better than the third quarter. National, unlike our domestic operations, was eight percentage points better than the third quarter comparison and down just 2% compared to the fourth quarter last year.
The economic situation in the U.K. remains a challenge, as evidenced by the recent announcement that the economy contracted in the fourth quarter after a year of growth. The horrendous December weather there also had an impact. Some pundits, however, are suggesting the slowdown may indicate the consumer retrenchment and fiscal tightening are having an impact on important components of the U.K. economy, such as the construction and services sectors. We will clearly keep an eye on that, particularly as the year unfolds.
Digital advertising continues to be a significant focus for us. The growth in Digital advertising in our Publishing segment continued again this quarter and reflects those efforts. Digital advertising revenue for the U.S. Community Publishing, Newsquest and USA TODAY were all up nicely in the quarter, particularly U.S. Community Publishing, which was up 16%, and USA TODAY, which jumped 19%.
Turning to expenses. Publishing expenses, excluding special items, were down about 5%, in line with revenue declines. The impact of strategic efforts to identify operating efficiencies, as well as facility consolidations in previous quarters and this quarter drove the expense decrease. The decline, however, was partially offset by significantly higher newsprint expense, which was up over 18%. Higher newsprint usage prices were partially offset by a decline in consumption of about 6.5%. 
Let me say a couple of words on the current newsprint landscape. Last year, newsprint prices rose on the strength of demand and exports, but continued growth in those markets is now uncertain due to the increased offshore customer inventories. Domestic prices have been relatively stable since the second half of 2010, although an East-West regional price variance persists. Having said that, we expect newsprint usage price comparisons in the first quarter of this year to be unfavorable, compared to the first quarter of 2010 when we had the lowest prices of 2010, but our consumption is expected to be lower. The connection between pricing and demand can be tenuous, suggesting that a moderate approach by producers to price recovery would support a stable environment for both industries. 
Publishing segment operating income, excluding special items, was just 2% lower in the quarter. The decline was driven principally by newsprint expense. Excluding newsprint expense and special items, operating income and cash flow would have both increased in the low single digits in the fourth quarter, compared to the fourth quarter last year. 
Now let me switch over to Broadcast. Revenue results and profitability were substantially stronger this quarter. Revenue growth of 27% reflects the strength of our local franchises. Several factors contributed to that increase: Ad demand related to the November elections, which totaled approximately $52 million for the quarter; solid core advertising revenues, an increase in retransmission fees of 16% to about $16.5 million; and finally, a 44% increase in Captivate's revenue.
Although politically related spending was strong, television advertising demand, excluding political, was up in the quarter. The increase was tempered by the displacement effect of heavy political ad demand, which I'll discuss more about that in a moment. If you exclude special items, Broadcasting expenses were up about 12% in the quarter as expected, reflecting primarily higher sales and marketing costs and the ramp of some initiatives. Broadcasting revenue growth greatly outpaced expense increases. The result, a 47% increase in operating income, excluding special items, and a 41% increase in operating cash flow on the same basis.
As Craig noted, the more suitable comparison may be to the fourth quarter of 2008, given the level of political spending in that presidential election year. Excluding special items, we generated almost 20% more in operating income in the fourth quarter this year on an increase in total Broadcasting revenue of just 9% and lower political revenue than in 2008, which again, was a presidential election year. In short, our margins this quarter were better than the fourth quarter of 2008, reflecting the improved efficiency of our Broadcasting operations and our significant operating leverage.
Looking to the first quarter of 2011, we may face some headwinds in comparison to our combined revenue success of last year. The biggest, of course, is the Winter Olympic Games, which generated almost $19 million in ad demand on our NBC-affiliated stations. We also enjoyed election-related advertising of $3.3 million, and a little over $2 million related to the Super Bowl on our CBS stations. And as you know, the Superbowl will be on Fox this year. Still, solid core advertising in the fourth quarter and particularly for December, which was not impacted by the displacement effect of political spending, bodes well for the first quarter. Despite the level of ad revenue that will be absent relative to the first quarter last year, given current trends, we expect total television revenues to be up in the very low single digits.
While the Broadcasting segment had an outstanding quarter, our Digital segment also generated much higher profitability from a 5% increase in revenues. The revenue increase was due principally to higher revenues at CareerBuilder. Operating expenses in the Digital segment overall were tightly managed and as a result, Digital segment operating income, excluding special items, totaled approximately $38 million, an increase from the fourth quarter last year of over 45%. Operating cash flow in the same basis was up significantly as well, about 31%. Digital advertising revenue company-wide was over $271 million in the quarter and 10% higher than in the fourth quarter last year, as each business segment increased their digital revenues. 
Now let me turn quickly to the balance sheet. As we previously announced, we completed a bond financing at the beginning of the quarter. These transactions, in addition to our debt reduction, had an impact on our interest expense. Interest expense was up about $1.5 million in the quarter, reflecting significantly lower average debt balances, but also a higher average interest rate due to these longer-term fixed rate debt issuances.
As a reminder, we also extended our revolving credit facilities. Total commitments under the amended facilities are now $1.63 billion through March 15, 2012, and total extended commitments from the middle of March 2012 to the end of September 2014 will be $1.14 billion, more than ample capacity. As Craig noted, the combined impact of these transactions is significant. We again have created a debt maturity profile that is easily manageable, as well as the financial flexibility to invest in our businesses, explore opportunities and better position the company for future growth.
As we have noted, we generated significantly more cash flow this quarter than in the fourth quarter last year. We used a portion of it to reduce debt by about $67 million. We also made a $100 million pretax voluntary contribution to our pension plan in the quarter, bringing those contributions to $130 million in total. We also had a strong investment performance in the plan, which all resulted in a substantial improvement in the funded status of the plan.
So taking all of that into consideration, long-term debt at the end of the year was $2.35 billion, and cash totaled $183 million. At this point, our all-in-cost of debt is approximately 6.8%, including the impact of the new debt I noted. And our debt-to-EBITDA covenant at the end of the period was again below 2x. One final financial item, capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $32 million, bringing the total for the year to $69 million. 
So in summary, the fourth quarter capped a year of improving results for the Gannett Co. Revenues overall were positive compared to last year's fourth quarter and completed the run of sequential improvement for the year. And we maintained our focus on restructuring our cost base. The operating leverage created as a result dramatically improved the profitability of our company and as Craig mentioned, we further strengthened our balance sheet. We at Gannett are well positioned to adapt to the evolving media landscape and the prospect of a firmer economy in the year ahead. 
And with that, we will open it up for questions. Sarah?"

So at this point, those initiatives I think are paying off not only in the number of users from a unique standpoint but as well, as Gracia said, we're seeing the pickup both in the top and bottom line."

But for Q4, we did see -- with travel, there were some very positive increases there. The FICAT, which is financial and insurance, also had a good number, and credit cards was a pretty good solid number as well.

I think there was a lot of significant spending in that category towards the end of the fourth quarter of 2009, and we saw a diminishment, particularly in that particular category, so that one had an outsized impact on the numbers. But I would say, Doug, that when you look at what we provided at UBS in terms of expectations -- or not expectations, but in fact were we stood at the end of the first two months of the quarter. Other than in national, we are very much in line with all of the numbers that we showed at UBS. So I think the only real surprise might have been a little bit of a weakness in national, which really gained a little momentum in period '12, again as I mentioned, which was a little stronger for us in period '12 of '09 when there was some budget opportunities that came up.

On one hand, we see some numbers and statistics that would suggest that things are picking up more than what it appears in the marketplace. And then in other areas, for instance in retail sales, while there was a fairly powerful spending done around Thanksgiving, it seemed as though the consumers tightened up in their pocketbooks in the month of December. And retails sales in some situations were not quite as robust as those Thanksgiving numbers would have suggested they might be. So I think in total, I think there's still a lot of uncertainty surrounding the economy. I think there's a lot of concern about what's going to happen to the municipalities and the states and the talk surrounding potential bankruptcies and the like. And that, obviously, can have an impact on what goes on in the community if jobs are at stake as a result of municipalities cutting back, et cetera. So I think it's kind of similar to what we've said all along, which is that we've never seen an economic recovery that's gone in a straight line. There have always been those moments where fears take hold and then exuberance takes hold and then you continue to go back-and-forth as each number comes out and each new thing pops up. But I think overall, we're real pleased with what we accomplished, both for the year and for the fourth quarter. We'll see how the economy zigs and zags as we get into 2011 in a more meaningful way. And we'll do what is necessary to produce strong results. Obviously, in the U.K., a little bit of a different scenario with the contraction in the economy there in the fourth quarter after four quarters of growth. And they've certainly taken a little bit of a different position on retrenchment in government spending and the like than we have in the U.S, thus far. So we're going to have to see how that all plays out. But we will keep you posted, and we'll share with you anything that we see, either positive or negative."

As Gracia noted, we've provided a thorough update at the MEANY presentations, and our results are very much in-line with the expectations we shared then. Earnings per diluted share adjusted for special items were $0.41 for the quarter, Digital segment revenue growth was up 12% as stronger online employment add demand positively impacted the results at. Digital revenue companywide was over 12% higher, as well reflecting a cross-platform sales initiatives. Our Publishing segment revenue results lag last year by 6%, reflecting the current state of a domestic economy. However, we had strength in Auto and Employment. 
Softness in certain sectors persist particularly real estate here in the U.S. and more broadly in the U.K. Broadcasting segment revenues were down just $3.6 million, reflecting the challenge of overcoming our own success last year of over $24 million in Olympic, Super Bowl and political spending. Core TV advertising growth was solid as was growth in retransmission fees and Digital revenue and Broadcasting segment. Excluding the incremental impact of the event that benefited last year's revenue, total television revenues were up significantly. We're very pleased with the core growth in television. 
Our total revenues were down about 4%. Our expenses were lower overall reflecting our continuing efforts to create efficiencies across the company, particularly in Publishing. All of our businesses were solidly profitable in the quarter. We generated free cash flow of $216 million and we reduced our debt by over $160 million despite challenges to revenue growth. 
Bennett has changed dramatically over the last few years as you have seen. We have changed the way we gather and distribute content. We have successfully expanded our presence in our markets, both locally and nationally through multiple platforms and devices. We are changing the way we sell in those markets to take advantage of that expanded reach. The natural next step in the process was to launch our first corporate brand and national advertising campaign. Our new logo and tagline, ""It's All Within Reach,"" highlight our ability to deliver content to consumers anyway they want to access it. The use of new platforms and devices are growing everyday, and we are expanding along with that by continuing to extend our reach from Print and Broadcast to Online to Mobile and Portable. 
For our Advertising customers and businesses, we are able to bring solutions to them that will help them grow. We are transforming in our current and our potential customers will benefit from the changes that have made. Our brand campaign is an integrated, B-to-B effort, targeting the advertising, marketing and financial communities. Feedback has been positive. We believe it is critical that advertisers understand the scope and the power of our brand and all that we offer. 
We also further strengthened our management team with two key appointments. We have added as Chief Marketing officer and David Payne as our Chief Digital Officer. Both individuals are industry leaders and we are extremely pleased to have them both on board. We are certain that their experience and insights will help guide and shape our efforts as we continue our progress. 
Changing our sales culture to focus on solutions-based selling across all platforms continues to be a key priority for us. Gannett client solutions teams are getting momentum as they collaborate the local markets sales teams to target the highest potential accounts those the currently have limited or no advertising with our local media organizations. We have made significant progress and they are continuing to build their pipelines of business. 
In U.S. Community Publishing, we continue to make strides to support our vision for a world-class sales operation. In the second quarter, we will begin implementing the longer-term components in our top markets. These include installing CRM software and a new pipeline management process to help manage sales relationships. We are also realigning the sales organization. 
Also important to our success is our ability to deliver Digital solutions that are integrated, as well as affordable and efficient to every advertiser in our local markets. Our alliance with Yahoo! extends our digital reach of consumers to an average of 80% in local markets selling Yahoo!'s local inventory in addition to our own. We have launched in all of our USCP markets. Our local sales organizations are leveraging this extended reach to more effectively sell and compete on behavioral, demographic and geographic levels. We are performing ahead of our launch goals and continue to see more opportunities here. 
In addition, as a result, this quarter reflect, we have been particularly successful with classified verticals like automotive and employment. Gracia will go into that in more detail in just a few moments. Coupon-related products have gotten a fair amount of media attention as of late. Over the past year, several Gannett properties have created new social commerce products that use the collective buying power to get great details for consumers and traffics for local merchants. This business is a great fit for our company because of our brands and our strong relationships with our businesses and consumers. 
In September last year, the Arizona Republic launched dealchicken.com, a daily deal site similar to Groupon and LivingSocial. This site has grown quickly since then in terms of both audience and revenue. Similarly in October 2010, Clipper Magazine launched its Double-Take deals online coupon product. Double-Take deals is experiencing good success and is now live across 450 magazines in 31 states. We are now extending the daily deals concept companywide to build on the success of these local offerings. Our unique value proposition in our local market allows us to achieve efficiencies through centralization. We will be rolling out the DealChicken product in 57 of our large and medium-sized Publishing and Broadcast markets by year's end. With both DealChicken and Double-Take deals a key differentiator for Gannett is our ability to tie the discount offers to several other types of local marketing products, which, together, will deliver a much more robust campaign in order to build repeat business for our Advertising customers. 
In our Broadcasting segment, we continue to extend the reach of our strong television brands in our local markets through Yahoo!, as well as local community sites. We are leveraging the strength of our own sales force with Yahoo!. Our initial seven Yahoo! broadcast markets have launched. Based on our is solid performance to date, Yahoo! has opened up two additional rollout markets. At the same time, we have access to a telesales staff in our hyper local community sites. We are exceeding launch revenue growth across nine markets. We went live in our final market in January and now have 264 community sites across 10 markets. 
During the quarter, we exceeded our first quarter revenue plan and delivered $3.2 million total community site pages, growing approximately 88% from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter. All of these efforts help drive an increase of almost 20% in Television Digital Advertising in the quarter, and we continue to explore other initiative. We are ramping up our social media efforts, including Twitter and Facebook, which are becoming even more important tools for gathering and distributing content. Overall, the continued strength of our local news ratings, which is central to our television strategy, combined with firmer ad demand for key categories, which resulted in solid revenue growth and core advertising this quarter. Gracia will discuss that in a little more detail in just a moment. 
Employment is another bright spot in our results and for the economy as a whole. CareerBuilder benefited from that strength as revenue growth both domestically and internationally resulted in a substantial increase in Digital segment revenue. Digital revenue in both Publishing and Broadcasting were up significantly as well. Overall, digital revenue, company-wide, increased over 12% as I noted and totaled over $250 million and a 20% of total revenue, which is typically our smallest quarter. The focus on Digital, continues with the proliferation of devices and changing media consumption. We need to be in the best position possible to harness all of the touch points we have with online and mobile users. 
More than 100 of Gannett redesigned online mobile media sites launched locally and nationally last month. The redesign, delivers richer content and supports on-demand video and significantly enhances the consumer experience. The new enhancements also enable business customers to effectively extend the reach of their campaigns across USATODAY.com, and Gannett's local markets nationwide by standardizing ad units across the sites. We are pleased with the early results as a 30-day internal study indicated video viewership total visitors and page views all increased. Each of the initiatives noted here reflect our effort to change as media consumption evolves and people are beginning to take notice. 
Recently, paid content ranked its top 50 most successful digital media companies in the U.S. and Gannett was 12th. We continue to leverage the unique assets we have at the Gannett company, to enhance content distribution on any platform. We are quickly ramping up our ability to achieve even greater success, selling across those platforms. That is crucial as we position the company for future growth. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gracia."
20571,129455825,115457,"Gannett Co., Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2011",2011-04-18,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Think, Craig. Revenue results for the quarter were impacted by several as Craig noted. They reflect the general health of the economy here in the U.S. and U.K. and the uneven recovery we are experiencing. They reflected strength in some sectors, as well a",1756,"Think, Craig. Revenue results for the quarter were impacted by several as Craig noted. They reflect the general health of the economy here in the U.S. and U.K. and the uneven recovery we are experiencing. They reflected strength in some sectors, as well as continued softness in others such as real estate. 
Overall our total operating revenues were down almost 4% and totaled $1.3 billion. Reported operating expenses for the company for the quarter were down as well. As a result, the company was solidly profitable despite the challenging advertising environment, as operating income excluding special items was $192 million. 
Earnings per diluted share for the quarter on a GAAP basis were $0.37, but if you exclude those special items, earnings were $0.41 per share. We detailed the special items in the release this morning. In summary in the first quarter, they totaled approximately $14 million pretax. Approximately $8 million was due to facility consolidations and $6 million pretax as a result of workforce restructuring. 
We provided reconciliations of those several non-GAAP items to our GAAP schedules in our release this morning as well. As you may recall, we sold The Honolulu Advertiser and its related assets in a small directory publishing in the second quarter of last year. Results for this pro forma properties have been reclassified to discontinued operations. Revenues from those properties totaled approximately $23 million in the first quarter last year. Of course, we cycle those events next quarter. 
So looking at each of our segments in a little more detail, total Publishing segment revenues were just over 6% lower. They reflect continuing strength in the Auto and Employment in the U.S., however, that was offset by softer ad demand in certain sectors, most notably real estate domestically, and over all in the U.K.. 
Severe weather in the Northeast, the South and in the U.K., as well as a later Easter this year, also impacted results. Revenues for our domestic Publishing operations declined 6.5%. Classified Advertising, however, improved sequentially within the quarter and was down about 3% for the quarter and was down just 2% in March. The Automotive and Employment categories continued the positive runs that began four quarters ago. Auto Advertising was up 6% in the quarter and employment revenue growth was also significantly higher, up over 7%. 
Hereto there was sizable sequential improvement within the quarter finishing with March over 13% higher. In real estate, year-over-year comparisons were slightly better in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter. However, the real estate category was down domestically, reflecting housing issues across the country. 
In its most recent Facebook, the FOMC noted that real estate markets for single-family homes for the most part either were little changed from low levels or continued to weaken across all districts. As we have noted in the past, we believe the real estate meltdown led the cyclical slowdown. So a complete recovery of the economy will be dependent on the real estate market that is growing, or the very least, has stabilized. 
National advertising was volatile to say the least, both here and in the U.K., with double-digit percentage points swings month-to-month. At USA TODAY, there was strength in the Telecom and Credit Card categories, while several other key categories declined compared to the first quarter last year. As a result, total National Advertising across all Publishing was down about 11% in the quarter. Retail Advertising demand was hindered by softer ad demand overall in addition to the weather in the Northeast, South and the later Easter. 
In the U.K., revenue at Newsquest was about 7% lower in pounds in the quarter. The economy there, as we noted, continues to be very fragile. Consumer confidence is subdued, as shown by retail sales which posted the worst numbers in 15 years, driven by concern about the impact of public-sector cuts. Reduced public-sector spending together with its lack of confidence, continues to affect revenues. The other revenue category, primarily commercial printing, however, continues to be a bright spot. It was up 30% for the quarter and is about 9% of their total revenues eclipsing national advertising. 
Our cross-platform sales efforts continue to take hold. U.S. Community's publishing digital revenue growth increased over 13% with key categories like Auto, Employment, National and Retail all delivering double-digit growth. And at USA Today their digital growth was 19% higher in the quarter. 
Now let me turn for a moment to expenses. Reported Publishing expenses this quarter were down about 2%. Excluding special items however, Publishing expenses were 3% lower year-over-year. Once again, the declines reflects our effort to drive efficiencies, as well as the impact to facility consolidations over the past several quarters. 
Higher newsprint costs, which were up about 12.5%, tempered the lower level of operating expenses. Significantly higher usage prices were offset partially by a declining consumption of almost 10%. 
Now let me just say a few words on the current status of the newsprint market. Newsprint shipments declined to offshore markets and domestically throughout the first quarter. While some supplier rationalizations have been announced, these adjustments are not expected to offset the cumulative effect of the current, soft market conditions. As a result, downward price pressure grew. 
At this point, however, newsprint usage price comparisons in the second quarter of 2011 are expect to be unfavorable, although not to the extent they were in the first quarter. And consumption is expected to be lower. As a result of the revenue and expense picture, Publishing segment operating income excluding special items, was about $131 million operating cash flow on a same basis totaled almost $163 million. Moving to the Broadcasting segment, again a real bright spot for us. Revenue was just $3.6 million lower in the quarter, despite the absence of $24 million of ad spending associated with several events last year. We benefited last year from $18.6 million in Olympic advertising on our NBC affiliated stations, $3.3 million in politically-related ad spending and $2.2 million in ad demand related to the Super Bowl, which this year moved to Fox from our CBS stations. 
If you exclude the incremental impact of these events, total television revenues were over 7% higher. Core advertising remains strong in the first quarter, continuing the momentum we saw last year. 
Looking at March revenue results, which were not impacted by Olympics or the Super Bowl, Core Advertising was up 5.5%, driven in part by strength in Auto. For the quarter, retransmission fees were up significantly, about 26% to $19.5 million. And Digital revenue growth in TV was up almost 28%. 
As Greg noted, effort to extend our reach through local community sites and our alliance with Yahoo! contributed to the online revenue growth. Expenses in Broadcasting were up approximately 1%. Therefore operating income totaled six of the $.5 million while operating cash flow was almost $71 million despite the revenue headwinds. 
Looking at the second quarter, comparisons again will be difficult with almost $12 million in political spending in the second quarter last year. We do, however, expect the momentum in core advertising to continue, as well as the upward trend in transferees. So based on current trends, we expect total television revenues for the second quarter to be flat, compared to the second quarter of 2010. 
Excluding the incremental impact of political spending, the percentage increase in total television revenue growth in the second quarter this year compared to last year is expected to be up in the mid-single digits. 
Now turning to the Digital segment. Revenues there were 12% higher in the quarter given primarily by higher online employment ad demand that positively impacted CareerBuilder's results. Digital segment expenses were well-managed and were up just a little over 3%. As a result, operating income was up substantially, almost fivefold to a little over $16 million from $3.4 million last year and in what has typically been the Digital segment's smallest quarter. Similarly, operating cash flow more than doubled, almost $24 million.  As Craig noted, the entire company, digital revenue told $251 million, over 12% higher and approximately 20% of total revenues. 
Turning quickly to the balance sheet, we generate about $216 million in free cash flow and we used part of that to reduce debt by $164 million. At the end of the quarter, long-term debt stood at $2.2 billion. And cash at quarter end was $142 million. Interest expense in the quarter was about $3.2 million higher year-over-year, as the sharp decline in the average debt balances was offset by higher average rates as our debt mix just to longer term straight debt. 
At this point, our all in cost of debt is approximately 7%. Our debt to EBITDA ratio at the end of the period was about 1.9x giving us tremendous financial flexibility.  One last financial item, capital expenditures in the first quarter were $12.6 million. 
Before we open the call to questions, I want to focus for a few moments on our proven ability to consistently generate free cash flow even in the most challenging economic environment. As we noted, free cash flow was $216 million. We defined that as net cash flow from operating activities, less the outlay for capital expenditures during the quarter, plus the net of payments for and proceeds from investments. We believe that our Publishing, Broadcast and Digital businesses, each quite profitable on their own, are integral parts of our business as a whole. The most fundamental economic way to understand Gannett as a whole is to understand our free cash flow, and what we have done and can do with it. We have substantially delevered the balance sheet over the past two years, from $3.8 billion of debt at the end of 2008 to $2.2 billion at the end of the quarter. And we have the financial flexibility to invest in all of our businesses, especially Digital. 
With a strong balance sheet and with more clarity on the economy, which we hope will come in the second half of the year, we will be in a better position to consider returning additional capital to shareholders through either share repurchases and/or dividends. 
So in summary, we are making dramatic changes in our ability to distribute contents across all platforms, and we improving our capability to sell across those platforms. That, combined with the earnings power of our businesses, and the financial flexibility we have to invest in future growth opportunities, puts Gannett in a unique position to grow with the changing media landscape. 
And with that, we'll open it up for questions."

As Gracia noted, we've provided a thorough update at the MEANY presentations, and our results very much are in-line with the expectations we shared then. 
Earnings per diluted share adjusted for special items were $0.41 for the quarter, Digital segment revenue growth was up 12% as stronger online employment ad  demand positively impacted the results at CareerBuilder. Digital revenue companywide was over 12% higher, as well reflecting a cross-platform sales initiatives. Our Publishing segment revenue results lag last year by 6%, reflecting the current state of a domestic economy. However, we had strength in Auto and Employment. 
Softness in certain sectors persist, particularly real estate here in the U.S. and more broadly in the U.K. Broadcasting segment revenues were down just $3.6 million, reflecting the challenge of overcoming our own success last year of over $24 million in Olympic, Super Bowl and political spending. Core TV advertising growth was solid as was growth in retransmission fees and Digital revenue and our Broadcasting segment. Excluding the incremental impact of the events that benefited last year's revenue, total television revenues were up significantly. We're very pleased with the core growth in television. 
Our total revenues were down about 4%. Our expenses were lower overall reflecting our continuing efforts to create efficiencies across the company, particularly in Publishing. All of our businesses were solidly profitable in the quarter. We generated free cash flow of $216 million and we reduced our debt by over $160 million despite challenges to revenue growth. 
Gannett has changed dramatically over the last few years as you have seen. We have changed the way we gather and distribute content. We have successfully expanded our presence in our markets, both locally and nationally through multiple platforms and devices. We are changing the way we sell in those markets to take advantage of that expanded reach. 
The natural next step in the process was to launch our first corporate brand and national advertising campaign. Our new logo and tagline, ""It's All Within Reach,"" highlight our ability to deliver content to consumers any way they want to access it. The use of new platforms and devices are growing everyday, and we are expanding along with that by continuing to extend our reach from Print and Broadcast to Online to Mobile and Portable. 
For our Advertising customers and businesses, we are able to bring solutions to them that will help them grow. We are transforming in our current and potential customers will benefit from the changes that have made. Our brand campaign is an integrated, B2B effort, targeting the advertising, marketing and financial communities. Feedback has been positive. We believe it is critical that advertisers understand the scope and the power of our brand and all that we offer. 
We also further strengthened our management team with two key appointments. We have added Maryam Banikarim as Chief Marketing Officer and David Payne as our Chief Digital Officer. Both individuals are industry leaders and we are extremely pleased to have them both on board. We are certain their experience and insights will help guide and shape our efforts as we continue our progress. 
Changing our sales culture to focus on solutions-based selling across all platforms continues to be a key priority for us. Gannett Client Solutions teams are getting momentum as they collaborate with local markets sales teams to target the highest potential accounts, those that currently have limited or no advertising with our local media organizations. We had made significant progress and they are continuing to build their pipeline of business. 
In U.S. Community Publishing, we continue to make strides to support our vision for a world-class sales operation. In the second quarter, we will begin implementing the longer-term components in our top markets. These include installing CRM software and a new pipeline management process to help manage sales relationships. We are also realigning the sales organization. 
Also important to our success is our ability to deliver Digital solutions that are integrated, as well as affordable and efficient to every advertiser in our local markets. Our alliance with Yahoo! extends our digital reach of consumers to an average of 80% in local markets selling Yahoo!'s local inventory in addition to our own. We have launched in all of our USCP markets. Our local sales organizations are leveraging this extended reach to more effectively sell and compete on behavioral, demographic and geographic levels. We are performing ahead of our launch goals and continue to see more opportunity here. 
In addition, as a result, this quarter reflect, we have been particularly successful with classified verticals like automotive and employment. Gracia will go into that in more detail in just a few moments. Coupon-related products have gotten a fair amount of media attention of late. Over the past year, several Gannett properties have created new social commerce products that use the collective buying power to get great deals for consumers and traffic for local merchants. This business is a great fit for our company because of our brands and our strong relationships with our businesses and consumers. 
In September last year, the Arizona Republic launched dealchicken.com, a daily deal site similar to Groupon and LivingSocial. This site has grown quickly since then in terms of both audience and revenue. Similarly in October 2010, Clipper Magazine launched its Double Take Deals online coupon product. 
Double Take deals is experiencing good success and is now live across 450 magazines in 31 states. We are now extending the daily deals concept companywide to build on the success of these local offerings. Our unique value proposition in our local market allows us to achieve efficiencies through centralization. We will be rolling out the Deal Chicken product in 57 of our large and medium-sized Publishing and Broadcast markets by year's end. 
With both Deal Chicken and Double Take Deals, a key differentiator for Gannett is our ability to tie the discount offers to several other types of local marketing products, which, together, will deliver a much more robust campaign in order to build repeat business for our Advertising customers. 
In our Broadcasting segment, we continue to extend the reach of our strong television brands in our local markets through Yahoo!, as well as local community sites. We are leveraging the strength of our own sales force with Yahoo!. Our initial seven Yahoo! broadcast markets have launched. Based on our solid performance to date, Yahoo! has opened up two additional rollout markets. 
At the same time, we have access to a telesales staff in our hyper local community sites. We are exceeding launch revenue goals across nine markets. We went live in our final market in January and now have 264 community sites across 10 markets. 
During the quarter, we exceeded our first quarter revenue plan and delivered $3.2 million total community site pages, growing approximately 88% from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter. All of these efforts help drive an increase of almost 28% in Television Digital Advertising in the quarter, and we continue to explore other initiatives. We are ramping up our social media efforts, including Twitter and Facebook, which are becoming even more important tools for gathering and distributing content. 
Overall, the continued strength of our local news ratings, which is central to our television strategy, combined with firmer ad demand for key categories, which resulted in solid revenue growth and core advertising this quarter. Gracia will discuss that in a little more detail in just a moment. 
Employment is another bright spot in our results and for the economy as a whole. CareerBuilder benefited from that strength as revenue growth both domestically and internationally resulted in a substantial increase in Digital segment revenue. Digital revenue in both Publishing and Broadcasting were up significantly as well. Overall, Digital revenue, companywide, increased over 12% as I noted and totaled over $250 million and a 20% of total revenues, which is typically our smallest quarter. The focus on Digital, continues with the proliferation of devices and changing media consumption. We need to be in the best position possible to harness all of the touch points we have with online and mobile users. 
More than 100 of Gannett's redesigned online mobile media sites launched locally and nationally last month. The redesign, delivers richer content and supports on-demand video and significantly enhances the consumer experience. The new enhancements also enable business customers to effectively extend the reach of their campaigns across USATODAY.com, and Gannett's local markets nationwide by standardizing ad units across the sites. 
We are pleased with the early results as a 30-day internal study indicated that video viewership, total visitors and page views all increased. Each of the initiatives noted here reflect our effort to change as media consumption evolves and people are beginning to take notice. 
Recently, paidContent ranked its top 50 Most Successful Digital Media Companies in the U.S. and Gannett was 12th. We continue to leverage the unique assets we have at the Gannett Company, to enhance content distribution on any platform. We are quickly ramping up our ability to achieve even greater success, selling across those platforms. That is crucial as we position the company for our future growth. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gracia."
20571,129455825,115469,"Gannett Co., Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2011",2011-04-18,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Craig. Revenue results for the quarter were impacted by several as Craig noted. They reflect the general health of the economy here in the U.S. and U.K. and the uneven recovery we are experiencing. They reflect strength in some sectors, as well as",1759,"Thanks, Craig. Revenue results for the quarter were impacted by several as Craig noted. They reflect the general health of the economy here in the U.S. and U.K. and the uneven recovery we are experiencing. They reflect strength in some sectors, as well as continued softness in others, such as real estate. 
Overall our total operating revenues were down almost 4% and totaled $1.3 billion. Reported operating expenses for the company for the quarter were down as well. As a result, the company was solidly profitable despite the challenging advertising environment as operating income, excluding special items, was $192 million. 
Earnings per diluted share for the quarter on a GAAP basis were $0.37, but if you exclude those special items, earnings were $0.41 per share. We detailed the special items in the release this morning. In summary in the first quarter, they totaled approximately $14 million pretax. Approximately $8 million was due to facility consolidations and $6 million pretax as a result of workforce restructuring. 
We provided reconciliations of those several non-GAAP items to our GAAP schedules in our release this morning as well. As you may recall, we sold The Honolulu Advertiser and its related assets and a small directory publishing business in the second quarter of last year. Results for this pro forma properties have been reclassified to discontinued operations. Revenues from those properties totaled approximately $23 million in the first quarter last year. Of course, we cycle those events next quarter. 
So looking at each of our segments in a little more detail, total Publishing segment revenues were just over 6% lower. They reflect continuing strength in Auto and Employment in the U.S., however, that was offset by softer ad demand in certain sectors, most notably real estate domestically, and over all in the U.K. 
Severe weather in the Northeast, the South and in the U.K., as well as a later Easter this year, also impacted results. Revenues for our domestic Publishing operations declined 6.5%. Classified Advertising, however, improved sequentially within the quarter and was down about 3% for the quarter and was down just 2% in March. The Automotive and Employment categories continued the positive runs that began four quarters ago. Auto Advertising was up over 6% in the quarter and employment revenue growth was also significantly higher, up over 7%. 
Hereto, there was sizable sequential improvement within the quarter finishing with March over 13% higher. In real estate, year-over-year comparisons were slightly better in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter. However, the real estate category was down domestically, reflecting housing issues across the country. 
In its most recent Beige Book, the FOMC noted that real estate markets for single-family homes, for the most part, either were little changed from low levels or continue to weaken across all districts. As we have noted in the past, we believe the real estate meltdown led the cyclical slowdown. So a complete recovery of the economy will be dependent on the real estate market that is growing, or the very least, has stabilized. 
National advertising was volatile to say the least, both here and in the U.K., with double-digit percentage points swings month-to-month. At USA TODAY, there was strength in the Telecom and Credit Card categories, while several other key categories declined compared to the first quarter last year. As a result, total National Advertising across all Publishing was down about 11% in the quarter. Retail Advertising demand was hindered by softer ad demand overall in addition to the weather in the Northeast, South and the later Easter. 
In the U.K., revenue at Newsquest was about 7% lower in pounds in the quarter. The economy there, as we have noted, continues to be very fragile. Consumer confidence is subdued, as shown by retail sales which posted the worst numbers in 15 years, driven by concern about the impact of public-sector cuts. 
Reduced public-sector spending, together with this lack of confidence, continues to affect revenues. The other revenue category, primarily Commercial Printing, however, continues to be a bright spot. It was up 30% for the quarter and is about 9% of their total revenues eclipsing National Advertising. 
Our cross-platform sales efforts continue to take hold. U.S. Community Publishing Digital revenue growth increased over 13% with key categories like Auto, Employment, National and Retail, all delivering double-digit growth. And at USA Today their digital growth was 19% higher in the quarter. 
Now let me turn for a moment to expenses. Reported Publishing expenses this quarter were down about 2%. Excluding special items, however, Publishing expenses were 3% lower year-over-year. Once again, the decline reflects our effort to drive efficiencies, as well as the impact to facility consolidations over the past several quarters. 
Higher newsprint costs, which were up about 12.5%, tempered the lower level of operating expenses. Significantly higher newsprint usage prices were offset partially by a declining consumption of almost 10%. 
Now let me just say a few words on the current status of the newsprint market. Newsprint shipments declined to offshore markets and domestically throughout the first quarter. While some supply rationalizations have been announced, these adjustments are not expected to offset the cumulative effect of current, soft market conditions. As a result, downward price pressure grow. 
At this point, however, newsprint usage price comparisons in the second quarter of 2011 are expected to be unfavorable, although not to the extent they were in the first quarter, and consumption is expected to be lower. As a result of the revenue and expense picture, Publishing segment operating income, excluding special items, was about $131 million and operating cash flow on a same basis totaled almost $163 million. 
Moving to the Broadcasting segment. Again a real bright spot for us. Revenue was just $3.6 million lower in the quarter, despite the absence of $24 million of ad spending associated with several events last year. We benefited last year from $18.6 million in Olympic advertising on our NBC-affiliated stations, $3.3 million in politically-related ad spending and $2.2 million in ad demand related to the Super Bowl, which this year moved to Fox from our CBS stations. 
If you exclude the incremental impact of these events, total television revenues were over 7% higher. Core advertising remains strong in the first quarter, continuing the momentum we saw last year. 
Looking at March revenue results, which were not impacted by Olympics or the Super Bowl, Core Advertising was up 5.5%, driven in part by strength in Auto. For the quarter, retransmission fees were up significantly, about 26% to $19.5 million. And Digital revenue growth in TV was up almost 28%. 
As Craig noted, efforts to extend our reach through local community sites and our alliance with Yahoo! contributed to the online revenue growth. Expenses in Broadcasting were up approximately 1%. Therefore, operating income totaled $63.5 million, while operating cash flow was almost $71 million despite the revenue headwinds. 
Looking at the second quarter, comparisons again will be difficult with almost $12 million in political spending in the second quarter last year. We do, however, expect the momentum in core advertising to continue, as well as the upward trend in retrans fees. So based on current trends, we expect total Television revenues for the second quarter to be flat, compared to the second quarter of 2010. 
Excluding the incremental impact of political spending, the percentage increase in total Television revenues growth in the second quarter this year compared to last year is expected to be up in the mid-single digits. 
Now turning to the Digital segment. Revenues there were 12% higher in the quarter, driven primarily by higher online employment ad demand that positively impacted CareerBuilder's results. Digital segment expenses were well managed and were up just a little over 3%. As a result, operating income was up substantially, almost fivefold to a little over $16 million from $3.4 million last year, in what has typically been the Digital segment's smallest quarter. Similarly, operating cash flow more than doubled to almost $24 million.  As Craig noted, the for entire company, Digital revenue totaled $251 million, over 12% higher and approximately 20% of total revenues. 
Turning quickly to the balance sheet, we generated about $216 million in free cash flow and we used part of that to reduce debt by $164 million. At the end of the quarter, long-term debt stood at $2.2 billion, and cash at quarter end was $142 million. Interest expense in the quarter was about $3.2 million higher year-over-year, as the sharp decline in the average debt balances was offset by higher average rates as our debt mix shifts to longer term fixed-rate debt. 
At this point, our all-in cost of debt is approximately 7%. Our debt to EBITDA ratio at the end of the period was about 1.9x giving us tremendous financial flexibility.  One last financial item, capital expenditures in the first quarter were $12.6 million. 
Before we open the call to questions, I want to focus for a few moments on our proven ability to consistently generate free cash flow even in the most challenging economic environment. As we noted, free cash flow was $216 million. We defined that as net cash flow from operating activities, less the outlay for capital expenditures during the quarter, plus the net of payments for and proceeds from investments. 
We believe that our Publishing, Broadcast and Digital businesses, each quite profitable on their own, are integral parts of our business as a whole. The most fundamental economic way to understand Gannett as a whole is to understand our free cash flow, and what we have done and can do with it. We have substantially delevered the balance sheet over the past two years, from $3.8 billion of debt at the end of 2008 to $2.2 billion at the end of the quarter. And we have the financial flexibility to invest in all of our businesses, especially Digital. 
With a strong balance sheet and with more clarity on the economy, which we hope will come in the second half of the year, we will be in a better position to consider returning additional capital to shareholders through either share repurchases and/or dividends. 
So in summary, we are making dramatic changes in our ability to distribute contents across all platforms, and we are improving our capability to sell across those platforms. That, combined with the earnings power of our businesses and the financial flexibility we have to invest in future growth opportunities, puts Gannett in a unique position to grow with the changing media landscape. 
And with that, we'll open it up for questions."

As Gracia noted, we've provided a thorough update at the MEANY presentations, and our results very much are in-line with the expectations we shared then. 
Earnings per diluted share adjusted for special items were $0.41 for the quarter, Digital segment revenue growth was up 12% as stronger online employment ad  demand positively impacted the results at CareerBuilder. Digital revenue companywide was over 12% higher, as well reflecting our cross-platform sales initiatives. Our Publishing segment revenue results lag last year by 6%, reflecting the current state of a domestic economy. However, we had strength in Auto and Employment. 
Softness in certain sectors persist, particularly real estate here in the U.S. and more broadly in the U.K. Broadcasting segment revenues were down just $3.6 million, reflecting the challenge of overcoming our own success last year of over $24 million in Olympic, Super Bowl and political spending. Core TV advertising growth was solid as was growth in retransmission fees and Digital revenue and our Broadcasting segment. Excluding the incremental impact of the events that benefited last year's revenue, total television revenues were up significantly. We're very pleased with the core growth in television. 
Our total revenues were down about 4%. Our expenses were lower overall reflecting our continuing efforts to create efficiencies across the company, particularly in Publishing. All of our businesses were solidly profitable in the quarter. We generated free cash flow of $216 million and we reduced our debt by over $160 million despite challenges to revenue growth. 
Gannett has changed dramatically over the last few years as you have seen. We have changed the way we gather and distribute content. We have successfully expanded our presence in our markets, both locally and nationally through multiple platforms and devices. We are changing the way we sell in those markets to take advantage of that expanded reach. 
The natural next step in the process was to launch our first corporate brand and national advertising campaign. Our new logo and tagline, ""It's All Within Reach,"" highlight our ability to deliver content to consumers any way they want to access it. The use of new platforms and devices are growing everyday, and we are expanding along with that by continuing to extend our reach from Print and Broadcast to Online to Mobile and Portable. 
For our Advertising customers and businesses, we are able to bring solutions to them that will help them grow. We are transforming in our current and potential customers will benefit from the changes that have made. Our brand campaign is an integrated, B2B effort, targeting the advertising, marketing and financial communities. Feedback has been positive. We believe it is critical that advertisers understand the scope and the power of our brand and all that we offer. 
We also further strengthened our management team with two key appointments. We have added Maryam Banikarim as Chief Marketing Officer and David Payne as our Chief Digital Officer. Both individuals are industry leaders and we are extremely pleased to have them both on board. We are certain their experience and insights will help guide and shape our efforts as we continue our progress. 
Changing our sales culture to focus on solutions-based selling across all platforms continues to be a key priority for us. Gannett Client Solutions teams are getting momentum as they collaborate with local markets sales teams to target the highest potential accounts, those that currently have limited or no advertising with our local media organizations. We have made significant progress and they are continuing to build their pipeline of business. 
In U.S. Community Publishing, we continue to make strides to support our vision for a world-class sales operation. In the second quarter, we will begin implementing the longer-term components in our top markets. These include installing CRM software and a new pipeline management process to help manage sales relationships. We are also realigning the sales organization. 
Also important to our success is our ability to deliver Digital solutions that are integrated, as well as affordable and efficient to every advertiser in our local markets. Our alliance with Yahoo! extends our digital reach of consumers to an average of 80% in local markets selling Yahoo!'s local inventory in addition to our own. We have launched in all of our USCP markets. Our local sales organizations are leveraging this extended reach to more effectively sell and compete on behavioral, demographic and geographic levels. We are performing ahead of our launch goals and continue to see more opportunity here. 
In addition, as a result, this quarter reflect, we have been particularly successful with classified verticals like automotive and employment. Gracia will go into that in more detail in just a few moments. Coupon-related products have gotten a fair amount of media attention of late. Over the past year, several Gannett properties have created new social commerce products that use the collective buying power to get great deals for consumers and traffic for local merchants. This business is a great fit for our company because of our brands and our strong relationships with our businesses and consumers. 
In September last year, the Arizona Republic launched dealchicken.com, a daily deal site similar to Groupon and LivingSocial. This site has grown quickly since then in terms of both audience and revenue. Similarly in October 2010, Clipper Magazine launched its Double Take Deals online coupon product. 
Double Take deals is experiencing good success and is now live across 450 magazines in 31 states. We are now extending the daily deals concept companywide to build on the success of these local offerings. Our unique value proposition in our local market allows us to achieve efficiencies through centralization. We will be rolling out the Deal Chicken product in 57 of our large and medium-sized Publishing and Broadcast markets by year's end. 
With both Deal Chicken and Double Take Deals, a key differentiator for Gannett is our ability to tie the discount offers to several other types of local marketing products, which, together, will deliver a much more robust campaign in order to build repeat business for our Advertising customers. 
In our Broadcasting segment, we continue to extend the reach of our strong television brands in our local markets through Yahoo!, as well as local community sites. We are leveraging the strength of our own sales force with Yahoo!. Our initial seven Yahoo! broadcast markets have launched. Based on our solid performance to date, Yahoo! has opened up two additional rollout markets. 
At the same time, we have access to a telesales staff in our hyper local community sites. We are exceeding launch revenue goals across nine markets. We went live in our final market in January and now have 264 community sites across 10 markets. 
During the quarter, we exceeded our first quarter revenue plan and delivered $3.2 million total community site pages, growing approximately 88% from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter. All of these efforts help drive an increase of almost 28% in Television Digital Advertising in the quarter, and we continue to explore other initiatives. We are ramping up our social media efforts, including Twitter and Facebook, which are becoming even more important tools for gathering and distributing content. 
Overall, the continued strength of our local news ratings, which is central to our television strategy, combined with firmer ad demand for key categories, which resulted in solid revenue growth and core advertising this quarter. Gracia will discuss that in a little more detail in just a moment. 
Employment is another bright spot in our results and for the economy as a whole. CareerBuilder benefited from that strength as revenue growth both domestically and internationally resulted in a substantial increase in Digital segment revenue. Digital revenue in both Publishing and Broadcasting were up significantly as well. Overall, Digital revenue, companywide, increased over 12% as I noted and totaled over $250 million and a 20% of total revenues, which is typically our smallest quarter. The focus on Digital, continues with the proliferation of devices and changing media consumption. We need to be in the best position possible to harness all of the touch points we have with online and mobile users. 
More than 100 of Gannett's redesigned online mobile media sites launched locally and nationally last month. The redesign, delivers richer content and supports on-demand video and significantly enhances the consumer experience. The new enhancements also enable business customers to effectively extend the reach of their campaigns across USATODAY.com, and Gannett's local markets nationwide by standardizing ad units across the sites. 
We are pleased with the early results as a 30-day internal study indicated that video viewership, total visitors and page views all increased. Each of the initiatives noted here reflect our effort to change as media consumption evolves and people are beginning to take notice. 
Recently, paidContent ranked its top 50 Most Successful Digital Media Companies in the U.S. and Gannett was 12th. We continue to leverage the unique assets we have at the Gannett Company, to enhance content distribution on any platform. We are quickly ramping up our ability to achieve even greater success, selling across those platforms. That is crucial as we position the company for our future growth. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gracia."
20571,129455825,115504,"Gannett Co., Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2011",2011-04-18,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Craig. Revenue results for the quarter were impacted by several factors as Craig noted. They reflect the general health of the economy here in the U.S. and U.K. and the uneven recovery we are experiencing. They reflect strength in some sectors, as",1760,"Thanks, Craig. Revenue results for the quarter were impacted by several factors as Craig noted. They reflect the general health of the economy here in the U.S. and U.K. and the uneven recovery we are experiencing. They reflect strength in some sectors, as well as continued softness in others, such as real estate. 
Overall our total operating revenues were down almost 4% and totaled $1.3 billion. Reported operating expenses for the company for the quarter were down as well. As a result, the company was solidly profitable despite the challenging advertising environment as operating income, excluding special items, was $192 million. 
Earnings per diluted share for the quarter on a GAAP basis were $0.37, but if you exclude those special items, earnings were $0.41 per share. We detailed the special items in the release this morning. In summary in the first quarter, they totaled approximately $14 million pretax. Approximately $8 million was due to facility consolidations and $6 million pretax was the result of workforce restructuring. 
We provided reconciliations of those several non-GAAP items to our GAAP schedules in our release this morning as well. As you may recall, we sold The Honolulu Advertiser and its related assets and a small directory publishing business in the second quarter of last year. Results for this pro forma properties have been reclassified to discontinued operations. Revenues from those properties totaled approximately $23 million in the first quarter last year. Of course, we cycle those events next quarter. 
So looking at each of our segments in a little more detail, total Publishing segment revenues were just over 6% lower. They reflect continuing strength in Auto and Employment in the U.S., however, that was offset by softer ad demand in certain sectors, most notably real estate domestically, and over all in the U.K. 
Severe weather in the Northeast, the South and in the U.K., as well as a later Easter this year, also impacted results. Revenues for our domestic Publishing operations declined 6.5%. Classified Advertising, however, improved sequentially within the quarter and was down about 3% for the quarter and was down just 2% in March. The Automotive and Employment categories continued the positive runs that began four quarters ago. Auto Advertising was up over 6% in the quarter and employment revenue growth was also significantly higher, up over 7%. 
Hereto, there was sizable sequential improvement within the quarter finishing with March over 13% higher. In real estate, year-over-year comparisons were slightly better in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter. However, the real estate category was down domestically, reflecting housing issues across the country. 
In its most recent Beige Book, the FOMC noted that real estate markets for single-family homes, for the most part, either were little changed from low levels or continue to weaken across all districts. As we have noted in the past, we believe the real estate meltdown led the cyclical slowdown. So a complete recovery of the economy will be dependent on the real estate market that is growing, or the very least, has stabilized. 
National advertising was volatile to say the least, both here and in the U.K., with double-digit percentage points swings month-to-month. At USA TODAY, there was strength in the Telecom and Credit Card categories, while several other key categories declined compared to the first quarter last year. As a result, total National Advertising across all Publishing was down about 11% in the quarter. Retail Advertising demand was hindered by softer ad demand overall in addition to the weather in the Northeast, South and the later Easter. 
In the U.K., revenue at Newsquest was about 7% lower in pounds in the quarter. The economy there, as we have noted, continues to be very fragile. Consumer confidence is subdued, as shown by retail sales which posted the worst numbers in 15 years, driven by concern about the impact of public-sector cuts. 
Reduced public-sector spending, together with this lack of confidence, continues to affect revenues. The other revenue category, primarily Commercial Printing, however, continues to be a bright spot. It was up 30% for the quarter and is about 9% of their total revenues eclipsing National Advertising. 
Our cross-platform sales efforts continue to take hold. U.S. Community Publishing Digital revenue growth increased over 13% with key categories like Auto, Employment, National and Retail, all delivering double-digit growth. And at USA Today their digital growth was 19% higher in the quarter. 
Now let me turn for a moment to expenses. Reported Publishing expenses this quarter were down about 2%. Excluding special items, however, Publishing expenses were 3% lower year-over-year. Once again, the decline reflects our effort to drive efficiencies, as well as the impact of facility consolidations over the past several quarters. 
Higher newsprint costs, which were up about 12.5%, tempered the lower level of operating expenses. Significantly higher newsprint usage prices were offset partially by a declining consumption of almost 10%. 
Now let me just say a few words on the current status of the newsprint market. Newsprint shipments declined to offshore markets and domestically throughout the first quarter. While some supply rationalizations have been announced, these adjustments are not expected to offset the cumulative effect of current, soft market conditions. As a result, downward price pressure grow. 
At this point, however, newsprint usage price comparisons in the second quarter of 2011 are expected to be unfavorable, although not to the extent they were in the first quarter, and consumption is expected to be lower. As a result of the revenue and expense picture, Publishing segment operating income, excluding special items, was about $131 million and operating cash flow on a same basis totaled almost $163 million. 
Moving to the Broadcasting segment. Again a real bright spot for us. Revenue was just $3.6 million lower in the quarter, despite the absence of $24 million of ad spending associated with several events last year. We benefited last year from $18.6 million in Olympic advertising on our NBC-affiliated stations, $3.3 million in politically-related ad spending and $2.2 million in ad demand related to the Super Bowl, which this year moved to Fox from our CBS stations. 
If you exclude the incremental impact of these events, total television revenues were over 7% higher. Core advertising remains strong in the first quarter, continuing the momentum we saw last year. 
Looking at March revenue results, which were not impacted by Olympics or the Super Bowl, Core Advertising was up 5.5%, driven in part by strength in Auto. For the quarter, retransmission fees were up significantly, about 26% to $19.5 million. And Digital revenue growth in TV was up almost 28%. 
As Craig noted, efforts to extend our reach through local community sites and our alliance with Yahoo! contributed to the online revenue growth. Expenses in Broadcasting were up approximately 1%. Therefore, operating income totaled $63.5 million, while operating cash flow was almost $71 million despite the revenue headwinds. 
Looking at the second quarter, comparisons again will be difficult with almost $12 million in political spending in the second quarter last year. We do, however, expect the momentum in core advertising to continue, as well as the upward trend in retrans fees. So based on current trends, we expect total Television revenues for the second quarter to be flat, compared to the second quarter of 2010. 
Excluding the incremental impact of political spending, the percentage increase in total Television revenues growth in the second quarter this year compared to last year is expected to be up in the mid-single digits. 
Now turning to the Digital segment. Revenues there were 12% higher in the quarter, driven primarily by higher online employment ad demand that positively impacted CareerBuilder's results. Digital segment expenses were well managed and were up just a little over 3%. As a result, operating income was up substantially, almost fivefold to a little over $16 million from $3.4 million last year, in what has typically been the Digital segment's smallest quarter. Similarly, operating cash flow more than doubled to almost $24 million.  As Craig noted, the for entire company, Digital revenue totaled $251 million, over 12% higher and approximately 20% of total revenues. 
Turning quickly to the balance sheet, we generated about $216 million in free cash flow and we used part of that to reduce debt by $164 million. At the end of the quarter, long-term debt stood at $2.2 billion, and cash at quarter end was $142 million. Interest expense in the quarter was about $3.2 million higher year-over-year, as the sharp decline in the average debt balances was offset by higher average rates as our debt mix shifts to longer term fixed-rate debt. 
At this point, our all-in cost of debt is approximately 7%. Our debt to EBITDA ratio at the end of the period was about 1.9x giving us tremendous financial flexibility.  One last financial item, capital expenditures in the first quarter were $12.6 million. 
Before we open the call to questions, I want to focus for a few moments on our proven ability to consistently generate free cash flow even in the most challenging economic environment. As we noted, free cash flow was $216 million. We defined that as net cash flow from operating activities, less the outlay for capital expenditures during the quarter, plus the net of payments for and proceeds from investments. 
We believe that our Publishing, Broadcast and Digital businesses, each quite profitable on their own, are integral parts of our business as a whole. The most fundamental economic way to understand Gannett as a whole is to understand our free cash flow, and what we have done and can do with it. We have substantially delevered the balance sheet over the past two years, from $3.8 billion of debt at the end of 2008 to $2.2 billion at the end of the quarter. And we have the financial flexibility to invest in all of our businesses, especially Digital. 
With a strong balance sheet and with more clarity on the economy, which we hope will come in the second half of the year, we will be in a better position to consider returning additional capital to shareholders through either share repurchases and/or dividends. 
So in summary, we are making dramatic changes in our ability to distribute contents across all platforms, and we are improving our capability to sell across those platforms. That, combined with the earnings power of our businesses and the financial flexibility we have to invest in future growth opportunities, puts Gannett in a unique position to grow with the changing media landscape. 
And with that, we'll open it up for questions."

We are very pleased to announce this morning that the Board of Directors approved a doubling of our quarterly dividend from $0.04 to $0.08 and that we are resuming share repurchases under the $1 billion program",1635,"Thanks, Gracia, and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased to announce this morning that the Board of Directors approved a doubling of our quarterly dividend from $0.04 to $0.08 and that we are resuming share repurchases under the $1 billion program authorized originally in mid-2006. We are committed to creating value for our shareholders and the actions announced today reflect that commitment. 
Over the past couple of years, we have further strengthened our balance sheet by using our free cash flow to aggressively reduce our debt. In addition, we issued longer-term debt to construct a very manageable debt maturity schedule and extend our revolving credit facilities. As we have stated previously, we wanted added clarity on the economy to be in a position to assist the best approach to returning capital to shareholders. We are taking these actions because we have confidence in our long-term growth prospects, our ability to consistently generate free cash flow and our strong financial position.
As importantly, we will continue to have the financial flexibility to invest in our businesses and pursue new opportunities. Regarding the dividend increase, it is the company's 172nd consecutive annual or excuse me, quarterly dividend spanning a period of 44 years since the company went public in October 1967. In terms of share repurchases, we believe at current price levels, our stock is a great investment and resuming the share repurchases plan underscores that conviction. At this point, we have a just over $800 million of remaining authority under the original authorization and we expect to repurchase up to 100 million of shares over the next 12 months. Of course, as we have noted in the past, our Board will regularly we assess these actions as economic and business conditions continue to evolve. 
We see many opportunities for future growth that Gannett company is uniquely positioned to capture those opportunities as consumer consumption further increases and media companies adapt to meet those change. 
During the quarter, we continued progress on several fronts, most notably, our cross-platform selling efforts and leveraging the power of our local brands. Before I give you an update on our efforts, let me briefly cover our second quarter results.
Overall, the results reflect the current state of economies here and in the U.K. Strength in some sectors while in others, a challenging environment for ad demand. Our efforts to sell across platforms and a focus on the Digital are once again reflected in solid revenue growth in these areas in all of our business segments.
Earnings per share adjusted for special items totaled $0.58. Revenue company-wide was 2% lower for the quarter, due to softer ad demand stemming from the unsteady economy. Tough comparisons in our Broadcasting segment and the impact of the crisis in Japan had on auto and consumer electric sectors here in the U.S. 
Revenue results in our Digital segment were very strong again this quarter. Revenue in this segment was up almost 13% in the quarter, driven primarily by very strong results at CareerBuilder, both domestically and international.
Digital revenue company-wide advanced 13%, as well reflecting the growth in the Digital segment in addition to solid online revenue growth in both our Broadcasting and Publishing segments. 
Total Digital revenue was $276 million, almost 21% of total company revenues. Digital revenue year-to-date totaled $529 million. Total Broadcasting segment revenues was up slightly. That was quite an achievement given a challenge of overcoming our success and garnering political dollars last year, $12 million in the second quarter alone. 
Strong growth in Digital advertising and a 24% increase in retransmission fees in television contributed to the results. Publishing revenues were down just under 5% and reflect in large part the softening economic environment here and particularly in the U.K. While the economy seems to be improving through the end of last year, growth slipped in many areas of the country. Classified advertising categories were all impacted, including auto and employment.
Real estate advertising demand continues to lag reflecting what is sure to be a slow recovery in housing. Digital revenue growth was a bright spot in the Publishing segment at U.S. Community Publishing, Newsquest and USA TODAY all achieved increases. Expenses company-wide excluding special items declined over all as we continue our focus on efficiency efforts across all of our businesses.
Our Broadcasting and Digital segments expanded their profitability in the second quarter. The Publishing segment was solidly profitable despite the economic challenges. As I noted, we continued to drive change here at Gannett to adapt to the changing media landscape. This is particularly evident in our approach to a sales process and our local media franchises. A more complex selling environment and our transformation to multimedia organizations calls for better understanding of our business clients, marketing and communication challenges and a new suite of services that get better results for our customers.
This new environment also opens up new revenue opportunities as we held businesses understand, utilize and reap the benefits of our engaged and loyal audiences. A number of sales initiatives are in the works to create greater value for advertisers, drive differentiation and enhance our sales performance. Gannett client solutions teams in place since the fourth quarter last year are gaining traction. Before regional teams collaborate with local sales management to target the highest potential local account and offer them more than traditional reach and frequency. The regional groups have fulfilled marketing need that extend further into non-traditionaladvertising avenues. They range from developing mobile apps, to managing social media to event planning, to leveraging database analysis for customer acquisition programs. We are focused on cross-platform sales and leveraging our local brands in our Broadcasting segment as well. Our Digital sales efforts, particularly global community sales, resulted in a jump of almost 30% in online revenue for our TV stations this quarter.
During the quarter, we had a great example of our TV station showcasing the power of the local brand. The show, The Voice, has done very well in NBC with strong help from Gannett NBC stations and the marketing blitz around the show. Gannett TV stations had an extremely strong showing and dominated the ratings since the shows launch. And the top 25 metered markets for all of NBC stations, Gannett consistently had 3 stations ranked in the top 5 every week. Among all metered markets, Gannett had the 4 highest rated stations on 3 nights and the Gannett station was ranked #1 6x. 
Driving these outstanding ratings was a marketing effort that included several techniques that went beyond traditional on air methods. Social media for instance was a critical component included everything from live chats, to polls to fan's comments on topics like performers, choice of music and judges. Our NBC TV stations build momentum to The Voice by engaging local consumers in different and innovative ways and by providing extra promotional muscle on air, online and using social media.
The success of The Voice demonstrates the impact of Gannett Broadcasting, collective strength and the ability to help push a strong show even further ahead of our competition. 
While the strength of the local brand is critical to the success of our TV station and their markets equally important is a stedfast quality on local important -- on local reporting. 
Our NBC affiliate, WGRZ, in Buffalo recently received the 2011 Edward R. Murrow Awards for overall news excellence in a small market for doing just that.
Focusing on stories and issues that are of interest to the committee, giving reporters the latitude to cover them and affording them the request of air time are all keys to the award-winning coverage. The right combination of people, commitment to compelling stories and them covering them in depth resulted in solid watchdog journalism that can better a community. And the effort has resulted in improving ratings for the station as well. The power of our local brands, our deep connections to and our knowledge of the communities we serve and our reach within those communities are key differentiators for deal checking. Our daily deal site. They will help deal chicken more effectively serve both merchants and consumers build long-term relationships that will last beyond the single daily deal.
Another key difference four our product is our ability to combine the discount promotion with several other types of media, including print and online products. The result is a much broader ad campaign and increased potential for repeat customers. Deal Chicken has produced outstanding results in the Phoenix market. It is consistently one of the top 3 daily deal products in the market and often working its way in the #2 position. We have committed to rolling out the product in 50 of our largest Publishing and Broadcasting markets and began that rollout early last week with launches in St. Louis, Cincinnati, Detroit, Washington DC and Rochester. A business that uses Deal Chicken in Phoenix said that and I quote, work epically. That kind of success has resulted in a 41% increase in revenues in the Phoenix market for Deal Chicken from the first quarter to the second quarter. 
I'll touch on just a few of the initiatives that are underway here at the Gannett company. They all have a common thread, our local market presence, knowledge and the ability to leverage and scale it. We continue to stretch and adapt to the consumer and advertiser and those efforts are moving ahead very strongly.
We are confident in our long-term growth, as well as our ability to generate cash flow. We have the financial flexibility and the strength of the balance sheet to resume share repurchases and increase the dividend. And at the same time, we'll  have the ability to invest in future growth opportunities, which is critically important. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gracia."
20571,136887436,141867,"Gannett Co., Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2011",2011-07-18,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Craig, and good morning again. Our second quarter revenue results once again reflect the of several factors.

Our second quarter revenue results once again reflect the of several factors. We benefited from a positive impact of our efforts to create new revenue opportunities, particularly in Digital, as well as overcoming our own terrific success last year generating political ad spending. The economic environment continues to present a headwind with a bit of deceleration here and continuing challenges in the U.K. As a result, total company revenues were $1.33 billion, a 2.2% decline, but a sequential improvement from the first quarter comparisons.
Our expenses were down 1.3% excluding special items as we continue efforts company-wide to be as efficient as possible and well-positioned to benefit when the pace of economic recovery improves. Lower expense levels were achieved in both Publishing and Broadcasting. Digital segment expenses were higher reflecting the substantial revenue growth there and investments in the new initiatives. 
As a result, the company generated operating income excluding special items of $257 million and operating cash flow of $307 million. We detailed those special items in the release this morning. 
This quarter, on a pretax basis, approximately $9 million was due to workforce restructuring, while over $6 million related to facility consolidations. 
We had a net tax benefit of over $20 million, related primarily to a tax settlement and other items covering multiple years. 
In total, that resulted in a $0.04 benefit to reported earnings per share. The results for the second quarter last year included a net tax benefit of almost $29 million or $0.12 per share.
We provided reconciliations of those several non-GAAP items to our GAAP schedules in our release this morning as well. From a cash flow perspective, net cash flow from operating activities totaled $191 million for the quarter and free cash flow totaled $180 million. Through the first half of the year, the company has generated free cash flow of almost $400 million.
Focusing a little more closely on the segments, total Publishing segment revenues were down about 5% in the quarter. That was a better result than first quarter comparisons. In fact, advertising, circulation and other revenue comparisons all improved from first quarter comparisons. Reflecting our focus and investment in circulation, particularly Sundays, circulation revenue was down just 1.7% and trended better within the quarter, finishing in June with less than 0.5% decline. And the good news on the volume front was that in June, total Sunday circulation was actually up 1.2%. 
Digital revenues in Publishing were up over 12%, an increase of almost 9% in online ads at U.S. Community Publishing, contributed to the growth as did a 22% increase in Digital revenue at USA TODAY. 
Domestically, Publishing revenue was about 6% lower. Classified advertising in the U.S. was impacted by the deceleration in the economy. Auto advertising was down about 4%, employment was virtually flat to last year and real estate continues to lag. The decline in real estate advertising this quarter was in line with first quarter comparisons.
While we believe the impact to the auto category across all of our businesses from the earthquake in Japan will be temporary, the housing market issues will take some time to sort themselves out. 
Turning to national advertising in the Publishing segment, it was about 8.5% lower, an increase of almost 3% in pounds at Newsquest, was offset by softer ad demand at USA TODAY. Newsquest benefited early in the quarter from the royal wedding with national advertising up over 12% in April. At USA TODAY, significant growth in the telecom and financial categories among some others was offset by a declines in some other categories.
Retail advertising was down although comparisons both here and in the U.K. were better this quarter than the first quarter. That reflects in part of later Easter. Revenue overall at Newsquest declined about 7% in pounds reflecting again the economic realities there. In the quarter, they did benefit from the Royal wedding and the timing of the later Easter as I noticed. 
Overall results were muted during the quarter as consumers are cutting back because of the tough economic climate, worries about rising fuel prices and job uncertainty. So the economic challenges persists an impact our results.
Publishing expenses this quarter were down about 1% but excluding special items, expenses were almost 3% lower. As noted, the continuous effort to create efficiencies helped to reduce expenses. Those savings were offset in part by an increase in newsprint expense over 9%. A declining usage of approximately 9% was more than offset by a 20% increase in newsprint usage prices.
Now focusing for a moment on the current newsprint market, demand for newsprint in North America is down nearly 7% year-to-date with same period no operating rates below 90%. Producers are trying to manage this imbalance in supply and demand by increasing exports and implementing downtime. Domestic prices have been stable since the first quarter of 2010, although at regional east-west price variance continues. 
Overall, market conditions do not support higher prices as most observed as expect news prices to remain flat in the near term. We believe on the best case basis for producers that would be the case.
Although newsprint usage price comparisons in the third quarter this year are expected to continue to be unfavorable, the gap will narrow relative to the second quarter.
Profitability in the Publishing segment was solid once again this quarter as operating income excluding special items was $154 million and operating cash flow in the same basis totaled $185 million.
Turning to Broadcasting. Revenue was up slightly to $184.4 million, overcoming a net decline of about $9 million in political spending. Growth in Digital revenues and retransmission fees contributed to that achievement. Total television revenues excluding the incremental impact of political spending was over 5% higher. Although revenue growth was impacted by major cancellations by foreign car manufacturers due to the crisis in Japan, higher ad demand in many categories offset the decline in auto. As a result, core TV advertising excluding again the impact of political, was up as well, about 1.5%. 
Digital revenues in our TV stations were 29% higher and reflect our focus on local Digital sales. Broadcasting segment expenses were down about 2%, successful revenue efforts to overcome much higher political spending as well as lower expenses led to an increase in profitability in Broadcasting. 
Operating income up 3% totaling $80.4 million and operating cash flow was almost $88 million, an increase of almost 2% despite the difficult comparison. And those difficult comparisons will continue in the third quarter as political spending ramped up to about $21 million in that quarter last year. We expect growth in core advertising, a continued increase in retrans fees and the challenges presented by the Japan crisis abating as the quarter progresses. So based on current trends, we expect the percentage decline in total television revenues for the third quarter to be in the mid-single digits, but excluding the incremental impact of political spending, the percentage increase in total television revenues is expected to be in the mid-single digits in the third quarter.
Again, that's where we are today. There is obviously going to be some volatility, hopefully to the upside as the quarter unfolds. Digital segment revenues were up 13% in the quarter and CareerBuilder delivered yet another strong quarter. Despite a somewhat anemic job picture, CareerBuilder generated strong revenue growth for our variety of reasons, online job listings our growing across all categories, they are no longer just a job site, but rather they are evolving into a true human capital solutions company. And there was a significant revenue increase in their international operations. Digital segment expenses were up over 8% as a segment had solid revenue growth and made investments in new initiatives. Operating income in the Digital segment was up substantially, almost 32% to $36.2 million, while operating cash flow was 24% higher to $43.8 million. 
As Craig noted, and it bears repeating, Digital revenue company-wide totaled $276 million, a 13% increase and is now 21% of total revenues. 
Let me turn quickly to the balance sheet. As a result of our operations, we generated as we said strong free cash flow. We reduced debt by $167 million during the quarter to approximately $2 billion. Cash at quarter end was $165 million. Interest expense in the quarter was higher than last year's second quarter as the continuing decline in the average debt balances was offset by higher average rates due to a higher proportion of long-term fixed rate debt. At this point, our rolling cost of debt is approximately 6.6%.
Our debt to EBITDA ratio as measured for the covenant test in our credit facilities was reduced to approximately 1.8x at the end of the order. One final financial item, CapEx in the quarter were $16.6 million and a little over $29 million year-to-date. 
Before we open the call to your questions, I want to emphasize what Craig said at the beginning of our comments. The capital allocation announcement today underscore our commitment to creating more shareholder value. The strength of our balance sheet, our future growth prospects and the confidence in the company's free cash flow generation enable us to commit to the higher dividend and share repurchases while maintaining lots of flexibility to invest in our existing businesses and a new opportunity to grow our business.
And with that, we'll open it up to questions."

Anne Hurlich, our General Manager there has great relations with the biggest outdoor Wolf trap opportunity for people to go to events.

As to our goals on the balance sheet, it is always to maintain a very strong balance sheet. And as we all know, having with lived to these last few years, it really depends on what access to capital markets looks like and a variety of other things. So we feel very good about the strength of our balance sheet. It's really phenomenal. We have our debt maturities laddered out very carefully. There's no debt coming due in 2013, but as Craig said, we will continuously look at opportunities to share that free cash flow with our more directly with our shareholders as well as have the flexibility as good opportunities, investment opportunities come up to invest in those. So we'll always provide a little bit more flexibility than not in the balance sheet for those things that you can time when they're going to come up are not but you have to be just ready to respond when they do come up, but I think we've ever much appreciate how strong our balance sheet is now and we'll continue to have a combination of paying a little bit of debt down and returning value to shareholders.

We are very pleased to announce this morning that the Board of Directors approved a doubling of our quarterly dividend from $0.04 to $0.08, and that we are resuming share repurchases under the $1 billion program",1637,"Thanks, Gracia, and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased to announce this morning that the Board of Directors approved a doubling of our quarterly dividend from $0.04 to $0.08, and that we are resuming share repurchases under the $1 billion program authorized originally in mid-2006. We are committed to creating value for our shareholders and the actions announced today reflect that commitment. 
Over the past couple of years, we have further strengthened our balance sheet by using our free cash flow to aggressively reduce our debt. In addition, we issued longer-term debt to construct a very manageable debt maturity schedule and extend our revolving credit facilities. As we have stated previously, we wanted added clarity on the economy to be in a position to assess the best approach to returning capital to shareholders. We are taking these actions because we have confidence in our long-term growth prospects, our ability to consistently generate free cash flow and our strong financial position.
As importantly, we will continue to have the financial flexibility to invest in our businesses and pursue new opportunities. Regarding the dividend increase, it is the company's 172nd consecutive annual -- or excuse me, quarterly dividend spanning a period of 44 years since the company went public in October of 1967. In terms of share repurchases, we believe at current price levels, our stock is a great investment, and resuming the share repurchases plan underscores that conviction. At this point, we have just over $800 million of remaining authority under the original authorization, and we expect to repurchase up to 100 million of shares over the next 12 months. Of course, as we have noted in the past, our board will regularly reassess these actions as economic and business conditions continue to evolve. 
We see many opportunities for future growth, the Gannett company is uniquely positioned to capture those opportunities as consumer consumption further increases and media companies adapt to meet this change. 
During the quarter, we continued progress on several fronts, most notably, our cross-platform selling efforts and leveraging the power of our local brands. Before I give you an update on our efforts, let me briefly cover our second quarter results.
Overall, the results reflect the current state of economies here and in the U.K. Strength in some sectors, while in others, a challenging environment for ad demand. Our efforts to sell across platforms and a focus on digital are once again reflected in solid revenue growth in these areas in all of our business segments.
Earnings per diluted share adjusted for special items totaled $0.58. Revenue company-wide was 2% lower for the quarter, due to softer ad demand stemming from the unsteady economy, tough comparisons in our Broadcasting segment and the impact of the crisis in Japan had on auto and consumer electric sectors here in the U.S. 
Revenue results in our Digital segment were very strong again this quarter. Revenue in this segment was up almost 13% in the quarter, driven primarily by very strong results at CareerBuilder, both domestically and internationally.
Digital revenue company-wide advanced 13% as well, reflecting the growth in the Digital segment in addition to solid online revenue growth in both our Broadcasting and Publishing segments. 
Total Digital revenue was $276 million, almost 21% of total company revenues. Digital revenue year-to-date totaled $529 million. Total Broadcasting segment revenues was up slightly. That was quite an achievement given the challenge of overcoming our success and garnering political dollars last year, $12 million in the second quarter alone. 
Strong growth in Digital advertising and a 24% increase in retransmission fees in television contributed to the results. Publishing revenues were down just under 5% and reflect, in large part, the softening economic environment here and particularly in the U.K. While the economy seemed to be improving through the end of last year, growth slipped in many areas of the country. Classified advertising categories were all impacted, including auto and employment.
Real estate advertising demand continues to lag reflecting what is sure to be a slow recovery in housing. Digital revenue growth was a bright spot in the Publishing segment at U.S. Community Publishing, Newsquest and USA TODAY all achieved increases. Expenses company-wide excluding special items declined overall, as we continue our focus on efficiency efforts across all of our businesses.
Our Broadcasting and Digital segments expanded their profitability in the second quarter. The Publishing segment was solidly profitable despite the economic challenges. As I noted, we continued to drive change here at Gannett to adapt to the changing media landscape. This is particularly evident in our approach to a sales process in our local media franchises. A more complex selling environment and our transformation to multimedia organizations calls for a better understanding of our business clients, marketing and communication challenges and a new suite of services that get better results for our customers.
This new environment also opens up new revenue opportunities as we help businesses understand, utilize and reap the benefits of our engaged and loyal audiences. A number of sales initiatives are in the works to create greater value for advertisers, drive differentiation and enhance our sales performance. Gannett client solutions teams in place since the fourth quarter last year are gaining traction. The 4 regional teams collaborate with local sales management to target the highest potential local account and offer them more than traditional reach and frequency. The regional groups have fulfilled marketing need that extend further into non-traditional advertising avenues. They range from developing mobile apps, to managing social media to event planning, to leveraging database analysis for customer acquisition programs. We are focused on cross-platform sales and leveraging our local brands in our Broadcasting segment as well. Our Digital sales efforts, particularly local community sales, resulted in a jump of almost 30% in online revenue for our TV stations this quarter.
During the quarter, we had a great example of our TV station showcasing the power of the local brand. The show, The Voice, has done very well in NBC with strong help from Gannett NBC stations and the marketing blitz around the show. Gannett TV stations had an extremely strong showing and dominated the ratings since the show's launch. In the top 25 metered markets for all of NBC stations, Gannett consistently had 3 stations ranked in the top 5 every week. Among all metered markets, Gannett had the 4 highest rated stations on 3 nights and the Gannett station was ranked #1, 6 times.
Driving these outstanding ratings was a marketing effort that included several techniques that went beyond traditional on-air methods. Social media for instance was a critical component, included everything from live chats, to polls to fan's comments on topics like performers, choice of music and judges. Our NBC TV stations built momentum to The Voice by engaging local consumers in different and innovative ways and by providing extra promotional muscle on air, online and using social media.
The success of The Voice demonstrates the impact of Gannett Broadcasting's collective strength and the ability to help push a strong show even further ahead of our competition. 
While the strength of the local brand is critical to the success of our TV stations in their markets, equally important is a stedfast quality on local important -- on local reporting. 
Our NBC affiliate, WGRZ, in Buffalo recently received the 2011 Edward R. Murrow awards for overall news excellence in a small market for doing just that.
Focusing on stories and issues that are of interest to the community, giving reporters the latitude to cover them and affording them the requisite air time are all keys to the award-winning coverage. The right combination of people, commitment to compelling stories and then covering them in depth resulted in solid watchdog journalism that can better a community. And the effort has resulted in improving ratings for the station as well. The power of our local brands, our deep connections to and our knowledge of the communities we serve and our reach within those communities are key differentiators for Deal Chicken, our daily deal site. They will help Deal Chicken more effectively serve both merchants and consumers build long-term relationships that will last beyond the single daily deal.
Another key difference for our product is our ability to combine the discount promotion with several other types of media, including print and online products. The result is a much broader ad campaign and increased potential for repeat customers. Deal Chicken has produced outstanding results in the Phoenix market. It is consistently one of the top 3 daily deal products in the market, and often working its way in the #2 position. We have committed to rolling out the product in 50 of our largest Publishing and Broadcasting markets, and began that rollout early last week with launches in St. Louis, Cincinnati, Detroit, Washington D.C. and Rochester. A business that used Deal Chicken in Phoenix said that it, and I quote, ""worked epically."" That kind of success has resulted in a 41% increase in revenues in the Phoenix market for Deal Chicken from the first quarter to the second quarter. 
I'll touch on just a few of the initiatives that are underway here at the Gannett company. They all have a common thread, our local market presence, knowledge and the ability to leverage and scale it. We continue to stretch and adapt to the consumer and advertiser and those efforts are moving ahead very strongly.
We are confident in our long-term growth, as well as our ability to generate cash flow. We have the financial flexibility and the strength of the balance sheet to resume share repurchases and increase the dividend. And at the same time, we'll  have the ability to invest in future growth opportunities, which is critically important. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gracia."
20571,136887436,141931,"Gannett Co., Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2011",2011-07-18,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Craig, and good morning again. Our second quarter revenue results once again reflect the confluence of several factors. We benefited from the positive impact of our efforts to create new revenue opportunities, particularly in Digital, as well as o",1567,"Thanks, Craig, and good morning again. Our second quarter revenue results once again reflect the confluence of several factors. We benefited from the positive impact of our efforts to create new revenue opportunities, particularly in Digital, as well as overcoming our own terrific success last year generating political ad spending. The economic environment continues to present a headwind with a bit of deceleration here and continuing challenges in the U.K. As a result, total company revenues were $1.33 billion, a 2.2% decline, but a sequential improvement from the first quarter comparisons.
Our expenses were down 1.3% excluding special items as we continue efforts company-wide to be as efficient as possible and well-positioned to benefit when the pace of economic recovery improves. Lower expense levels were achieved in both Publishing and Broadcasting. Digital segment expenses were higher reflecting the substantial revenue growth there and investments in new initiatives. 
As a result, the company generated operating income excluding special items of $257 million and operating cash flow of $307 million. We detailed those special items in the release this morning. 
This quarter, on a pretax basis, approximately $9 million was due to workforce restructuring, while over $6 million related to facility consolidations. 
We had a net tax benefit of over $20 million, related primarily to a tax settlement and other items covering multiple years. In total, that resulted in a $0.04 benefit to reported earnings per share. Results for the second quarter last year included a net tax benefit of almost $29 million or $0.12 per share.
We provided reconciliations of those several non-GAAP items to our GAAP schedules in our release this morning as well. From a cash flow perspective, net cash flow from operating activities totaled $191 million for the quarter and free cash flow totaled $180 million. Through the first half of the year, the company has generated free cash flow of almost $400 million.
Focusing a little more closely on the segments, total Publishing segment revenues were down about 5% in the quarter. That was a better result than first quarter comparisons. In fact, advertising, circulation and other revenue comparisons all improved from first quarter comparisons. Reflecting our focus and investment in circulation, particularly Sundays, circulation revenue was down just 1.7% and trended better within the quarter, finishing in June with less than 0.5% decline. And the good news on the volume front was that in June, total Sunday circulation was actually up 1.2%. 
Digital revenues in Publishing were up over 12%, an increase of almost 9% in online ads at U.S. Community Publishing, contributed to the growth as did a 23% increase in Digital revenue at USA TODAY. 
Domestically, Publishing revenue was about 6% lower. Classified advertising in the U.S. was impacted by the deceleration in the economy. Auto advertising was down about 4%, employment was virtually flat to last year and real estate continues to lag. The decline in real estate advertising this quarter was in line with first quarter comparisons.
While we believe the impact to the auto category across all of our businesses from the earthquake in Japan will be temporary, the housing market issues will take some time to sort themselves out. 
Turning to national advertising in the Publishing segment, it was about 8.5% lower, an increase of almost 3% in pounds at Newsquest, was offset by softer ad demand at USA TODAY. Newsquest benefited early in the quarter from the royal wedding, with national advertising up over 12% in April. At USA TODAY, significant growth in the telecom and financial categories among some others was offset by declines in some other categories.
Retail advertising was down although comparisons both here and in the U.K. were better this quarter than the first quarter. That reflects in part a later Easter. Revenue overall at Newsquest declined about 7% in pounds reflecting again the economic realities there. In the quarter, they did benefit from the royal wedding and the timing of the later Easter as I noticed. 
Overall results were muted during the quarter as consumers are cutting back because of the tough economic climate, worries about rising fuel prices and job uncertainty. So the economic challenges persists and impact our results.
Publishing expenses this quarter were down about 1% but excluding those special items, expenses were almost 3% lower. As noted, the continuous effort to create efficiencies has helped to reduce expenses. Those savings were offset in part by an increase in newsprint expense of over 9%. A declining usage of approximately 9% was more than offset by a 20% increase in newsprint usage prices.
Now focusing for a moment on the current newsprint market, demand for newsprint in North America is down nearly 7% year-to-date with same period no  operating rates below 90%. Producers are trying to manage this imbalance in supply and demand by increasing exports and implementing downtime. Domestic prices have been stable since the third quarter of 2010, although a regional east-west price variance continues. 
Overall, market conditions do not support higher prices as most observers expect news prices to remain flat in the near term. We believe on a best case basis for producers that would be the case.
Although newsprint usage price comparisons in the third quarter this year are expected to continue to be unfavorable, the gap will narrow relative to the second quarter.
Profitability in the Publishing segment was solid once again this quarter as operating income excluding special items was $154 million, and operating cash flow in the same basis totaled $185 million.
Turning to Broadcasting. Revenue was up slightly to $184.4 million, overcoming a net decline of about $9 million in political spending. Growth in Digital revenues and retransmission fees contributed to that achievement. Total television revenue excluding the incremental impact of political spending was over 5% higher. Although revenue growth was impacted by major cancellations by foreign car manufacturers due to the crisis in Japan, higher ad demand in many categories offset the decline in auto. As a result, core TV advertising excluding again the impact of political, was up as well, about 1.5%. 
Digital revenues at our TV stations were 29% higher and reflect our focus on local Digital sales. Broadcasting segment expenses were down about 2%, successful revenue efforts to overcome much higher political spending, as well as lower expenses led to an increase in profitability in Broadcasting. 
Operating income up 3%, totaling $80.4 million and operating cash flow was almost $88 million, an increase of almost 2% despite the difficult comparison. And those difficult comparisons will continue in the third quarter as political spending ramped up to about $21 million in that quarter last year. We expect growth in core advertising, a continued increase in retrans fees and the challenges presented by the Japan crisis abating as the quarter progresses. So based on current trends, we expect the percentage decline in total television revenues for the third quarter to be in the mid-single digits. But excluding the incremental impact of political spending, the percentage increase in total television revenues is expected to be in the mid-single digits in the third quarter.
Again, that's where we are today. There is obviously going to be some volatility, hopefully to the upside as the quarter unfolds. Digital segment revenues were up 13% in the quarter and CareerBuilder delivered yet another strong quarter. Despite a somewhat anemic job picture, CareerBuilder generated strong revenue growth for a variety of reasons, online job listings are growing across all categories, they are no longer just a job site, but rather they are evolving into a true human capital solutions company, and there was a significant revenue increase in their international operations. Digital segment expenses were up over 8%, as a segment have solid revenue growth and made investments in new initiatives. Operating income in the Digital segment was up substantially, almost 32% to $36.2 million, while operating cash flow was 24% higher to $43.8 million. 
As Craig noted, and it bears repeating, Digital revenue company-wide totaled $276 million, a 13% increase and is now 21% of total revenues. 
Let me turn quickly to the balance sheet. As a result of our operations, we generated, as we said strong free cash flow. We reduced debt by $167 million during the quarter to approximately $2 billion. Cash at quarter end was $165 million. Interest expense in the quarter was higher than last year's second quarter as the continuing decline in the average debt balances was offset by higher average rates due to a higher proportion of long-term fixed rate debt. At this point, our rolling cost of debt is approximately 6.6%.
Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio as measured for the covenant test in our credit facilities was reduced to approximately 1.8x at the end of the quarter. One final financial item, CapEx in the quarter were $16.6 million and a little over $29 million year-to-date. 
Before we open the call to your questions, I want to emphasize what Craig said at the beginning of our comments. The capital allocation announcement today underscore our commitment to creating more shareholder value. The strength of our balance sheet, our future growth prospects and the confidence in the company's free cash flow generation enable us to commit to the higher dividend and share repurchases, while maintaining lots of flexibility to invest in our existing businesses and in new opportunities to grow our businesses.
And with that, we'll open it up to questions."

They still have some tough slogging there given significant economic headwinds, I would say, worse than even what we are experiencing here in the U.S. But Paul Davidson and his management team have just done a fabulous job in doing all the right things to manage through these. For them, truly economic downturn, very difficult austerity measures there and a contraction in growth rather than even tepid growth there. So our team there has done a wonderful job in managing through that, both from looking at new revenue opportunities, as well as managing on the cost side.

We think, all of that combined, Michael, is really going to drive this in a positive way. And so that's one side. The other side, we've talked about Deal Chicken as we mentioned, that kicked off just this last week. The initial pieces here, obviously, it's very early to tell, but the response in the number of deals that are coming up already is quite exciting. There was also one deal and I think that really ties to the community, an additional add-on that was done in Washington D.C. by WUSA Television. Allan Horlick, our General Manager there has great relations with the biggest outdoor Wolf Trap opportunity for people to go to events. They had a terrific deal that actually took about $10 off the cost, the Fiddler on the Roof. And from I've heard already this morning, we did have some very, very positive results. So as you look at this, across-the-board, I think you're going to see continued strength as these pieces kick in, as well the additional local community side that Dave Lougee is doing, as well as Bob Dickey.

We are very pleased to announce this morning that the Board of Directors approved a doubling of our quarterly dividend from $0.04 to $0.08, and that we are resuming share repurchases under the $1 billion program",1637,"Thanks, Gracia, and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased to announce this morning that the Board of Directors approved a doubling of our quarterly dividend from $0.04 to $0.08, and that we are resuming share repurchases under the $1 billion program authorized originally in mid-2006. We are committed to creating value for our shareholders and the actions announced today reflect that commitment. 
Over the past couple of years, we have further strengthened our balance sheet by using our free cash flow to aggressively reduce our debt. In addition, we issued longer-term debt to construct a very manageable debt maturity schedule and extend our revolving credit facilities. As we have stated previously, we wanted added clarity on the economy to be in a position to assess the best approach to returning capital to shareholders. We are taking these actions because we have confidence in our long-term growth prospects, our ability to consistently generate free cash flow and our strong financial position.
As importantly, we will continue to have the financial flexibility to invest in our businesses and pursue new opportunities. Regarding the dividend increase, it is the company's 172nd consecutive annual -- or excuse me, quarterly dividend spanning a period of 44 years since the company went public in October of 1967. In terms of share repurchases, we believe at current price levels, our stock is a great investment, and resuming the share repurchases plan underscores that conviction. At this point, we have just over $800 million of remaining authority under the original authorization, and we expect to repurchase up to 100 million of shares over the next 12 months. Of course, as we have noted in the past, our board will regularly reassess these actions as economic and business conditions continue to evolve. 
We see many opportunities for future growth, the Gannett Company is uniquely positioned to capture those opportunities as consumer consumption further increases and media companies adapt to meet this change. 
During the quarter, we continued progress on several fronts, most notably, our cross-platform selling efforts and leveraging the power of our local brands. Before I give you an update on our efforts, let me briefly cover our second quarter results.
Overall, the results reflect the current state of economies here and in the U.K. Strength in some sectors, while in others, a challenging environment for ad demand. Our efforts to sell across platforms and a focus on digital are once again reflected in solid revenue growth in these areas in all of our business segments.
Earnings per diluted share adjusted for special items totaled $0.58. Revenue company-wide was 2% lower for the quarter, due to softer ad demand stemming from the unsteady economy, tough comparisons in our Broadcasting segment and the impact of the crisis in Japan had on auto and consumer electric sectors here in the U.S. 
Revenue results in our Digital segment were very strong again this quarter. Revenue in this segment was up almost 13% in the quarter, driven primarily by very strong results at CareerBuilder, both domestically and internationally.
Digital revenue company-wide advanced 13% as well, reflecting the growth in the Digital segment in addition to solid online revenue growth in both our Broadcasting and Publishing segments. 
Total Digital revenue was $276 million, almost 21% of total company revenues. Digital revenue year-to-date totaled $529 million. Total Broadcasting segment revenues was up slightly. That was quite an achievement given the challenge of overcoming our success and garnering political dollars last year, $12 million in the second quarter alone. 
Strong growth in Digital advertising and a 24% increase in retransmission fees in television contributed to the results. Publishing revenues were down just under 5% and reflect, in large part, the softening economic environment here and particularly in the U.K. While the economy seemed to be improving through the end of last year, growth slipped in many areas of the country. Classified advertising categories were all impacted, including auto and employment.
Real estate advertising demand continues to lag reflecting what is sure to be a slow recovery in housing. Digital revenue growth was a bright spot and the Publishing segment at U.S. Community Publishing, Newsquest and USA TODAY all achieved increases. Expenses company-wide excluding special items declined overall, as we continue our focus on efficiency efforts across all of our businesses.
Our Broadcasting and Digital segments expanded their profitability in the second quarter. The Publishing segment was solidly profitable despite the economic challenges. As I noted, we continued to drive change here at Gannett to adapt to the changing media landscape. This is particularly evident in our approach to a sales process in our local media franchises. A more complex selling environment and our transformation to multimedia organizations calls for a better understanding of our business clients, marketing and communication challenges and a new suite of services that get better results for our customers.
This new environment also opens up new revenue opportunities as we help businesses understand, utilize and reap the benefits of our engaged and loyal audiences. A number of sales initiatives are in the works to create greater value for advertisers, drive differentiation and enhance our sales performance. Gannett client solutions teams in place since the fourth quarter last year are gaining traction. The 4 regional teams collaborate with local sales management to target the highest potential local account and offer them more than traditional reach and frequency. The regional groups have fulfilled marketing needs that extend further into non-traditional advertising avenues. They range from developing mobile apps, to managing social media to event planning, to leveraging database analysis for customer acquisition programs. We are focused on cross-platform sales and leveraging our local brands in our Broadcasting segment as well. Our Digital sales efforts, particularly local community sales, resulted in a jump of almost 30% in online revenue for our TV stations this quarter.
During the quarter, we had a great example of our TV station showcasing the power of the local brand. The show, The Voice, has done very well in NBC with strong help from Gannett NBC stations and the marketing blitz around the show. Gannett TV stations had an extremely strong showing and dominated the ratings since the show's launch. In the top 25 metered markets for all of NBC stations, Gannett consistently had 3 stations ranked in the top 5 every week. Among all metered markets, Gannett had the 4 highest rated stations on 3 nights and the Gannett station was ranked #1, 6 times.
Driving these outstanding ratings was a marketing effort that included several techniques that went beyond traditional on-air methods. Social media for instance was a critical component, included everything from live chats, to polls to fan comments on topics like performers, choice of music and judges. Our NBC TV stations built momentum to The Voice by engaging local consumers in different and innovative ways and by providing extra promotional muscle on air, online and using social media.
The success of The Voice demonstrates the impact of Gannett Broadcasting's collective strength and the ability to help push a strong show even further ahead of our competition. 
While the strength of the local brand is critical to the success of our TV stations in their markets, equally important is a stedfast quality on local important -- on local reporting. 
Our NBC affiliate, WGRZ, in Buffalo recently received the 2011 Edward R. Murrow awards for overall news excellence in a small market for doing just that.
Focusing on stories and issues that are of interest to the community, giving reporters the latitude to cover them and affording them the requisite air time are all keys to the award-winning coverage. The right combination of people, commitment to compelling stories and then covering them in depth resulted in solid watchdog journalism that can better a community. And the effort has resulted in improving ratings for the station as well. The power of our local brands, our deep connections to and our knowledge of the communities we serve and our reach within those communities are key differentiators for Deal Chicken, our daily deal site. They will help Deal Chicken more effectively serve both merchants and consumers build long-term relationships that will last beyond the single daily deal.
Another key difference for our product is our ability to combine the discount promotion with several other types of media, including print and online products. The result is a much broader ad campaign and increased potential for repeat customers. Deal Chicken has produced outstanding results in the Phoenix market. It is consistently one of the top 3 daily deal products in the market, and often working its way in the #2 position. We have committed to rolling out the product in 50 of our largest Publishing and Broadcasting markets, and began that rollout early last week with launches in St. Louis, Cincinnati, Detroit, Washington D.C. and Rochester. A business that used Deal Chicken in Phoenix said that it, and I quote, ""worked epically."" That kind of success has resulted in a 41% increase in revenues in the Phoenix market for Deal Chicken from the first quarter to the second quarter. 
I've touched on just a few of the initiatives that are underway here at the Gannett Company. They all have a common thread, our local market presence, knowledge and the ability to leverage and scale it. We’ve continued to stretch and adapt to the consumer and advertiser and those efforts are moving ahead very strongly.
We are confident in our long-term growth, as well as our ability to generate cash flow. We have the financial flexibility and the strength of the balance sheet to resume share repurchases and increase the dividend. And at the same time, we'll have the ability to invest in future growth opportunities, which is critically important. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gracia."
20571,136887436,142115,"Gannett Co., Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2011",2011-07-18,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Craig, and good morning again. Our second quarter revenue results once again reflect the confluence of several factors.

Our second quarter revenue results once again reflect the confluence of several factors. We benefited from the positive impact of our efforts to create new revenue opportunities, particularly in Digital, as well as overcoming our own terrific success last year generating political ad spending. The economic environment continues to present a headwind with a bit of deceleration here and continuing challenges in the U.K. As a result, total company revenues were $1.33 billion, a 2.2% decline, but a sequential improvement from the first quarter comparisons.
Our expenses were down 1.3% excluding special items as we continue efforts company-wide to be as efficient as possible and well-positioned to benefit when the pace of economic recovery improves. Lower expense levels were achieved in both Publishing and Broadcasting. Digital segment expenses were higher reflecting the substantial revenue growth there and investments in new initiatives. 
As a result, the company generated operating income excluding special items of $257 million and operating cash flow of $307 million. We detailed those special items in the release this morning. 
This quarter, on a pretax basis, approximately $9 million was due to workforce restructuring, while over $6 million related to facility consolidations. 
We had a net tax benefit of over $20 million, related primarily to a tax settlement and other items covering multiple years. In total, that resulted in a $0.04 benefit to reported earnings per share. Results for the second quarter last year included a net tax benefit of almost $29 million or $0.12 per share.
We provided reconciliations of those several non-GAAP items to our GAAP schedules in our release this morning as well. From a cash flow perspective, net cash flow from operating activities totaled $191 million for the quarter and free cash flow totaled $180 million. Through the first half of the year, the company has generated free cash flow of almost $400 million.
Focusing a little more closely on the segments, total Publishing segment revenues were down about 5% in the quarter. That was a better result than first quarter comparisons. In fact, advertising, circulation and other revenue comparisons all improved from first quarter comparisons. Reflecting our focus and investment in circulation, particularly Sundays, circulation revenue was down just 1.7% and trended better within the quarter, finishing in June with less than 0.5% decline. And the good news on the volume front was that in June, total Sunday circulation was actually up 1.2%. 
Digital revenues in Publishing were up over 12%, an increase of almost 9% in online ads at U.S. Community Publishing, contributed to the growth as did a 23% increase in Digital revenue at USA TODAY. 
Domestically, Publishing revenue was about 6% lower. Classified advertising in the U.S. was impacted by the deceleration in the economy. Auto advertising was down about 4%, employment was virtually flat to last year and real estate continues to lag. The decline in real estate advertising this quarter was in line with first quarter comparisons.
While we believe the impact to the auto category across all of our businesses from the earthquake in Japan will be temporary, the housing market issues will take some time to sort themselves out. 
Turning to national advertising in the Publishing segment, it was about 8.5% lower, an increase of almost 3% in pounds at Newsquest, was offset by softer ad demand at USA TODAY. Newsquest benefited early in the quarter from the royal wedding, with national advertising up over 12% in April. At USA TODAY, significant growth in the telecom and financial categories among some others was offset by declines in some other categories.
Retail advertising was down although comparisons both here and in the U.K. were better this quarter than the first quarter. That reflects in part a later Easter. Revenue overall at Newsquest declined about 7% in pounds reflecting again the economic realities there. In the quarter, they did benefit from the royal wedding and the timing of the later Easter as I noticed. 
Overall results were muted during the quarter as consumers are cutting back because of the tough economic climate, worries about rising fuel prices and job uncertainty. So the economic challenges persist and impact our results.
Publishing expenses this quarter were down about 1% but excluding those special items, expenses were almost 3% lower. As noted, the continuous effort to create efficiencies has helped to reduce expenses. Those savings were offset in part by an increase in newsprint expense of over 9%. A declining usage of approximately 9% was more than offset by a 20% increase in newsprint usage prices.
Now focusing for a moment on the current newsprint market, demand for newsprint in North America is down nearly 7% year-to-date with same period no-operating rates below 90%. Producers are trying to manage this imbalance in supply and demand by increasing exports and implementing downtime. Domestic prices have been stable since the third quarter of 2010, although a regional east-west price variance continues. 
Overall, market conditions do not support higher prices as most observers expect news prices to remain flat in the near term. We believe on a best case basis for producers that would be the case.
Although newsprint usage price comparisons in the third quarter of this year are expected to continue to be unfavorable, the gap will narrow relative to the second quarter.
Profitability in the Publishing segment was solid once again this quarter as operating income excluding special items was $154 million, and operating cash flow in the same basis totaled $185 million.
Turning to Broadcasting. Revenue was up slightly to $184.4 million, overcoming a net decline of about $9 million in political spending. Growth in Digital revenues and retransmission fees contributed to that achievement. Total television revenue excluding the incremental impact of political spending was over 5% higher. Although revenue growth was impacted by major cancellations by foreign car manufacturers due to the crisis in Japan, higher ad demand in many categories offset the decline in auto. As a result, core TV advertising excluding again the impact of political, was up as well, about 1.5%. 
Digital revenues at our TV stations were 29% higher and reflect our focus on local Digital sales. Broadcasting segment expenses were down about 2%, successful revenue efforts to overcome much higher political spending, as well as lower expenses led to an increase in profitability in Broadcasting. 
Operating income up 3%, totaling $80.4 million and operating cash flow was almost $88 million, an increase of almost 2% despite the difficult comparison. And those difficult comparisons will continue in the third quarter as political spending ramped up to about $21 million in that quarter last year. We expect growth in core advertising, a continued increase in retrans fees and the challenges presented by the Japan crisis abating as the quarter progresses. So based on current trends, we expect the percentage decline in total television revenues for the third quarter to be in the mid-single digits. But excluding the incremental impact of political spending, the percentage increase in total television revenues is expected to be in the mid-single digits in the third quarter.
Again, that's where we are today. There is obviously going to be some volatility, hopefully to the upside as the quarter unfolds. Digital segment revenues were up 13% in the quarter and CareerBuilder delivered yet another strong quarter. Despite a somewhat anemic job picture, CareerBuilder generated strong revenue growth for a variety of reasons, online job listings are growing across all categories, they are no longer just a job site, but rather they are evolving into a true human capital solutions company, and there was a significant revenue increase in their international operations. Digital segment expenses were up over 8%, as the segment had solid revenue growth and made investments in new initiatives. Operating income in the Digital segment was up substantially, almost 32% to $36.2 million, while operating cash flow was 24% higher to $43.8 million. 
As Craig noted, and it bears repeating, Digital revenue company-wide totaled $276 million, a 13% increase and is now 21% of total revenues. 
Let me turn quickly to the balance sheet. As a result of our operations, we generated, as we said strong free cash flow. We reduced debt by $167 million during the quarter to approximately $2 billion. Cash at quarter end was $165 million. Interest expense in the quarter was higher than last year's second quarter as the continuing decline in the average debt balances was offset by higher average rates due to a higher proportion of long-term fixed rate debt. At this point, our all-in cost of debt is approximately 6.6%.
Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio as measured for the covenant test in our credit facilities was reduced to approximately 1.8x at the end of the quarter. One final financial item, CapEx in the quarter were $16.6 million and a little over $29 million year-to-date. 
Before we open the call to your questions, I want to emphasize what Craig said at the beginning of our comments. The capital allocation announcements today underscore our commitment to creating more shareholder value. The strength of our balance sheet, our future growth prospects and the confidence in the company's free cash flow generation enable us to commit to the higher dividend and share repurchases, while maintaining lots of flexibility to invest in our existing businesses and in new opportunities to grow our businesses.
And with that, we'll open it up to questions."

But at the same time, we have been adding back in key Digital areas, as well as on the Broadcast division. We've been adding folks on the news side, as well as in the sales area. So it's really -- you can't just hone in on one specific division, you have to look at the company in totality and the varying performances in each one of our businesses. And even within U.S. Community Publishing, the varying performances of each of the individual units and the prospects for the economies in those particular markets."

As to our goals on the balance sheet, it is always to maintain a very strong balance sheet. And as we all know, having lived through these last few years, it really depends on what access to capital markets looks like and a variety of other things. So we feel very good about the strength of our balance sheet. It's really phenomenal. We have our debt maturities laddered out very carefully. There's no debt coming due in 2013. But as Craig said, we will continuously look at opportunities to share that free cash flow with our, more directly with our shareholders, as well as have the flexibility as good opportunities, investment opportunities come up to invest in those. So we'll always provide a little bit more flexibility than not in the balance sheet for those things that you can't time when they're going to come up or not, but you have to be just ready to respond when they do come up.

Let me begin by acknowledging Craig Dubow, our and Chairman and CEO, who retired on October 6 due to disability from ongoing health issues. Craig and I worked hand-in-hand for many years, and on behalf of the entire management team and the board, we thank him for his leadership during an extremely challenging time for our industry and the economy more broadly. 
Craig and the management team all maintained a steadfast commitment to serving our customers and their ever-changing media consumption preferences and created a solid foundation for the future. The management team and I share a common vision for the future of Gannett and are passionate about the opportunities ahead. 
Now on today's call, I'm going to update you on some of our strategic initiatives and we'll discuss the financial highlights for the quarter. Paul Saleh, our Chief Financial Officer, will then review our quarterly results in more detail, including the special items we noted in the release as well as some balance sheet items. We'll then open up the call for your questions. 
At Gannett, we continue to focus on 2 fronts: meeting the demands of the changing media landscape while further solidifying our role as the leading source of local news and information through our unique, relevant and highly valued and engaging content. It's our mission to be the destination for consumers however, whenever and wherever they need to be informed and entertained. And to put it even simpler, we want to be there for our consumers and it time and on any device. Our strong, trusted relationships within our communities have been built over decades through an unwavering dedication to serving our consumers and businesses in these communities. 
As a result, we are participants in, and advocates for, our communities. These deep, long-term relationships are rare in media, and we will safeguard and build upon them as we continue to evolve our business is to be more digitally focused. It is through this deep, rich engagement at the local level that we are also able to help our advertisers because we leverage the strength and reach of our tremendous local and national brands to provide effective solutions. 
We are operating from a position of strength with unique assets and attributes, and we recognize that we must continue to accelerate our evolution to fully leverage those strengths. To that end, we have advanced on a number of fronts during the quarter, and I want to highlight some of these efforts. 
At the end of September, we launched Gannett Publishing Services, which combine and centralizes all of our domestic brand production and distribution functions into one organizational structure. This new structure combines several functions, such as imaging and production printing packaging in a variety of other things. These are traditionally been managed division elite and affected the autonomy of our divisional market management teams. This change to insufficient fees within the company, but more importantly, allows us to focus on attracting additional revenues by leveraging our expertise in areas like single copy sales, home delivery and third-party sales. This move will help us better utilize our win capacity and our distribution capabilities nationwide, not just for our own properties but for third parties as well. We expect to create some efficiencies through the centralization as we eliminate some duplicate operations beginning later this year and into the next couple of years. We will certainly keep you posted as that effort progresses. 
And we are working toward a similar goal with the Cincinnati Inquirer. During the quarter, we signed a letter of intent with a Columbus dispatch for the possible printing of the Cincinnati Inquirer and the Kentucky Inquirer in a new, more compact format that would be brighter, more engaging and easier to read. The change provides convenience for consumers and new opportunities for advertisers. This new approach will enhance the user experience by allowing for fuller use of color and photographs and improved readability, while covering the same amount of news as the previous format. 
As I noted before, we are advocates in the communities we serve. In broadcasting, we are showcasing that role with unique content, coupled with our TV stations powerful local brand. Here to, an innovative approach is the linchpin to our success and a good example of that in TV recently is the creation of high-quality, relevant content that aired in primetime across all of our stations and all of the networks that they represent. This was a first for us. The 3 one-hour specials focused on specific medical issues that directly impact many of our lives: obesity, cancer and heart disease. We forged new partnerships with other station groups and the special on stance or cleared 58% of the U.S. households. The content was developed centrally while the advertising and sponsorship opportunities for the shows were sold locally. These programs have a very strong social media component, including a live online chat and Q&A June the program, which further enhanced the audience's engagement with them. That is an aspect of consumer interaction that dovetails particularly well with TV viewership and has become increasingly important and driven higher TV viewership as well. We experienced very good success with this model, and as I said, other non-Gannett stations have picked up on these programs. Look for more of this type of collaboration in the future. 
In our local markets, we continue to focus on providing solutions for our advertisers. I am pleased to say that we are building on the success we had with Yahoo! in our first 9 broadcast markets and are in the process of rolling it out to our remaining TV markets. We are broadening our reach with the Yahoo! partnership and bringing sophisticated targeting solutions to our customers, both current and new. 
In addition, our hyper local community sites bring us additional advertisers that typically would not have advertised on our TV stations. As I said in the past, digital is an increasingly important and rapidly growing part of every part of our business. We are very happy with the progress for instance of our Deal Chicken rollout. The launch has been proceeding as planned with markets hatching on time and performing well. 
In late July, we began the rollout. Currently, we're in 49 markets, and we will certainly meet our expectation of being in over 50 markets by year end. Excluding Phoenix, which was our first market, we have not been live in these markets for very long, in fact, only half has been live for less than a month and only 11 markets have been live for over 2 months. We have nearly completed the investment in talent that we need both centrally and in all of the markets. 
Perhaps most important is the phenomenal collaboration between our central team here in McLane and the local staffs on the ground and establishing these operations across all of those markets. At this point, our total investment has been under $10 million. Clearly, we're still very early in the process but excluding Phoenix, which has been in the market for about a year, for just 2 full months of operation, we are seeing 50% revenue growth month-on-month. 
In Phoenix, gross revenue was about $25,000 in its first month or so. Monthly revenue now is about 10x as much. While the early numbers are not particularly meaningful, we expect the revenue growth rate to push up even further in the fourth quarter. 
Some additional metrics, our opt-in e-mail list has update 1 million names, no small feat given the relatively short time span they have been in operation. Equally impressive is the Deal Chicken as a top 10 visited daily deals site among national sites based on experience here twice, and that test was done closer to the beginning of our launch. Our average deal value has steadily increased, and once again, this product builds on our strong local relationships, our existing local infrastructure as well as our ability to promote Deal Chicken locally across multiple channels, over the air, in print and online. We are excited about these and other strategic initiatives which are moving us aggressively toward our goal of reaching and engaging with our audience in the best way and with the best products. 
Now I'm going to provide some financial highlights for the quarter before I turn it over to Paul to go into some more specifics. Our earnings per share were $0.44 when adjusted for special items. they reflect the positive impact of several strategic initiatives, particularly our digital efforts, but although the challenges of managing our businesses in the midst of a tremendous amount of economic uncertainty and the softening global economy. 
We also had to compare against our own terrific success in garnering political spending last year. Total revenue as a result of all these factors was down about 3.5%. 
An increase in Digital segment revenues was another bright spot, reflecting double-digit revenue growth at CareerBuilder. They continued to capture market share domestically, leading to solid revenue growth, and CareerBuilder's international operations achieved substantially higher revenue growth. Our commitment to multiplatform sales results in a companywide Digital revenues of almost $275 million. That was an increase of about 10% from the third quarter last year and represented 22% of total companywide revenue. 
Year-to-date, we've generated over $800 million revenue for the company, a 12% increase compared to last year. 
Turning for a second to our Broadcasting segment, reported revenue was about 6% lower and again reflects the challenge of comparing to our own great success last year in generating ad spending relating to politics, over $21 million in the third quarter of last year. Total television revenues, when adjusted for that incremental impact of political spending, were up almost 5%. Retransmission revenues and online television revenues were also both up nicely. So a very good quarter for Broadcasting in the face of some tough comparisons due to our strong market positions and ongoing success in taking market share. 
Now based on current trends and comparing against yet another substantial level of political advertising in last year's fourth quarter, we expect the percentage decline in total television revenues for the fourth quarter to be in the very low teens compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Now if I'd exclude again that incremental impact of political spending, total television revenues are expected to increase in the very high single-digits to perhaps 10%, 11% in the fourth quarter compared to the same quarter last year, again reflecting our strong stations as well as continued good execution on the sales front. But as always, I have to caveat that we are early in the quarter and as we all know, pacs can be volatile. So stay tuned and we'll continue to update you as the quarter progresses. 
In the Publishing segment, again a bright spot was the solid increase in Digital revenues. Softening economic conditions however, both here and in the U.K., contributed to a decline in Publishing segment revenues of just over 5%. We face challenges across many of our advertising categories due in part to the Japanese situation that impacted auto advertising and continuing issues with the national housing market that severely tempered real estate advertising. 
At Newsquest, while the economy has made for tough operating conditions, year-over-year, ad category comparisons for all categories improved relative to the first half of the year. 
We again continue to focus on managing costs and lowering expenses companywide, with the goal of creating ongoing efficiencies, while at the same time investing in growth opportunities. 
Importantly, all of our business segments are consistently profitable in the third quarter and Digital revenues and traffic continued to show positive momentum in all of our business segments, again reflecting the success we are having in offering content and solutions across all platforms. 
Overall, our results for the quarter reflect the strength of Gannett's iconic local and national brands and our relentless commitment to continuously enhance the news, information and services we offer every day to the communities we serve. We remain focused on aligning expenses with areas of opportunity while leveraging our great brands, our strong balance sheet and our world-class talent to position Gannett for long-term success. 
We will, as always, manage through the present soft economic environment, but most importantly, we will proactively create a successful future for Gannett. I'm convinced we have the right strategy and the right team in place to continue to remake Gannett in this incredible digital age. 
And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Paul."
20571,141260873,172860,"Gannett Co., Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2011",2011-10-17,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Well, thank you, Gracia. I'll cover our quarterly results in more detail, particularly each of our business segments and have a comment on some balance sheet items. Generated about $1.3 billion of revenues in the quarter. Total expenses, excluding special",1329,"Well, thank you, Gracia. I'll cover our quarterly results in more detail, particularly each of our business segments and have a comment on some balance sheet items. Generated about $1.3 billion of revenues in the quarter. Total expenses, excluding special items, were $1.1 billion, a decline of 2% year-over-year. 
Company remains solidly profitable with operating income excluding special items totaling $207 million. We generated operating cash flow of $256 million. On a GAAP basis, earning per diluted share for the third quarter were $0.41, earning per diluted share excluding special items were $0.44 as Gracia noted. 
In the third quarter, we had about $11 million in pretax, special items as detailed in the release. Reviewing them quickly, we had a charge of approximately $9 million on a pretax basis due to workforce restructuring, which was reflected in operating income. 
On an after-tax basis, this charge represents about $5 million or $0.02 per share. We also recorded a special, non-cash impairment charge of almost $2 million or slightly over $1 million on an after-tax basis for an investment in an online business. This non-cash charge is reflected as a nonoperating item. 
In the third quarter of last year, we had over $31 million in charges associated with workforce restructuring, facility consolidations and intangible asset impairments. These charges totaled about $33 million after-tax or $0.10 per share. All these items are found on Table 5 of our earnings release. 
From a cash flow perspective, net cash flow from operating activities totaled $188 million for the quarter, and free cash flow totaled $176 million, as found on Table 10 of our release. For the first 3 quarters of this year, the company generated free cash flow of over $570 million. 
Turning to our segment results. Total Publishing segment revenues were 5% lower in the quarter, slightly lagging second quarter year-over-year comparisons, reflecting a softer economic environment. Advertising revenues were 8.5% lower. Circulation revenue was down just 1% in the quarter, a slight improvement relative to year-over-year comparisons in both the first quarter and the second quarter and also reflecting our continued efforts to promote Sunday circulation in U.S. community Publishing. 
The demand for our online advertising solutions drove an 8% increase in Publishing segment digital revenues. The gain was driven in large part by an increase of almost 9% in online revenue in U.S. Community Publishing. The largest online categories in U.S. Community Publishing are auto, employment and retail, which represent about 75% of their digital revenue, are all up solidly in the quarter. 
At Newsquest, advertising revenues in pounds was 8% lower, reflecting continued softness in the U.K. economy. However, Newsquest year-over-year ad revenue comparisons were better than second quarter comparisons across all ad categories. 
In the classified categories in the U.S., auto ad demand was just over 5% lower in the quarter due to waning consumer confidence in the economy and the continuous effect of the crisis in Japan. 
Employment advertising was unchanged from last year, although the third quarter comparison improved slightly relative to the second quarter. Decline in the real estate advertising category has been relatively consistent for a number of quarters, reflecting continuing systemic issues in the housing market. 
Classified categories comparison at Newsquest in pounds were better this quarter relative to the second quarter, driven by an 11 percentage point improvement in employment advertising comparisons. 
In the Publishing segment, national advertising was down over 15% in the quarter. National advertising was 7% higher at Newsquest in pounds. The increase was due in part to a national ad campaign associated with the conversion in the U.K. of TV broadcasting from analog to digital that benefited our regional publishers. The conversion is scheduled to be completed by October of next year. That gain was mitigated by continued weakness in the U.S. as a substantial increase in U.S. today's largest category, technology, was more than offset by decline in the auto and entertainment categories. 
Expenses in the Publishing segment were down over 3% year-over-year as we continue to extract cost efficiencies. Newsprint expenses was up slightly in the quarter as an increase in the usage prices was almost offset by lower consumption. 
Newsprint prices have been relatively stable for the last year as softer demand in the U.S. was offset by growth internationally. Still, price conditions in North America could soften as consumption declines. At this point, we expect newsprint expenses to be lower in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with 2010 due to a decline in consumption. 
Operating income in the Publishing segment excluding special items was $117 million, while operating cash flow totaled $147 million and those are found in Table 7 of our earnings release. 
Now turning to the Broadcasting segment. We again faced the challenge of overcoming our own success last year, which included over $21 million of politically-related ad spending. Broadcast revenues totaled $174 million, declining about $11 million or 6%. Total television revenues were up almost 5% in the quarter if you exclude the 11 -- $18 million in incremental political revenues generated last year. 
Our TV stations continue to capture local market share through solid sales initiatives and the strengths of their brands. Growth was achieved in many ad categories, particularly auto, which picked up strongly in September as inventory and supply chain issues began to be resolved. Online advertising solutions at our TV stations continue to draw customers, resulting in a 28% increase in Digital revenues, and higher retransmission revenues which grew 27% in the quarter to $20 million, also contributed to the revenue results. 
Excluding special items, Broadcasting segment expenses were down about 4% this quarter. Operating income totaled approximately $69 million in the quarter. Operating cash flow was $76 million, just $8 million lower compared with the prior year, despite the net decline of $18 million in political spending. These figures can be also found on Table 7 of our earnings release. 
Now turning to the Digital segment. Revenue in our Digital segment were up solidly in the quarter, a little over 10%. Digital segment expenses, excluding special items, were 8% higher, reflecting the pace of revenue growth, as well as continued investments in new Digital initiatives, particularly by CareerBuilder. 
Operating income for the Digital segment excluding special items was $34 million, up 20%. Operating cash flow was 17% higher and totaled $42 million. 
CareerBuilder once again delivered strong results this quarter. Revenue growth at CareerBuilder was up about 15%, driven primarily by solid results domestically as the business continues to build market share. CareerBuilder's international revenue were up strongly as well in the low 40%. 
Although CareerBuilder continues to invest in strategic initiatives, particularly in expanding operations outside the U.S., operating expenses were held in line with revenue growth. Operating cash flow as a result was about 13% higher. 
Companywide Digital revenues, as Gracia noted, totaled $273 million, up 10% in the quarter and represented 21.5% of the total company revenues. 
Now turning to the balance sheet and capital allocation. We generated $176 million of free cash flow this quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to approximately $572 million. We reduced that by $103 million during the quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $1.9 billion of debt outstanding, a debt-to-EBITDA ratio as measured by the covenant test in our credit facilities was reduced to approximately 1.8x at the end of the quarter. Interest expense in the quarter was relatively unchanged compared with the prior year. 
At this point, our all-in cost of debt is approximately 6.9%. 
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.7 million shares at a cost of $28 million. As we indicated when we announced the resumption of the share repurchase program in mid-July, the company expected to repurchase up to $100 million of shares over a 12-month period. 
Cash at quarter end was $196 million. And lastly, capital expenditures in the third quarter totaled about $17 million and $46 million year-to-date. And with that, I will open it up for questions."

Obviously, it's very early in the quarter but overall, we're not seeing anything that is substantially different than what we have seen in the prior quarters. I think there's a little bit of a slight improvement in some of our Publishing businesses",451,"Sure. Obviously, it's very early in the quarter but overall, we're not seeing anything that is substantially different than what we have seen in the prior quarters. I think there's a little bit of a slight improvement in some of our Publishing businesses but nothing substantial that we're seeing thus far. Seeing some slight improvement, obviously, in TV excluding political in some key categories like auto. But again, it's tough to say at this point given we're going to have to wait and see how the holiday season is going to unfold. I think at this point in talking to some consumer product manufacturers, they sense cautious optimism from retailers with an emphasis on cautious. They're waiting to see how the consumer is going to be spending as the holiday season begins to ramp up. Clearly, consumer confidence is going to have an impact. One area of obvious optimism is auto and how that's going to impact our various platforms as well as TV. As you saw or read in our numbers in July and August, obviously that was still fairly muted but now with the Japanese production issues behind us, those issues are winding down, and in fact, in September on the TV side, we saw auto advertising up over 20%. And I think we saw new car sales in September up pretty nicely, up, I think, by about 10%. And what we're hearing out of GM and others is that the consumer is still in the game despite a difficult economy. So we're optimistic on the auto side, and that should have a good impact on all of our platforms, particularly television. As to the fourth quarter and beyond, we will continue to manage as we always have with this company, aligning our expenses against the opportunities we see. I think a good example of that is what I mentioned early in my remarks on the Gannett Publishing Services side where we have combined all of those operations that's going to achieve additional efficiencies. But as importantly, if not more importantly, give us some opportunities to generate revenues by managing it in a consolidated and more aggressive way and going out and looking for opportunities there. I mentioned obviously Cincinnati, where we're looking down the road at the potential consolidation there, the outsourcing of printing and some efficiencies to be realized there. So we're constantly looking at opportunities to be more efficient in what we do, and we continue to believe that, that will be helpful on the newsprint side. Those comparisons are abating as the year has progressed, and as Paul mentioned, we expect newsprint expense to be below last year so that will be helpful as well."

So that's where the lion's share of our focus is on is improving that top line irrespective of how the economy plays out over the next couple of years, to position ourselves when the economy does return to a more normalized environment if there is such a thing these days.

In third quarter, in the careers resources category, in the total traffic year-to-year growth up about 14% year-over-year that we've retained. And there's just some other numbers that we look at that, for instance, through the second quarter, CareerBuilder's North American network revenue was $310 million, which exceeded #2's North America revenue by about $66 million. So we track traffic, we track expressions of interest, we track total revenues. And on all of those metrics, our team at CareerBuilder sees good improvement over the rest of the players in the market. And then on the international side, obviously in 2009 and early 2010, there was not a lot of effort and dollars expended, given the global economic situation that prevailed at that point. But we have selectively made some small acquisitions. We've improved those results as we've been in many of the markets that we are in internationally year-over-year. And so we see, again with having the Microsoft exclusive on traffic overseas, we see that as a great opportunity to continue to expand upon our international offerings there. And as Paul mentioned, we saw a terrific revenue growth overseas, albeit from a small base but that's a real area of opportunity for us going forward."

Let me begin by acknowledging Craig Dubow, our former Chairman and CEO, who retired on October 6 due to disability from ongoing health issues. Craig and I worked hand-in-hand for many years, and on behalf of the entire management team and the board, we thank him for his leadership during an extremely challenging time for our industry and the economy more broadly. 
Craig and the management team all maintained a steadfast commitment to serving our customers and their ever-changing media consumption preferences and created a solid foundation for the future. The management team and I share a common vision for the future of Gannett and are passionate about the opportunities ahead. 
Now on today's call, I'm going to update you on some of our strategic initiatives, and we'll discuss some financial highlights for the quarter. Paul Saleh, our Chief Financial Officer, will then review our quarterly results in more detail, including the special items we noted in the release, as well as some balance sheet items. We'll then open up the call for your questions. 
At Gannett, we continue to focus on 2 fronts: meeting the demands of the changing media landscape while further solidifying our role as the leading source of local news and information through our unique, relevant and highly valued and engaging content. It's our mission to be the destination for consumers however, whenever and wherever they want to be informed and entertained. And to put it even simpler, we want to be there for our consumers anytime and on any device. Our strong, trusted relationships within our communities have been built over decades through an unwavering dedication to serving our consumers and businesses in these communities. 
As a result, we are participants in and advocates for our communities. These deep, long-term relationships are rare in media, and we will safeguard and build upon them as we continue to evolve our businesses to be more digitally focused. It is through this deep, rich engagement at the local level that we are also able to help our advertisers because we leverage the strength and reach of our tremendous local and national brands to provide effective solutions. 
We are operating from a position of strength with unique assets and attributes, and we recognize that we must continue to accelerate our evolution to fully leverage those strengths. To that end, we have advanced on a number of fronts during the quarter, and I want to highlight some of these efforts. 
At the end of September, we launched Gannett Publishing Services, which combines and centralizes all of our domestic print production and distribution functions into one organizational structure. This new structure combines several functions, such as imaging, ad production, printing, packaging and a variety of other things. These have traditionally been managed divisionally and reflected the autonomy of our divisional market management teams. This change creates sufficient fees within the company, but more importantly, allows us to focus on attracting additional revenues by leveraging our expertise in areas like single copy sales, home delivery and third-party sales. This move will help us better utilize our print capacity and our distribution capabilities nationwide, not just for our own properties but for third parties as well. We expect to create some efficiencies through the centralization as we eliminate some duplicate operations beginning later this year and into the next couple of years. We will certainly keep you posted as that effort progresses. 
And we are working toward a similar goal with the Cincinnati Enquirer. During the quarter, we signed a letter of intent with The Columbus Dispatch for the possible printing of the Cincinnati Enquirer and the Kentucky Enquirer in a new, more compact format that will be brighter, more engaging and easier to read. The change provides convenience for consumers and new opportunities for advertisers. This new approach would enhance the user experience by allowing for fuller use of color and photographs and improved readability, while covering the same amount of news as the previous format. 
As I noted before, we are advocates in the communities we serve. In broadcasting, we are showcasing that role with unique content, coupled with our TV station's powerful local brands. Hereto an innovative approach is the linchpin to our success, and a good example of that in TV recently is the creation of high-quality, relevant content that aired in primetime across all of our stations and all of the networks that they represent. 
This was a first for us. The 3 1-hour specials focused on specific medical issues that directly impact many of our lives: obesity, cancer and heart disease. We forged new partnerships with other station groups, and the special on cancer cleared 58% of the U.S. households. The content was developed centrally, while the advertising and sponsorship opportunities for the shows were sold locally. These programs have a very strong social media component, including a live online chat and Q&A during the program, which further enhanced the audience's engagement with them. That is an aspect of consumer interaction that dovetails particularly well with TV viewership and has become increasingly important and driven higher TV viewership as well. We experienced very good success with this model, and as I said, other non-Gannett stations have picked up on these programs. Look for more of this type of collaboration in the future. 
In our local markets, we continue to focus on providing solutions for our advertisers. I am pleased to say that we are building on the success we had with Yahoo! in our first 9 broadcast markets and are in the process of rolling it out to our remaining TV markets. We are broadening our reach with the Yahoo! partnership and bringing sophisticated targeting solutions to our customers, both current and new. 
In addition, our hyper local community sites bring us additional advertisers that typically would not have advertised on our TV stations. As I said in the past, digital is an increasingly important and rapidly growing part of every part of our business. We are very happy with the progress for instance of our Deal Chicken rollout. The launch has been proceeding as planned with markets hatching on time and performing well. 
In late July, we began the rollout. Currently, we are in 49 markets, and we will certainly meet our expectation of being in over 50 markets by year end. Excluding Phoenix, which was our first market, we have not been live in these markets for very long. In fact, almost half have been live for less than a month, and only 11 markets have been live for over 2 months. We have nearly completed the investment in talent that we need both centrally and in all of the markets. 
Perhaps most important is the phenomenal collaboration between our central team here in McLean and the local staffs on the ground and establishing these operations across all of those markets. At this point, our total investment has been under $10 million. Clearly, we're still very early in the process, but excluding Phoenix, which has been in the market for about a year, for just 2 full months of operation, we are seeing 50% revenue growth month-on-month. 
In Phoenix, gross revenue was about $25,000 in its first month or so. Monthly revenue now is about 10x as much. While the early numbers are not particularly meaningful, we expect the revenue growth rate to push up even further in the fourth quarter. 
Some additional metrics, our opt-in e-mail list has exceeded 1 million names, no small feat given the relatively short time span they have been in operation. Equally impressive is the Deal Chicken as a top 10 visited daily deals site among national sites based on experience hit-wise, and that was done closer to the beginning of our launch. Our average deal value has steadily increased, and once again, this product builds on our strong local relationships, our existing local infrastructure, as well as our ability to promote Deal Chicken locally across multiple channels: over the air, in print and online. We are excited about these and other strategic initiatives which are moving us aggressively toward our goal of reaching and engaging with our audience in the best way and with the best products. 
Now I'm going to provide some financial highlights for the quarter before I turn it to Paul to go into some more specifics. Our earnings per share were $0.44 when adjusted for special items. They reflect the positive impact of several strategic initiatives, particularly our digital efforts, but also the challenges of managing our businesses in the midst of a tremendous amount of economic uncertainty and the softening global economy. 
We also had to compare against our own terrific success in garnering political spending last year. Total revenue as a result of all these factors was down about 3.5%. 
An increase in Digital segment revenues was another bright spot, reflecting double-digit revenue growth at CareerBuilder. They continued to capture market share domestically, leading to solid revenue growth, and CareerBuilder's international operations achieved substantially higher revenue growth. Our commitment to multi-platform sales resulted in companywide Digital revenues of almost $275 million. That was an increase of about 10% from the third quarter last year and represented 22% of total companywide revenue. 
Year-to-date, we've generated over $800 million in Digital [ph] revenue for the company, a 12% increase compared to last year. 
Turning for a second to our Broadcasting segment. Reported revenue was about 6% lower and again reflects the challenge of comparing to our own great success last year in generating ad spending related to politics, over $21 million in the third quarter of last year. Total television revenues, when adjusted for that incremental impact of political spending, were up almost 5%. Retransmission revenues and online television revenues were also both up nicely. So a very good quarter for Broadcasting in the face of some tough comparisons due to our strong market positions and ongoing success in taking market share. 
Now based on current trends and comparing against yet another substantial level of political advertising in last year's fourth quarter, we expect the percentage decline in total television revenues for the fourth quarter to be in the very low teens compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Now if I exclude again the incremental impact of political spending, total television revenues are expected to increase in the very high single-digits to perhaps 10%, 11% in the fourth quarter compared to the same quarter last year, again, reflecting our strong stations, as well as continued good execution on the sales front. But as always, I have to caveat that we are early in the quarter, and as we all know, pacing can be volatile. So stay tuned, and we'll continue to update you as the quarter progresses. 
In the Publishing segment, again, a bright spot was the solid increase in Digital revenues. Softening economic conditions however, both here and in the U.K., contributed to a decline in Publishing segment revenues of just over 5%. We face challenges across many of our advertising categories due in part to the Japanese situation that impacted auto advertising and continuing issues with the national housing market that severely tempered real estate advertising. 
At Newsquest, while the economy has made for tough operating conditions, year-over-year, ad category comparisons for all categories improved relative to the first half of the year. 
We again continue to focus on managing costs and lowering expenses companywide, with the goal of creating ongoing efficiencies, while at the same time, investing in growth opportunities. 
Importantly, all of our business segments are consistently profitable in the third quarter, and Digital revenues and traffic continued to show positive momentum in all of our business segments, again, reflecting the success we are having in offering content and solutions across all platforms. 
Overall, our results for the quarter reflect the strength of Gannett's iconic local and national brands and our relentless commitment to continuously enhance the news, information and services we offer every day to the communities we serve. We remain focused on aligning expenses with areas of opportunity while leveraging our great brands, our strong balance sheet and our world-class talent to position Gannett for long-term success. 
We will, as always, manage through the present soft economic environment, but most importantly, we will proactively create a successful future for Gannett. I'm convinced we have the right strategy and the right team in place to continue to remake Gannett in this incredible digital age. 
And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Paul."
20571,141260873,172922,"Gannett Co., Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2011",2011-10-17,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Well, thank you, Gracia. I'll cover our quarterly results in more detail, particularly each of our business segments, and I will comment on some balance sheet items. Generated about $1.3 billion in revenues in the quarter. Total expenses, excluding specia",1328,"Well, thank you, Gracia. I'll cover our quarterly results in more detail, particularly each of our business segments, and I will comment on some balance sheet items. Generated about $1.3 billion in revenues in the quarter. Total expenses, excluding special items, were $1.1 billion, a decline of 2% year-over-year. 
Company remains solidly profitable with operating income excluding special items totaling $207 million. We generated operating cash flow of $256 million. On a GAAP basis, earning per diluted share for the third quarter were $0.41. Earning per diluted share excluding special items were $0.44 as Gracia noted. 
In the third quarter, we had about $11 million in pretax, special items as detailed in the release. Reviewing them quickly, we had a charge of approximately $9 million on a pretax basis due to workforce restructuring, which was reflected in operating income. 
On an after-tax basis, this charge represents about $5 million or $0.02 per share. We also recorded a special, non-cash impairment charge of almost $2 million or slightly over $1 million on an after-tax basis for an investment in an online business. This non-cash charge is reflected as a non-operating item. 
In the third quarter of last year, we had over $31 million in charges associated with workforce restructuring, facility consolidations and intangible asset impairments. These charges totaled about $23 million after-tax or $0.10 per share. All these items are found on Table 5 of our earnings release. 
From a cash flow perspective, net cash flow from operating activities totaled $188 million for the quarter, and free cash flow totaled $176 million as found on Table 10 of our release. For the first 3 quarters of this year, the company generated free cash flow of over $570 million. 
Turning to our segment results. Total Publishing segment revenues were 5% lower in the quarter, slightly lagging second quarter year-over-year comparisons, reflecting a softer economic environment. Advertising revenues were 8.5% lower. Circulation revenue was down just 1% in the quarter, a slight improvement relative to year-over-year comparisons in both the first quarter and the second quarter and also reflecting our continued efforts to promote Sunday circulation in U.S. Community Publishing. 
The demand for our online advertising solutions drove an 8% increase in Publishing segment digital revenues. The gain was driven in large part by an increase of almost 9% in online revenue in U.S. Community Publishing. The largest online categories in U.S. Community Publishing: auto, employment and retail, which represent about 75% of their digital revenue, are all up solidly in the quarter. 
At Newsquest, advertising revenues in pounds was 8% lower, reflecting continued softness in the U.K. economy. However, Newsquest year-over-year ad revenue comparisons were better than second quarter comparisons across all ad categories. 
In the classified categories in the U.S., auto ad demand was just over 5% lower in the quarter due to waning consumer confidence in the economy and the continuous effect of the crisis in Japan. 
Employment advertising was unchanged from last year, although the third quarter comparison improved slightly relative to the second quarter. Decline in the real estate advertising category has been relatively consistent for a number of quarters, reflecting continuing systemic issues in the housing market. 
Classified categories comparison at Newsquest in pounds were better this quarter relative to the second quarter, driven by an 11 percentage point improvement in employment advertising comparisons. 
In the Publishing segment, national advertising was down over 15% in the quarter. National advertising was 7% higher at Newsquest in pounds. The increase was due in part to a national ad campaign associated with the conversion in the U.K. of TV broadcasting from analog to digital that benefited our regional publishers. The conversion is scheduled to be completed by October of next year. That gain was mitigated by continued weakness in the U.S. as a substantial increase in US TODAY's largest category, technology, was more than offset by decline in the auto and entertainment categories. 
Expenses in the Publishing segment were down over 3% year-over-year as we continue to extract cost efficiencies. Newsprint expenses was up slightly in the quarter as an increase in the usage prices was almost offset by lower consumption. 
Newsprint prices have been relatively stable for the last year as softer demand in the U.S. was offset by growth internationally. Still, price conditions in North America could soften as consumption declines. At this point, we expect newsprint expenses to be lower in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with 2010 due to a decline in consumption. 
Operating income in the Publishing segment excluding special items was $117 million, while operating cash flow totaled $147 million. And those are found in Table 7 of our earnings release. 
Now turning to the Broadcasting segment. We again faced the challenge of overcoming our own success last year, which included over $21 million of politically-related ad spending. Broadcast revenues totaled $174 million, declining about $11 million or 6%. Total television revenues were up almost 5% in the quarter if you exclude the 11 -- $18 million in incremental political revenues generated last year. 
Our TV stations continue to capture local market share through solid sales initiatives and the strengths of their brands. Growth was achieved in many ad categories, particularly auto, which picked up strongly in September as inventory and supply chain issues began to be resolved. Online advertising solutions at our TV stations continued to draw customers, resulting in a 28% increase in Digital revenues. And higher retransmission revenues, which grew 27% in the quarter to $20 million, also contributed to the revenue results. 
Excluding special items, Broadcasting segment expenses were down about 4% this quarter. Operating income totaled approximately $69 million in the quarter. Operating cash flow was $76 million, just $8 million lower compared with the prior year despite the net decline of $18 million in political spending. These figures can be also found on Table 7 of our earnings release. 
Now turning to the Digital segment. Revenue in our Digital segment were up solidly in the quarter, a little over 10%. Digital segment expenses excluding special items were 8% higher, reflecting the pace of revenue growth, as well as continued investments in new Digital initiatives, particularly by CareerBuilder. 
Operating income for the Digital segment excluding special items was $34 million, up 20%. Operating cash flow was 17% higher and totaled $42 million. 
CareerBuilder once again delivered strong results this quarter. Revenue growth at CareerBuilder was up about 15%, driven primarily by solid results domestically as the business continues to build market share. CareerBuilder's international revenue were up strongly as well in the low 40%. 
Although CareerBuilder continues to invest in strategic initiatives, particularly in expanding operations outside the U.S., operating expenses were held in line with revenue growth. Operating cash flow as a result was about 13% higher. 
Companywide Digital revenues, as Gracia noted, totaled $273 million, up 10% in the quarter and represented 21.5% of the total company revenues. 
Now turning to the balance sheet and capital allocation. We generated $176 million of free cash flow this quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to approximately $572 million. We've reduced that by $103 million during the quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $1.9 billion of debt outstanding. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as measured by the covenant test in our credit facilities, was reduced to approximately 1.8x at the end of the quarter. Interest expense in the quarter was relatively unchanged compared with the prior year. At this point, our all-in cost of debt is approximately 6.9%. 
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.7 million shares at a cost of $28 million. As we indicated when we announced the resumption of the share repurchase program in mid-July, the company expected to repurchase up to $100 million of shares over a 12-month period. 
Cash at quarter end was $196 million. And lastly, capital expenditures in the third quarter totaled about $17 million and $46 million year-to-date. 
And with that, I will open it up for questions."

Alexia, obviously, it's very early in the quarter, but overall, we're not seeing anything that is substantially different than what we have seen in the prior quarters. I think there's a little bit of a slight improvement in some of our Publishing businesses but nothing substantial that we're seeing thus far. Seeing some slight improvement, obviously, in TV excluding political in some key categories like auto. But again, it's tough to say at this point given we're going to have to wait and see how the holiday season is going to unfold. I think at this point in talking to some consumer product manufacturers, they sense cautious optimism from retailers with an emphasis on cautious. They're waiting to see how the consumer is going to be spending as the holiday season begins to ramp up. Clearly, consumer confidence is going to have an impact. One area of obvious optimism is auto and how that's going to impact our various platforms, as well as TV. As you saw or read in our numbers in July and August, obviously, that was still fairly muted, but now with the Japanese production issues behind us, those issues are winding down. And in fact, in September on the TV side, we saw auto advertising up over 20%. And I think we saw a new car sales in September up pretty nicely, up, I think, about 10%. And what we're hearing out of GM and others is that the consumer is still in the game despite a difficult economy. So we're optimistic on the auto side, and that should have a good impact on all of our platforms, particularly television. As to the fourth quarter and beyond, we will continue to manage as we always have with this company, aligning our expenses against the opportunities we see. I think a good example of that is what I mentioned early in my remarks on the Gannett Publishing Services side where we have combined all of those operations that's going to achieve additional efficiencies, but as importantly, if not more importantly, give us some opportunities to generate revenues by managing it in a consolidated and more aggressive way in going out and looking for opportunities there. I mentioned obviously Cincinnati where we're looking down the road at the potential consolidation there, the outsourcing of printing and some efficiencies to be realized there. So we're constantly looking at opportunities to be more efficient in what we do, and we continue to believe that, that will be helpful on the newsprint side. Those comparisons are abating as the year has progressed, and as Paul mentioned, we expect newsprint expense to be below last year so that will be helpful as well."

I think as we look at the metrics, and frankly, Monster has not obviously published its third quarter numbers. But when we look at the numbers through the second quarter, what we noticed is that the share that we have compared to the #2 user were about 57% higher in average unique visitors. In third quarter, in the careers resources category, in the total traffic year-over-year growth, up about 14% year-over-year that we've retained. And there's just some other numbers that we look at that, for instance, through the second quarter, CareerBuilder's North American network revenue was $310 million, which exceeded #2's North America revenue by about $66 million. So we track traffic, we track expressions of interest, we track total revenues. And on all of those metrics, our team at CareerBuilder sees good improvement over the rest of the players in the market. And then on the international side, obviously in 2009 and early 2010, there was not a lot of effort and dollars expended, given the global economic situation that prevailed at that point. But we have selectively made some small acquisitions. We've improved due to results as we've been in many of the markets that we are in internationally year-over-year. And so we see -- again, with having the Microsoft exclusive on traffic overseas, we see that as a great opportunity to continue to expand upon our international offerings there. And as Paul mentioned, we saw a terrific revenue growth overseas, albeit from a small base, but that's a real area of opportunity for us going forward."

Craig and I worked hand-in-hand for many years, and on behalf of the entire management team and the board, we thank him for his leadership during an extremely challenging time for our industry and the economy more broadly. 
Craig and the management team all maintained a steadfast commitment to serving our customers and their ever-changing media consumption preferences and created a solid foundation for the future. The management team and I share a common vision for the future of Gannett and are passionate about the opportunities ahead. 
Now on today's call, I'm going to update you on some of our strategic initiatives, and we'll discuss some financial highlights for the quarter. Paul Saleh, our Chief Financial Officer, will then review our quarterly results in more detail, including the special items we noted in the release, as well as some balance sheet items. We'll then open up the call for your questions. 
At Gannett, we continue to focus on 2 fronts: meeting the demands of the changing media landscape while further solidifying our role as the leading source of local news and information through our unique, relevant and highly valued and engaging content. It's our mission to be the destination for consumers however, whenever and wherever they want to be informed and entertained. And to put it even simpler, we want to be there for our consumers anytime and on any device. Our strong, trusted relationships within our communities have been built over decades through an unwavering dedication to serving our consumers and businesses in these communities. 
As a result, we are participants in and advocates for our communities. These deep, long-term relationships are rare in media, and we will safeguard and build upon them as we continue to evolve our businesses to be more digitally focused. It is through this deep, rich engagement at the local level that we are also able to help our advertisers because we leverage the strength and reach of our tremendous local and national brands to provide effective solutions. 
We are operating from a position of strength with unique assets and attributes, and we recognize that we must continue to accelerate our evolution to fully leverage those strengths. To that end, we have advanced on a number of fronts during the quarter, and I want to highlight some of these efforts. 
At the end of September, we launched Gannett Publishing Services, which combines and centralizes all of our domestic print production and distribution functions into one organizational structure. This new structure combines several functions, such as imaging, ad production, printing, packaging and a variety of other things. These have traditionally been managed divisionally and reflected the autonomy of our divisional market management teams. This change creates efficiencies within the company, but more importantly, allows us to focus on attracting additional revenues by leveraging our expertise in areas like single-copy sales, home delivery and third-party sales. This move will help us better utilize our print capacity and our distribution capabilities nationwide, not just for our own properties but for third parties as well. We expect to create some efficiencies through the centralization as we eliminate some duplicate operations beginning later this year and into the next couple of years. We will certainly keep you posted as that effort progresses. 
And we are working toward a similar goal with the Cincinnati Enquirer. During the quarter, we signed a letter of intent with The Columbus Dispatch for the possible printing of the Cincinnati Enquirer and the Kentucky Enquirer in a new, more compact format that will be brighter, more engaging and easier to read. The change provides convenience for consumers and new opportunities for advertisers. This new approach would enhance the user experience by allowing for fuller use of color and photographs and improved readability, while covering the same amount of news as the previous format. 
As I noted before, we are advocates in the communities we serve. In broadcasting, we are showcasing that role with unique content, coupled with our TV stations' powerful local brands. Here, too, an innovative approach is the linchpin to our success, and a good example of that in TV recently is the creation of high-quality, relevant content that aired in prime time across all of our stations and all of the networks that they represent. 
This was a first for us. The 3 1-hour specials focused on specific medical issues that directly impact many of our lives: obesity, cancer and heart disease. We forged new partnerships with other station groups, and the special on cancer cleared 58% of the U.S. households. The content was developed centrally, while the advertising and sponsorship opportunities for the shows were sold locally. These programs have a very strong social media component, including a live online chat and Q&A during the program, which further enhanced the audience's engagement with them. That is an aspect of consumer interaction that dovetails particularly well with TV viewership and has become increasingly important and driven higher TV viewership as well. We experienced very good success with this model, and as I said, other non-Gannett stations have picked up on these programs. Look for more of this type of collaboration in the future. 
In our local markets, we continue to focus on providing solutions for our advertisers. I am pleased to say that we are building on the success we had with Yahoo! in our first 9 broadcast markets and are in the process of rolling it out to our remaining TV markets. We are broadening our reach with the Yahoo! partnership and bringing sophisticated targeting solutions to our customers, both current and new. 
In addition, our hyperlocal community sites bring us additional advertisers that typically would not have advertised on our TV stations. As I said in the past, digital is an increasingly important and rapidly growing part of every part of our business. We are very happy with the progress, for instance, of our Deal Chicken rollout. The launch has been proceeding as planned with markets hatching on time and performing well. 
In late July, we began the rollout. Currently, we are in 49 markets, and we will certainly meet our expectation of being in over 50 markets by year end. Excluding Phoenix, which was our first market, we have not been live in these markets for very long. In fact, almost half have been live for less than a month, and only 11 markets have been live for over 2 months. We have nearly completed the investment in talent that we need both centrally and in all of the markets. 
Perhaps most important is the phenomenal collaboration between our central team here in McLean and the local staffs on the ground in establishing these operations across all of those markets. At this point, our total investment has been under $10 million. Clearly, we're still very early in the process, but excluding Phoenix, which has been in the market for about a year, for just 2 full months of operation, we are seeing 50% revenue growth month-on-month. 
In Phoenix, gross revenue was about $25,000 in its first month or so. Monthly revenue now is about 10x as much. While the early numbers are not particularly meaningful, we expect the revenue growth rate to push up even further in the fourth quarter. 
Some additional metrics. Our opt-in e-mail list has exceeded 1 million names, no small feat given the relatively short time span they have been in operation. Equally impressive is that Deal Chicken is a top 10 visited daily deals site among national sites based on experience hit-wise, and that list was done closer to the beginning of our launch. Our average deal value has steadily increased, and once again, this product builds on our strong local relationships, our existing local infrastructure, as well as our ability to promote Deal Chicken locally across multiple channels: over the air, in print and online. We are excited about these and other strategic initiatives which are moving us aggressively toward our goal of reaching and engaging with our audience in the best way and with the best products. 
Now I'm going to provide some financial highlights for the quarter before I turn it to Paul to go into some more specifics. Our earnings per share were $0.44 when adjusted for special items. They reflect the positive impact of several strategic initiatives, particularly our digital efforts, but also the challenges of managing our businesses in the midst of a tremendous amount of economic uncertainty and the softening global economy. 
We also had to compare against our own terrific success in garnering political spending last year. Total revenue as a result of all these factors was down about 3.5%. 
An increase in Digital segment revenues was another bright spot, reflecting double-digit revenue growth at CareerBuilder. They continued to capture market share domestically, leading to solid revenue growth, and CareerBuilder's international operations achieved substantially higher revenue growth. Our commitment to multi-platform sales resulted in company-wide Digital revenues of almost $275 million. That was an increase of about 10% from the third quarter last year and represented 22% of total company-wide revenue. 
Year-to-date, we've generated over $800 million in Digital revenue for the company, a 12% increase compared to last year. 
Turning for a second to our Broadcasting segment. Reported revenue was about 6% lower and again reflects the challenge of comparing to our own great success last year in generating ad spending related to politics, over $21 million in the third quarter of last year. Total television revenues, when adjusted for that incremental impact of political spending, were up almost 5%. Retransmission revenues and online television revenues were also both up nicely. So a very good quarter for Broadcasting in the face of some tough comparisons due to our strong market positions and ongoing success in taking market share. 
Now based on current trends and comparing against yet another substantial level of political advertising in last year's fourth quarter, we expect the percentage decline in total television revenues for the fourth quarter to be in the very low teens compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Now if I exclude again the incremental impact of political spending, total television revenues are expected to increase in the very high single-digits to perhaps 10%, 11% in the fourth quarter compared to the same quarter last year, again reflecting our strong stations, as well as continued good execution on the sales front. But as always, I have to caveat that we are early in the quarter, and as we all know, pacing can be volatile. So stay tuned, and we'll continue to update you as the quarter progresses. 
In the Publishing segment, again, a bright spot was the solid increase in Digital revenues. Softening economic conditions however, both here and in the U.K., contributed to a decline in Publishing segment revenues of just over 5%. We face challenges across many of our advertising categories due in part to the Japanese situation that impacted auto advertising and continuing issues with the national housing market that severely tempered real estate advertising. 
At Newsquest, while the economy has made for tough operating conditions, year-over-year ad category comparisons for all categories improved relative to the first half of the year. 
We again continue to focus on managing costs and lowering expenses company-wide, with the goal of creating ongoing efficiencies, while at the same time investing in growth opportunities. 
Importantly, all of our business segments are consistently profitable in the third quarter, and Digital revenues and traffic continued to show positive momentum in all of our business segments, again reflecting the success we are having in offering content and solutions across all platforms. 
Overall, our results for the quarter reflect the strength of Gannett's iconic local and national brands and our relentless commitment to continuously enhance the news, information and services we offer every day to the communities we serve. We remain focused on aligning expenses with areas of opportunity while leveraging our great brands, our strong balance sheet and our world-class talent to position Gannett for long-term success. 
We will, as always, manage through the present soft economic environment, but most importantly, we will proactively create a successful future for Gannett. I'm convinced we have the right strategy and the right team in place to continue to remake Gannett in this incredible digital age. 
And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Paul."
20571,141260873,173004,"Gannett Co., Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2011",2011-10-17,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Well, thank you, Gracia. I'll cover our quarterly results in more detail, particularly each of our business segments, and I will comment on some balance sheet items. Generated about $1.3 billion in revenues in the quarter. Total expenses, excluding specia",1329,"Well, thank you, Gracia. I'll cover our quarterly results in more detail, particularly each of our business segments, and I will comment on some balance sheet items. Generated about $1.3 billion in revenues in the quarter. Total expenses, excluding special items, were $1.1 billion, a decline of 2% year-over-year. 
Company remains solidly profitable, with operating income excluding special items totaling $207 million. We generated operating cash flow of $256 million. On a GAAP basis, earning per diluted share for the third quarter were $0.41. Earning per diluted share excluding special items were $0.44, as Gracia noted. 
In the third quarter, we had about $11 million in pretax special items as detailed in the release. Reviewing them quickly, we had a charge of approximately $9 million on a pretax basis due to workforce restructuring, which was reflected in operating income. 
On an after-tax basis, this charge represents about $5 million or $0.02 per share. We also recorded a special non-cash impairment charge of almost $2 million or slightly over $1 million on an after-tax basis for an investment in an online business. This non-cash charge is reflected as a non-operating item. 
In the third quarter of last year, we had over $31 million in charges associated with workforce restructuring, facility consolidations and intangible asset impairments. These charges totaled about $23 million after tax or $0.10 per share. All these items are found on Table 5 of our earnings release. 
From a cash flow perspective, net cash flow from operating activities totaled $188 million for the quarter, and free cash flow totaled $176 million, as found on Table 10 of our release. For the first 3 quarters of this year, the company generated free cash flow of over $570 million. 
Turning to our segment results. Total Publishing segment revenues were 5% lower in the quarter, slightly lagging second quarter year-over-year comparisons, reflecting a softer economic environment. Advertising revenues were 8.5% lower. Circulation revenue was down just 1% in the quarter, a slight improvement relative to year-over-year comparisons in both the first quarter and the second quarter and also reflecting our continued efforts to promote Sunday circulation in U.S. Community Publishing. 
The demand for our online advertising solutions drove an 8% increase in Publishing segment digital revenues. The gain was driven in large part by an increase of almost 9% in online revenue in U.S. Community Publishing. The largest online categories in U.S. Community Publishing: auto, employment and retail, which represent about 75% of their digital revenue, are all up solidly in the quarter. 
At Newsquest, advertising revenues in pounds was 8% lower, reflecting continued softness in the U.K. economy. However, Newsquest year-over-year ad revenue comparisons were better than second quarter comparisons across all ad categories. 
In the classified categories in the U.S., auto ad demand was just over 5% lower in the quarter due to waning consumer confidence in the economy and the continuous effect of the crisis in Japan. 
Employment advertising was unchanged from last year, although the third quarter comparison improved slightly relative to the second quarter. Decline in the real estate advertising category has been relatively consistent for a number of quarters, reflecting continuing systemic issues in the housing market. 
Classified categories comparison at Newsquest in pounds were better this quarter relative to the second quarter, driven by an 11 percentage point improvement in employment advertising comparisons. 
In the Publishing segment, national advertising was down over 15% in the quarter. National advertising was 7% higher at Newsquest in pounds. The increase was due in part to a national ad campaign associated with the conversion in the U.K. of TV broadcasting from analog to digital that benefited our regional publishers. The conversion is scheduled to be completed by October of next year. That gain was mitigated by continued weakness in the U.S. as a substantial increase in US TODAY's largest category, technology, was more than offset by decline in the auto and entertainment categories. 
Expenses in the Publishing segment were down over 3% year-over-year as we continue to extract cost efficiencies. Newsprint expenses was up slightly in the quarter as an increase in the usage prices was almost offset by lower consumption. 
Newsprint prices have been relatively stable for the last year as softer demand in the U.S. was offset by growth internationally. Still, price conditions in North America could soften as consumption declines. At this point, we expect newsprint expenses to be lower in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with 2010 due to a decline in consumption. 
Operating income in the Publishing segment excluding special items was $117 million, while operating cash flow totaled $147 million. And those are found in Table 7 of our earnings release. 
Now turning to the Broadcasting segment. We again faced the challenge of overcoming our own success last year, which included over $21 million of politically-related ad spending. Broadcast revenues totaled $174 million, declining about $11 million or 6%. Total television revenues were up almost 5% in the quarter if you exclude the 11 -- $18 million in incremental political revenues generated last year. 
Our TV stations continue to capture local market share through solid sales initiatives and the strengths of their brands. Growth was achieved in many ad categories, particularly auto, which picked up strongly in September as inventory and supply chain issues began to be resolved. Online advertising solutions at our TV stations continued to draw customers, resulting in a 28% increase in Digital revenues. And higher retransmission revenues, which grew 27% in the quarter to $20 million, also contributed to the revenue results. 
Excluding special items, Broadcasting segment expenses were down about 4% this quarter. Operating income totaled approximately $69 million in the quarter. Operating cash flow was $76 million, just $8 million lower compared with the prior year despite the net decline of $18 million in political spending. These figures can be also found on Table 7 of our earnings release. 
Now turning to the Digital segment. Revenue in our Digital segment were up solidly in the quarter, a little over 10%. Digital segment expenses excluding special items were 8% higher, reflecting the pace of revenue growth, as well as continued investments in new Digital initiatives, particularly by CareerBuilder. 
Operating income for the Digital segment excluding special items was $34 million, up 20%. Operating cash flow was 17% higher and totaled $42 million. 
CareerBuilder once again delivered strong results this quarter. Revenue growth at CareerBuilder was up about 15%, driven primarily by solid results domestically as the business continues to build market share. CareerBuilder's international revenue were up strongly as well, in the low 40%. 
Although CareerBuilder continues to invest in strategic initiatives, particularly in expanding operations outside the U.S., operating expenses were held in line with revenue growth. Operating cash flow as a result was about 13% higher. 
Company-wide Digital revenues, as Gracia noted, totaled $273 million, up 10% in the quarter and represented 21.5% of the total company revenues. 
Now turning to the balance sheet and capital allocation. We generated $176 million of free cash flow this quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to approximately $572 million. We've reduced that by $103 million during the quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $1.9 billion of debt outstanding. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as measured by the covenant test in our credit facilities, was reduced to approximately 1.8x at the end of the quarter. Interest expense in the quarter was relatively unchanged compared with the prior year. At this point, our all-in cost of debt is approximately 6.9%. 
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.7 million shares at a cost of $28 million. As we indicated when we announced the resumption of the share repurchase program in mid-July, the company expected to repurchase up to $100 million of shares over a 12-month period. 
Cash at quarter end was $196 million. And lastly, capital expenditures in the third quarter totaled about $17 million and $46 million year-to-date. 
And with that, I will open it up for questions."

Alexia, obviously, it's very early in the quarter, but overall, we're not seeing anything that is substantially different than what we have seen in the prior quarters. I think there's a little bit of a slight improvement in some of our Publishing businesses but nothing substantial that we're seeing thus far. Seeing some slight improvement, obviously, in TV excluding political in some key categories like auto. But again, it's tough to say at this point given we're going to have to wait and see how the holiday season is going to unfold. I think at this point in talking to some consumer product manufacturers, they sense cautious optimism from retailers with an emphasis on cautious. They're waiting to see how the consumer is going to be spending as the holiday season begins to ramp up. Clearly, consumer confidence is going to have an impact. One area of obvious optimism is auto and how that's going to impact our various platforms, as well as TV. As you saw or read in our numbers in July and August, obviously, that was still fairly muted, but now with the Japanese production issues behind us, those issues are winding down. And in fact, in September on the TV side, we saw auto advertising up over 20%. And I think we saw new car sales in September up pretty nicely, up, I think, about 10%. And what we're hearing out of GM and others is that the consumer is still in the game despite a difficult economy. So we're optimistic on the auto side, and that should have a good impact on all of our platforms, particularly television. As to the fourth quarter and beyond, we will continue to manage as we always have at this company, aligning our expenses against the opportunities we see. I think a good example of that is what I mentioned early in my remarks on the Gannett Publishing Services side, where we have combined all of those operations. That's going to achieve additional efficiencies, but as importantly, if not more importantly, give us some opportunities to generate revenues by managing it in a consolidated and more aggressive way in going out and looking for opportunities there. I mentioned, obviously, Cincinnati where we're looking down the road at the potential consolidation there, the outsourcing of printing and some efficiencies to be realized there. So we're constantly looking at opportunities to be more efficient in what we do, and we continue to believe that, that will be helpful on the newsprint side. Those comparisons are abating as the year has progressed. And as Paul mentioned, we expect newsprint expense to be below last year, so that will be helpful as well."

So that's where the lion's share of our focus is on, is improving that top line, irrespective of how the economy plays out over the next couple of years, to position ourselves when the economy does return to a more normalized environment, if there is such a thing these days. But from an expense perspective, we are continuously realigning, as I said earlier, our expenses to make sure they are in the areas of the most opportunity for us. Our expenses aren't going to be even quarter-to-quarter because there are going to be certain opportunities from quarter-to-quarter to invest in.

We also are looking at a variety of things, as I mentioned earlier, from a product perspective to improve the user experience, the design and the functionality of a number of our websites just as we did last year when we rolled out Odyssey and saw a very nice pickup in traffic to our websites.

But when we look at the numbers through the second quarter, what we notice is that the share that we have compared to the #2 user, we're about 57% higher in average unique visitors. In third quarter, in the careers resources category, in the total traffic year-over-year growth, up about 14% year-over-year that we've attained. And there's just some other numbers that we look at that -- for instance, through the second quarter, CareerBuilder's North American network revenue was $310 million, which exceeded #2's North America revenue by about $66 million. So we track traffic, we track expressions of interest, we track total revenues. And on all of those metrics, our team at CareerBuilder sees good improvement over the rest of the players in the market. And then on the international side, obviously in 2009 and early 2010, there was not a lot of effort and dollars expended, given the global economic situation that prevailed at that point. But we have selectively made some small acquisitions. We've improved the results as we've been in many of the markets that we are in internationally year-over-year. And so we see -- again, with having the Microsoft exclusive on traffic overseas, we see that as a great opportunity to continue to expand upon our international offerings there. And as Paul mentioned, we saw a terrific revenue growth overseas, albeit from a small base, but that's a real area of opportunity for us going forward."

Let me begin by acknowledging Craig Dubow, our former Chairman and CEO, who retired on October 6 due to disability from ongoing health issues. Craig and I worked hand-in-hand for many years, and on behalf of the entire management team and the board, we thank him for his leadership during an extremely challenging time for our industry and the economy more broadly. 
Craig and the management team all maintained a steadfast commitment to serving our customers and their ever-changing media consumption preferences and created a solid foundation for the future. The management team and I share a common vision for the future of Gannett and are passionate about the opportunities ahead. 
Now on today's call, I'm going to update you on some of our strategic initiatives, and we'll discuss some financial highlights for the quarter. Paul Saleh, our Chief Financial Officer, will then review our quarterly results in more detail, including the special items we noted in the release, as well as some balance sheet items. We'll then open up the call for your questions. 
At Gannett, we continue to focus on 2 fronts: meeting the demands of the changing media landscape while further solidifying our role as the leading source of local news and information through our unique, relevant and highly valued and engaging content. It's our mission to be the destination for consumers however, whenever and wherever they want to be informed and entertained. And to put it even simpler, we want to be there for our consumers anytime and on any device. Our strong, trusted relationships within our communities have been built over decades through an unwavering dedication to serving our consumers and businesses in these communities. 
As a result, we are participants in and advocates for our communities. These deep, long-term relationships are rare in media, and we will safeguard and build upon them as we continue to evolve our businesses to be more digitally focused. It is through this deep, rich engagement at the local level that we are also able to help our advertisers because we leverage the strength and reach of our tremendous local and national brands to provide effective solutions. 
We are operating from a position of strength with unique assets and attributes, and we recognize that we must continue to accelerate our evolution to fully leverage those strengths. To that end, we have advanced on a number of fronts during the quarter, and I want to highlight some of these efforts. 
At the end of September, we launched Gannett Publishing Services, which combines and centralizes all of our domestic print production and distribution functions into one organizational structure. This new structure combines several functions, such as imaging, ad production, printing, packaging and a variety of other things. These have traditionally been managed divisionally and reflected the autonomy of our divisional market management teams. This change creates efficiencies within the company, but more importantly, allows us to focus on attracting additional revenues by leveraging our expertise in areas like single-copy sales, home delivery and third-party sales. This move will help us better utilize our print capacity and our distribution capabilities nationwide, not just for our own properties but for third parties as well. We expect to create some efficiencies through the centralization as we eliminate some duplicate operations beginning later this year and into the next couple of years. We will certainly keep you posted as that effort progresses. 
And we are working toward a similar goal with the Cincinnati Enquirer. During the quarter, we signed a letter of intent with The Columbus Dispatch for the possible printing of the Cincinnati Enquirer and the Kentucky Enquirer in a new, more compact format that will be brighter, more engaging and easier to read. The change provides convenience for consumers and new opportunities for advertisers. This new approach would enhance the user experience by allowing for fuller use of color and photographs and improved readability, while covering the same amount of news as the previous format. 
As I noted before, we are advocates in the communities we serve. In broadcasting, we are showcasing that role with unique content, coupled with our TV stations' powerful local brands. Here, too, an innovative approach is the linchpin to our success, and a good example of that in TV recently is the creation of high-quality, relevant content that aired in prime time across all of our stations and all of the networks that they represent. 
This was a first for us. The 3 1-hour specials focused on specific medical issues that directly impact many of our lives: obesity, cancer and heart disease. We forged new partnerships with other station groups, and the special on cancer cleared 58% of the U.S. households. The content was developed centrally, while the advertising and sponsorship opportunities for the shows were sold locally. These programs have a very strong social media component, including a live online chat and Q&A during the program, which further enhanced the audience's engagement with them. That is an aspect of consumer interaction that dovetails particularly well with TV viewership and has become increasingly important and driven higher TV viewership as well. We experienced very good success with this model, and as I said, other non-Gannett stations have picked up on these programs. Look for more of this type of collaboration in the future. 
In our local markets, we continue to focus on providing solutions for our advertisers. I am pleased to say that we are building on the success we had with Yahoo! in our first 9 broadcast markets and are in the process of rolling it out to our remaining TV markets. We are broadening our reach with the Yahoo! partnership and bringing sophisticated targeting solutions to our customers, both current and new. 
In addition, our hyperlocal community sites bring us additional advertisers that typically would not have advertised on our TV stations. As I said in the past, digital is an increasingly important and rapidly growing part of every part of our business. We are very happy with the progress, for instance, of our Deal Chicken rollout. The launch has been proceeding as planned with markets hatching on time and performing well. 
In late July, we began the rollout. Currently, we are in 49 markets, and we will certainly meet our expectation of being in over 50 markets by year end. Excluding Phoenix, which was our first market, we have not been live in these markets for very long. In fact, almost half have been live for less than a month, and only 11 markets have been live for over 2 months. We have nearly completed the investment in talent that we need both centrally and in all of the markets. 
Perhaps most important is the phenomenal collaboration between our central team here in McLean and the local staffs on the ground in establishing these operations across all of those markets. At this point, our total investment has been under $10 million. Clearly, we're still very early in the process, but excluding Phoenix, which has been in the market for about a year, for just 2 full months of operation, we are seeing 50% revenue growth month-on-month. 
In Phoenix, gross revenue was about $25,000 in its first month or so. Monthly revenue now is about 10x as much. While the early numbers are not particularly meaningful, we expect the revenue growth rate to push up even further in the fourth quarter. 
Some additional metrics. Our opt-in e-mail list has exceeded 1 million names, no small feat given the relatively short time span they have been in operation. Equally impressive is that Deal Chicken is a top 10 visited daily deals site among national sites based on experience hit-wise, and that list was done closer to the beginning of our launch. Our average deal value has steadily increased, and once again, this product builds on our strong local relationships, our existing local infrastructure, as well as our ability to promote Deal Chicken locally across multiple channels: over the air, in print and online. We are excited about these and other strategic initiatives which are moving us aggressively toward our goal of reaching and engaging with our audience in the best way and with the best products. 
Now I'm going to provide some financial highlights for the quarter before I turn it to Paul to go into some more specifics. Our earnings per share were $0.44 when adjusted for special items. They reflect the positive impact of several strategic initiatives, particularly our digital efforts, but also the challenges of managing our businesses in the midst of a tremendous amount of economic uncertainty and the softening global economy. 
We also had to compare against our own terrific success in garnering political spending last year. Total revenue as a result of all these factors was down about 3.5%. 
An increase in Digital segment revenues was another bright spot, reflecting double-digit revenue growth at CareerBuilder. They continued to capture market share domestically, leading to solid revenue growth, and CareerBuilder's international operations achieved substantially higher revenue growth. Our commitment to multi-platform sales resulted in company-wide Digital revenues of almost $275 million. That was an increase of about 10% from the third quarter last year and represented 22% of total company-wide revenue. 
Year-to-date, we've generated over $800 million in Digital revenue for the company, a 12% increase compared to last year. 
Turning for a second to our Broadcasting segment. Reported revenue was about 6% lower and again reflects the challenge of comparing to our own great success last year in generating ad spending related to politics, over $21 million in the third quarter of last year. Total television revenues, when adjusted for that incremental impact of political spending, were up almost 5%. Retransmission revenues and online television revenues were also both up nicely. So a very good quarter for Broadcasting in the face of some tough comparisons due to our strong market positions and ongoing success in taking market share. 
Now based on current trends and comparing against yet another substantial level of political advertising in last year's fourth quarter, we expect the percentage decline in total television revenues for the fourth quarter to be in the very low teens compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Now if I exclude again the incremental impact of political spending, total television revenues are expected to increase in the very high single-digits to perhaps 10%, 11% in the fourth quarter compared to the same quarter last year, again reflecting our strong stations, as well as continued good execution on the sales front. But as always, I have to caveat that we are early in the quarter, and as we all know, pacing can be volatile. So stay tuned, and we'll continue to update you as the quarter progresses. 
In the Publishing segment, again, a bright spot was the solid increase in Digital revenues. Softening economic conditions however, both here and in the U.K., contributed to a decline in Publishing segment revenues of just over 5%. We face challenges across many of our advertising categories due in part to the Japanese situation that impacted auto advertising and continuing issues with the national housing market that severely tempered real estate advertising. 
At Newsquest, while the economy has made for tough operating conditions, year-over-year ad category comparisons for all categories improved relative to the first half of the year. 
We again continue to focus on managing costs and lowering expenses company-wide, with the goal of creating ongoing efficiencies, while at the same time investing in growth opportunities. 
Importantly, all of our business segments are consistently profitable in the third quarter, and Digital revenues and traffic continued to show positive momentum in all of our business segments, again reflecting the success we are having in offering content and solutions across all platforms. 
Overall, our results for the quarter reflect the strength of Gannett's iconic local and national brands and our relentless commitment to continuously enhance the news, information and services we offer every day to the communities we serve. We remain focused on aligning expenses with areas of opportunity while leveraging our great brands, our strong balance sheet and our world-class talent to position Gannett for long-term success. 
We will, as always, manage through the present soft economic environment, but most importantly, we will proactively create a successful future for Gannett. I'm convinced we have the right strategy and the right team in place to continue to remake Gannett in this incredible digital age. 
And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Paul."
20571,141260873,173127,"Gannett Co., Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2011",2011-10-17,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Well, thank you, Gracia. I'll cover our quarterly results in more detail, particularly each of our business segments, and I will comment on some balance sheet items. Generated about $1.3 billion in revenues in the quarter. Total expenses, excluding specia",1329,"Well, thank you, Gracia. I'll cover our quarterly results in more detail, particularly each of our business segments, and I will comment on some balance sheet items. Generated about $1.3 billion in revenues in the quarter. Total expenses, excluding special items, were $1.1 billion, a decline of 2% year-over-year. 
Company remains solidly profitable, with operating income excluding special items totaling $207 million. We generated operating cash flow of $256 million. On a GAAP basis, earning per diluted share for the third quarter were $0.41. Earning per diluted share excluding special items were $0.44, as Gracia noted. 
In the third quarter, we had about $11 million in pretax special items as detailed in the release. Reviewing them quickly, we had a charge of approximately $9 million on a pretax basis due to workforce restructuring, which was reflected in operating income. 
On an after-tax basis, this charge represents about $5 million or $0.02 per share. We also recorded a special non-cash impairment charge of almost $2 million or slightly over $1 million on an after-tax basis for an investment in an online business. This non-cash charge is reflected as a non-operating item. 
In the third quarter of last year, we had over $31 million in charges associated with workforce restructuring, facility consolidations and intangible asset impairments. These charges totaled about $23 million after tax or $0.10 per share. All these items are found on Table 5 of our earnings release. 
From a cash flow perspective, net cash flow from operating activities totaled $188 million for the quarter, and free cash flow totaled $176 million, as found on Table 10 of our release. For the first 3 quarters of this year, the company generated free cash flow of over $570 million. 
Turning to our segment results. Total Publishing segment revenues were 5% lower in the quarter, slightly lagging second quarter year-over-year comparisons, reflecting a softer economic environment. Advertising revenues were 8.5% lower. Circulation revenue was down just 1% in the quarter, a slight improvement relative to year-over-year comparisons in both the first quarter and the second quarter and also reflecting our continued efforts to promote Sunday circulation in U.S. Community Publishing. 
The demand for our online advertising solutions drove an 8% increase in Publishing segment digital revenues. The gain was driven in large part by an increase of almost 9% in online revenue in U.S. Community Publishing. The largest online categories in U.S. Community Publishing: auto, employment and retail, which represent about 75% of their digital revenue, are all up solidly in the quarter. 
At Newsquest, advertising revenues in pounds was 8% lower, reflecting continued softness in the U.K. economy. However, Newsquest year-over-year ad revenue comparisons were better than second quarter comparisons across all ad categories. 
In the classified categories in the U.S., auto ad demand was just over 5% lower in the quarter due to waning consumer confidence in the economy and the continuous effect of the crisis in Japan. 
Employment advertising was unchanged from last year, although the third quarter comparison improved slightly relative to the second quarter. Decline in the real estate advertising category has been relatively consistent for a number of quarters, reflecting continuing systemic issues in the housing market. 
Classified categories comparison at Newsquest in pounds were better this quarter relative to the second quarter, driven by an 11 percentage point improvement in employment advertising comparisons. 
In the Publishing segment, national advertising was down over 15% in the quarter. National advertising was 7% higher at Newsquest in pounds. The increase was due in part to a national ad campaign associated with the conversion in the U.K. of TV broadcasting from analog to digital that benefited our regional publishers. The conversion is scheduled to be completed by October of next year. That gain was mitigated by continued weakness in the U.S. as a substantial increase in US TODAY's largest category, technology, was more than offset by decline in the auto and entertainment categories. 
Expenses in the Publishing segment were down over 3% year-over-year as we continue to extract cost efficiencies. Newsprint expenses was up slightly in the quarter as an increase in the usage prices was almost offset by lower consumption. 
Newsprint prices have been relatively stable for the last year as softer demand in the U.S. was offset by growth internationally. Still, price conditions in North America could soften as consumption declines. At this point, we expect newsprint expenses to be lower in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with 2010 due to a decline in consumption. 
Operating income in the Publishing segment excluding special items was $117 million, while operating cash flow totaled $147 million. And those are found in Table 7 of our earnings release. 
Now turning to the Broadcasting segment. We again faced the challenge of overcoming our own success last year, which included over $21 million of politically-related ad spending. Broadcast revenues totaled $174 million, declining about $11 million or 6%. Total television revenues were up almost 5% in the quarter if you exclude the 11 -- $18 million in incremental political revenues generated last year. 
Our TV stations continue to capture local market share through solid sales initiatives and the strengths of their brands. Growth was achieved in many ad categories, particularly auto, which picked up strongly in September as inventory and supply chain issues began to be resolved. Online advertising solutions at our TV stations continued to draw customers, resulting in a 28% increase in Digital revenues. And higher retransmission revenues, which grew 27% in the quarter to $20 million, also contributed to the revenue results. 
Excluding special items, Broadcasting segment expenses were down about 4% this quarter. Operating income totaled approximately $69 million in the quarter. Operating cash flow was $76 million, just $8 million lower compared with the prior year despite the net decline of $18 million in political spending. These figures can be also found on Table 7 of our earnings release. 
Now turning to the Digital segment. Revenue in our Digital segment were up solidly in the quarter, a little over 10%. Digital segment expenses excluding special items were 8% higher, reflecting the pace of revenue growth, as well as continued investments in new Digital initiatives, particularly by CareerBuilder. 
Operating income for the Digital segment excluding special items was $34 million, up 20%. Operating cash flow was 17% higher and totaled $42 million. 
CareerBuilder once again delivered strong results this quarter. Revenue growth at CareerBuilder was up about 15%, driven primarily by solid results domestically as the business continues to build market share. CareerBuilder's international revenue were up strongly as well, in the low 40%. 
Although CareerBuilder continues to invest in strategic initiatives, particularly in expanding operations outside the U.S., operating expenses were held in line with revenue growth. Operating cash flow as a result was about 13% higher. 
Company-wide Digital revenues, as Gracia noted, totaled $273 million, up 10% in the quarter and represented 21.5% of the total company revenues. 
Now turning to the balance sheet and capital allocation. We generated $176 million of free cash flow this quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to approximately $572 million. We've reduced that by $103 million during the quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $1.9 billion of debt outstanding. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as measured by the covenant test in our credit facilities, was reduced to approximately 1.8x at the end of the quarter. Interest expense in the quarter was relatively unchanged compared with the prior year. At this point, our all-in cost of debt is approximately 6.9%. 
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.7 million shares at a cost of $28 million. As we indicated when we announced the resumption of the share repurchase program in mid-July, the company expected to repurchase up to $100 million of shares over a 12-month period. 
Cash at quarter end was $196 million. And lastly, capital expenditures in the third quarter totaled about $17 million and $46 million year-to-date. 
And with that, I will open it up for questions."

Alexia, obviously, it's very early in the quarter, but overall, we're not seeing anything that is substantially different than what we have seen in the prior quarters. I think there's a little bit of a slight improvement in some of our Publishing businesses but nothing substantial that we're seeing thus far. Seeing some slight improvement, obviously, in TV excluding political in some key categories like auto. But again, it's tough to say at this point given we're going to have to wait and see how the holiday season is going to unfold. I think at this point in talking to some consumer product manufacturers, they sense cautious optimism from retailers with an emphasis on cautious. They're waiting to see how the consumer is going to be spending as the holiday season begins to ramp up. Clearly, consumer confidence is going to have an impact. One area of obvious optimism is auto and how that's going to impact our various platforms, as well as TV. As you saw or read in our numbers in July and August, obviously, that was still fairly muted, but now with the Japanese production issues behind us, those issues are winding down. And in fact, in September on the TV side, we saw auto advertising up over 20%. And I think we saw new car sales in September up pretty nicely, up, I think, about 10%. And what we're hearing out of GM and others is that the consumer is still in the game despite a difficult economy. So we're optimistic on the auto side, and that should have a good impact on all of our platforms, particularly television. As to the fourth quarter and beyond, we will continue to manage as we always have at this company, aligning our expenses against the opportunities we see. I think a good example of that is what I mentioned early in my remarks on the Gannett Publishing Services side, where we have combined all of those operations. That's going to achieve additional efficiencies, but as importantly, if not more importantly, give us some opportunities to generate revenues by managing it in a consolidated and more aggressive way in going out and looking for opportunities there. I mentioned, obviously, Cincinnati where we're looking down the road at the potential consolidation there, the outsourcing of printing and some efficiencies to be realized there. So we're constantly looking at opportunities to be more efficient in what we do, and we continue to believe that, that will be helpful on the newsprint side. Those comparisons are abating as the year has progressed. And as Paul mentioned, we expect newsprint expense to be below last year, so that will be helpful as well."

I think as we look at the metrics -- and frankly, Monster has not obviously published its third quarter numbers. But when we look at the numbers through the second quarter, what we notice is that the share that we have compared to the #2 user, we're about 57% higher in average unique visitors. In third quarter, in the careers resources category, in the total traffic year-over-year growth, up about 14% year-over-year that we've attained. And there's just some other numbers that we look at that -- for instance, through the second quarter, CareerBuilder's North American network revenue was $310 million, which exceeded #2's North America revenue by about $66 million. So we track traffic, we track expressions of interest, we track total revenues. And on all of those metrics, our team at CareerBuilder sees good improvement over the rest of the players in the market. And then on the international side, obviously in 2009 and early 2010, there was not a lot of effort and dollars expended, given the global economic situation that prevailed at that point. But we have selectively made some small acquisitions. We've improved the results as we've been in many of the markets that we are in internationally year-over-year. And so we see -- again, with having the Microsoft exclusive on traffic overseas, we see that as a great opportunity to continue to expand upon our international offerings there. And as Paul mentioned, we saw a terrific revenue growth overseas, albeit from a small base, but that's a real area of opportunity for us going forward."
