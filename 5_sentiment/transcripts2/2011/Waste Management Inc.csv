We had a very good fourth quarter, earning $0.60 per share, an increase of over 15% compared to the $0.52 we earned in the prior-year quarter. Our Collection, Landfill and Recycling businesses all performed very",1359,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning from Houston. We had a very good fourth quarter, earning $0.60 per share, an increase of over 15% compared to the $0.52 we earned in the prior-year quarter. Our Collection, Landfill and Recycling businesses all performed very solidly. We increased operating earnings and improved operating margins in each of these lines of business. Revenue increased by $181 million or 6% from the prior-year period. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. 
Our revenue improvement was driven by better Recycling commodity prices, acquisitions and year-over-year increases and revenue growth from yield. On the pricing front, the fourth quarter was our strongest quarter of the year. Internal revenue growth from yield on a Collection and Disposal operations was 2.6% in the fourth quarter. We remain committed to our pricing discipline and in the fourth quarter, we again overcame the pricing headwind we faced on the roughly 40% of our Collection revenue that has price adjustments based on a CPI index.
CPI adjustment have caused a drag to our revenue growth from yield of approximately 40 basis points in the quarter and about 70 basis points for the year. So for both the quarter and the full year, we outpaced our long-term pricing objective to achieve price increases in the range of 50 to 100 basis points above CPI on our entire Collection and Disposal business.
The combined internal revenue growth from yield in the industrial, commercial and residential lines of our Collection business was 3.1% in the fourth quarter. Internal revenue growth from yield was 3.5% in both our commercial and industrial lines. While internal revenue growth from yield on our residential line of business was 2.2%.
Commercial new business pricing increased for the sixth consecutive quarter. Service increases, net of service decreases, were slightly negative for the quarter but improved significantly compared with the prior-year quarter. The winter quarters are typically the weakest for the year for service increases, net of decreases.
On the volume side of the business, internal revenue growth from volume in our Collection and Disposal business declined by 1.8% in the quarter. At the end of October, volumes were trending such that we expected volumes to be flat or slightly up for the quarter. However, the severe winter weather we saw in December negatively impacted volumes. Also impacting volumes were contract losses in our residential line of business and a slowing in the rate of growth in the special waste plant volumes.
For the fourth quarter, Commercial and Residential Collection lines saw declines of 5% and 5.9%, respectively. In our Industrial line of business, internal revenue growth from volume was down 3%, an improvement from prior quarters. Our strong pricing in our traditional Solid Waste Collection business overcame these volume losses and drove margin improvement. Overall, in the fourth quarter, we grew Collection income from operations margin by 220 basis points compared with the prior-year period.
In the Landfill side of the business, fourth quarter 2010 internal revenue growth from volume was positive 4.3%, which is the best quarterly performance for the year and the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year volume improvement. Internal revenue growth from volume for special waste was positive 12.5%. For MSW, internal revenue growth from volume was negative 5%. In our C&D line, internal revenue growth from volume was flat, which is the best performance since the fourth quarter of 2008.
On the Landfill pricing front, MSW per unit pricing was up by 2.4%, reflecting our continued focus on Landfill pricing. So our Landfill business also improved significantly in the quarter and we continue to see a strong pipeline for special waste volumes.
Overall, we grew income from operations in the Landfill line of business and increased the income from operations margin by 190 basis points compared with the prior-year period. 
When we look at our Collection and Landfill line of businesses combined, income from operations grew approximately 12% compared with the fourth quarter of 2009 and our income from operations margin improved by 210 basis points.
Turning to our Recycling business. Increased commodity prices contributed about $0.04 of positive year-over-year earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2010. For 2011, we expect Recycling commodity sales prices to have a slightly positive year-over-year impact on earnings per share. Average electricity sales prices at our waste-to-energy plants were flat in the fourth quarter. For 2011, we expect average electricity sales prices to be similar to 2010 levels and therefore we do not expect electricity sales prices to significantly impact earnings in 2011 compared with 2010.
Looking at volumes in 2011, we expect them to be flat to slightly positive, with volumes steadily improving throughout the year. Certainly the severe winter weather in the first quarter of 2011 have affected in volumes and expect this to have a negative impact on first quarter earnings. But starting in the second quarter of 2011, we expect volumes to resume the previous trend of slow but steady improvement. With respect to price, CPI is running at about approximately 1% and we expect CPI headwinds in our Residential and Franchise business to continue.
We've also seen more competitive pricing on new residential municipal contracts. So the pricing headwinds in 2011 will come primarily from our Residential line of business. We will continue to aggressively push Industrial, Commercial and Landfill prices. As a result, we expect our overall yield in 2011 to be 2%.
Our waste-to-energy operations are expected to have a negative impact of about $28 million on earnings in the first half of 2011 compared with 2010, primarily from upgrades being made at our recently acquired waste-to-energy plant in Virginia. Our waste-to-energy operations are expected to have a positive impact of about $11 million in the second half of 2011. We expect increased labor costs due primarily to annual merit increases, which will add approximately $65 million to 2011 expenses. We're planning to increase expenses be up to $50 million for information technology upgrades, startup costs associated with new cost-saving programs and customer-focused growth initiatives. Interest expense is expected to increase approximately $25 million principally because of higher fees and rates from the revolving credit facility that was executed in June of 2010.
We've previously discussed certain growth initiatives that had negative $0.03 impact to earnings in the third quarter. The headwinds in those initiatives are about the same and the fourth quarter. We expect to see the results from these initiatives continue to negatively impact earnings in the first half of the year but to turn positive by the end of the year. So when we look ahead to 2011, we'll face some headwinds, mostly in the first half of the year. But our strategy remains clear. We'll remain committed to our pricing discipline while at the same time investing in the future.
In looking at our first quarter, our preliminary data shows that January 2011 earnings were basically flat year-over-year, driven by negative volumes from and startup spending on new cost-reduction initiatives that will be implemented in 2011. The negative volumes were driven by the severe winter weather experienced throughout North America and we expect that to abate as we enter the spring season and to improve throughout the year.
We've also begun to bring in internal and external resources to develop cost-saving plans and the spending on those resources are not yet offset by savings. We expect the savings to begin to occur in the second half of the year and to accelerate in 2012. So earnings improvement will be muted in the first half of the year and pick up in the second half of the year. Overall, we estimate our 2011 fully diluted earnings to be between $2.24 and $2.30 per share.
In summary, our results in the fourth quarter build strong momentum going into 2011. Our entire organization is aligned around our pricing and cost savings strategies. This will serve us well in accomplishing our goals of growing our revenue, expanding our operating margins, increasing our return on invested capital, increasing our free cash flow and returning cash to our shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

These costs increased by $77 million in the fourth quarter but improved 100 basis points as a percentage of revenue to 61.2%. Cost Of goods sold have increased $67 million in the quarter, mainly because of rebates due to higher Recycling commodity prices. Because of these higher prices, earnings per diluted share at our Recycling operations increased approximately $0.04 in the quarter. Subcontractor costs increased $22 million in the quarter, primarily relating to the work we performed on the cleanup effort in the Gulf Coast region. Maintenance costs decreased $14 million. Direct fuel costs increased approximately $9 million, primarily because of the 15% increase in diesel fuel prices. The increase in our fuel costs was less than the increase in our fuel surcharge revenue for the quarter providing a $5 million benefit to income from operations. 
Foreign currency translation for our Canadian operations accounted for an increase in operating costs of approximately $7 million. SG&A costs were $367 million in the fourth quarter. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A costs improved 60 basis points to 11.5%. Interest expense for the fourth quarter increased by $9 million compared with the prior-year period. This is primarily due to higher upfront costs in usage fees on the new revolving credit facility which we executed in June 2010. On December 31, 2010, our weighted average cost of debt was 5.6% and our debt-to-total capital ratio for the quarter was 57.5% consistent with our target ratio of about 60%. The floating portion of our total debt portfolio was 13% at the end of the quarter. Our income tax rate as reported for the fourth quarter 2010 was 35.1%. After adjusting for the items referenced in our press release, our income tax rate for the fourth quarter would have been 36.6%. For 2011, we expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 35.7%.
Turning to cash flow. Fourth quarter 2010 net cash provided by operating activities was $622 million. During the fourth quarter, we received a benefit of about $50 million from a reduction at our federal income tax payments due to bonus depreciation. Our capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $367 million and our free cash flow for the fourth quarter were $263 million. For the full year 2010, free cash flow was about $1.2 billion after capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion. Our 2010 cash provided by operating activities was negatively impacted by the changes in working capital, primarily an increase in accounts receivable due to our strong revenue growth.
For 2011, we expect capital expenditures of between $1.35 billion and $1.45 billion. We have increased our capital spending plan to take advantage of the bonus depreciation legislation recently passed. The additional spend will focus on natural gas vehicles and fueling infrastructure, IT infrastructure and growth initiatives. In 2011, we expect our free cash flow benefit from bonus of depreciation of between $110 million and $140 million. Free cash flow in 2011 is expected to be in the range of $1.25 billion and $1.35 billion despite the increase in capital expenditures.
In the fourth quarter of 2010, we paid $150 million in dividends and we repurchased $58 million of our common stock. For the full year 2010, we paid $604 million in dividends and we repurchased $501 million of our common stock. As you know, our capital allocation program over the past few years has been very clear, return cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while opportunistically making strategic investments and acquiring assets. For 2011, our Capital Allocation Plan is to return up to $1.2 billion to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. The plan anticipates increasing future declared dividends by 8% to $1.36 per share on an annual basis which would result in a dividend yield of approximately 3.7%. We also intend to repurchase as much as a $575 million of common stock. 
We expect this spend between $250 million and $350 million of business acquisitions and investments with the majority of these investments on the Solid Waste side of the business. The cost savings program that David mentioned will focus on procurement, operational efficiency and back-office efficiency. The implementation costs of these initiatives will cost a drag on earnings in the first half of 2011. However, we expect to begin to realize the benefits of these initiatives in the second half of 2011 and they should accelerate through 2012. Despite the cost of these initiatives, we expect full year 2011 SG&A costs to decline as a percentage of revenue. Coupled with improved operating performance, we expect income from operations margins to continue to improve in 2011.
Finally, some news about our Investor Relations area. We have recently named Ed Egle as Director of Investor Relations. Ed will be taking over from Jim Alderson this recently named Director of Finance for our waste-to-energy operations in the United Kingdom.

Obviously, the winter storm started hitting in mid-December it in December as I recall was negative 4.9% in volumes. And so you see the dramatic change that we believe the weather had in December. And so on overall, the volumes were disappointing but there was nothing we could do about it.

So we are going to give you more options from Recycling point of view, from an organics point of view. If you can do that again great value out of materials. If you can recycle more materials and create value that you then can share with the customer, we can get the contract and at a higher price or at least at a higher return on capital.

Some of them are localized CPI, some of them are more regionalized with the CPI some try to get sort of waste industry-specific type of CPI. So they're all over the board.

And then the other thing to keep in mind is that we anniversary-ed a lot of our fees. For example, our environmental fee, minimum build the our administrative fee. That's about $50 million of headwinds all the fees and surcharges. We're expecting to be year-over-year about a $50 million headwind, which tells you that we've got to do a pretty good job on price increases to hit our 2% goal. If you remember last year, in order to hit our goal, we had to have an average price increase on our open-market commercial business of about 8%. In that type of trend continues this year. In order to get to our 2%, we've got further headwinds overcome from CPI and from the various fees and surcharges.

The pipeline there is probably only a quarter, the visibility is only a quarter out. But it still looks pretty strong.

And I've said it before, that I would much prefer to see those Commercial volumes move toward, because I think that would be more indicative of a strong economy, they've remained stubbornly negative at about negative 5%. Hopefully, we'll see that change. But as you know, with our business, you really don't start to see the change until the spring weather breaks and the folks start.

Things like and customer-focused growth. And the first two quarters of the year, that's going to be about $0.02 per quarter drag. We've got waste-to-energy. We're going to put $28 million into refurbishing this plant in Virginia that is in the first of the year and goes positive in the back half of the year. so you've got $0.03 of that within the first half from waste-to-energy. So that's $0.25 in the quarter. With that investment in the savings program starting back of the year does about $0.02 a quarter. So you've got $0.04 to $0.06 a quarter sort of investment. And then in the first quarter, we talked about the weather in January making earnings flat in January, normally we'd expect to see January up $0.01 or $0.02. So you got that effective in the first quarter. So I think very clearly, we are going to see that historical trend to be a little bit different for us this year. We certainly are going to be more up and loaded that front of loaded for both every reason that we have, which is the price should be a little bit better than the back of the year and PPI should get better for those contracts that we priced at June 30. The volume is going to be better because we don't have the weather coming out of the first half of the year and we expect the economy to continue to improve. So the volumes are going to get better during the course of the year. And then on the cost side, we're going to be making some investments in cost savings in the first half of the year that are going to work in the first the back half savings of the year. so if when you look at the three primary earnings, you're going to have some headwinds in the front part of the year, you're going to have tailwinds at the back of the year."

When we look at it probably about 65% of our Special Waste is actually what we sort of call permanent special waste coming out of plants where we have a contract. And then about 35% is event-related. And that 35% obviously changes with seasonality and I think also changes with corporate budgets for the folks that are doing the cleanup work. And so you're going to have some lumpiness but again so far going to the first quarter we don't see the rate slowing down dramatically."

So you have the numbers trending obviously in November you've got holiday season start to kick in the number starting to trend towards black. And that was driven through all lines of business. You've got great comparables year-to-year starting to show up in the Industrial line of business and you've got C&D and special waste holding up very handily. So everything was trending the right way until the weather hit. And this is what we faced every year when we're looking at what we're going to talk about with respect to volumes, what we're going to talk about with respect to volumes for the year is negative 4.9% in December indicative of whether or is it indicative of a softening economy. In other words, what do you base 2011 volumes off of? do You base it on the negative 0.4% in October or the negative 4.9% in December. And when we look at it. You can acquire more to October than December because of the weather event. Now January has continued to be soft. Again we believe it's because of weather not because of the economy. So again is the same thing based with every year where we really don't know if our volume call is going to be right until we come out of the seasonally month to start in the spring. Why do we think it's going to be flat for the year? Because we expect to see GDP positive this year. We have no reason to believe that special waste will drop off dramatically during the course of the year. We expect industrial volumes the continued to improve and then expect to see improvement on the Commercial line of business. If not, because the economy improved dramatically, because of the year-over-year comps. And so we expect every line of business to improve during the course of the year just like what we saw in October. And then you've got the overall volumes driven by that great special waste like it's been for the last three quarters. So that sort of the 10,000-foot view. The other thing that we've got going on is the investments that we started to make in customer-focused growth. The segmentation of our market areas. We're starting to see that take hold. We've talked about our Medical Waste initiatives and we just had a large national hospital chain that was virtually 100% by large competitor, we took about 30% of that business just a way. So we're on target, at least double the amount of Medical Waste we do, we are doing $20 million, $25 million, we expect to do $50 million in 2011. and then when I talked about on the municipal side. We're going to maintain the contracts in the past. We've let some contracts go based strictly on our philosophy of we are going to raise prices everywhere every time. We're going to take a little harder look at the industrial line of business and we're going to make sure that we using those contracts where we still get the good return on capital. We are looking at the positive factors throughout the business. I think that will be borne out once we see the spring come and you start to see normal seasonality kicking."

I'm not sure about our other folks in the industry but I follow the transportation industry pretty closely and if you look at the last two or three weeks number of transportation companies have brought down their earnings fairly dramatically because of the weather. More dramatically than we have. And basically what happens is as the folks up in New York know, commerce just shuts down, particularly when you have the type of snowstorms that we've been having along the East Coast and midwest. And when commerce shuts down we move 15,000 tons a day out of New York City and when things shutdown, we move zero. And so some of that comes back but not all of it comes back. And so the weather certainly has a dramatic effect on our business and certainly this weather this year has been as bad as we've ever seen. Now again, maybe what you didn't hear from the other companies is because they haven't closed their January books yet. I can't speak for the other companies. We just closed our January books and we were able to see that earnings were flat year-over-year and generally we'd expect them to be up $0.01 or $0.02.

You can't really do much about those when the economy improves, although you should see things like the minimum ton per load and some of those other types of fees improve as the economy improves. And then you've got general price increases. When you look at KPIs, the economy is always going to be better for us because customers are more willing to accept rise increases. But I think the important thing to remember about us is that we are moving away from price increases per for price increases say. What we're trying to do is to greater value proposition with our customers so we can get old price and volume.

We had a very good fourth quarter, earning $0.60 per share, an increase of over 15% compared to the $0.52 we earned in the prior-year quarter. Our Collection, Landfill and Recycling businesses all performed very",1356,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning from Houston. We had a very good fourth quarter, earning $0.60 per share, an increase of over 15% compared to the $0.52 we earned in the prior-year quarter. Our Collection, Landfill and Recycling businesses all performed very solidly. We increased operating earnings and improved operating margins in each of these lines of business. Revenue increased by $181 million or 6% from the prior-year period. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. 
Our revenue improvement was driven by better Recycling commodity prices, acquisitions and year-over-year increases in revenue growth from yield. On the pricing front, the fourth quarter was our strongest quarter of the year. Internal revenue growth from yield on our collection and disposal operations was 2.6% in the fourth quarter. We remain committed to our pricing discipline and in the fourth quarter, we again overcame the pricing headwind we faced on the roughly 40% of our collection revenue that has price adjustments based on a CPI index.
CPI adjustment had caused a drag to our revenue growth from yield of approximately 40 basis points in the quarter and about 70 basis points for the year. So for both the quarter and the full year, we outpaced our long-term pricing objective to achieve price increases in the range of 50 to 100 basis points above CPI on our entire Collection and Disposal business.
The combined internal revenue growth from yield in the industrial, commercial and residential lines of our Collection business was 3.1% in the fourth quarter. Internal revenue growth from yield was 3.5% in both our commercial and industrial lines. While internal revenue growth from yield on our residential line of business was 2.2%.
Commercial new business pricing increased for the sixth consecutive quarter. Service increases, net of service decreases, were slightly negative for the quarter but improved significantly compared with the prior-year quarter. The winter quarters are typically the weakest of the year for service increases, net of decreases.
On the volume side of the business, internal revenue growth from volume in our Collection and Disposal business declined by 1.8% in the quarter. At the end of October, volumes were trending such that we expected volumes to be flat or slightly up for the quarter. However, the severe winter weather we saw in December negatively impacted volumes. Also impacting volumes were contract losses in our residential line of business and a slowing in the rate of growth in the special waste landfill volumes.
For the fourth quarter, commercial and residential collection lines saw declines of 5% and 5.9%, respectively. In our Industrial line of business, internal revenue growth from volume was down 3%, an improvement from prior quarters. Our strong pricing in our traditional Solid Waste Collection business overcame these volume losses and drove margin improvement. Overall, in the fourth quarter, we grew collection income from operations margin by 220 basis points compared with the prior-year period.
In the landfill side of the business, fourth quarter 2010 internal revenue growth from volume was positive 4.3%, which is the best quarterly performance for the year and the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year volume improvement. Internal revenue growth from volume for special waste was positive 12.5%. For MSW, internal revenue growth from volume was negative 5%. In our C&D line, internal revenue growth from volume was flat, which is the best performance since the fourth quarter of 2008.
On the landfill pricing front, MSW per unit pricing was up by 2.4%, reflecting our continued focus on landfill pricing. So our Landfill business also improved significantly in the quarter and we continue to see a strong pipeline for special waste volumes.
Overall, we grew income from operations in the landfill line of business and increased the income from operations margin by 190 basis points compared with the prior-year period. 
When we look at our collection and landfill line businesses combined, income from operations grew approximately 12% compared with the fourth quarter of 2009, and our income from operations margin improved by 210 basis points.
Turning to our Recycling business, increased commodity prices contributed about $0.04 of positive year-over-year earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2010. For 2011, we expect recycling commodity sales prices to have a slightly positive year-over-year impact on earnings per share. Average electricity sales prices at our waste-to-energy plants were flat in the fourth quarter. For 2011, we expect average electricity sales prices to be similar to 2010 levels and therefore, we do not expect electricity sales prices to significantly impact earnings in 2011 compared with 2010.
Looking at volumes in 2011, we expect them to be flat to slightly positive, with volumes steadily improving throughout the year. Certainly, the severe winter weather in the first quarter of 2011 has affected volumes, and we expect this to have a negative impact on first quarter earnings. But starting in the second quarter of 2011, we expect volumes to resume the previous trend of slow but steady improvement. With respect to price, CPI is running at about approximately 1%, and we expect CPI headwinds in our Residential and Franchise business to continue.
We've also seen more competitive pricing on new residential municipal contracts. So the pricing headwinds in 2011 will come primarily from our residential line of business. We will continue to aggressively push industrial, commercial and landfill prices. As a result, we expect our overall yield in 2011 to be 2%.
Our waste-to-energy operations are expected to have a negative impact of about $28 million on earnings in the first half of 2011 compared with 2010, primarily from upgrades being made at our recently-acquired waste-to-energy plant in Virginia. Our waste-to-energy operations are expected to have a positive impact of about $11 million in the second half of 2011. We expect increased labor costs due primarily to annual merit increases, which will add approximately $65 million to 2011 expenses. We're planning to increase expenses by up to $50 million for information technology upgrades, start-up costs associated with new cost-saving programs and customer-focused growth initiatives. Interest expense is expected to increase approximately $25 million principally because of higher fees and rates from the revolving credit facility that was executed in June of 2010.
We've previously discussed certain growth initiatives that had negative $0.03 impact to earnings in the third quarter. The headwinds from those initiatives were about the same in the fourth quarter. We expect to see the results from these initiatives continue to negatively impact earnings in the first half of the year but to turn positive by the end of the year. So when we look ahead to 2011, we'll face some headwinds, mostly in the first half of the year. But our strategy remains clear. We'll remain committed to our pricing discipline while at the same time investing in the future.
In looking at our first quarter, our preliminary data shows that January 2011 earnings were basically flat year-over-year, driven by negative volumes and start-up spending on new cost-reduction initiatives that will be implemented in 2011. The negative volumes were driven by the severe winter weather experienced throughout North America, and we expect that to abate as we enter the spring season and to improve throughout the year.
We've also begun to bring in internal and external resources to develop cost-saving plans, and the spending on those resources are not yet offset by savings. We expect the savings to begin to occur in the second half of the year and to accelerate in 2012. So earnings improvement will be muted in the first half of the year and pick up in the second half of the year. Overall, we estimate our 2011 fully diluted earnings to be between $2.24 and $2.30 per share.
In summary, our results in the fourth quarter build strong momentum going into 2011. Our entire organization is aligned around our pricing and cost savings strategies. This will serve us well in accomplishing our goals of growing our revenue, expanding our operating margins, increasing our return on invested capital, increasing our free cash flow and returning cash to our shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

These costs increased by $77 million in the fourth quarter but improved 110 basis points as a percentage of revenue to 61.2%. Cost of goods sold increased $67 million in the quarter, mainly because of rebates due to higher recycling commodity prices. Because of these higher prices, earnings per diluted share at our recycling operations increased approximately $0.04 in the quarter. Subcontractor costs increased $22 million in the quarter, primarily relating to the work we performed on the cleanup effort in the Gulf Coast region. Maintenance costs decreased $14 million. Direct fuel costs increased approximately $9 million, primarily because of a 15% increase in diesel fuel prices. The increase in our fuel costs was less than the increase in our fuel surcharge revenue for the quarter, providing a $5 million benefit to income from operations. 
Foreign currency translation for our Canadian operations accounted for an increase in operating costs of approximately $7 million. SG&A costs were $367 million in the fourth quarter. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A costs improved 60 basis points to 11.5%. Interest expense for the fourth quarter increased by $9 million compared with the prior-year period. This is primarily due to higher upfront costs in usage fees on the new revolving credit facility which we executed in June 2010. 
On December 31, 2010, our weighted average cost of debt was 5.6%, and our debt-to-total capital ratio for the quarter was 57.5%, consistent with our target ratio of about 60%. The floating rate portion of our total Debt portfolio was 13% at the end of the quarter. Our income tax rate, as reported for the fourth quarter 2010, was 35.1%. After adjusting for the items referenced in our press release, our income tax rate for the fourth quarter would have been 36.6%. For 2011, we expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 35.7%.
Turning to cash flow, fourth quarter 2010 net cash provided by operating activities was $622 million. During the fourth quarter, we received a benefit of about $50 million from a reduction of our federal income tax payments due to bonus depreciation. Our capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $367 million and our free cash flow for the fourth quarter was $263 million. For the full year 2010, free cash flow was about $1.2 billion after capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion. Our 2010 cash provided by operating activities was negatively impacted by the changes in working capital, primarily an increase in accounts receivable due to our strong revenue growth.
For 2011, we expect capital expenditures of between $1.35 billion and $1.45 billion. We have increased our capital spending plans to take advantage of the bonus depreciation legislation recently passed. The additional spend will focus on natural gas vehicles and fueling infrastructure, IT infrastructure and growth initiatives. In 2011, we expect our free cash flow benefit from bonus depreciation of between $110 million and $140 million. Free cash flow in 2011 is expected to be in the range of $1.25 billion and $1.35 billion despite the increase in capital expenditures.
In the fourth quarter of 2010, we paid $150 million in dividend, and we repurchased $58 million of our common stock. For the full year 2010, we paid $604 million in dividends, and we repurchased $501 million of our common stock. As you know, our capital allocation program over the past few years has been very clear, return cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while opportunistically making strategic investments and acquiring assets. 
For 2011, our capital allocation plan is to return up to $1.2 billion to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. The plan anticipates increasing future declared dividends by 8% to $1.36 per share on an annual basis, which would result in a dividend yield of approximately 3.7%. We also intend to repurchase as much as $575 million of common stock. We expect to spend between $250 million and $350 million in business acquisitions and investments, with the majority of these investments on the Solid Waste side of the business. 
The cost savings program that David mentioned will focus on procurement, operational efficiency and back-office efficiency. The implementation costs of these initiatives will cause a drag on earnings in the first half of 2011. However, we expect to begin to realize the benefits of these initiatives in the second half of 2011, and they should accelerate through 2012. Despite the cost of these initiatives, we expect full year 2011 SG&A costs to decline as a percentage of revenue. Coupled with improved operating performance, we expect income from operations margins to continue to improve in 2011.
Finally, some news about our Investor Relations area. We have recently named Ed Egle [ph] as Director, Investor Relations. Ed will be taking over from Jim Alderson, who is recently named Director of Finance for our waste-to-energy operations in the United Kingdom. Congratulations, Jim, on his new position, and we thank him for his contributions to Investor Relations. 
Ed was recently Director of Financial Analysis and has over 15 years of experience with our company both in the field and at the corporate office. He'll be able to hit the ground running. Ed will be reporting to our Vice President of Finance and Treasurer, Cherie Rice, who will continue to oversee the Investor Relations program, as she has done the last several years. We will be introducing Ed to you at Investor Meetings during the coming months.

And just like we're looking at in our other customer segments, we're going to look at this customer segment as to how do we create a value proposition for the customer such that price doesn't become the primary driving factor. So when you look at municipal contracts, you've got to find out what municipalities want. And today, what they want are more options for diversion. So we're going to give them more options from a recycling point of view, from an organics point of view. If you can do that, you can create value out of the materials. If you can recycle more materials and create value that you can then can share with the customer, we can get the contract at a higher price, or at least at a higher return on capital. And so going forward, we are not going to go out and compete on price. That's never been on our strategy in any line of business. But we are going to compete to maintain those contracts that give us a good return on capital, and that we're going to try to find a way to meet the customers' need better than anyone else in the industry."

And then I think the other thing to keep in mind is that we anniversaried a lot of our fees. So for example, our environmental fee, minimum ton-per-load fee, our administrative fee, that's about $50 million of headwinds. All the fees and surcharges, we're expecting to be year-over-year about a $50 million headwind, which tells you that we've got to do a pretty good job on price increases to hit our 2% goal. If you remember last year, in order to hit our goal, we had to have an average price increase on our open-market Commercial business of about 8%. And that type of trend continues this year.

But just from a commentary point of view on the commercial volumes, these will be the special waste. Special waste has held up tremendously well during the year, and we don't particularly see that changing in 2011. The pipeline still looks pretty strong. Now the pipeline there is probably only a quarter, your visibility is probably only a quarter out. But it still looks pretty strong. On the commercial side, those volumes have very stubbornly stayed sort of in the negative 5% range, and we just haven't seen a dramatic move in those volumes. And I've said it before, that I would much prefer to see those commercial volumes move toward black because I think that would be more indicative of a strong economy. They've remained stubbornly negative at about negative 5%. Hopefully, we'll see that change. But as you know, with our business, you really don't start to see the change until the spring weather breaks and folks start -- and I mean, there's not that many people as you know in the Northeast that are adding new businesses during the winter months. And so I think we'll get a better feel in the second quarter as to whether we're going to see significant improvement in commercial volumes year-over-year."

And what we've seen in the last three years as volumes, you all know very well that we're very highly leveraged from a fixed cost point of view at our landfills. And so as the volumes have come down the last three years, the margins have come down fairly dramatically and the return on capital has come down fairly dramatically. We make huge investments in these landfills every year. And so if we're going to get the return on capital up, we don't have a lot of opportunity to pull out variable costs. So there's only one way to get the return on capital up, and that is to push pricing. And that's exactly what we'll do."

I mean, we talked about it in the script, but the way I sort of look at the year, Michael, is that in the first two quarters, we're still going to have some headwinds from the growth initiatives that we talked about in the third quarter and a little bit this quarter. Things like Bagster and customer-focused growth. And the first two quarters of the year, that's going to be about a $0.02 per quarter drag. We've got waste-to-energy. We're going to put $28 million into refurbishing this plant in Virginia that hits in the first of the year and now goes positive '11 in the back half of the year. So you've got $0.03 of headwind in the first half from waste-to-energy, so that's a penny and a half in the quarter. And then as Bob mentioned, we're making investments in these savings programs to starting paying off in the back half of the year and the first two quarters, that's about $0.02 a quarter. So you've got $0.04 to $0.06 a quarter sort of investment. And then in the first quarter, we talked about the weather in January making earnings flat in January, normally, we'd expect to see January up $0.01 or $0.02. So you've got that effect in the first quarter. So I think, very clearly, we're going to see that historical trend to be a little bit different for us this year. We certainly are going to be more back-end loaded than front-end loaded for every reason that we have, which is the price should be a little bit better in the back half of the year because CPI should get better for those contracts that repriced on June 30. The volume is going to be better because we won't have the weather coming out of the first part of the year, and we expect the economy to continue to improve. So the volume is going to get better during the course of the year. And then on the cost side, we're going to be making some investments in cost savings in the first half of the year that are going to reap the cost savings from the back half of the year. So when you look at the three primary drivers of our earnings, you're going to have some headwinds in the front part of the year, you're going to have tailwinds in the back of the year."

And so you have the numbers trending. Obviously, in November, you've got the holiday season starting to kick in. But, yes, the number is starting to trend towards black, right? And that was driven through all lines of business. You've got great comparables year-to-year starting to show up in the industrial line of business, and you've got C&D and special waste holding up very handily. So everything was trending the right way until the weather hit. And this is what we faced every year when we're looking at what we're going to talk about with respect to volumes -- what we're going to talk about with respect to volumes for the year is negative 4.9% in December indicative of weather? Or is it indicative of a softening economy? In other words, what do you base 2011 volumes off of? Do you base it off the negative 0.4% in October or the negative 4.9% in December? And when we look at it, we think that you can compare it more to October than December because of the weather event. Now January has continued to be soft. Again, we believe it's because of weather, not because of the economy. So again, is the same thing we're faced with every year, where we really don't know if our volume call is going to be right until we come out into the seasonally up months to start in the spring. Why do we think it's going to be flat for the year? Because we expect to see GDP positive this year. We have no reason to believe that special waste will drop off dramatically during the course of the year. We expect industrial volumes the continue to improve, and then expect to see improvement on the commercial line of business. If not because the economy improved dramatically, because of the year-over-year comps. And so we expect every line of business to improve during the course of the year just like what we saw in October. And then you've got the overall volumes driven by that great special waste like it's been for the last three quarters. So that sort of the 10,000-foot view. The other thing that we've got going on is the investments that we started to make in customer-focused growth, the segmentation of our market areas. We're starting to see that take hold. We've talked about our medical waste initiatives, and we just had a large national hospital chain that was virtually 100% by a large competitor, we took about 30% of that business away. So we're on target to at least double the amount of medical waste we do. We're doing $20 million, $25 million. We expect to do $50 million in 2011. And then when I talk about on the municipal side, we're going to make sure that we maintain the contracts in the past. We've let some contracts go based strictly on our philosophy if we're going to raise prices everywhere every time. We're going to take a little harder look at the residentials line of business, and we're going to make sure that we stay at those contracts where we still get the good return on capital. So we're looking at that positive factors throughout the business. I think that will be born out once we see the spring come and you start to see a normal seasonality kick in."

Yes, I mean, look, when you look -- I'm not sure about the other folks in the industry, but I follow the transportation industry fairly closely, and if you take a look over the last two or three weeks, you'll see that a number of transportation companies have brought down their earnings fairly dramatically because of the weather, more dramatically than we have. And basically, what happens is, as the folks up in New York know, commerce just shuts down, particularly when you have the type of snowstorms that we've been having along the East Coast and the Midwest. And when commerce shuts down, look, we move 15,000 tons a day out of New York City and when things shutdown, we move zero. And so some of that comes back, but not all of it comes back. And so the weather certainly has a dramatic effect on our business, and certainly, this weather this year has been as bad as we've ever seen. Now again, maybe what you didn't hear from the other companies is because they haven't closed their January books yet. I can't speak for the other companies. We've just closed our January books, and we were able to see that earnings were flat year-over-year and, generally, we'd expect them to be up $0.01 or $0.02.

We just saw the wholesale prices come out and they were -- it's the only time in my life that actually root for inflation is because we have the CPI adjusting contracts. And then we've got the other piece that we have to overcome, which is the fees and surcharges. I talked about those, those are about $50 million. Those will be $50 million negative. You can't really do much about those when the economy improves, although you should see things like the minimum ton per load and some of those other types of fees improve as the economy improves. And then you've got just the general price increases. When you look at GPIs, better economy is always going to be better for us because customers are more willing to accept price increases. But I think the important thing to remember about us is that we are moving away from price increases per price increases' sake. And what we're trying to do is to create that value proposition with our customers so that we can get both price and volume.

We had a very good fourth quarter, earning $0.60 per share, an increase of over 15% compared to the $0.52 we earned in the prior-year quarter. Our Collection, Landfill and Recycling businesses all performed very",1356,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning from Houston. We had a very good fourth quarter, earning $0.60 per share, an increase of over 15% compared to the $0.52 we earned in the prior-year quarter. Our Collection, Landfill and Recycling businesses all performed very solidly. We increased operating earnings and improved operating margins in each of these lines of business. Revenue increased by $181 million or 6% from the prior-year period. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. 
Our revenue improvement was driven by better Recycling commodity prices, acquisitions and year-over-year increases in revenue growth from yield. On the pricing front, the fourth quarter was our strongest quarter of the year. Internal revenue growth from yield on our collection and disposal operations was 2.6% in the fourth quarter. We remain committed to our pricing discipline and in the fourth quarter, we again overcame the pricing headwind we faced on the roughly 40% of our collection revenue that has price adjustments based on a CPI index.
CPI adjustment had caused a drag to our revenue growth from yield of approximately 40 basis points in the quarter and about 70 basis points for the year. So for both the quarter and the full year, we outpaced our long-term pricing objective to achieve price increases in the range of 50 to 100 basis points above CPI on our entire Collection and Disposal business.
The combined internal revenue growth from yield in the industrial, commercial and residential lines of our Collection business was 3.1% in the fourth quarter. Internal revenue growth from yield was 3.5% in both our commercial and industrial lines. While internal revenue growth from yield on our residential line of business was 2.2%.
Commercial new business pricing increased for the sixth consecutive quarter. Service increases, net of service decreases, were slightly negative for the quarter but improved significantly compared with the prior-year quarter. The winter quarters are typically the weakest of the year for service increases, net of decreases.
On the volume side of the business, internal revenue growth from volume in our Collection and Disposal business declined by 1.8% in the quarter. At the end of October, volumes were trending such that we expected volumes to be flat or slightly up for the quarter. However, the severe winter weather we saw in December negatively impacted volumes. Also impacting volumes were contract losses in our residential line of business and a slowing in the rate of growth in the special waste landfill volumes.
For the fourth quarter, commercial and residential collection lines saw declines of 5% and 5.9%, respectively. In our Industrial line of business, internal revenue growth from volume was down 3%, an improvement from prior quarters. Our strong pricing in our traditional Solid Waste Collection business overcame these volume losses and drove margin improvement. Overall, in the fourth quarter, we grew collection income from operations margin by 220 basis points compared with the prior-year period.
In the landfill side of the business, fourth quarter 2010 internal revenue growth from volume was positive 4.3%, which is the best quarterly performance for the year and the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year volume improvement. Internal revenue growth from volume for special waste was positive 12.5%. For MSW, internal revenue growth from volume was negative 5%. In our C&D line, internal revenue growth from volume was flat, which is the best performance since the fourth quarter of 2008.
On the landfill pricing front, MSW per unit pricing was up by 2.4%, reflecting our continued focus on landfill pricing. So our Landfill business also improved significantly in the quarter and we continue to see a strong pipeline for special waste volumes.
Overall, we grew income from operations in the landfill line of business and increased the income from operations margin by 190 basis points compared with the prior-year period. 
When we look at our collection and landfill line businesses combined, income from operations grew approximately 12% compared with the fourth quarter of 2009, and our income from operations margin improved by 210 basis points.
Turning to our Recycling business, increased commodity prices contributed about $0.04 of positive year-over-year earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2010. For 2011, we expect recycling commodity sales prices to have a slightly positive year-over-year impact on earnings per share. Average electricity sales prices at our waste-to-energy plants were flat in the fourth quarter. For 2011, we expect average electricity sales prices to be similar to 2010 levels and therefore, we do not expect electricity sales prices to significantly impact earnings in 2011 compared with 2010.
Looking at volumes in 2011, we expect them to be flat to slightly positive, with volumes steadily improving throughout the year. Certainly, the severe winter weather in the first quarter of 2011 has affected volumes, and we expect this to have a negative impact on first quarter earnings. But starting in the second quarter of 2011, we expect volumes to resume the previous trend of slow but steady improvement. With respect to price, CPI is running at about approximately 1%, and we expect CPI headwinds in our Residential and Franchise business to continue.
We've also seen more competitive pricing on new residential municipal contracts. So the pricing headwinds in 2011 will come primarily from our residential line of business. We will continue to aggressively push industrial, commercial and landfill prices. As a result, we expect our overall yield in 2011 to be 2%.
Our waste-to-energy operations are expected to have a negative impact of about $28 million on earnings in the first half of 2011 compared with 2010, primarily from upgrades being made at our recently-acquired waste-to-energy plant in Virginia. Our waste-to-energy operations are expected to have a positive impact of about $11 million in the second half of 2011. We expect increased labor costs due primarily to annual merit increases, which will add approximately $65 million to 2011 expenses. We're planning to increase expenses by up to $50 million for information technology upgrades, start-up costs associated with new cost-saving programs and customer-focused growth initiatives. Interest expense is expected to increase approximately $25 million principally because of higher fees and rates from the revolving credit facility that was executed in June of 2010.
We've previously discussed certain growth initiatives that had negative $0.03 impact to earnings in the third quarter. The headwinds from those initiatives were about the same in the fourth quarter. We expect to see the results from these initiatives continue to negatively impact earnings in the first half of the year but to turn positive by the end of the year. So when we look ahead to 2011, we'll face some headwinds, mostly in the first half of the year. But our strategy remains clear. We'll remain committed to our pricing discipline while at the same time investing in the future.
In looking at our first quarter, our preliminary data shows that January 2011 earnings were basically flat year-over-year, driven by negative volumes and start-up spending on new cost-reduction initiatives that will be implemented in 2011. The negative volumes were driven by the severe winter weather experienced throughout North America, and we expect that to abate as we enter the spring season and to improve throughout the year.
We've also begun to bring in internal and external resources to develop cost-saving plans, and the spending on those resources are not yet offset by savings. We expect the savings to begin to occur in the second half of the year and to accelerate in 2012. So earnings improvement will be muted in the first half of the year and pick up in the second half of the year. Overall, we estimate our 2011 fully diluted earnings to be between $2.24 and $2.30 per share.
In summary, our results in the fourth quarter build strong momentum going into 2011. Our entire organization is aligned around our pricing and cost savings strategies. This will serve us well in accomplishing our goals of growing our revenue, expanding our operating margins, increasing our return on invested capital, increasing our free cash flow and returning cash to our shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

These costs increased by $77 million in the fourth quarter but improved 110 basis points as a percentage of revenue to 61.2%. Cost of goods sold increased $67 million in the quarter, mainly because of rebates due to higher recycling commodity prices. Because of these higher prices, earnings per diluted share at our recycling operations increased approximately $0.04 in the quarter. Subcontractor costs increased $22 million in the quarter, primarily relating to the work we performed on the cleanup effort in the Gulf Coast region. Maintenance costs decreased $14 million. Direct fuel costs increased approximately $9 million, primarily because of a 15% increase in diesel fuel prices. The increase in our fuel costs was less than the increase in our fuel surcharge revenue for the quarter, providing a $5 million benefit to income from operations. 
Foreign currency translation for our Canadian operations accounted for an increase in operating costs of approximately $7 million. SG&A costs were $367 million in the fourth quarter. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A costs improved 60 basis points to 11.5%. Interest expense for the fourth quarter increased by $9 million compared with the prior-year period. This is primarily due to higher upfront costs in usage fees on the new revolving credit facility which we executed in June 2010. 
On December 31, 2010, our weighted average cost of debt was 5.6%, and our debt-to-total capital ratio for the quarter was 57.5%, consistent with our target ratio of about 60%. The floating rate portion of our total Debt portfolio was 13% at the end of the quarter. Our income tax rate, as reported for the fourth quarter 2010, was 35.1%. After adjusting for the items referenced in our press release, our income tax rate for the fourth quarter would have been 36.6%. For 2011, we expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 35.7%.
Turning to cash flow, fourth quarter 2010 net cash provided by operating activities was $622 million. During the fourth quarter, we received a benefit of about $50 million from a reduction of our federal income tax payments due to bonus depreciation. Our capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $367 million and our free cash flow for the fourth quarter was $263 million. For the full year 2010, free cash flow was about $1.2 billion after capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion. Our 2010 cash provided by operating activities was negatively impacted by the changes in working capital, primarily an increase in accounts receivable due to our strong revenue growth.
For 2011, we expect capital expenditures of between $1.35 billion and $1.45 billion. We have increased our capital spending plans to take advantage of the bonus depreciation legislation recently passed. The additional spend will focus on natural gas vehicles and fueling infrastructure, IT infrastructure and growth initiatives. In 2011, we expect our free cash flow benefit from bonus depreciation of between $110 million and $140 million. Free cash flow in 2011 is expected to be in the range of $1.25 billion and $1.35 billion despite the increase in capital expenditures.
In the fourth quarter of 2010, we paid $150 million in dividend, and we repurchased $58 million of our common stock. For the full year 2010, we paid $604 million in dividends, and we repurchased $501 million of our common stock. As you know, our capital allocation program over the past few years has been very clear, return cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while opportunistically making strategic investments and acquiring assets. 
For 2011, our capital allocation plan is to return up to $1.2 billion to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. The plan anticipates increasing future declared dividends by 8% to $1.36 per share on an annual basis, which would result in a dividend yield of approximately 3.7%. We also intend to repurchase as much as $575 million of common stock. We expect to spend between $250 million and $350 million in business acquisitions and investments, with the majority of these investments on the Solid Waste side of the business. 
The cost savings program that David mentioned will focus on procurement, operational efficiency and back-office efficiency. The implementation costs of these initiatives will cause a drag on earnings in the first half of 2011. However, we expect to begin to realize the benefits of these initiatives in the second half of 2011, and they should accelerate through 2012. Despite the cost of these initiatives, we expect full year 2011 SG&A costs to decline as a percentage of revenue. Coupled with improved operating performance, we expect income from operations margins to continue to improve in 2011.
Finally, some news about our Investor Relations area. We have recently named Ed Egle [ph] as Director, Investor Relations. Ed will be taking over from Jim Alderson, who is recently named Director of Finance for our waste-to-energy operations in the United Kingdom. Congratulations, Jim, on his new position, and we thank him for his contributions to Investor Relations. 
Ed was recently Director of Financial Analysis and has over 15 years of experience with our company both in the field and at the corporate office. He'll be able to hit the ground running. Ed will be reporting to our Vice President of Finance and Treasurer, Cherie Rice, who will continue to oversee the Investor Relations program, as she has done the last several years. We will be introducing Ed to you at Investor Meetings during the coming months. 
And with that, Nicole, let's open the line for questions."

Obviously, the winter storm started hitting in sort of mid-December and that in December, as I recall, was negative 4.9% in volumes. And so you can see the dramatic change that we believe the weather had in December. And so, overall, the volumes were disappointing, but there was nothing we could do about it. The two things that we could do something about on the cost side and on the yield side, we exceeded our expectations."

I mean, when we talked in the last year about the customer-focused growth, one of the things that we did is we put an emphasis on our municipal contracts. And just like we're looking at in our other customer segments, we're going to look at this customer segment as to how do we create a value proposition for the customer such that price doesn't become the primary driving factor. So when you look at municipal contracts, you've got to find out what municipalities want. And today, what they want are more options for diversion. So we're going to give them more options from a recycling point of view, from an organics point of view. If you can do that, you can create value out of the materials. If you can recycle more materials and create value that you can then can share with the customer, we can get the contract at a higher price, or at least at a higher return on capital. And so going forward, we are not going to go out and compete on price. That's never been our strategy in any line of business. But we are going to compete to maintain those contracts that give us a good return on capital, and then we're going to try to find a way to meet the customers' need better than anyone else in the industry."

What we looked at for CPI in the year was about 1% to 1.3% on CPI. And so you can do the math there to figure out what effect that has on the overall yield for the year. And then I think the other thing to keep in mind is that we anniversaried a lot of our fees. So for example, our environmental fee, our minimum ton-per-load fee, our administrative fee, that's about $50 million of headwinds. All the fees and surcharges, we're expecting to be year-over-year about a $50 million headwind, which tells you that we've got to do a pretty good job on price increases to hit our 2% goal. If you remember last year, in order to hit our goal, we had to have an average price increase on our open-market Commercial business of about 8%. And that type of trend continues this year. I mean, in order to get to our 2%, we've got further headwinds to overcome from CPI and from the various fees and surcharges.

And so I think we'll get a better feel in the second quarter as to whether we're going to see significant improvement in commercial volumes year-over-year."

And look, I think you all recognize that everything we've done since I've been here has been focused on return on capital. And what we've seen in the last three years as volumes, you all know very well that we're very highly leveraged from a fixed cost point of view at our landfills. And so as the volumes have come down the last three years, the margins have come down fairly dramatically and the return on capital has come down fairly dramatically. We make huge investments in these landfills every year. And so if we're going to get the return on capital up, we don't have a lot of opportunity to pull out variable costs. So there's only one way to get the return on capital up, and that is to push pricing. And that's exactly what we'll do."

I mean, we talked about it in the script, but the way I sort of look at the year, Michael, is that in the first two quarters, we're still going to have some headwinds from the growth initiatives that we talked about in the third quarter and a little bit this quarter. Things like Bagster and customer-focused growth. And the first two quarters of the year, that's going to be about a $0.02 per quarter drag. We've got waste-to-energy. We're going to put $28 million into refurbishing this plant in Virginia that hits in the first of the year and now goes positive '11 in the back half of the year. So you've got $0.03 of headwind in the first half from waste-to-energy, so that's a penny and a half in a quarter. And then as Bob mentioned, we're making investments in these cost savings programs to starting paying off in the back half of the year and the first two quarters, that's about $0.02 a quarter. So you've got $0.04 to $0.06 a quarter sort of investment. And then in the first quarter, we talked about the weather in January making earnings flat in January. Normally, we'd expect to see January up $0.01 or $0.02. So you've got that effect in the first quarter. So I think, very clearly, we're going to see that historical trend to be a little bit different for us this year. We certainly are going to be more back-end loaded than front-end loaded for every reason that we have, which is the price should be a little bit better in the back half of the year because CPI should get better for those contracts that reprice on June 30. The volume is going to be better because we won't have the weather coming out of the first part of the year, and we expect the economy to continue to improve. So the volume is going to get better during the course of the year. And then on the cost side, we're going to be making some investments in cost savings in the first half of the year that are going to reap the cost savings from the back half of the year. So when you look at the three primary drivers of our earnings, you're going to have some headwinds in the front part of the year, you're going to have tailwinds in the back of the year."

You've got great comparables year-to-year starting to show up in the industrial line of business, and you've got C&D and special waste holding up very handily. So everything was trending the right way until the weather hit. And this is what we faced every year when we're looking at what we're going to talk about with respect to volumes -- what we're going to talk about with respect to volumes for the year. Is negative 4.9% in December indicative of weather? Or is it indicative of a softening economy? In other words, what do you base 2011 volumes off of? Do you base it off the negative 0.4% in October or the negative 4.9% in December? And when we look at it, we think that you can compare it more to October than December because of the weather event. Now January has continued to be soft. Again, we believe it's because of weather, not because of the economy. So again, it's the same thing we're faced with every year, where we really don't know if our volume call is going to be right until we come out into the seasonally up months that start in the spring. Why do we think it's going to be flat for the year? Because we expect to see GDP positive this year. We have no reason to believe that special waste will drop off dramatically during the course of the year. We expect industrial volumes to continue to improve, and then we expect to see improvement on the commercial line of business, if not because the economy improved dramatically, because of the year-over-year comps. And so we expect every line of business to improve during the course of the year just like what we saw in October. And then you've got the overall volumes driven by that great special waste like it's been for the last three quarters. So that sort of the 10,000-foot view. The other thing that we've got going on is the investments that we started to make in customer-focused growth, the segmentation of our market areas. We're starting to see that take hold. We've talked about our medical waste initiatives, and we just had a large national hospital chain that was virtually 100% by a large competitor, we took about 30% of that business away. So we're on target to at least double the amount of medical waste we do. We're doing $20 million, $25 million. We expect to do about $50 million in 2011. And then when I talk about on the municipal side, we're going to make sure that we maintain the contracts. In the past, we've let some contracts go based strictly on our philosophy if we're going to raise prices everywhere every time. We're going to take a little harder look at the residentials line of business, and we're going to make sure that we stay at those contracts where we still get the good return on capital. So we're looking at that positive factors throughout the business. I think that will be born out once we see the spring come and you start to see normal seasonality kick in."

Yes, I mean, look, when you look -- I'm not sure about the other folks in our industry, but I follow the transportation industry fairly closely, and if you take a look over the last two or three weeks, you'll see that a number of transportation companies have brought down their earnings fairly dramatically because of the weather, more dramatically than we have. And basically, what happens is, as the folks up in New York know, commerce just shuts down, particularly when you have the type of snowstorms that we've been having along the East Coast and the Midwest. And when commerce shuts down, look, we move 15,000 tons a day out of New York City and when things shutdown, we move zero. And so some of that comes back, but not all of it comes back. And so the weather certainly has a dramatic effect on our business, and certainly, this weather this year has been as bad as we've ever seen. Now again, maybe what you didn't hear from the other companies is because they haven't closed their January books yet. I can't speak for the other companies. We've just closed our January books, and we were able to see that earnings were flat year-over-year and, generally, we'd expect them to be up $0.01 or $0.02.

We just saw the wholesale prices come out and they were -- it's the only time in my life that I actually root for inflation is because we have the CPI adjusting contracts. And then we've got the other piece that we have to overcome, which is the fees and surcharges. I talked about those, those are about $50 million. Those will be $50 million negative. You can't really do much about those when the economy improves, although you should see things like the minimum ton per load and some of those other types of fees improve as the economy improves. And then you've got just the general price increases. When you look at GPIs, better economy is always going to be better for us because customers are more willing to accept price increases. But I think the important thing to remember about us is that we are moving away from price increases for price increases' sake. And what we're trying to do is to create that value proposition with our customers so that we can get both price and volume. I mean, that is for the first year, as for our pricing program, they were price-focused, and they were focused on price to the detriment of volume. And now that we're moved towards segmenting our customer base, we believe we can get both price and volume, and that's certainly our goal."

190694,128746575,119192,"Waste Management, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2011",2011-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. During the first quarter, our solid waste operations performed well, with strong yield performance offsetting weaker than expected volumes. Our overall business earned $0.39 per diluted share, with about $0.09 of",1235,"Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. During the first quarter, our solid waste operations performed well, with strong yield performance offsetting weaker than expected volumes. Our overall business earned $0.39 per diluted share, with about $0.09 of impacts from short-term headwind. Year-over-year, we had a negative impact of $0.02 per diluted share from our waste-to-energy operations and $0.01 per diluted share from stock option grants under our long-term compensation program. We also had negative impacts of $0.03 per diluted share from our cost reduction initiatives and a negative $0.03 per diluted share from our growth initiatives. Without these, our earnings would have been $0.48 per diluted share, which demonstrates the strength of our solid waste business.
Spending on our cost reduction initiatives was slow in the second quarter and we should begin to see year-over-year benefits in the third quarter. Our portfolio of growth initiatives, like Bagster and medical waste, will negatively affect the second and possibly the third quarters, but should become profitable by the end of the year. And our waste-to-energy business will have a small negative effect in the second quarter, but will begin to add year-over-year earnings growth in the third or fourth quarter. So these headwinds should be very short-term and we expect that to drive operational and earnings improvement for years to come.
During the first quarter, revenue increased by $168 million or 5.7% from the prior year quarter. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of positive year-over-year revenue comparison. Major drivers of our revenue improvement are improved recycling volumes at higher commodity prices, the continued emphasis on year-over-year yield increases and acquisitions. Internal revenue growth from yield on our collection and disposal operations was 2.8% in the quarter. This represents the highest yield since the third quarter of 2009 and the third quarter of sequential growth. 
In the coming quarters, many of our fees and surcharges will anniversary, causing downward pressure on yield growth. CPI is an important component of pricing in our municipal sector. CPI increased about 1% for the first 3 months of 2011, consistent with our expectations, but below the level we saw in the first quarter of 2010. We had approximately a 40 basis point reduction in yield from CPI in the first quarter. Many of our contracts adjustment July 1, so the low CPI will continue to negatively affect yield in the second half of the year. 
Despite these pricing pressures, we'll continue to maintain our pricing discipline and fully expect to achieve or exceed our full year yield targets. The combined internal revenue growth from yield in the industrial, commercial and residential lines of our collection business was 3.3% in the first quarter. Commercial and industrial yields were 4.1% and 3.4%, respectively. The yield component of internal revenue growth in our residential line of business was 2.3%.
Both commercial and industrial new business pricing increased compared to the first quarter of last year. The commercial increase represents the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. Our customer churn has been improving steadily over the last 3 quarters and improved to 9.5% in the first quarter of 2011.
On the volume side of the business, internal revenue growth from volume declined 1.7% in the quarter, a 10 basis point sequential improvement from the fourth quarter of 2010. We had expected that volumes will be stronger in the first quarter. However, the winter weather certainly had a negative effect on volumes. Both our commercial and residential collection lines of business saw a year-over-year volume decline of 5.6%. The residential line of business improved 30 basis points from the fourth quarter, which is the first sequential improvement in residential volumes since the of 2009. Industrial volumes declined by 2.8% on a year-over-year basis, which was the seventh straight quarter of sequential improvement. By focusing on pricing, we were able to overcome the declining volumes and grow income from operations and margins year-over-year in the collection line of business.
In the landfill side of the business, first quarter 2011 internal revenue growth from volume improved by 1.6% compared to the first quarter of 2010. C&D volumes improved 6.4% year-over-year, up from the flat volumes that we experienced in the fourth quarter. Internal revenue growth from volume for special waste was positive 2.9% year-over-year. As you know, special waste is generally more affected by weather than other volumes, so the severe winter weather had a bigger effect on this segment. But we still see strength in the pipeline for special waste volumes and expect them to improve during the quarters.  For MSW, internal revenue growth from volume was negative 6.7% year-over-year.
On the yield front, all of the waste streams had positive revenue growth from yield for the first quarter. The landfill business overcame the weather drag on volumes with strong revenue growth from yield. And income from operations from the landfill line businesses also improved in the first quarter of 2010. By looking at the combination of the collection and the landfill lines of business, income from operations grew 4% compared to the first quarter of 2010, and income from operations margin grew over 30 basis points.
In our waste-to-energy operations, income from operations has declined in the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2010. The expiration of a long-term electric power capacity agreement had a $6.3 million negative effect in the quarter. Also affecting the decline were upgrades to our acquired facility in Virginia, lower electricity revenues and weather, all of which are expected to improve as we progress throughout the remainder of 2011. For the rest of 2011, we expect to have an additional $0.02 earnings per share year-over-year drag in the second quarter, with the third and fourth quarters being flat to slightly positive year-over-year.
Turning to our recycling business, increased commodity prices and volume contributed about $0.03 of positive year-over-year earnings per diluted share in the first quarter of 2011, which was consistent with our expectations for the first quarter. Commodity prices have increased approximately 18% when compared with last year. We had expected prices to come down during the year but so far, they've remained strong. As prices continue to remain strong, we should see about a $0.02 earnings per share benefit in each of the second and third quarters and no net effect in the fourth quarter.
With respect to solid waste volumes through the last weeks of March and the first few weeks of April, we've seen some encouraging signs. We expect to see our normal seasonal improvement during the quarter, leading to steady improvement in the second and third quarters such that 2011 volume should be closer to flat when compared with the full year 2010. Of course, it's difficult to extrapolate first quarter volumes to the rest of the year, particularly due to severe weather effects in the first quarter, so we'll have more clarity about our volume projections after we see second quarter volumes.
So we made good progress in the first quarter, and we fully expect our cost reduction program and growth initiatives to turn from headwinds to tailwinds in the second half of the year. So with improving volumes, our customer focus, growth initiatives and our continued focus on operational excellence, we're confident that we're on track to meet our full year adjusted earnings forecast of $2.24 to $2.30 per diluted share. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

These costs increased by $114 million in the first quarter to 64.3% of revenue. Cost of goods sold increased $67 million in the quarter mainly because of rebates due to higher recycling commodity prices. These higher prices, net of rebates, had resulted in an increase in earnings per diluted share from our recycling operations of approximately $0.03 in the quarter. Direct fuel costs increased approximately $27 million, primarily because of a 27% increase in diesel fuel. Subcontractor costs increased $15 million in the quarter, primarily relating to the increase in special waste volume and increased fuel costs at our transfer station operations. In 2010, we redesigned our fuel surcharge to better match changes in diesel fuel costs. In the first quarter, the redesign worked as planned as fuel surcharge offset the increased costs of direct fuel and our fuel increases that are included in our subcontractor costs. 
Maintenance costs increased $11 million due to planned maintenance projects at our waste-to-energy and our landfill-gas-to-energy facilities. Operating costs at businesses we acquired accounted for $24 million of the increase. Foreign currency translation for our Canadian operations accounted for an increase of plant operating loss of approximately $6 million. Our SG&A costs increased $31 million year-over-year, and as a percentage of revenue, increased 30 basis points to 12.3%. The increased costs in SG&A relate primarily to our strategic growth plans and cost reduction initiatives and expenses related to our stock option grants under our long-term compensation program. 
Our growth initiatives, which include medical waste and Bagster, had a negative $0.03 per diluted share impact on the quarter. We expect our growth initiatives to have a negative earnings per share impact in the second and third quarters and to be flat to slightly positive in fourth quarter. 
One of our 3 long-term strategic goals is to continuously improve our operational efficiency. During our fourth quarter conference call, we told you that we had brought in outside consulting to assist us with initiatives to reduce costs and improve efficiency in areas like procurement, logistics and centralization of certain functions such as dispatch. The up-front costs for these initiatives were approximately $20 million in the first quarter. The outside consulting costs are expected to be a negative $0.02 per share in the second quarter and a negative $0.01 per share in each of the third and fourth quarters as we internalize the work of the consultants. The benefits from our cost reduction initiatives are expected to more than offset these costs in the third and fourth quarter and accelerate into 2012. In summary in the first quarter, we faced $0.09 of EPS headwinds. We expect these headwinds to be approximately a negative $0.06 per share in the second quarter, consisting of a negative $0.02 per share from each of our waste-to-energy operations, our growth initiatives and our cost reduction initiatives. We expect these investments will benefit the second half of the year, accelerate in 2012 and will lead to sustained margin expansion.
Interest expense for the first quarter increased $9 million compared with the prior year period. This is primarily due to higher up-front costs and usage fees on the revolving credit facility that we executed in June 2010. On March 31, 2011, our weighted average cost of debt was 5.6%, and our debt-to-total-capital ratio for the quarter was 58%, consistent with our target ratio of about 60%. The floating-rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 18% at the end of the quarter. 
Our income tax rate, as reported for the first quarter of 2011, was 35.9%. Included in the first quarter effective tax rate are adjustments to our net deferred taxes including a $2.2 million expense related to an income tax rate increase in Illinois. For 2011, we expect the recurring effective tax rate to be approximately 35%.
Turning to cash flow. First quarter 2011 net cash provided by operating activities was $600 million. This represents a 21% increase over the first quarter of 2010 and is the highest first quarter net cash provided by operating activities since the first quarter of 2006. The increase was driven primarily by changes in our working capital. 
Our capital expenditures for the first quarter were $316 million. We still anticipate spending between $1.35 billion and $1.45 billion on capital expenditures during 2011. Our free cash flow for the first quarter was $289 million, which is $36 million better than the prior year quarter despite an increase in capital expenditures of $61 million. This performance puts us well on the way of achieving our expected free cash flow for 2011 of between $1.25 billion and $1.35 billion. In the first quarter of 2011, we paid $162 million in dividends and we repurchased $63 million of our common stock, continuing our long-standing emphasis to return cash to our shareholders. We also completely -- we also completed approximately $100 million in business acquisitions. 
As we go forward with our cost reduction and growth initiatives, it is encouraging to see our traditional solid waste business perform so well. Through the dedication of hard-working employees, we were able to achieve solid performance in this quarter. And for that, we thank them. And with that, Nicole, let's open the line for questions."

I would think that two things are going to help us improve that during the year. First, you got seasonality, so as volumes improve, you ought to have more opportunity for pricing. And we've always said that sometimes, high fuel costs are a friend, right? We get to pass through the higher fuel costs through our fuel surcharge. That worked very well this quarter, having no net effect on the quarter. But with our landfill being positioned in a lot of places in advantaged geographic location, it now becomes a lot more expensive to drive past our landfill and to bring it to the competing landfill.

The benefits will be going through operating expense primarily in this year. And some of them will go through SG&A, but mostly it will go through operating expense. We do expect the benefits to be seen starting toward the end of the second quarter and well into the and tend to be relatively significant in the third and fourth quarter. Here's why we believe it. The 2 areas we're focusing at primarily, there's a lot of years we're focusing at. The 2 are procurement and the routing logistics side of the business. With procurement, it's pretty easy to see where the opportunities are. And once you start the process of renegotiating contracts and getting through that whole effort, you can see that the benefits are going to come and we have good visibility to that. So that one, we're quite comfortable with and we think there's a significant opportunity there. In the other area, the routing and logistics, we expect there will be some benefit this year. We're spending a little bit more in the second half procurement. And I think about procurement is once you've gotten it going, you internalize it pretty quickly and you take it from there and you don't really need to have the consulting costs to help. And the logistics, that's going to take a little bit more time. We've already started the process of taking a redesigned, of the effort of taking our redesigned processes supported by technology into one area, one market area where we're about to begin to roll it out in a second market area. Because of the complication of it, we're taking time to do. We found that just putting a new technology on a truck isn't enough unless you really take the time to retrain people to use the information and change the processes. that's going to take a little longer, but that gives us comfort that will take us into next year, the procurement benefits, the routing and logistics benefits will continue. And the third area we talked about was consolidating certain functions, and that in order to do that, you got to go through a process redesign and pick a location, find the right people and staff that function. And that's something that will take a couple of years to be, a good 12 to 18 months of organized. So it will take a little longer for those things to get into, to see the benefits. But the pieces from the procurement and some of the other piece, you will see pretty quickly."

And when Bob talked about when you look at procurement and logistics department, they've done a great job of flexing down costs and generally maintaining margins and increasing margins year-over-year, every year since I've been here even though we've had declining volumes. But having said all that, you get to a point where you're not getting as much traction here. As Bob talked about the onboard computers, we were getting benefits from that. But you got, sometimes you have to bring in sort of outside eyes to take a look at it and show you some new ways to do things, and that's exactly what we've done here. It's been very good. We're seeing some really good progress. And then ultimately it becomes the way you do business and then you get rid of those outside eyes. And so that's the process we're going through right now. Obviously, it takes some investment to do that, but we're counting on that being a fairly quick payback in 2011 and then accelerate into 2012."

I've been surprised that with gasoline prices as high as they are, there hasn't been as much talk about it. in other words, I think the last time it happened, there was the initial shock because it really hadn't happened before. And now I think people are pretty used to gasoline, whether a $3 per gallon at $3 right? And so obviously, I think all American businesses have to be concerned about higher fuel prices dampening the economy. Frankly for us, I think there's sort of a sweet spot in there between roughly $3.50 a gallon of gasoline where frankly it's not so high that we can't recover it through our fuel surcharge and customers don't complain about that. Yet as we've talked about before, our smaller competitors that don't have fuel surcharge are just going to have 1 choice or 2 choices, make less money or increase prices. That's a good thing. And then as the price of diesel goes up, if they're going to drive by our landfill, we basically price our landfill by figuring out what's the cost and next best alternative. all of sudden, the next best alternative becomes a lot more expensive at higher diesel prices. So I think you've hit the nail right on the head. My question is not that it's going to impact our business, because I think the impacts to our business are pretty good. My bigger concern would be it would have an impact on the larger economy. so far, I think the people have been a little bit immune to the higher prices, but it continues."

And one of the things that we saw when we first looked at this Bagster opportunity was with the new housing starts down, you're going to have more people doing remodeling, right? And so that's the perfect opportunity for Bagster. And so I'm not certain that Bagster is as much tied into the overall economy as, for example, our typical roll-off hauls. Because as you see, fewer people buying homes or constructing homes, your roll-off homes go down. And what that means you've got to remodel your current home and that should drive Bagster sales up. the medical waste side, it's not as tied to the economy, frankly, as it is tied to getting the sales force in place and getting them through the long cycle of sales, right? In other words, you build infrastructure and so that costs you money and that has costs. And you have salespeople and that adds costs. And if your sales cycle is 3 to 6 months on the medical waste side, you're going to suffer those costs before you start seeing revenue. And so we've been adding salespeople. We continue to add salespeople in medical waste. We do see them starting to generate enough revenue to pay for themselves, if you will, because of the long sales cycle in medical waste, it takes a little bit longer."

But those are customers that were adding basically in the first and second quarters. So you got -- you should have some additional revenue generation. Frankly, it's been a little bit slower than we expected because we've got a competitor out there that's pretty fierce and doing whatever they need to do to retain customers. But that, too, will pass, and we think that medical waste will be a great business for us. And then on Bagster, clearly what we've seen year-over-year is over 100% growth on sales and over 200% growth on pickups. And so we're pretty confident that we'll see improvement there. Now I will tell you that in my mind, the back half of the year is a heck of a lot more focused on the cost reduction initiatives than it is the growth initiatives. Remember what we said about the growth initiatives is that they're going to continue to be negative in the second and third quarter and sort of flat to maybe slightly positive in the fourth quarter.

190694,128746575,119449,"Waste Management, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2011",2011-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. During the first quarter, our solid waste operations performed well, with strong yield performance offsetting weaker-than-expected volumes. Our overall business earned $0.39 per diluted share, with about $0.09 of",1237,"Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. During the first quarter, our solid waste operations performed well, with strong yield performance offsetting weaker-than-expected volumes. Our overall business earned $0.39 per diluted share, with about $0.09 of impact from short-term headwind. Year-over-year, we had a negative impact of $0.02 per diluted share from our waste-to-energy operations and $0.01 per diluted share from stock option grants under our long-term compensation program. We also had negative impacts of $0.03 per diluted share from our cost reduction initiatives and a negative $0.03 per diluted share from our growth initiatives. Without these, our earnings would have been $0.48 per diluted share, which demonstrates the strength of our solid waste business.
Spending on our cost reduction initiatives will slow in the second quarter, and we should begin to see year-over-year benefits in the third quarter. Our portfolio of growth initiatives, like Bagster and medical waste, will negatively affect the second and possibly the third quarters, but should become profitable by the end of the year. And our waste-to-energy business will have a small negative effect in the second quarter but will begin to add year-over-year earnings growth in the third or fourth quarter. So these headwinds should be very short term, and we expect them to drive operational and earnings improvement for years to come.
During the first quarter, revenue increased by $168 million or 5.7% from the prior year quarter. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of positive year-over-year revenue comparison. Major drivers of our revenue improvement are improved recycling volumes at higher commodity prices, the continued emphasis on year-over-year yield increases and acquisitions. 
Internal revenue growth from yield on our collection and disposal operations was 2.8% in the quarter. This represents the highest yield since the third quarter of 2009 and the third quarter of sequential growth. In the coming quarters, many of our fees and surcharges will anniversary, causing downward pressure on yield growth. CPI is an important component of pricing in our municipal sector. CPI increased about 1% for the first 3 months of 2011, consistent with our expectations, but below the level we saw in the first quarter of 2010. 
We had approximately a 40 basis point reduction in yield from CPI in the first quarter. Many of our contracts adjust on July 1, so the low CPI will continue to negatively affect yield in the second half of the year. Despite these pricing pressures, we'll continue to maintain our pricing discipline and fully expect to achieve or exceed our full year yield target. 
The combined internal revenue growth from yield in the industrial, commercial and residential lines of our collection business was 3.3% in the first quarter. Commercial and industrial yields were 4.1% and 3.4%, respectively. The yield component of internal revenue growth in our residential line of business was 2.3%.
Both commercial and industrial new business pricing increased compared to the first quarter of last year. The commercial increase represents the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. Our customer churns have been improving steadily over the last 3 quarters and improved to 9.5% in the first quarter of 2011.
On the volume side of the business, internal revenue growth from volume declined 1.7% in the quarter, a 10 basis point sequential improvement from the fourth quarter of 2010. We had expected that volumes would be stronger in the first quarter. However, the winter weather certainly had a negative effect on volumes. Both our commercial and residential collection lines of business saw a year-over-year volume decline of 5.6%. 
The residential line of business improved 30 basis points from the fourth quarter, which is the first sequential improvement in residential volumes since the fourth quarter of 2009. Industrial volumes declined by 2.8% on a year-over-year basis, which was the seventh straight quarter of sequential improvement. By focusing on pricing, we were able to overcome the declining volumes and grow income from operations and margins year-over-year in the collection line of business.
In the landfill side of the business, first quarter 2011 internal revenue growth from volume improved by 1.6% compared to the first quarter of 2010. C&D volumes improved 6.4% year-over-year, up from the flat volumes that we experienced in the fourth quarter. Internal revenue growth from volume for special waste was positive 2.9% year-over-year. As you know, special waste is generally more affected by weather than other volumes, so the severe winter weather had a bigger effect on this segment. But we still see strength in the pipeline for special waste volumes and expect them to improve during the quarters.  For MSW, internal revenue growth from volume was negative 6.7% year-over-year.
On the yield front, all of the waste streams had positive revenue growth from yield for the first quarter. The landfill business overcame the weather drag on volumes with strong revenue growth from yield. And income from operations in the landfill line businesses also improved in the first quarter of 2010. When looking at the combinations of the collection and the landfill lines of business, income from operations grew 4% compared to the first quarter of 2010, and income from operations margin grew over 30 basis points.
In our waste-to-energy operations, income from operation has declined in the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2010. The expiration of a long-term electric power capacity agreement had a $6.3 million negative effect in the quarter. Also affecting the decline were upgrades to our acquired facility in Virginia, lower electricity revenues and weather, all of which are expected to improve as we progress throughout the remainder of 2011. For the rest of 2011, we expect to have an additional $0.02 earnings per share year-over-year drag in the second quarter, with the third and fourth quarters being flat to slightly positive year-over-year.
Turning to our recycling business. Increased commodity prices and volume contributed about $0.03 of positive year-over-year earnings per diluted share in the first quarter of 2011, which was consistent with our expectations for the first quarter. Commodity prices have increased approximately 18% when compared with last year. We had expected prices to come down during the year but so far, they've remained strong. As prices continue to remain strong, we should see about a $0.02 earnings per share benefit in each of the second and third quarters and no net effect in the fourth quarter.
With respect to solid waste volumes, through the last weeks of March and the first few weeks of April, we've seen some encouraging signs. We expect to see our normal seasonal improvement during the quarter, leading to steady improvement in the second and third quarters such that 2011 volume should be closer to flat when compared with the full year 2010. Of course, it's difficult to extrapolate first quarter volumes to the rest of the year, particularly due to severe weather effects in the first quarter, so we'll have more clarity about our volume projections after we see second quarter volumes.
So we made good progress in the first quarter, and we fully expect our cost reduction program and growth initiatives to turn from headwinds to tailwinds in the second half of the year. So with improving volumes, our customer focus, growth initiatives and our continued focus on operational excellence, we're confident that we're on track to meet our full year adjusted earnings forecast of $2.24 to $2.30 per diluted share. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

These costs increased by $114 million in the first quarter to 64.3% of revenue. Cost of goods sold increased $67 million in the quarter mainly because of rebates due to higher recycling commodity prices. These higher prices, net of rebates, had resulted in an increase in earnings per diluted share from our recycling operations of approximately $0.03 in the quarter. 
Direct fuel costs increased approximately $27 million, primarily because of a 27% increase in diesel fuel. Subcontractor costs increased $15 million in the quarter, primarily relating to the increase in special waste volume and increased fuel costs at our transfer station operations. In 2010, we redesigned our fuel surcharge to better match changes in diesel fuel costs. In the first quarter, the redesign worked as planned as the fuel surcharge offset the increased costs of direct fuel and other fuel increases that are included in our subcontractor costs. 
Maintenance costs increased $11 million due to planned maintenance projects at our waste-to-energy and our landfill-gas-to-energy facilities. Operating costs at businesses we acquired accounted for $24 million of the increase. 
Foreign currency translation for our Canadian operations accounted for an increase in operating costs of approximately $6 million. Our SG&A costs increased $31 million year-over-year, and as a percentage of revenue, increased 30 basis points to 12.3%. The increased costs in SG&A relate primarily to our strategic growth plans and cost reduction initiatives and expenses related to our stock option grants under our long-term compensation program. 
Our growth initiatives, which include medical waste and Bagster, had a negative $0.03 per diluted share impact on the quarter. We expect our growth initiatives to have a negative earnings per share impact in the second and third quarters and to be flat to slightly positive in fourth quarter. 
One of our 3 long-term strategic goals is to continuously improve our operational efficiency. During our fourth quarter conference call, we told you that we had brought in outside consultants to assist us with initiatives to reduce costs and improve efficiency in areas like procurement, routing and logistics and the centralization of certain functions such as dispatch. 
The up-front costs for these initiatives were approximately $20 million in the first quarter. The outside consulting costs are expected to be a negative $0.02 per share in the second quarter and a negative $0.01 per share in each of the third and fourth quarters as we internalize the work of the consultants. The benefits from our cost reduction initiatives are expected to more than offset these costs in the third and fourth quarter and accelerate into 2012. 
In summary, in the first quarter, we faced $0.09 of EPS headwinds. We expect these headwinds to be approximately a negative $0.06 per share in the second quarter, consisting of a negative $0.02 per share from each of our waste-to-energy operations, our growth initiatives and our cost reduction initiatives. We expect these investments will benefit the second half of the year, accelerate in 2012 and will lead to sustained margin expansion.
Interest expense for the first quarter increased $9 million compared with the prior year period. This is primarily due to higher up-front costs and usage fees on the revolving credit facility that we executed in June 2010. On March 31, 2011, our weighted average cost of debt was 5.6%, and our debt-to-total-capital ratio for the quarter was 58%, consistent with our target ratio of about 60%. The floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 18% at the end of the quarter. 
Our income tax rate as reported for the first quarter of 2011 was 35.9%. Included in the first quarter effective tax rate are adjustments to our net deferred taxes, including a $2.2 million expense related to an income tax rate increase in Illinois. For 2011, we expect the recurring effective tax rate to be approximately 35%.
Turning to cash flow. First quarter 2011 net cash provided by operating activities was $600 million. This represents a 21% increase over the first quarter of 2010 and is the highest first quarter net cash provided by operating activities since the first quarter of 2006. The increase was driven primarily by changes in our working capital. 
Our capital expenditures for the first quarter were $316 million. We still anticipate spending between $1.35 billion and $1.45 billion on capital expenditures during 2011. Our free cash flow for the first quarter was $289 million, which is $36 million better than the prior year quarter despite an increase in capital expenditures of $61 million. This performance puts us well on the way of achieving our expected free cash flow for 2011 of between $1.25 billion and $1.35 billion. 
In the first quarter of 2011, we paid $162 million in dividends and we repurchased $63 million of our common stock, continuing our long-standing emphasis to return cash to our shareholders. We also completed approximately $100 million in business acquisitions. 
As we go forward with our cost reduction and growth initiatives, it is encouraging to see our traditional solid waste business perform so well. Through the dedication of hard-working employees, we were able to achieve solid performance in this quarter. And for that, we thank them. 
And with that, Nicole, let's open the line for questions."

I would think that two things are going to help us improve that during the year. First, you got seasonality. So as volumes improve, you ought to have more opportunity for pricing. And we've always said that sometimes, high fuel costs are our friend, right? We get to pass through the higher fuel costs through our fuel surcharge. That worked very well this quarter, having no net effect on the quarter. But with our landfill being positioned in a lot of places in advantaged geographic location, it now becomes a lot more expensive to drive past our landfill and to bring it to a competing landfill. So both of those factors should help us in pricing during the course of the year."

So you've got -- so what's going to have to drive it going forward, so we expect to see some headwinds that I said from CPI and from the anniversary-ing of fees. What's going to have to drive it going forward is a continued -- as you point out, continued new business pricing continue to increase, price increases on our commercial line of business, which we've been pretty good about doing in the last 5 years, and then better landfill pricing in the back half of the year."

But then in 2012, the CPI should become a tailwind, which hopefully offsets the headwinds from the anniversary-ing of the fees. And so then you're back to sort of a normal state, if you will, where pricing is driven more by the traditional methods of pricing, which is annual price increases on your customers at both the collection and landfill line of business. So the back half of the year, I would expect -- we're going to maintain our pricing discipline. And so I'm not surprised by the 2.8% in the first quarter. I wouldn't be surprised to see that come down a little bit in the remaining quarters of 2011, but then I would expect to see it go back up in 2012 as we start getting the tailwinds from the CPI benefits."

We'd expect to see roughly that amount in the remaining quarters because that was not one that we instituted last year. So net-net, you're looking at sort of a $10 million to $15 million drag to pricing from the anniversary-ing of the fees."

The $0.01 that we talked about that are -- will be going through SG&A, the benefits will be going through operating expense primarily in this year. And some of them will go through SG&A, but mostly it will go through operating expense. And we do expect the benefits to be seen starting toward the end of the second quarter and well into  the -- and to be relatively significant in the third and fourth quarter. Here's why we believe it. The 2 areas we're focusing on primarily -- there's a lot of areas we're focusing at. The 2 are procurement and the routing logistics side of the business. With procurement, it's pretty easy to see where the opportunities are. And once you start the process of renegotiating contracts and getting through that whole effort, you can see that the benefits are going to come and we have good visibility to that. So that one, we're quite comfortable with, and we think there's a significant opportunity there. In the other area, the routing and logistics, we expect there will be some benefit this year. We're spending a little bit more in the second half on that than we will with procurement. The nice thing about procurement is once you've gotten it going, you internalize it pretty quickly and you take it from there and you don't really need to have the consulting costs to help. On the routing and logistics, that's going to take a little bit more time. We've already started the process of taking a redesigned -- or the effort to taking our redesigned processes supported by technology into one area, one market area, where we're about to begin to roll it out in a second market area. Because of the complication of it, we're taking time to do it We found that just putting a new technology on a truck isn't enough unless you really take the time to retrain people to use the information and change the processes. And that's just going to take a little longer. But that gives us comfort when that will take us into next year, the procurement benefits will continue, the routing and logistics benefits will continue. And then the third area we talked about was consolidating certain functions. And in order to do that, you got to go through a process redesign, pick a location, find the right people and then staff that function. And that's something that will take a couple of years, to me, a good 12 to 18 months of organized this. So it will take a little longer for those things to get into to see the benefits. But the pieces from the procurement and some of the others, you will see pretty quickly."

And when -- as Bob talked about, when you look at procurement and the logistics department, they've done a great job at flexing down costs and generally maintaining margins, increasing margins year-over-year, every year since I've been here even though we've had declining volumes. But having said all that, you get to a point where you're not getting as much traction here. As Bob talked about, the onboard computers, we were getting benefits from that. But you got -- sometimes you have to bring in sort of outside eyes to take a look at it and show you some new ways to do things. And that's exactly what we've done here. It's been very good. We're seeing some really good progress. And then ultimately, it becomes the way you do business and you get rid of those outside eyes. And so that's the process we're going through right now.

And then as you get more market awareness, ultimately, you won't need to spend as much on marketing.

I've been surprised that with gasoline prices as high as they are, there hasn't been as much talk about it. I mean, in other words, I think the last time it happened, there was the initial shock because it really hadn't happened before. And now I think people are pretty used to gasoline, whether $3 per gallon -- at $3 with it, right? And so obviously, I think all American businesses have to be concerned about high fuel applied prices dampening the economy. Frankly for us, I think there's sort of a sweet spot in there between roughly $3.50 a gallon of gasoline where frankly it's not so high that we can't recover it through our fuel surcharge and customers don't complain about that. Yet as we've talked about before, our smaller local competitors that don't have fuel surcharge are just going to have 1 choice or 2 choices: make less money or increase prices. That's a good thing. And then as the price of diesel goes up, if they're going to drive by our landfill, we basically price our landfill by figuring out what's the cost and the next best alternative. And all of sudden, the next best alternative becomes a lot more expensive at higher diesel prices. So I think you've hit the nail right on the head. My concern is not that it's going to impact our business because frankly I think the impact to our business are pretty good. My bigger concern would be that it would have an impact on the larger economy. And so far, I think people have been a little bit immune to the higher prices but it sort of continues."

And one of the things that we saw when we first looked at this Bagster opportunity was with the new housing starts down, you're going to have more people doing remodeling, right? And so that's the perfect opportunity for Bagster. And so I'm not certain that Bagster is as much tied in to the overall economy as, for example, our typical roll-off hauls. Because as you see fewer people buying homes or constructing homes, your roll-off hauls go down. But what that means is that you've got to remodel your current home and that should drive Bagster sales up. On the medical waste side, it's not as tied to the economy, frankly, as it is tied to getting the salesforce in place and getting them through the long cycle of sales, right? In other words, you build infrastructure and so that costs you money and that has costs. And then you add salespeople and that add costs. And if your sales cycle is 3 to 6 months on the medical waste side, you're going to suffer those costs before you start seeing revenue. And so we've been adding salespeople. We continue to add salespeople in medical waste. We need to see them starting to generate enough revenue to pay for themselves, if you will, because of the long sales cycle in medical waste.

Frankly, it's been a little bit slower than we expected because we've got a competitor out there that's pretty fierce in doing whatever they need to do to retain customers. But that, too, will pass, and we think that medical waste will be a great business for us. And then on Bagster, clearly what we've seen year-over-year is over 100% growth on sales and over 200% growth on pickups. And so we're pretty confident that we'll see improvement there. Now I will tell you that in my mind, the back half of the year is a heck of a lot more focused on the cost reduction initiatives than it is the growth initiatives. Remember what we said about the growth initiatives is that they're going to continue to be negative in the second and third quarter and sort of flat to maybe slightly positive in the fourth quarter.

190694,128746575,119469,"Waste Management, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2011",2011-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. During the first quarter, our solid waste operations performed well, with strong yield performance offsetting weaker-than-expected volumes. Our overall business earned $0.39 per diluted share, with about $0.09 of",1237,"Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. During the first quarter, our solid waste operations performed well, with strong yield performance offsetting weaker-than-expected volumes. Our overall business earned $0.39 per diluted share, with about $0.09 of impact from short-term headwind. Year-over-year, we had a negative impact of $0.02 per diluted share from our waste-to-energy operations and $0.01 per diluted share from stock option grants under our long-term compensation program. We also had negative impacts of $0.03 per diluted share from our cost reduction initiatives and a negative $0.03 per diluted share from our growth initiatives. Without these, our earnings would have been $0.48 per diluted share, which demonstrates the strength of our solid waste business.
Spending on our cost reduction initiatives will slow in the second quarter, and we should begin to see year-over-year benefits in the third quarter. Our portfolio of growth initiatives, like Bagster and medical waste, will negatively affect the second and possibly the third quarters, but should become profitable by the end of the year. And our waste-to-energy business will have a small negative effect in the second quarter but will begin to add year-over-year earnings growth in the third or fourth quarter. So these headwinds should be very short term, and we expect them to drive operational and earnings improvement for years to come.
During the first quarter, revenue increased by $168 million or 5.7% from the prior year quarter. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of positive year-over-year revenue comparison. Major drivers of our revenue improvement are improved recycling volumes at higher commodity prices, the continued emphasis on year-over-year yield increases and acquisitions. 
Internal revenue growth from yield on our collection and disposal operations was 2.8% in the quarter. This represents the highest yield since the third quarter of 2009 and the third quarter of sequential growth. In the coming quarters, many of our fees and surcharges will anniversary, causing downward pressure on yield growth. CPI is an important component of pricing in our municipal sector. CPI increased about 1% for the first 3 months of 2011, consistent with our expectations, but below the level we saw in the first quarter of 2010. 
We had approximately a 40 basis point reduction in yield from CPI in the first quarter. Many of our contracts adjust on July 1, so the low CPI will continue to negatively affect yield in the second half of the year. Despite these pricing pressures, we'll continue to maintain our pricing discipline and fully expect to achieve or exceed our full year yield target. 
The combined internal revenue growth from yield in the industrial, commercial and residential lines of our collection business was 3.3% in the first quarter. Commercial and industrial yields were 4.1% and 3.4%, respectively. The yield component of internal revenue growth in our residential line of business was 2.3%.
Both commercial and industrial new business pricing increased compared to the first quarter of last year. The commercial increase represents the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. Our customer churns have been improving steadily over the last 3 quarters and improved to 9.5% in the first quarter of 2011.
On the volume side of the business, internal revenue growth from volume declined 1.7% in the quarter, a 10 basis point sequential improvement from the fourth quarter of 2010. We had expected that volumes would be stronger in the first quarter. However, the winter weather certainly had a negative effect on volumes. Both our commercial and residential collection lines of business saw a year-over-year volume decline of 5.6%. 
The residential line of business improved 30 basis points from the fourth quarter, which is the first sequential improvement in residential volumes since the fourth quarter of 2009. Industrial volumes declined by 2.8% on a year-over-year basis, which was the seventh straight quarter of sequential improvement. By focusing on pricing, we were able to overcome the declining volumes and grow income from operations and margins year-over-year in the collection line of business.
In the landfill side of the business, first quarter 2011 internal revenue growth from volume improved by 1.6% compared to the first quarter of 2010. C&D volumes improved 6.4% year-over-year, up from the flat volumes that we experienced in the fourth quarter. Internal revenue growth from volume for special waste was positive 2.9% year-over-year. As you know, special waste is generally more affected by weather than other volumes, so the severe winter weather had a bigger effect on this segment. But we still see strength in the pipeline for special waste volumes and expect them to improve during the quarters.  For MSW, internal revenue growth from volume was negative 6.7% year-over-year.
On the yield front, all of the waste streams had positive revenue growth from yield for the first quarter. The landfill business overcame the weather drag on volumes with strong revenue growth from yield. And income from operations in the landfill line businesses also improved in the first quarter of 2010. When looking at the combinations of the collection and the landfill lines of business, income from operations grew 4% compared to the first quarter of 2010, and income from operations margin grew over 30 basis points.
In our waste-to-energy operations, income from operation has declined in the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2010. The expiration of a long-term electric power capacity agreement had a $6.3 million negative effect in the quarter. Also affecting the decline were upgrades to our acquired facility in Virginia, lower electricity revenues and weather, all of which are expected to improve as we progress throughout the remainder of 2011. For the rest of 2011, we expect to have an additional $0.02 earnings per share year-over-year drag in the second quarter, with the third and fourth quarters being flat to slightly positive year-over-year.
Turning to our recycling business. Increased commodity prices and volume contributed about $0.03 of positive year-over-year earnings per diluted share in the first quarter of 2011, which was consistent with our expectations for the first quarter. Commodity prices have increased approximately 18% when compared with last year. We had expected prices to come down during the year but so far, they've remained strong. As prices continue to remain strong, we should see about a $0.02 earnings per share benefit in each of the second and third quarters and no net effect in the fourth quarter.
With respect to solid waste volumes, through the last weeks of March and the first few weeks of April, we've seen some encouraging signs. We expect to see our normal seasonal improvement during the quarter, leading to steady improvement in the second and third quarters such that 2011 volume should be closer to flat when compared with the full year 2010. Of course, it's difficult to extrapolate first quarter volumes to the rest of the year, particularly due to severe weather effects in the first quarter, so we'll have more clarity about our volume projections after we see second quarter volumes.
So we made good progress in the first quarter, and we fully expect our cost reduction program and growth initiatives to turn from headwinds to tailwinds in the second half of the year. So with improving volumes, our customer focus, growth initiatives and our continued focus on operational excellence, we're confident that we're on track to meet our full year adjusted earnings forecast of $2.24 to $2.30 per diluted share. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

These costs increased by $114 million in the first quarter to 64.3% of revenue. Cost of goods sold increased $67 million in the quarter mainly because of rebates due to higher recycling commodity prices. These higher prices, net of rebates, had resulted in an increase in earnings per diluted share from our recycling operations of approximately $0.03 in the quarter. 
Direct fuel costs increased approximately $27 million, primarily because of a 27% increase in diesel fuel. Subcontractor costs increased $15 million in the quarter, primarily relating to the increase in special waste volume and increased fuel costs at our transfer station operations. In 2010, we redesigned our fuel surcharge to better match changes in diesel fuel costs. In the first quarter, the redesign worked as planned as the fuel surcharge offset the increased costs of direct fuel and other fuel increases that are included in our subcontractor costs. 
Maintenance costs increased $11 million due to planned maintenance projects at our waste-to-energy and our landfill-gas-to-energy facilities. Operating costs at businesses we acquired accounted for $24 million of the increase. 
Foreign currency translation for our Canadian operations accounted for an increase in operating costs of approximately $6 million. Our SG&A costs increased $31 million year-over-year, and as a percentage of revenue, increased 30 basis points to 12.3%. The increased costs in SG&A relate primarily to our strategic growth plans and cost reduction initiatives and expenses related to our stock option grants under our long-term compensation program. 
Our growth initiatives, which include medical waste and Bagster, had a negative $0.03 per diluted share impact on the quarter. We expect our growth initiatives to have a negative earnings per share impact in the second and third quarters and to be flat to slightly positive in fourth quarter. 
One of our 3 long-term strategic goals is to continuously improve our operational efficiency. During our fourth quarter conference call, we told you that we had brought in outside consultants to assist us with initiatives to reduce costs and improve efficiency in areas like procurement, routing [ph] and logistics and the centralization of certain functions such as dispatch. 
The up-front costs for these initiatives were approximately $20 million in the first quarter. The outside consulting costs are expected to be a negative $0.02 per share in the second quarter and a negative $0.01 per share in each of the third and fourth quarters as we internalize the work of the consultants. The benefits from our cost reduction initiatives are expected to more than offset these costs in the third and fourth quarter and accelerate into 2012. 
In summary, in the first quarter, we faced $0.09 of EPS headwinds. We expect these headwinds to be approximately a negative $0.06 per share in the second quarter, consisting of a negative $0.02 per share from each of our waste-to-energy operations, our growth initiatives and our cost reduction initiatives. We expect these investments will benefit the second half of the year, accelerate in 2012 and will lead to sustained margin expansion.
Interest expense for the first quarter increased $9 million compared with the prior year period. This is primarily due to higher up-front costs and usage fees on the revolving credit facility that we executed in June 2010. On March 31, 2011, our weighted average cost of debt was 5.6%, and our debt-to-total-capital ratio for the quarter was 58%, consistent with our target ratio of about 60%. The floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 18% at the end of the quarter. 
Our income tax rate as reported for the first quarter of 2011 was 35.9%. Included in the first quarter effective tax rate are adjustments to our net deferred taxes, including a $2.2 million expense related to an income tax rate increase in Illinois. For 2011, we expect the recurring effective tax rate to be approximately 35%.
Turning to cash flow. First quarter 2011 net cash provided by operating activities was $600 million. This represents a 21% increase over the first quarter of 2010 and is the highest first quarter net cash provided by operating activities since the first quarter of 2006. The increase was driven primarily by changes in our working capital. 
Our capital expenditures for the first quarter were $316 million. We still anticipate spending between $1.35 billion and $1.45 billion on capital expenditures during 2011. Our free cash flow for the first quarter was $289 million, which is $36 million better than the prior year quarter despite an increase in capital expenditures of $61 million. This performance puts us well on the way of achieving our expected free cash flow for 2011 of between $1.25 billion and $1.35 billion. 
In the first quarter of 2011, we paid $162 million in dividends and we repurchased $63 million of our common stock, continuing our long-standing emphasis to return cash to our shareholders. We also completed approximately $100 million in business acquisitions. 
As we go forward with our cost reduction and growth initiatives, it is encouraging to see our traditional solid waste business perform so well. Through the dedication of hard-working employees, we were able to achieve solid performance in this quarter. And for that, we thank them. 
And with that, Nicole, let's open the line for questions."

I would think that two things are going to help us improve that during the year. First, you got seasonality. So as volumes improve, you ought to have more opportunity for pricing. And we've always said that sometimes, high fuel costs are our friend, right? We get to pass through the higher fuel costs through our fuel surcharge. That worked very well this quarter, having no net effect on the quarter. But with our landfill being positioned in a lot of places in advantaged geographic location, it now becomes a lot more expensive to drive past our landfill and to bring it to a competing landfill. So both of those factors should help us in pricing during the course of the year."

And our administrative fee provides some benefit in the quarter. That also anniversaries in the second quarter. So you've got -- so what's going to have to drive it going forward, so we expect to see some headwinds that I said from CPI and from the anniversary-ing of fees. What's going to have to drive it going forward is a continued -- as you point out, continued new business pricing continue to increase, price increases on our commercial line of business, which we've been pretty good about doing in the last 5 years, and then better landfill pricing in the back half of the year."

But then in 2012, the CPI should become a tailwind, which hopefully offsets the headwinds from the anniversary-ing of the fees. And so then you're back to sort of a normal state, if you will, where pricing is driven more by the traditional methods of pricing, which is annual price increases on your customers at both the collection and landfill line of business. So the back half of the year, I would expect -- we're going to maintain our pricing discipline. And so I'm not surprised by the 2.8% in the first quarter. I wouldn't be surprised to see that come down a little bit in the remaining quarters of 2011, but then I would expect to see it go back up in 2012 as we start getting the tailwinds from the CPI benefits."

We've got our administrative fee, which gave us an $8 million benefit in the first quarter. And again, that anniversaries in the second quarter, so we expect to get no benefit of that from that. And then we got our new container service fee, which was $11 million benefit in Q2.

The $0.01 that we talked about that are -- will be going through SG&A, the benefits will be going through operating expense primarily in this year. And some of them will go through SG&A, but mostly it will go through operating expense. And we do expect the benefits to be seen starting toward the end of the second quarter and well into  the -- and to be relatively significant in the third and fourth quarter. Here's why we believe it. The 2 areas we're focusing on primarily -- there's a lot of areas we're focusing at. The 2 are procurement and the routing logistics side of the business. With procurement, it's pretty easy to see where the opportunities are. And once you start the process of renegotiating contracts and getting through that whole effort, you can see that the benefits are going to come and we have good visibility to that. So that one, we're quite comfortable with, and we think there's a significant opportunity there. In the other area, the routing and logistics, we expect there will be some benefit this year. We're spending a little bit more in the second half on that than we will with procurement. The nice thing about procurement is once you've gotten it going, you internalize it pretty quickly and you take it from there and you don't really need to have the consulting costs to help. On the routing and logistics, that's going to take a little bit more time. We've already started the process of taking a redesigned -- or the effort to taking our redesigned processes supported by technology into one area, one market area, where we're about to begin to roll it out in a second market area. Because of the complication of it, we're taking time to do it. We found that just putting a new technology on a truck isn't enough unless you really take the time to retrain people to use the information and change the processes. And that's just going to take a little longer. But that gives us comfort when that will take us into next year, the procurement benefits will continue, the routing and logistics benefits will continue. And then the third area we talked about was consolidating certain functions. And in order to do that, you got to go through a process redesign, pick a location, find the right people and then staff that function. And that's something that will take a couple of years, to me, a good 12 to 18 months of organized and do. So it will take a little longer for those things to get into to see the benefits. But the pieces from the procurement and some of the others, you will see pretty quickly."

And when -- as Bob talked about, when you look at procurement and the logistics department, they've done a great job at flexing down costs and generally maintaining margins, increasing margins year-over-year, every year since I've been here even though we've had declining volumes. But having said all that, you get to a point where you're not getting as much traction here. As Bob talked about, the onboard computers, we were getting benefits from that. But you got -- sometimes you have to bring in sort of outside eyes to take a look at it and show you some new ways to do things. And that's exactly what we've done here. It's been very good. We're seeing some really good progress. And then ultimately, it becomes the way you do business and you get rid of those outside eyes. And so that's the process we're going through right now.

And then as you get more market awareness, ultimately, you won't need to spend as much on marketing.

I've been surprised that with gasoline prices as high as they are, there hasn't been as much talk about it. I mean, in other words, I think the last time it happened, there was the initial shock because it really hadn't happened before. And now I think people are pretty used to gasoline, whether $3 per gallon -- at $3 with it, right? And so obviously, I think all American businesses have to be concerned about high fuel applied prices dampening the economy. Frankly for us, I think there's sort of a sweet spot in there between roughly $3.50 a gallon of gasoline where frankly it's not so high that we can't recover it through our fuel surcharge and customers don't complain about that. Yet as we've talked about before, our smaller local competitors that don't have fuel surcharge are just going to have 1 choice or 2 choices: make less money or increase prices. That's a good thing. And then as the price of diesel goes up, if they're going to drive by our landfill, we basically price our landfill by figuring out what's the cost and the next best alternative. And all of sudden, the next best alternative becomes a lot more expensive at higher diesel prices. So I think you've hit the nail right on the head. My concern is not that it's going to impact our business because frankly I think the impact to our business are pretty good. My bigger concern would be that it would have an impact on the larger economy. And so far, I think people have been a little bit immune to the higher prices, let's hope it continues."

Because as you see fewer people buying homes or constructing homes, your roll-off hauls go down. But what that means is that you've got to remodel your current home and that should drive Bagster sales up. On the medical waste side, it's not as tied to the economy, frankly, as it is tied to getting the salesforce in place and getting them through the long cycle of sales, right? In other words, you build infrastructure and so that costs you money and that has costs. And then you add salespeople and that add costs. And if your sales cycle is three to six months on the medical waste side, you're going to suffer those costs before you start seeing revenue. And so we've been adding salespeople.

During the second quarter, we earned $0.50 per diluted share, a. Number of things in the quarter went just as we expected.

During the second quarter, we earned $0.50 per diluted share, a. Number of things in the quarter went just as we expected. As previously discussed, we had about $0.06 of combined earnings per share headwinds from our waste energy operations, our growth initiatives and our cost reduction programs. In the back half of the year, we expect these collective headwinds to abate and brought our cost reduction efforts to begin to add to earnings. However, in the quarter, a few things did not go as we expected. We had a $0.04 reduction in earnings per share from increased maintenance from repair costs, legal items and risk management. The legal and risk management items are second quarter issues but the maintenance increase is primarily due to higher commodity prices so we'll likely see higher maintenance costs in the back half of the year. Our revenue growth from yield was slightly below expectations for the quarter and our revenue growth from volume was lower than our expectations. With respect to yield, we're taking immediate and significant pricing actions to increase our yield. With respect to volumes, we continue to move forward with our customer focused growth initiatives and the transaction that we announced today to purchase Oakley will certainly accelerate those efforts. We're pleased that during the second quarter revenue increased by $189 million or 6% from the prior-year quarter. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of positive year-over-year revenue comparison. Higher commodity prices, improved recycling volumes, acquisitions and year-over-year yield increases contributed to the revenue growth. While internal revenue growth from yield continues to provide positive revenue growth, we're not satisfied with the results for the second quarter. Internal revenue growth from yield and our collection and disposal operations was 1.6% in the quarter and 2.2% year-to-date through June 30. The combined internal revenue growth from yield in the industrial, commercial and residential lines of our collection business was 2% in the second quarter. Commercial and industrial yields were 3.2% and 1.3%, respectively. Yield in our residential line of business was 0.9%. At the beginning of the year, we noted that the residential line of business was become more competitive: local, regional and national companies have become more aggressive on price. Municipalities are also looking for price concessions so you this positive significant increases in residential yields.
Our price increases to customers were right on plan, but mix issues had about 60 to 80 basis points of negative effect on yield in the quarter, which is much higher than we've seen in the recent past. The mix issues were most common in our southern group, where for example, in our franchise markets, we saw a dramatic shift in mix from higher priced permanent roll-off to a lower price temporary roll-off. So looking at yield without mix, we would've been over 2% yield. Our pricing actions in the second half of the year should add about 80 basis points to 100 basis points to yield, of course, offset by any continuing mix issues.
Another factor affecting our yield has been rollbacks of our price increases. In our commercial line of business, we implemented significant price increases to our customers in the 6% to 7% range. This level of price increase has been the norm over the last 5 years of Waste Management. Local haulers often offer new business prices substantially below our prices but lately, we've seen our regional and national competitors aggressively reduce prices to obtain volumes. We had to take action to retain profitable customers and in the second quarter, we saw the highest level of price rollbacks since prior 2004. But the bottom line earnings benefit of increasing our yield continues earnings benefit you can get from purchasing volumes at low prices. So we will continue to maintain our pricing discipline even in the face of aggressive discounting by our competitors. 
Despite these pricing pressures, we maintained customer churn at about 10% in the second quarter, a 60 basis point improvement from the same quarter in the prior year. On the landfill yield front, all of the waste streams had positive revenue growth from yield during the second quarter, continuing the trend that we saw in the first quarter. On the volume side of the business, internal revenue growth from volume declined 1.7% in the quarter, which is flat compared to the first quarter of 2011. If you exclude the volumes associated with the Gulf Coast cleanup efforts in 2010, volume would have declined 1.1% in the quarter. Although we saw a good seasonal uptick in volumes in the first few weeks of April, volumes had a soft patch in May and June, mirroring the dip in the U.S. economy. Our commercial collection line of business saw year-over-year volume decline of 4.9% and the residential line of business saw a 4.2% decline year-over-year. Both of these collection lines improved sequentially from the first quarter. Industrial volumes declined by 3.6% on a year-over-year basis.
In the landfill side of the business, second quarter 2011 internal revenue growth from volume improved by 1.1% compared to the second quarter of 2010. Internal revenue growth from volume for special waste was positive 8.1% year-over-year. This is an increase sequentially from the positive 2.9% internal revenue growth from volume that we saw in the first quarter and we still see strength in the pipeline for special waste volumes.
C&D volumes declined 7.8% year-over-year and MSW internal revenue growth volumes was negative 7.5% year-over-year. Income from operations in the collection line of business improved slightly during the second quarter when compared to the same quarter last year. We increased our income from operations despite the decline in volumes and increasing cost inflation in the price of tires, lubricants and steel parts. These maintenance related costs have risen between 10% and 40% from the same quarter of 2010, reflecting the worldwide increase in commodity prices.
As we expected, income from operations in our waste-to-energy line of business declined in the second quarter compared to the second quarter of 2010 by $0.02. The expiration of a long-term electric power capacity agreement in South Florida had a negative $6.6 million effect in the quarter. Also affecting the decline were upgrades to our facility in Virginia and increased costs for fuel and chemical usage.
For the rest of 2011, we expect the third and fourth quarter to be flat year-over-year for our waste-to-energy business and for earnings to begin to increase in the first quarter of 2012.
Turning to our recycling business, increased commodity prices and volume contributed about $0.03 of positive year-over-year earnings per diluted share in the second quarter of 2011, which is similar to the first quarter. Commodity prices have increased approximately 25% when compared with the same quarter last year. If prices continue to remain strong, we expect to see about a $0.03 to $0.04 benefit for the second half of the year. With respect to solid waste volumes, we certainly expect to see stronger seasonal improvement during the second quarter. Landfill volumes have remained positive, while the collection volumes have continued to show weakness. One positive in our collection business in that is service increases have exceeded decreases for the second consecutive quarter. Of course in the third and fourth quarter, we'll have to overcome the increase in volume that we saw last year from the Gulf Coast cleanup, which added about 1.7% to volumes in the third quarter and about 0.8% in the fourth quarter. Volumes looked slightly better in July but given our weak first half volumes, we now expect to see volumes in the negative 1.5% to negative 2.5% range for the full year. In response to the current business environment and our outlook for volumes, we've instituted yield improvement and cost containment plans. From a yield point of view, in order to strengthen our pricing in the second half of 2011, we've increased our environmental fee in a celebrated our price increase programs. By doing this, we expect to be able to achieve our goal of 2% yield for the full year. We've also implemented a cost containment program to rein in on increasing costs. This programs includes today and entertainment, eliminating discretionary spending and eliminating certain positions. We estimate that controlling these costs will add approximately $30 million to $40 million of income from operations when compared with the third and fourth quarter of 2010. Of course we also realize that you have to spend some short-term money to get long-term benefits and we will continue to invest in system upgrades, our innovation and optimization programs and customer focused growth. We believe that incurring these costs today will ensure that we're a stronger company in the future. But we also have to be mindful of the present conditions and cut costs wherever we can. For the remainder of the year, we expect recycling commodity prices to remain strong and for our waste-to-energy operations to achieve earnings similar to 2010 second half earnings. Our cost programs and growth initiatives will continue to progress but we expect to see weaker volumes in the second half than we originally planned. Consequently, we now project full year adjusted earnings of between $2.14 and $2.18 per diluted share. Finally, today I'm excited to announce the acquisition of Oakley, the largest waste broker in the United States, with annualized revenues of about $580 million. This acquisition provides us an opportunity to add a significant amount of collections disposal volumes through our systems. In discussions with Oakley, we also recognize that they have some compelling value propositions that they can provide to customers, particularly in the commercial property and food and retail segments. It's similar to what we're doing in those segments through our customer growth efforts. We expect that the excellent sales management in service teams will greatly increase our penetration in those markets by providing value-added environmental solutions to customers. At the same time, we believe we'll be able to benefit both their current customers and their extensive holler network to win-win situation. The old Oakley transaction provides waste management. We look forward to our new partnership and we welcome the Oakley team to waste management and with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

These costs increased by $144 million in the second quarter to 63.9% of revenue. The biggest contributor was cost of goods sold, which increased $95 million in the quarter, mainly because of rebates due to higher recycling commodity prices and volumes. These higher commodity prices and volumes, net of rebates, resulted in an increase in our earnings per diluted share from our recycling operations of approximately $0.03 in the quarter.
Direct fuel costs increased approximately $39 million, primarily because of a 33% increase in price per gallon of diesel fuel. Subcontractor costs increased $6 million in the quarter, primarily relating to the increased fuel costs at our transfer operations. In the second quarter, fuel surcharge revenue continue to offset the increased cost of direct fuel and fuel increases included to subcontractor costs. Maintenance costs increased $17 million, primarily related to higher costs for parts and supply, tires and lubricants and our collection and landfill operations. As David said, we have seen prices for these items increase between 10% and 40% year-over-year, generally in line with prior commodity prices.
Operating expenses increased $24 million due to acquisitions made within the last 12 months. In foreign currency translation for our Canadian operations, accounted an increase in operating cost of approximately $8 million. SG&A costs increased $37 million year-over-year and as a percentage of revenue, increased 50 basis points to 11.4%. The increased costs in SG&A primarily relates to our strategic growth plans and our cost reduction initiatives and our in line with what we discussed in our previous conference calls this year. Our growth initiatives which is include medical waste and Baxter had a negative $0.03 per diluted share impact on the quarter. When we gave guidance for the year, we described the initiatives to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in areas like procurement, volume and logistics and the centralization of certain functions. We spent approximately $19 million on these initiatives in the second quarter, consistent with our expectation. We are now starting to see positive traction in procurement where we have $5 billion in spend that we can go after. Given the positive results that we have seen late in the second quarter, we feel confident that we will see the benefits in the third and fourth quarter that will more than offset the full year cost of these initiatives. We also expect that in the second half of 2011, the consulting costs for these initiatives will decline by $22 million.
The remaining SG&A cost associated with these initiatives will support future revenue growth and will reduce operating expenses.
Interest expense for the second quarter increased $3 million compared with the prior year. At June 30, 2011, our weighted average cost of debt was 5.4% and our debt-to-total-capital ratio for the quarter was 57.7% consistent with our target of about 60%. The floating rate portion of our  total debt portfolio was 18% at the end of the quarter. During the second quarter, we amended our $2 billion revolving credit facility, significantly reducing the cost of the facility and extending its term to May 2016. The credit markets had improved significantly since we executed our agreement in June 2010 and we view this as an opportunity to meaningfully reduce our future interest cost. We estimate that we should say of approximately $5 million in interest expense during the second half of 2011.
Our income tax rate, as reported for the second quarter of 2011, was 34.5%. For 2011, we expect the recurring effective tax rate to be approximately 35%.
Turning to cash flow. Second quarter 2011 net cash provided by operating activities was $478 million. This is flat compared to the second quarter of 2010. Our capital expenditures for the second quarter were $280 million, $60 million higher than the second quarter of 2010 and consistent with our plan to increase capital expenditures in 2011. We still anticipate spending between $1.35 billion and $1.45 billion during 2011. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $206 million, which was $69 million less than the prior-year quarter, largely due to an increase in capital expenditures of $60 million. We still expect free cash flow for 2011 of about $1.25 billion.
In the second quarter of 2011, we paid $161 million in dividends and we repurchased $105 million of our common stock, continuing our long-standing emphasis on returning cash to our shareholders. We also completed approximately $58 million in business acquisitions.
We believe that the actions we are taking to grow and to optimize our operations, including the acquisition of Oakley, are the right actions and with the help of our employees, the best in the business, we'll begin to see the result of those actions in the second half of this year and into 2012. And with that, Nicole, let's open the line for questions."

Now obviously, that more than offsets the mix issues. Now obviously, if the mix issues get worse in the back half of the year, you can predict mix as the problem. If they were to get worse in the back half of the year, obviously, that would have more of an effect on that by a 100 basis point improvement. The first part of the question is interesting. I think everybody recognizes that we generally been the price leader in the markets that we serve and in the past, what we've seen is that the regional and national competitors that basically drafted of our price actions and all the types and split the rising votes. What we've always seen sort of pockets of places where I would say there wasn't as much pricing discipline. Over the last couple of quarters, what we've seen is that those pockets have expanded to where it looks to us like it's virtually in every one of our markets that we're seeing folks that aren't drafting on our pricing actions anywhere. They're taking actions that are designed more to get volume than to draft on our pricing actions and that's become pretty widespread throughout our markets, obviously, as the economy hasn't improved. Now the reality is that you get, you can never get as much benefit from volume as you can from pricing, all the pricing falls to the bottom line but the volume doesn't so we continue to recognize that the trade-off is positive but the trade-off is positive, we've been raising prices on our current customer base where we see deterioration again, as, you pointed out frankly in the pricing rollblacks order to maintain our customers that are under attack, and in the mix which obviously, we don't have any control over so if we see sort of the 20 to 40 basis points of mix in the back half of the year, offset by the 80 basis points 100 basis points of pricing action that's how you get back to the 2% yield."

It started out at the beginning of the year, we recognized that there is going to be some pretty aggressive action in paid residential contracts and we took account of that and in our front year guidance but it has spread to the rolloff in the commercial lines. We just got through in the last 2 weeks going through all 25 of our geographic areas to look at their market business strategies for the next 4 years and for the first time since I've been meeting with these folks on a quarterly basis, it was virtually every market that said they're seeing very aggressive pricing action spreading, starting out obviously in the residential line of business but now spreading to the commercial and the industrial line and that's why you see our price rollbacks growing so in other words, I think the whole point of the pricing is a few things. First off, we're not going to back off on our price increases because the trade-off is still positive, but we are seeing more reductions from rollbacks, which is obviously competitively driven and then we got this mix issue that quite frankly, we didn't see coming in the beginning part of the year. You can't predict mix and it really hit us hard in the second quarter. We expect it to abate a little bit but we still expect to see some of that in the third and fourth quarters."

If $100,000 is 10% of their revenue, that means they have $1 million of total revenue, right? And that also means that about 30% to 40% of that $1 million is disposal costs for them so they've got $300,000 to $400,000 of disposal costs on their $1 million of revenue, right? That's 3 to 4 times the amount of revenue that Oakley has in that market, that $100,000. So when you think about it, you can get 3 to 4x their revenue if you're able to get all of their disposal volumes in a line of business that has about double the margins of the collection line of business. So if were able to work with those haulers to get them to bring all of their volumes to our disposal and recycling facilities, we actually do a lot better than if we take over that business on the truck. We can do better on the order of magnitudes, so you're getting 3 to 4 times the revenue in a line of business that probably has doubled the margin, so you're getting 6 to 8 times more benefit if you can add that hauler, bring their volumes to your landfill network and your recycling network and so we're going to work with those local haulers to actually keep them in place but look, if we can't provide better disposal solutions for them that become a win for them and a win for us."

When you look at the first quarter, we had a slight negative for mix. In the second quarter, that went to $19.5 million and so it was a pretty dramatic shift pretty quickly and most of that occurred in our southern group so for example, in South Florida, we had franchise business and in the franchise markets, our permanent rolloff is actually higher priced than our temporary roll-off, a little bit different than most of our other markets. But the permanent rolloff business have started in Florida has started to feel the heat from the economy over the last few years but actually, there was a pretty good pickup in temporary businesses and we had a mix in the roll-off line that went from higher price to lower-priced volumes. You've also had some residential contracts throughout the country where, in order to maintain or extend those contracts, we'll go in and offer a recycling service. So if you are doing a solid waste at $12 a home and you go in and you do recycling at $2 a home, you've made a good business decision but your yield looks like it's going down and then we got, we got a lot of special waste as you know, for the last few years and special waste is always interesting. The example I use is if you have a landfill where you are bringing in waste from a long-distance, you might charge $18 as a whole but you charge $50 for transportation but then if the volumes come in from closer, you might charge $20 at the whole with no transportation. So you're actually making a great business decision. You're making more money but it looks like your price has gone down because of the mix of volumes and so I think with the increase in special waste with the change in South Florida with the change with some of the residential contracts and then with our normal turn, we saw that hit us a lot harder in the second quarter then we've seen in the past."

I don't have any doubt about that. The difference that we've got between this year and that year because what you saw was we dropped below 1% then we immediately snapped back well above 2%. The only difference you have between now and then is this mix issue. We didn't have the 60 to 80 basis point of mix headwind. And again, mix doesn't necessarily reduce your bottom line earnings. In my examples, you're actually making more money but it looks like your yield is going down. So you would see exactly the same snapback if it weren't for these mix issues and the way we're looking at the mix issues right now, we're expecting them to continue in the back half of the year. I think the corollary is identical. As soon as we see deterioration, we take action to do something about it and we intend to maintain that discipline."

The reality is that these dollars that we're spending to benefit our future wouldn't even be recognized if we were showing volume growth and continuing to get 2%-plus yield. It wouldn't be affecting our numbers whatsoever. We happen to be spending money for the future in the teeth of volumes and price that aren't as strong as we thought they would be. And So you have 2 choices, right, you either say, okay we're going to cut the spending because we're not seeing the volumes in price come in or you say we're going to continue to do what we think the best thing for the long-term of this company and you spend despite the fact that your seeing, because you know you are going to get the future benefit and you keep spending despite the fact it's been a tough year.

Obviously, we're not happy with what happened in our second quarter and hopefully, what you heard today is that we're going to take actions to get this thing right.

On the Oakley transaction, I think we'd be remiss if we didn't mention the amazing work that our team did putting this together. We've been in discussions with them for quite a long time but we got into some very serious discussions over the last month or so. And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention, John Stein, our legal team and Joe Buddy West, Joe the West and Sean Hill in our finance group and tons of other people that have been working night and day to get this deal done, it was a phenomenal job by them, this is going to be a great opportunity for waste management it's also going to be a great opportunity for the folks of Oakleyso we're really looking forward to getting to know our new partner and I can promise you will be meeting with them regularly to let them know what's going on as we meet with them as they go on with the vendor hall network and then finally, I wanted to say this is actually Bob's last quarterly conference call and from my point of view, we've been together now for about 7 years. Bob's been a great business partner but he's a better friend than a business partner and we will certainly all miss his sage advice as he wanders off to retire to his beloved Kingwood. Bob, congratulations on the retirement and I'm sure I'll be visiting your house a lot. Please come out. Thank you, all."

190694,133859897,148032,"Waste Management, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2011",2011-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. During the second quarter, we earned $0.50 per diluted share. A number of things in the quarter went just as we expected.

During the second quarter, we earned $0.50 per diluted share. A number of things in the quarter went just as we expected. As previously discussed, we had about $0.06 of combined earnings per share headwinds from our waste energy operations, our growth initiatives and our cost reduction programs. 
In the back half of the year, we expect these collective headwinds to abate and for our cost reduction efforts to begin to add to earnings. However, in the quarter, a few things did not go as we expected. We had a $0.04 reduction in earnings per share from increased maintenance from repair costs, legal items and risk management. The legal and risk management items are second quarter issues but the maintenance increase is primarily due to higher commodity prices. So we'll likely see higher maintenance costs in the back half of the year. 
Our revenue growth from yield was slightly below expectations for the quarter and our revenue growth from volume was lower than our expectations. With respect to yield, we're taking immediate and significant pricing actions to increase our yield. With respect to volumes, we continue to move forward with our customer focused growth initiatives, and the transaction that we announced today to purchase Oafleaf will certainly accelerate those efforts. 
We're pleased that during the second quarter, revenue increased by $189 million or 6% from the prior-year quarter. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of positive year-over-year revenue comparison. Higher commodity prices, improved recycling volumes, acquisitions and year-over-year yield increases contributed to the revenue growth. While internal revenue growth from yield continues to provide positive revenue growth, we're not satisfied with the results for the second quarter. Internal revenue growth from yield and our collection and disposal operations was 1.6% in the quarter and 2.2% year-to-date through June 30. 
The combined internal revenue growth from yield in the industrial, commercial and residential lines of our collection business was 2% in the second quarter. Commercial and industrial yields were 3.2% and 1.3%, respectively. Yield in our residential line of business was 0.9%. At the beginning of the year, we noted that the residential line of business was becoming more competitive. Local, regional and national companies have become more aggressive on price. Municipalities are also looking for price concessions, so although yield remains positive, we do not expect significant increases in the residential yield. 
Our price increases to customers were right on plan, but mix issues had about 60 to 80 basis points of negative effect on yield in the quarter, which is much higher than we've seen in the recent past. The mix issues were most common in our southern group, where, for example, in our franchise markets, we saw a dramatic shift in mix from higher-priced permanent roll-off to a lower-priced temporary roll-off. So looking at yield without mix, we would have been over 2% yield. Our pricing actions in the second half of the year should add about 80 to 100 basis points to yield, of course, offset by any continuing mix issues. 
Another factor affecting our yield has been rollbacks of our price increases. In our commercial line of business, we implemented significant price increases to our customers in the 6% to 7% range. This level of price increase has been the norm over the last 5 years of Waste Management. Local haulers often offer new business prices substantially below our prices. But lately, we've seen our regional and national competitors aggressively reduce prices to obtain volumes. We had to take action to retain profitable customers. 
And in the second quarter, we saw the highest level of price rollbacks since prior 2004. But the bottom line earnings benefit of increasing our yield continues to exceed earnings benefit you can get from purchasing volumes at low prices. So we will continue to maintain our pricing discipline even in the face of aggressive discounting by our competitors. Despite these pricing pressures, we maintained customer churn at about 10% in the second quarter, a 60 basis point improvement from the same quarter in the prior year. On the landfill yield front, all of the waste streams had positive revenue growth from yield during the second quarter, continuing the trend that we saw in the first quarter. 
On the volume side of the business, internal revenue growth from volume declined 1.7% in the quarter, which is flat compared to the first quarter of 2011. If you exclude the volumes associated with the Gulf Coast cleanup efforts in 2010, volume would have declined 1.1% in the quarter. Although we saw a good seasonal uptick in volumes in the first few weeks of April, volumes had a soft patch in May and June, mirroring the dip in the U.S. economy. Our commercial collection line of business saw a year-over-year volume decline of 4.9% and the residential line of business saw a 4.2% decline year-over-year. Both of these collection lines improved sequentially from the first quarter. Industrial volumes declined by 3.6% on a year-over-year basis.
In the landfill side of the business, second quarter 2011 internal revenue growth from volume improved by 1.1% compared to the second quarter of 2010. Internal revenue growth from volume for special waste was positive 8.1% year-over-year. This is an increase sequentially from the positive 2.9% internal revenue growth from volumes that we saw in the first quarter. And we still see strength in the pipeline for special waste volumes.
C&D volumes declined 7.8% year-over-year and MSW internal revenue growth from volumes was negative 7.5% year-over-year. 
Income from operations in the collection line of business improved slightly during the second quarter when compared to the same quarter last year. We increased our income from operations despite the declining volumes and increasing cost inflation in the price of tires, lubricants and steel parts. These maintenance-related costs have risen between 10% and 40% from the same quarter of 2010, reflecting the worldwide increase in commodity prices.
As we expected, income from operations in our waste-to-energy line of business declined in the second quarter compared to the second quarter of 2010 by $0.02. The expiration of a long-term electric power capacity agreement in South Florida had a negative $6.6 million effect in the quarter. Also affecting the decline were upgrades to our acquired facility in Virginia and increased costs for fuel and chemical usage.
For the rest of 2011, we expect the third and fourth quarter to be flat year-over-year for our waste-to-energy business and for earnings to begin to increase in the first quarter of 2012.
Turning to our recycling business, increased commodity prices and volume contributed about $0.03 of positive year-over-year earnings per diluted share in the second quarter of 2011, which is similar to the first quarter. Commodity prices have increased approximately 25% when compared with the same quarter last year. If prices continue to remain strong, we expect to see about a $0.03 to $0.04 benefit for the second half of the year. 
With respect to solid waste volumes, we certainly expect to see stronger seasonal improvement during the second quarter. Landfill volumes have remained positive while the collection volumes have continued to show weakness. One positive in our collection business is that is service increases have exceeded decreases for the second consecutive quarter. Of course, in the third and fourth quarter, we'll have to overcome the increase in volume that we saw last year from the Gulf Coast cleanup, which added about 1.7% to volumes in the third quarter and about 0.8% in the fourth quarter. 
Volumes looked slightly better in July. But given our weak first half volumes, we now expect to see volumes in the negative 1.5% to negative 2.5% range for the full year. In response to the current business environment and our outlook for volumes, we've instituted yield improvement and cost containment plans. 
From a yield point of view, in order to strengthen our pricing in the second half of 2011, we've increased our environmental fee and accelerated our price increase programs. By doing this, we expect to be able to achieve our goal of 2% yield for the full year. We've also implemented a cost containment program to rein in on increasing costs. This program includes reducing travel and entertainment, eliminating discretionary spending and eliminating certain positions. We estimate that controlling these costs will add approximately $30 million to $40 million of income from operations when compared with the third and fourth quarters of 2010. 
Of course, we also realize that you have to spend some short-term money to get long-term benefits. And we will continue to invest in system upgrades, our innovation and optimization programs and customer-focused growth. We believe that incurring these costs today will ensure that we're a stronger company in the future. But we also have to be mindful of the present conditions and cut costs wherever we can. 
For the remainder of the year, we expect recycling commodity prices to remain strong and for our waste-to-energy operations to achieve earnings similar to 2010 second half earnings. Our cost programs and growth initiatives will continue to progress but we expect to see weaker volumes in the second half than we originally planned. Consequently, we now project full year adjusted earnings of between $2.14 and $2.18 per diluted share. 
Finally, today I'm excited to announce the acquisition of Oafleaf, the largest waste broker in the United States, with annualized revenues of about $580 million. This acquisition provides us an opportunity to add a significant amount of collection and disposal volumes through our systems. 
In our discussions with Oafleaf, we also recognize that they have some compelling value propositions that they can provide to customers, particularly in the commercial property and food and retail segments. It's similar to what we're doing in those segments through our customer-focused growth efforts. We expect that their excellent sales management and service teams will greatly increase our penetration in those markets by providing value-added environmental solutions to customers. 
At the same time, we believe we'll be able to benefit both their current customers and their extensive vendor hauler network to create a win-win situation. The Oafleaf transaction provides great value and great opportunities for waste management. We look forward to our new partnership and we welcome the Oafleaf team to Waste Management. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

These costs increased by $144 million in the second quarter to 63.9% of revenue. The biggest contributor was cost of goods sold, which increased $95 million in the quarter, mainly because of rebates due to higher recycling commodity prices and volumes. Note that these higher commodity prices and volumes, net of rebates, resulted in an increase in our earnings per diluted share from our recycling operations of approximately $0.03 in the quarter.
Direct fuel costs increased approximately $39 million, primarily because of a 33% increase in price per gallon of diesel fuel. Subcontractor costs increased $6 million in the quarter, primarily relating to the increased fuel costs at our transfer operations. In the second quarter, fuel surcharge revenue continued to offset the increased cost of direct fuel and fuel increases included in subcontractor costs. 
Maintenance costs increased $17 million, primarily related to the higher costs for parts and supply, tires and lubricants at our collection and landfill operations. As David said, we have seen prices for these items increased between 10% and 40% year-over-year, generally in line with prior commodity prices.
Operating expenses increased $24 million due to acquisitions made within the last 12 months. And foreign currency translation for our Canadian operations accounted for an increase in operating costs of approximately $8 million. 
SG&A costs increased $37 million year-over-year and, as a percentage of revenue, increased 50 basis points to 11.4%. The increased costs in SG&A primarily relate to our strategic growth plans and our cost reduction initiatives and are in line with what we discussed on our previous conference calls this year. 
Our growth initiatives, which include medical waste and Bagster had a negative $0.03 per diluted share impact on the quarter. When we gave guidance for the year, we described the initiatives to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in areas like procurement, volume and logistics and the centralization of certain functions. We spent approximately $19 million on these initiatives in the second quarter, consistent with our expectation. 
We are now starting to see positive traction in procurement where we have $5 billion in spend that we can go after. Given the positive results that we have seen late in the second quarter, we feel confident that we will see the benefits in the third and fourth quarters that will more than offset the full year cost of these initiatives. We also expect that in the second half of 2011, the consulting costs for these initiatives will decline by $22 million. The remaining SG&A costs associated with these initiatives will support future revenue growth and will reduce operating expenses.
Interest expense for the second quarter increased $3 million compared with the prior year. On June 30, 2011, our weighted average cost of debt was 5.4% and our debt-to-total-capital ratio for the quarter was 57.7%, consistent with our target ratio of about 60%. The floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 18% at the end of the quarter. 
During the second quarter, we amended our $2 billion revolving credit facility, significantly reducing the cost of the facility and extending its term to May 2016. The credit markets had improved significantly since we executed our agreement in June 2010 and we view this as an opportunity to meaningfully reduce our future interest cost. We estimate that we should save approximately $5 million in interest expense during the second half of 2011.
Our income tax rate, as reported for the second quarter of 2011, was 34.5%. For 2011, we expect the recurring effective tax rate to be approximately 35%.
Turning to cash flow. Second quarter 2011 net cash provided by operating activities was $478 million. This was flat compared to the second quarter of 2010. Our capital expenditures for the second quarter were $280 million, $60 million higher than the second quarter of 2010 and consistent with our plan to increase capital expenditures in 2011. We still anticipate spending between $1.35 billion and $1.45 billion on capital expenditures during 2011. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $206 million, which was $69 million less than the prior-year quarter, largely due to an increase in capital expenditures of $60 million. We still expect free cash flow for 2011 of about $1.25 billion.
In the second quarter of 2011, we paid $161 million in dividends and we repurchased $105 million of our common stock, continuing our long-standing emphasis on returning cash to our shareholders. We also completed approximately $58 million in business acquisitions.
We believe that the actions we are taking to grow and to optimize our operations, including the acquisition of Oafleaf, are the right actions. And with the help of our employees, the best in the business, we will begin to see the results of those actions in the second half of this year and into 2012. And with that, Nicole, let's open the line for questions."

The mix issues, you know, they were more dramatic at 60 to 80 basis points this quarter than they've been in the past. And frankly, we don't see those offsetting. And so what we need to do is we'll get that 80 to 100 basis points of benefit from the actions we're taking. And hopefully, that more than offsets the mix issues. Now obviously, if the mix issues get worse in the back half of the year and you can't predict the mix, it's a problem. If they were to get worse in the back half of the year, obviously, that would have more of an effect on that by a 100 basis point improvement. The first part of the question is interesting. I think everybody recognizes that we've generally been the price leader in the markets that we serve. And in the past, what we've seen is that the regional and national competitors that basically drafted off of our price actions and all the types and split of the rising votes. But what we've always seen sort of pockets of places where I would say there wasn't as much pricing discipline. Over the last couple of quarters, what we've seen is that those pockets have expanded to where it looks to us like it's virtually in every one of our markets that we're seeing folks that aren't drafting on our pricing actions anywhere. They're taking actions that are designed more to get volume than to draft on our pricing actions, and that's become pretty widespread throughout our markets, obviously, as the economy hasn't improved. Now the reality is that you get -- you can never get as much benefit from volume as you can from pricing. All the pricing falls to the bottom line but the volume doesn't. And so we continue to recognize that the trade-off is positive. But the trade-off is positive. We've been raising prices on our current customer base where we've seen the deterioration. Again, as you pointed out, it's frankly in the pricing rollbacks in order to maintain our customers that are under attack and in the mix, which, obviously, we don't have any control over. So if we see sort of the 20 to 40 basis points of mix in the back half of the year offset by the 80 basis points 100 basis points of pricing action, that's how you get back to our 2% yield."

And Scott, like I said before, the interesting thing that's happened over the last couple of quarters is that it has become more widespread throughout the business units. It started out at the beginning of the year. We recognized that there was going to be some pretty aggressive action in big residential contracts and we took account of that in our front year guidance. But it has spread to the roll-off in the commercial lines. We just got through in the last 2 weeks going through all 25 of our geographic areas to look at their market business strategy for the next 4 years. And for the first time since I've been meeting with these folks on a quarterly basis, it was virtually every market that said they're seeing very aggressive pricing action spreading, starting out, obviously, in the residential line of business but now spreading to the commercial and the industrial line. And that's why you see our price rollbacks growing. So in other words, I think the whole point of the pricing is a few things. First off, we're not going to back off on our price increases because the trade-off is still positive, but we are seeing more reductions from rollbacks, which is obviously competitively driven. And then we got this mix issue that, quite frankly, we didn't see coming in the beginning part of the year. You can't predict the mix. And it really hit us hard in the second quarter. We expect it to abate a little bit but we still expect to see some of that in the third and fourth quarters."

The obvious one is exactly that. But when you think about it, just to use an example, let's assume that a hauler has $100,000 of Oafleaf business in a particular market and that's 10% of their revenue. If $100,000 is 10% of their revenue, that means they have $1 million of total revenue, right? And that also means that about 30% to 40% of that $1 million is disposal costs for them. So they've got $300,000 to $400,000 of disposal costs on their $1 million of revenue, right? That's 3 to 4x the amount of revenue that Oafleaf has in that market, that $100,000. So when you think about it, you can get 3 to 4x their revenue if you're able to get all of their disposal volumes in a line of business that has about double the margins of the collection line of business. So if we're able to work with those haulers to get them to bring all of their volumes to our disposal and recycling facilities, we actually do a lot better than if we take over that business on the truck. We can do better on the order of magnitudes. So you're getting 3 to 4x the revenue in a line of business that probably has double the margin. So you're getting 6 to 8x more benefit if you can add that hauler, bring their volumes to your landfill network and your recycling network. And so we're going to work with those local haulers to actually keep them in place. But look, if we can provide better disposal solutions for them, that will become a win for them and a win for us."

When you look at the first quarter, we had a slight negative for mix. In the second quarter, that went to $19.5 million, and so it was a pretty dramatic shift pretty quickly. And most of that occurred in our southern group. So for example, in South Florida, we have franchise business. And in the franchise markets, our permanent roll-off is actually higher priced than our temporary roll-off, a little bit different than most of our other markets. But the permanent roll-off business has started in Florida, has started to feel the heat from the economy over the last few years. But actually, there was a pretty good tick-up in temporary businesses. So you had a mix in the roll-off line that went from higher-priced to lower-priced volumes. You've also had some residential contracts throughout the country where, in order to maintain or extend those contracts, we'll go in and offer a recycling service. So if you are doing a solid waste home at $12 a home and you go in and you do recycling at $2 a home, you've made a good business decision. But your yield looks like it's going down. And then we've got a lot of special waste, as you know, for the last few years and special waste is always interesting. The example I use is if you have a landfill where you are bringing in waste from a long distance, you might charge $18 at a whole but you charge $50 for transportation. But then if the volumes come in from closer, you might charge $20 at the whole with no transportation. So you're actually making a great business decision. You're making more money but it looks like your price has gone down because of the mix of volumes. And so I think with the increase in special waste, with the change in South Florida, with the change with some of the residential contracts and then with our normal churn, we saw that hit us a lot harder in the second quarter than we've seen in the past."

And then this quarter, what you saw was that the West and the South continued to have negative volumes. But you also saw in May and June, you saw even some softness in the Midwest and the East, which, I think, is probably driven by the same effects, the same factors that you saw on the national economy. So what we're seeing is that volumes continue to remain stubbornly low.

And we had a lot of opportunities to get long-term benefits. We identified it at the beginning of the year. We knew we had to spend money in order to get those benefits. I mean that's just the nature of the beast. But we also expected volumes to bounce back. I mean, look, the reality is that these dollars that we're spending to benefit our future wouldn't even be recognized if we were showing volume growth and continuing to get 2%-plus yield. It wouldn't be affecting our numbers whatsoever. We happen to be spending money for the future in the teeth of volumes and price that aren't as strong as we thought they would be. And so you have 2 choices, right? You either say, okay, we're going to cut the spending because we're not seeing the volumes with price come in, or you say, we're going to continue to do what we think is the best thing for the long term of this company. And you spend despite the fact that your seeing -- because you know you are going to get the future benefit and you keep spending despite the fact that it's been a tough year. I said it in my script, it's a tough balance to do for the long term and the short term. But we're going to spend to benefit the long term. But on the other hand, we're also going to go to our organization and say, look, we've got to find everywhere we can to cut out costs other than the investment in the future. And so when you talk about a Board, our Board is obviously a long-term thinking Board. We're a long-term thinking management team.

And so if you want to maintain that business, then we've got to look at the other parts of our business relationship to make it a win-win. It's not a win for Waste Management if one of our vendor haulers just simply maintains that $100,000 of business in the market and we do nothing. That is not a win for Waste Management there's only 2 ways we can win: one, put in on the back of our trucks and bring it in to our landfill. But then we only get back 10% of the business.

Bob's been a great business partner, but he's a better friend than a business partner. And we will certainly all miss his sage advice as he wanders off to retire to his beloved Kingwood.

190694,133859897,148109,"Waste Management, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2011",2011-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston.

During the second quarter, we earned $0.50 per diluted share. A number of things in the quarter went just as we expected. As previously discussed, we had about $0.06 of combined earnings per share headwinds from our waste energy operations, our growth initiatives and our cost reduction programs. 
In the back half of the year, we expect these collective headwinds to abate and for our cost reduction efforts to begin to add to earnings. However, in the quarter, a few things did not go as we expected. We had a $0.04 reduction in earnings per share from increased maintenance from repair costs, legal items and risk management. The legal and risk management items are second quarter issues but the maintenance increase is primarily due to higher commodity prices. So we'll likely see higher maintenance costs in the back half of the year. 
Our revenue growth from yield was slightly below expectations for the quarter and our revenue growth from volume was lower than our expectations. With respect to yield, we're taking immediate and significant pricing actions to increase our yield. With respect to volumes, we continue to move forward with our customer focused growth initiatives, and the transaction that we announced today to purchase Oakleaf will certainly accelerate those efforts. 
We're pleased that during the second quarter, revenue increased by $189 million or 6% from the prior-year quarter. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of positive year-over-year revenue comparison. Higher commodity prices, improved recycling volumes, acquisitions and year-over-year yield increases contributed to the revenue growth. While internal revenue growth from yield continues to provide positive revenue growth, we're not satisfied with the results for the second quarter. Internal revenue growth from yield and our collection and disposal operations was 1.6% in the quarter and 2.2% year-to-date through June 30. 
The combined internal revenue growth from yield in the industrial, commercial and residential lines of our collection business was 2% in the second quarter. Commercial and industrial yields were 3.2% and 1.3%, respectively. Yield in our residential line of business was 0.9%. At the beginning of the year, we noted that the residential line of business was becoming more competitive. Local, regional and national companies have become more aggressive on price. Municipalities are also looking for price concessions, so although yield remains positive, we do not expect significant increases in the residential yield. 
Our price increases to customers were right on plan, but mix issues had about 60 to 80 basis points of negative effect on yield in the quarter, which is much higher than we've seen in the recent past. The mix issues were most common in our southern group, where, for example, in our franchise markets, we saw a dramatic shift in mix from higher-priced permanent roll-off to a lower-priced temporary roll-off. So looking at yield without mix, we would have been over 2% yield. Our pricing actions in the second half of the year should add about 80 to 100 basis points to yield, of course, offset by any continuing mix issues. 
Another factor affecting our yield has been rollbacks of our price increases. In our commercial line of business, we implemented significant price increases to our customers in the 6% to 7% range. This level of price increase has been the norm over the last 5 years of Waste Management. Local haulers often offer new business prices substantially below our prices. But lately, we've seen our regional and national competitors aggressively reduce prices to obtain volumes. We had to take action to retain profitable customers. 
And in the second quarter, we saw the highest level of price rollbacks since prior 2004. But the bottom line earnings benefit of increasing our yield continues to exceed earnings benefit you can get from purchasing volumes at low prices. So we will continue to maintain our pricing discipline even in the face of aggressive discounting by our competitors. Despite these pricing pressures, we maintained customer churn at about 10% in the second quarter, a 60 basis point improvement from the same quarter in the prior year. On the landfill yield front, all of the waste streams had positive revenue growth from yield during the second quarter, continuing the trend that we saw in the first quarter. 
On the volume side of the business, internal revenue growth from volume declined 1.7% in the quarter, which is flat compared to the first quarter of 2011. If you exclude the volumes associated with the Gulf Coast cleanup efforts in 2010, volume would have declined 1.1% in the quarter. Although we saw a good seasonal uptick in volumes in the first few weeks of April, volumes had a soft patch in May and June, mirroring the dip in the U.S. economy. Our commercial collection line of business saw a year-over-year volume decline of 4.9% and the residential line of business saw a 4.2% decline year-over-year. Both of these collection lines improved sequentially from the first quarter. Industrial volumes declined by 3.6% on a year-over-year basis.
In the landfill side of the business, second quarter 2011 internal revenue growth from volume improved by 1.1% compared to the second quarter of 2010. Internal revenue growth from volume for special waste was positive 8.1% year-over-year. This is an increase sequentially from the positive 2.9% internal revenue growth from volumes that we saw in the first quarter. And we still see strength in the pipeline for special waste volumes.
C&D volumes declined 7.8% year-over-year and MSW internal revenue growth from volumes was negative 7.5% year-over-year. 
Income from operations in the collection line of business improved slightly during the second quarter when compared to the same quarter last year. We increased our income from operations despite the declining volumes and increasing cost inflation in the price of tires, lubricants and steel parts. These maintenance-related costs have risen between 10% and 40% from the same quarter of 2010, reflecting the worldwide increase in commodity prices.
As we expected, income from operations in our waste-to-energy line of business declined in the second quarter compared to the second quarter of 2010 by $0.02. The expiration of a long-term electric power capacity agreement in South Florida had a negative $6.6 million effect in the quarter. Also affecting the decline were upgrades to our acquired facility in Virginia and increased costs for fuel and chemical usage.
For the rest of 2011, we expect the third and fourth quarter to be flat year-over-year for our waste-to-energy business and for earnings to begin to increase in the first quarter of 2012.
Turning to our recycling business, increased commodity prices and volume contributed about $0.03 of positive year-over-year earnings per diluted share in the second quarter of 2011, which is similar to the first quarter. Commodity prices have increased approximately 25% when compared with the same quarter last year. If prices continue to remain strong, we expect to see about a $0.03 to $0.04 benefit for the second half of the year. 
With respect to solid waste volumes, we certainly expect to see stronger seasonal improvement during the second quarter. Landfill volumes have remained positive while the collection volumes have continued to show weakness. One positive in our collection business is that is service increases have exceeded decreases for the second consecutive quarter. Of course, in the third and fourth quarter, we'll have to overcome the increase in volume that we saw last year from the Gulf Coast cleanup, which added about 1.7% to volumes in the third quarter and about 0.8% in the fourth quarter. 
Volumes looked slightly better in July. But given our weak first half volumes, we now expect to see volumes in the negative 1.5% to negative 2.5% range for the full year. In response to the current business environment and our outlook for volumes, we've instituted yield improvement and cost containment plans. 
From a yield point of view, in order to strengthen our pricing in the second half of 2011, we've increased our environmental fee and accelerated our price increase programs. By doing this, we expect to be able to achieve our goal of 2% yield for the full year. We've also implemented a cost containment program to rein in on increasing costs. This program includes reducing travel and entertainment, eliminating discretionary spending and eliminating certain positions. We estimate that controlling these costs will add approximately $30 million to $40 million of income from operations when compared with the third and fourth quarters of 2010. 
Of course, we also realize that you have to spend some short-term money to get long-term benefits. And we will continue to invest in system upgrades, our innovation and optimization programs and customer-focused growth. We believe that incurring these costs today will ensure that we're a stronger company in the future. But we also have to be mindful of the present conditions and cut costs wherever we can. 
For the remainder of the year, we expect recycling commodity prices to remain strong and for our waste-to-energy operations to achieve earnings similar to 2010 second half earnings. Our cost programs and growth initiatives will continue to progress but we expect to see weaker volumes in the second half than we originally planned. Consequently, we now project full year adjusted earnings of between $2.14 and $2.18 per diluted share. 
Finally, today I'm excited to announce the acquisition of Oakleaf, the largest waste broker in the United States, with annualized revenues of about $580 million. This acquisition provides us an opportunity to add a significant amount of collection and disposal volumes through our systems. 
In our discussions with Oakleaf, we also recognize that they have some compelling value propositions that they can provide to customers, particularly in the commercial property and food and retail segments. It's similar to what we're doing in those segments through our customer-focused growth efforts. We expect that their excellent sales, management and service teams will greatly increase our penetration in those markets by providing value-added environmental solutions to customers. 
At the same time, we believe we'll be able to benefit both their current customers and their extensive vendor hauler network to create a win-win situation. The Oakleaf transaction provides great value and great opportunities for waste management. We look forward to our new partnership and we welcome the Oakleaf team to Waste Management. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

These costs increased by $144 million in the second quarter to 63.9% of revenue. The biggest contributor was cost of goods sold, which increased $95 million in the quarter, mainly because of rebates due to higher recycling commodity prices and volumes. Note that these higher commodity prices and volumes, net of rebates, resulted in an increase in our earnings per diluted share from our recycling operations of approximately $0.03 in the quarter.
Direct fuel costs increased approximately $39 million, primarily because of a 33% increase in price per gallon of diesel fuel. Subcontractor costs increased $6 million in the quarter, primarily relating to the increased fuel costs at our transfer operations. In the second quarter, fuel surcharge revenue continued to offset the increased cost of direct fuel and fuel increases included in subcontractor costs. 
Maintenance costs increased $17 million, primarily related to the higher costs for parts and supply, tires and lubricants at our collection and landfill operations. As David said, we have seen prices for these items increased between 10% and 40% year-over-year, generally in line with prior commodity prices.
Operating expenses increased $24 million due to acquisitions made within the last 12 months. And foreign currency translation for our Canadian operations accounted for an increase in operating costs of approximately $8 million. 
SG&A costs increased $37 million year-over-year and, as a percentage of revenue, increased 50 basis points to 11.4%. The increased costs in SG&A primarily relate to our strategic growth plans and our cost reduction initiatives and are in line with what we discussed on our previous conference calls this year. 
Our growth initiatives, which include medical waste and Bagster had a negative $0.03 per diluted share impact on the quarter. When we gave guidance for the year, we described the initiatives to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in areas like procurement, routing and logistics and the centralization of certain functions. We spent approximately $19 million on these initiatives in the second quarter, consistent with our expectation. 
We are now starting to see positive traction in procurement where we have $5 billion in spend that we can go after. Given the positive results that we have seen late in the second quarter, we feel confident that we will see the benefits in the third and fourth quarters that will more than offset the full year cost of these initiatives. We also expect that in the second half of 2011, the consulting costs for these initiatives will decline by $22 million. The remaining SG&A costs associated with these initiatives will support future revenue growth and will reduce operating expenses.
Interest expense for the second quarter increased $3 million compared with the prior year. On June 30, 2011, our weighted average cost of debt was 5.4% and our debt-to-total-capital ratio for the quarter was 57.7%, consistent with our target ratio of about 60%. The floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 18% at the end of the quarter. 
During the second quarter, we amended our $2 billion revolving credit facility, significantly reducing the cost of the facility and extending its term to May 2016. The credit markets had improved significantly since we executed our agreement in June 2010 and we view this as an opportunity to meaningfully reduce our future interest cost. We estimate that we should save approximately $5 million in interest expense during the second half of 2011.
Our income tax rate, as reported for the second quarter of 2011, was 34.5%. For 2011, we expect the recurring effective tax rate to be approximately 35%.
Turning to cash flow. Second quarter 2011 net cash provided by operating activities was $478 million. This was flat compared to the second quarter of 2010. Our capital expenditures for the second quarter were $280 million, $60 million higher than the second quarter of 2010 and consistent with our plan to increase capital expenditures in 2011. We still anticipate spending between $1.35 billion and $1.45 billion on capital expenditures during 2011. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $206 million, which was $69 million less than the prior-year quarter, largely due to an increase in capital expenditures of $60 million. We still expect free cash flow for 2011 of about $1.25 billion.
In the second quarter of 2011, we paid $161 million in dividends and we repurchased $105 million of our common stock, continuing our long-standing emphasis on returning cash to our shareholders. We also completed approximately $58 million in business acquisitions.
Now, we believe that the actions we are taking to grow and to optimize our operations, including the acquisition of Oakleaf, are the right actions. And with the help of our employees, the best in the business, we will begin to see the results of those actions in the second half of this year and into 2012. And with that, Nicole, let's open the line for questions."

Is the price discounting you're seeing from regionals broad-based? Or are you seeing that more in certain markets?

The mix issues, you know, they were more dramatic at 60 to 80 basis points this quarter than they've been in the past. And frankly, we don't see those offsetting. And so what we need to do is we'll get that 80 to 100 basis points of benefit from the actions we're taking. And hopefully, that more than offsets the mix issues. Now obviously, if the mix issues get worse in the back half of the year and you can't predict the mix, it's a problem. If they were to get worse in the back half of the year, obviously, that would have more of an effect on that 100 basis point improvement. The first part of the question is interesting. I think everybody recognizes that we've generally been the price leader in the markets that we serve. And in the past, what we've seen is that the regional and national competitors that basically drafted off of our price actions and all the rises, all the tides lifted the rising boats. But what we've always seen sort of pockets of places where I would say there wasn't as much pricing discipline. Over the last couple of quarters, what we've seen is that those pockets have expanded to where it looks to us like it's virtually in every one of our markets that we're seeing folks that aren't drafting on our pricing actions anymore. They're taking actions that are designed more to get volume than to draft on our pricing actions, and that's become pretty widespread throughout our markets, obviously, as the economy hasn't improved. Now the reality is that you get -- you can never get as much benefit from volume as you can from pricing. All the pricing falls to the bottom line but the volume doesn't. And so we continue to recognize that the trade-off is positive. But the trade-off is positive. We've been raising prices on our current customer base where we've seen the deterioration. Again, as you pointed out, it's frankly in the pricing rollbacks in order to maintain our customers that are under attack and in the mix, which, obviously, we don't have any control over. So if we see sort of the 20 to 40 basis points of mix in the back half of the year offset by the 80 basis points to 100 basis points of pricing action, that's how you get back to our 2% yield."

And Scott, like I said before, the interesting thing that's happened over the last couple of quarters is that it has become more widespread throughout the business units. It started out at the beginning of the year. We recognized that there was going to be some pretty aggressive action in big residential contracts and we took account of that in our front year guidance. But it has spread to the roll-off in the commercial lines. We just got through in the last 2 weeks going through all 25 of our geographic areas to look at their market business strategy for the next 4 years. And for the first time since I've been meeting with these folks on a quarterly basis, it was virtually every market that said they're seeing very aggressive pricing action spreading, starting out, obviously, in the residential line of business but now spreading to the commercial and the industrial line. And that's why you see our price rollbacks growing. So in other words, I think the whole point of the pricing is a few things. First off, we're not going to back off on our price increases because the trade-off is still positive, but we are seeing more reductions from rollbacks, which is obviously competitively driven. And then we got this mix issue that, quite frankly, we didn't see coming in the beginning part of the year. You can't predict the mix. And it really hit us hard in the second quarter. We expect it to abate a little bit but we still expect to see some of that in the third and fourth quarters."

And they're incremental to what we were spending last year. So what we've done is we've been sourced a lot of the consulting work and won't be needing that anymore. And we produced ads in a number of places and in a number of functions. So I think that it will -- I expect SG&A for the year to be a little under 12% of revenue."

The obvious one is exactly that. But when you think about it, just to use an example, let's assume that a hauler has $100,000 of Oakleaf business in a particular market and that's 10% of their revenue. If $100,000 is 10% of their revenue, that means they have $1 million of total revenue, right? And that also means that about 30% to 40% of that $1 million is disposal costs for them. So they've got $300,000 to $400,000 of disposal costs on their $1 million of revenue, right? That's 3x to 4x the amount of revenue that Oakleaf has in that market, that $100,000. So when you think about it, you can get 3x to 4x the revenue if you're able to get all of their disposal volumes in a line of business that has about double the margins of the collection line of business. So if we're able to work with those haulers to get them to bring all of their volumes to our disposal and recycling facilities, we actually do a lot better than if we take over that business on the truck. We can do better on the order of magnitudes. So you're getting 3x to 4x the revenue in a line of business that probably has double the margin. So you're getting 6x to 8x more benefit if you can add that hauler, bring their volumes to your landfill network and your recycling network. And so we're going to work with those local haulers to actually keep them in place. But look, if we can provide better disposal solutions for them, that become a win for them and a win for us"

When you look at the first quarter, we had a slight negative for mix. In the second quarter, that went to $19.5 million, and so it was a pretty dramatic shift pretty quickly. And most of that occurred in our southern group. So for example, in South Florida, we have franchise business. And in the franchise markets, our permanent roll-off is actually higher priced than our temporary roll-off, a little different than most of our other markets. But the permanent roll-off business has started in Florida, has started to feel the heat from the economy over the last few years. But actually, there was a pretty good tick-up in temporary businesses. So you had a mix in the roll-off line that went from higher-priced to lower-priced volumes. You've also had some residential contracts throughout the country where, in order to maintain or extend those contracts, we'll go in and offer a recycling service. So if you are doing a solid waste home at $12 a home and you go in and you do recycling at $2 a home, you've made a good business decision. But your yield looks like it's going down. And then we've got a lot of special waste, as you know, for the last few years and special waste is always interesting. The example I use is if you have a landfill where you are bringing in waste from a long distance, you might charge $18 at a whole but you charge $50 for transportation. But then if the volumes come in from closer, you might charge $20 at the whole with no transportation. So you're actually making a great business decision. You're making more money but it looks like your price has gone down because of the mix of volumes. And so I think with the increase in special waste, with the change in South Florida, with the change with some of the residential contracts and then with our normal churn, we saw that hit us a lot harder in the second quarter than we've seen in the past."

And then this quarter, what you saw was that the West and the South continued to have negative volumes. But you also saw in May and June, you saw even some softness in the Midwest and the East, which, I think, is probably driven by the same effects, the same factors that you saw on the national economy. So what we're seeing is that volumes continue to remain stubbornly low. We've talked about it since the beginning of the downturn, which is what you'll see, I believe, is when you see the commercial volumes start to turn is when you'll see the volumes turn for us.

The difference that we've got between this year and that year, because what you saw was we dropped below 1% and then we immediately snapped back well above 2%, the only difference you have between now and then is this mix issue, right? I mean we didn't have the 60 to 80 basis points of mix headwind. And again, mix doesn't necessarily reduce your bottom line earnings. In my examples, you're actually making more money but it looks like your yield is going down. And so you would see exactly the same snapback if it weren't for these mix issues.

I mean, look, the reality is that these dollars that we're spending to benefit our future wouldn't even be recognized if we were showing volume growth and continuing to get 2%-plus yield. It wouldn't be affecting our numbers whatsoever. We happen to be spending money for the future in the teeth of volumes and price that aren't as strong as we thought they would be. And so you have 2 choices, right? You either say, okay, we're going to cut the spending because we're not seeing the volumes with price come in, or you say, we're going to continue to do what we think is the best thing for the long term of this company. And you spend despite the fact that your seeing -- because you know you are going to get the future benefit and you keep spending despite the fact that it's been a tough year. I said it in my script, it's a tough balance to do for the long term and the short term. But we're going to spend to benefit the long term. But on the other hand, we're also going to go to our organization and say, look, we've got to find everywhere we can to cut out costs other than the investment in the future. And so when you talk about a Board, our Board is obviously a long-term thinking Board. We're a long-term thinking management team. And so I think they have -- as long as they're seeing the progress, I think they've got the right amount of patience."

And so if you want to maintain that business, then we've got to look at the other parts of our business relationship to make it a win-win. It's not a win for Waste Management if one of our vendor haulers just simply maintains that $100,000 of business in the market and we do nothing. That is not a win for Waste Management. There's only 2 ways we can win: one, put it in on the back of our trucks and bring it in to our landfill. But then we only get that 10% of the business. If we can get 100% of their volumes into our disposal network, that's a huge win for us.

Bob's been a great business partner, but he's a better friend than a business partner. And we will certainly all miss his sage advice as he wanders off to retire to his beloved Kingwood.

190694,133859897,148468,"Waste Management, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2011",2011-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. During the second quarter, we earned $0.50 per diluted share. A number of things in the quarter went just as we expected. As previously discussed, we had about $0.06 of combined earnings per share headwinds from",1724,"Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. During the second quarter, we earned $0.50 per diluted share. A number of things in the quarter went just as we expected. As previously discussed, we had about $0.06 of combined earnings per share headwinds from our waste energy operations, our growth initiatives and our cost reduction programs. 
In the back half of the year, we expect these collective headwinds to abate and for our cost reduction efforts to begin to add to earnings. However, in the quarter, a few things did not go as we expected. We had a $0.04 reduction in earnings per share from increased maintenance from repair costs, legal items and risk management. The legal and risk management items are second quarter issues but the maintenance increase is primarily due to higher commodity prices. So we'll likely see higher maintenance costs in the back half of the year. 
Our revenue growth from yield was slightly below expectations for the quarter and our revenue growth from volume was lower than our expectations. With respect to yield, we're taking immediate and significant pricing actions to increase our yield. With respect to volumes, we continue to move forward with our customer focused growth initiatives, and the transaction that we announced today to purchase Oakleaf will certainly accelerate those efforts. 
We're pleased that during the second quarter, revenue increased by $189 million or 6% from the prior-year quarter. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of positive year-over-year revenue comparison. Higher commodity prices, improved recycling volumes, acquisitions and year-over-year yield increases contributed to the revenue growth. While internal revenue growth from yield continues to provide positive revenue growth, we're not satisfied with the results for the second quarter. Internal revenue growth from yield and our collection and disposal operations was 1.6% in the quarter and 2.2% year-to-date through June 30. 
The combined internal revenue growth from yield in the industrial, commercial and residential lines of our collection business was 2% in the second quarter. Commercial and industrial yields were 3.2% and 1.3%, respectively. Yield in our residential line of business was 0.9%. At the beginning of the year, we noted that the residential line of business was becoming more competitive. Local, regional and national companies have become more aggressive on price. Municipalities are also looking for price concessions, so although yield remains positive, we do not expect significant increases in the residential yield. 
Our price increases to customers were right on plan, but mix issues had about 60 to 80 basis points of negative effect on yield in the quarter, which is much higher than we've seen in the recent past. The mix issues were most common in our southern group, where, for example, in our franchise markets, we saw a dramatic shift in mix from higher-priced permanent roll-off to a lower-priced temporary roll-off. So looking at yield without mix, we would have been over 2% yield. Our pricing actions in the second half of the year should add about 80 to 100 basis points to yield, of course, offset by any continuing mix issues. 
Another factor affecting our yield has been rollbacks of our price increases. In our commercial line of business, we implemented significant price increases to our customers in the 6% to 7% range. This level of price increase has been the norm over the last 5 years of Waste Management. Local haulers often offer new business prices substantially below our prices. But lately, we've seen our regional and national competitors aggressively reduce prices to obtain volumes. We had to take action to retain profitable customers. 
And in the second quarter, we saw the highest level of price rollbacks since prior 2004. But the bottom line earnings benefit of increasing our yield continues to exceed earnings benefit you can get from purchasing volumes at low prices. So we will continue to maintain our pricing discipline even in the face of aggressive discounting by our competitors. Despite these pricing pressures, we maintained customer churn at about 10% in the second quarter, a 60 basis point improvement from the same quarter in the prior year. On the landfill yield front, all of the waste streams had positive revenue growth from yield during the second quarter, continuing the trend that we saw in the first quarter. 
On the volume side of the business, internal revenue growth from volume declined 1.7% in the quarter, which is flat compared to the first quarter of 2011. If you exclude the volumes associated with the Gulf Coast cleanup efforts in 2010, volume would have declined 1.1% in the quarter. Although we saw a good seasonal uptick in volumes in the first few weeks of April, volumes had a soft patch in May and June, mirroring the dip in the U.S. economy. Our commercial collection line of business saw a year-over-year volume decline of 4.9% and the residential line of business saw a 4.2% decline year-over-year. Both of these collection lines improved sequentially from the first quarter. Industrial volumes declined by 3.6% on a year-over-year basis.
In the landfill side of the business, second quarter 2011 internal revenue growth from volume improved by 1.1% compared to the second quarter of 2010. Internal revenue growth from volume for special waste was positive 8.1% year-over-year. This is an increase sequentially from the positive 2.9% internal revenue growth from volumes that we saw in the first quarter. And we still see strength in the pipeline for special waste volumes.
C&D volumes declined 7.8% year-over-year and MSW internal revenue growth from volumes was negative 7.5% year-over-year. 
Income from operations in the collection line of business improved slightly during the second quarter when compared to the same quarter last year. We increased our income from operations despite the declining volumes and increasing cost inflation in the price of tires, lubricants and steel parts. These maintenance-related costs have risen between 10% and 40% from the same quarter of 2010, reflecting the worldwide increase in commodity prices.
As we expected, income from operations in our waste-to-energy line of business declined in the second quarter compared to the second quarter of 2010 by $0.02. The expiration of a long-term electric power capacity agreement in South Florida had a negative $6.6 million effect in the quarter. Also affecting the decline were upgrades to our acquired facility in Virginia and increased costs for fuel and chemical usage.
For the rest of 2011, we expect the third and fourth quarter to be flat year-over-year for our waste-to-energy business and for earnings to begin to increase in the first quarter of 2012.
Turning to our recycling business, increased commodity prices and volume contributed about $0.03 of positive year-over-year earnings per diluted share in the second quarter of 2011, which is similar to the first quarter. Commodity prices have increased approximately 25% when compared with the same quarter last year. If prices continue to remain strong, we expect to see about a $0.03 to $0.04 benefit for the second half of the year. 
With respect to solid waste volumes, we certainly expect to see stronger seasonal improvement during the second quarter. Landfill volumes have remained positive while the collection volumes have continued to show weakness. One positive in our collection business is that is service increases have exceeded decreases for the second consecutive quarter. Of course, in the third and fourth quarter, we'll have to overcome the increase in volume that we saw last year from the Gulf Coast cleanup, which added about 1.7% to volumes in the third quarter and about 0.8% in the fourth quarter. 
Volumes looked slightly better in July. But given our weak first half volumes, we now expect to see volumes in the negative 1.5% to negative 2.5% range for the full year. In response to the current business environment and our outlook for volumes, we've instituted yield improvement and cost containment plans. 
From a yield point of view, in order to strengthen our pricing in the second half of 2011, we've increased our environmental fee and accelerated our price increase programs. By doing this, we expect to be able to achieve our goal of 2% yield for the full year. We've also implemented a cost containment program to rein in on increasing costs. This program includes reducing travel and entertainment, eliminating discretionary spending and eliminating certain positions. We estimate that controlling these costs will add approximately $30 million to $40 million of income from operations when compared with the third and fourth quarters of 2010. 
Of course, we also realize that you have to spend some short-term money to get long-term benefits. And we will continue to invest in system upgrades, our innovation and optimization programs and customer-focused growth. We believe that incurring these costs today will ensure that we're a stronger company in the future. But we also have to be mindful of the present conditions and cut costs wherever we can. 
For the remainder of the year, we expect recycling commodity prices to remain strong and for our waste-to-energy operations to achieve earnings similar to 2010 second half earnings. Our cost programs and growth initiatives will continue to progress but we expect to see weaker volumes in the second half than we originally planned. Consequently, we now project full year adjusted earnings of between $2.14 and $2.18 per diluted share. 
Finally, today I'm excited to announce the acquisition of Oakleaf, the largest waste broker in the United States, with annualized revenues of about $580 million. This acquisition provides us an opportunity to add a significant amount of collection and disposal volumes through our systems. 
In our discussions with Oakleaf, we also recognize that they have some compelling value propositions that they can provide to customers, particularly in the commercial property and food and retail segments. It's similar to what we're doing in those segments through our customer-focused growth efforts. We expect that their excellent sales, management and service teams will greatly increase our penetration in those markets by providing value-added environmental solutions to customers. 
At the same time, we believe we'll be able to benefit both their current customers and their extensive vendor hauler network to create a win-win situation. The Oakleaf transaction provides great value and great opportunities for waste management. We look forward to our new partnership and we welcome the Oakleaf team to Waste Management. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

These costs increased by $144 million in the second quarter to 63.9% of revenue. The biggest contributor was cost of goods sold, which increased $95 million in the quarter, mainly because of rebates due to higher recycling commodity prices and volumes. Note that these higher commodity prices and volumes, net of rebates, resulted in an increase in our earnings per diluted share from our recycling operations of approximately $0.03 in the quarter.
Direct fuel costs increased approximately $39 million, primarily because of a 33% increase in price per gallon of diesel fuel. Subcontractor costs increased $6 million in the quarter, primarily relating to the increased fuel costs at our transfer operations. In the second quarter, fuel surcharge revenue continued to offset the increased cost of direct fuel and fuel increases included in subcontractor costs. 
Maintenance costs increased $17 million, primarily related to the higher costs for parts and supply, tires and lubricants at our collection and landfill operations. As David said, we have seen prices for these items increased between 10% and 40% year-over-year, generally in line with prior commodity prices.
Operating expenses increased $24 million due to acquisitions made within the last 12 months. And foreign currency translation for our Canadian operations accounted for an increase in operating costs of approximately $8 million. 
SG&A costs increased $37 million year-over-year and, as a percentage of revenue, increased 50 basis points to 11.4%. The increased costs in SG&A primarily relate to our strategic growth plans and our cost reduction initiatives and are in line with what we discussed on our previous conference calls this year. 
Our growth initiatives, which include medical waste and Bagster had a negative $0.03 per diluted share impact on the quarter. When we gave guidance for the year, we described the initiatives to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in areas like procurement, routing and logistics and the centralization of certain functions. We spent approximately $19 million on these initiatives in the second quarter, consistent with our expectation. 
We are now starting to see positive traction in procurement where we have $5 billion in spend that we can go after. Given the positive results that we have seen late in the second quarter, we feel confident that we will see the benefits in the third and fourth quarters that will more than offset the full year cost of these initiatives. We also expect that in the second half of 2011, the consulting costs for these initiatives will decline by $22 million. The remaining SG&A costs associated with these initiatives will support future revenue growth and will reduce operating expenses.
Interest expense for the second quarter increased $3 million compared with the prior year. On June 30, 2011, our weighted average cost of debt was 5.4% and our debt-to-total-capital ratio for the quarter was 57.7%, consistent with our target ratio of about 60%. The floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 18% at the end of the quarter. 
During the second quarter, we amended our $2 billion revolving credit facility, significantly reducing the cost of the facility and extending its term to May 2016. The credit markets had improved significantly since we executed our agreement in June 2010 and we view this as an opportunity to meaningfully reduce our future interest cost. We estimate that we should save approximately $5 million in interest expense during the second half of 2011.
Our income tax rate, as reported for the second quarter of 2011, was 34.5%. For 2011, we expect the recurring effective tax rate to be approximately 35%.
Turning to cash flow. Second quarter 2011 net cash provided by operating activities was $478 million. This was flat compared to the second quarter of 2010. Our capital expenditures for the second quarter were $280 million, $60 million higher than the second quarter of 2010 and consistent with our plan to increase capital expenditures in 2011. We still anticipate spending between $1.35 billion and $1.45 billion on capital expenditures during 2011. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $206 million, which was $69 million less than the prior-year quarter, largely due to an increase in capital expenditures of $60 million. We still expect free cash flow for 2011 of about $1.25 billion.
In the second quarter of 2011, we paid $161 million in dividends and we repurchased $105 million of our common stock, continuing our long-standing emphasis on returning cash to our shareholders. We also completed approximately $58 million in business acquisitions.
Now, we believe that the actions we are taking to grow and to optimize our operations, including the acquisition of Oakleaf, are the right actions. And with the help of our employees, the best in the business, we will begin to see the results of those actions in the second half of this year and into 2012. And with that, Nicole, let's open the line for questions."

The mix issues, you know, they were more dramatic at 60 to 80 basis points this quarter than they've been in the past. And frankly, we don't see those offsetting. And so what we need to do is we'll get that 80 to 100 basis points of benefit from the actions we're taking. And hopefully, that more than offsets the mix issues. Now obviously, if the mix issues get worse in the back half of the year and you can't predict the mix, it's a problem. If they were to get worse in the back half of the year, obviously, that would have more of an effect on that 100 basis point improvement. The first part of the question is interesting. I think everybody recognizes that we've generally been the price leader in the markets that we serve. And in the past, what we've seen is that the regional and national competitors that basically drafted off of our price actions and all the rises, all the tides lifted the rising boats. But what we've always seen sort of pockets of places where I would say there wasn't as much pricing discipline. Over the last couple of quarters, what we've seen is that those pockets have expanded to where it looks to us like it's virtually in every one of our markets that we're seeing folks that aren't drafting on our pricing actions anymore. They're taking actions that are designed more to get volume than to draft on our pricing actions, and that's become pretty widespread throughout our markets, obviously, as the economy hasn't improved. Now the reality is that you get -- you can never get as much benefit from volume as you can from pricing. All the pricing falls to the bottom line but the volume doesn't. And so we continue to recognize that the trade-off is positive. But the trade-off is positive. We've been raising prices on our current customer base where we've seen the deterioration. Again, as you pointed out, it's frankly in the pricing rollbacks in order to maintain our customers that are under attack and in the mix, which, obviously, we don't have any control over. So if we see sort of the 20 to 40 basis points of mix in the back half of the year offset by the 80 basis points to 100 basis points of pricing action, that's how you get back to our 2% yield."

And Scott, like I said before, the interesting thing that's happened over the last couple of quarters is that it has become more widespread throughout the business units. It started out at the beginning of the year. We recognized that there was going to be some pretty aggressive action in big residential contracts and we took account of that in our front year guidance. But it has spread to the roll-off in the commercial lines. We just got through in the last 2 weeks going through all 25 of our geographic areas to look at their market business strategy for the next 4 years. And for the first time since I've been meeting with these folks on a quarterly basis, it was virtually every market that said they're seeing very aggressive pricing action spreading, starting out, obviously, in the residential line of business but now spreading to the commercial and the industrial line. And that's why you see our price rollbacks growing. So in other words, I think the whole point of the pricing is a few things. First off, we're not going to back off on our price increases because the trade-off is still positive, but we are seeing more reductions from rollbacks, which is obviously competitively driven. And then we got this mix issue that, quite frankly, we didn't see coming in the beginning part of the year. You can't predict the mix. And it really hit us hard in the second quarter. We expect it to abate a little bit but we still expect to see some of that in the third and fourth quarters."

If $100,000 is 10% of their revenue, that means they have $1 million of total revenue, right? And that also means that about 30% to 40% of that $1 million is disposal costs for them. So they've got $300,000 to $400,000 of disposal costs on their $1 million of revenue, right? That's 3x to 4x the amount of revenue that Oakleaf has in that market, that $100,000. So when you think about it, you can get 3x to 4x the revenue if you're able to get all of their disposal volumes in a line of business that has about double the margins of the collection line of business. So if we're able to work with those haulers to get them to bring all of their volumes to our disposal and recycling facilities, we actually do a lot better than if we take over that business on the truck. We can do better on the order of magnitudes. So you're getting 3x to 4x the revenue in a line of business that probably has double the margin. So you're getting 6x to 8x more benefit if you can add that hauler, bring their volumes to your landfill network and your recycling network.

When you look at the first quarter, we had a slight negative for mix. In the second quarter, that went to $19.5 million, and so it was a pretty dramatic shift pretty quickly. And most of that occurred in our southern group. So for example, in South Florida, we have franchise business. And in the franchise markets, our permanent roll-off is actually higher priced than our temporary roll-off, a little different than most of our other markets. But the permanent roll-off business has started in Florida, has started to feel the heat from the economy over the last few years. But actually, there was a pretty good tick-up in temporary businesses. So you had a mix in the roll-off line that went from higher-priced to lower-priced volumes. You've also had some residential contracts throughout the country where, in order to maintain or extend those contracts, we'll go in and offer a recycling service. So if you are doing a solid waste home at $12 a home and you go in and you do recycling at $2 a home, you've made a good business decision. But your yield looks like it's going down. And then we've got a lot of special waste, as you know, for the last few years and special waste is always interesting. The example I use is if you have a landfill where you are bringing in waste from a long distance, you might charge $18 at a whole but you charge $50 for transportation. But then if the volumes come in from closer, you might charge $20 at the whole with no transportation. So you're actually making a great business decision. You're making more money but it looks like your price has gone down because of the mix of volumes. And so I think with the increase in special waste, with the change in South Florida, with the change with some of the residential contracts and then with our normal churn, we saw that hit us a lot harder in the second quarter than we've seen in the past."

And then -- so what we've seen in the last few quarters is that the Midwest and the East have actually been doing fairly well. The South and the West haven't been doing so well. And then this quarter, what you saw was that the West and the South continued to have negative volumes. But you also saw in May and June, you saw even some softness in the Midwest and the East, which, I think, is probably driven by the same effects, the same factors that you saw on the national economy. So what we're seeing is that volumes continue to remain stubbornly low. We've talked about it since the beginning of the downturn, which is what you'll see, I believe, is when you see the commercial volumes start to turn is when you'll see the volumes turn for us. And we just haven't seen that happen yet."

I think as they've seen the volumes continue to remain weak, they've gotten more aggressive on price.

We've got the acceleration of our price increases in the pipeline. So the organization will respond. I don't have any doubt about that. The difference that we've got between this year and that year, because what you saw was we dropped below 1% and then we immediately snapped back well above 2%, the only difference you have between now and then is this mix issue, right? I mean we didn't have the 60 to 80 basis points of mix headwind. And again, mix doesn't necessarily reduce your bottom line earnings. In my examples, you're actually making more money but it looks like your yield is going down. And so you would see exactly the same snapback if it weren't for these mix issues. And the way we're looking at the mix issues right now, we're expecting them to continue in the back half of the year. So I think the corollary is identical.

Now we have increased rollbacks in the second quarter and that maybe indicate a higher level of competition. But we're still going to get 2% yield even with a little bit higher level of rollbacks.

The reason why we're able to do that, that we aren't able to do now is we don't have -- 10% of their business in that market isn't controlled by Waste Management. As of today, it is. And so if you want to maintain that business, then we've got to look at the other parts of our business relationship to make it a win-win. It's not a win for Waste Management if one of our vendor haulers just simply maintains that $100,000 of business in the market and we do nothing. That is not a win for Waste Management. There's only 2 ways we can win: one, put it in on the back of our trucks and bring it in to our landfill. But then we only get that 10% of the business. If we can get 100% of their volumes into our disposal network, that's a huge win for us. And if we can do it at a cost-neutral, even a cost-beneficial number to the vendor hauler, it's a win for them.

Bob's been a great business partner, but he's a better friend than a business partner. And we will certainly all miss his sage advice as he wanders off to retire to his beloved Kingwood.

I want to welcome Steve Preston on his first earnings call as our Executive Vice President of Finance. As you know, Bob Simpson retired on September 30 but he worked hard up to that day to make the transition a smooth one. We all miss Bob, of course, but we're excited to welcome Steve to the team. Welcome, Steve. 
We're pleased with a results of our operations for the third quarter, as we overcame a number of headwinds from a sluggish economy, $0.01 of negative impact from Hurricane Irene on the East Coast and continued investment in our growth initiatives to produce $0.63 of diluted earnings per share in the quarter. We took a lot of cost out in the quarter and we will continue to attack costs. However, we'll also continue to focus on our long-term cost and revenue initiatives because in a slow growth environment, those initiatives will help to drive earnings improvement.
Revenue for the third quarter increased by $181 million or 5.6% from the prior year period. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of positive year-over-year revenue comparison. We achieved this despite the third quarter of 2010 having benefited significantly from the Gulf Coast cleanup effort. Excluding Gulf Coast volumes from the comparison, volumes would have been down only 0.3%, which was the best performance we've seen in years. Higher commodity prices, improved recycling volumes, acquisitions, year-over-year internal revenue growth from yield and surcharge increases all contributed to the revenue growth. Internal revenue from growth from yield on our collection and disposal operations was 1.6% in the quarter and is at 2% year-to-date through September 30. The quarter's result is consistent with our results in the second quarter of 2011, demonstrating our continued pricing discipline. The combined internal revenue growth from yield at the industrial, commercial and residential lines of our collection business was 2.1% in the third quarter. Commercial and industrial yields were 3% and 2.2%, respectively. IRG from yield in our residential line of business was 0.8%.
We continue to meet with municipality seeking concessions and we're working with them to change service levels, extend contracts or offer value propositions that would benefit both the municipality and Waste Management. These are good business decisions but they've negatively impacted our residential and our overall yield.
In the third quarter of 2011, we saw improvement in our price rollbacks as they returned to more normal levels after a spike in the second quarter. We maintained customer churn at about 10.7% in the third quarter, a 10 basis point improvement from the same quarter in the prior year. We need to continue to focus on retaining our customers and we expect our churn rate to improve into 2012.
On the landfill yield front, special waste and C&D waste streams had the sixth consecutive quarter of positive internal revenue growth from yield. In recent months, we've increased our environmental fees as our environmental costs continue to rise. We've also continued our general price increase program and those actions will be reflected in our fourth quarter yield results. However, a change in contract pricing at one of our waste-to-energy operations in South Florida will have between a negative $5 million and a negative $6 million impact on yield in the fourth quarter. Excluding this from our yield calculations, we expect our fourth quarter results to bring us very close to achieving 2% yield for the full year.
On the volume side of the business, internal revenue growth from volume declined 2% in the quarter. If you exclude the volumes associated with the Gulf Coast cleanup efforts in 2010, IRG from volume declined only 0.3% in the quarter. Our commercial collection line of business saw year-over-year IRG from volume declined of 4.1% and the residential line of business saw a 3.4% decline year-over-year. Both of these collection lines improved sequentially from the second quarter and are the best IRG volume results that we've seen in 2011 for these business lines. Industrial IRG from volume declined by 2.9% on a year-over-year basis, which is an improvement from the second quarter of 2011. So collection volumes are improving but not as fast as volumes from recycling, which on an organic basis, grew 8% year-over-year. If we include recycling volumes we obtained from acquisitions, our recycling volumes have increased 14% year-over-year. As you know, customers are becoming more interested in diversion and we have a growing network of MRFs to support this demand. We will continue to invest in recycling assets to better meet our customers' needs.
In the landfill side of the business, third quarter 2011 internal revenue growth from volume improved by 1.5% compared to the third quarter of 2010. IRG from volume for special waste was positive 3.6% year-over-year. IRG from C&D volume declined 0.4% and MSW volumes declined 4.8% year-over-year. The MSW internal revenue growth from volume improved 270 basis points from the second quarter of 2011.
Income from operations in the collection line of business improved 2% in the third quarter when compared to the same quarter last year. This was our highest third quarter income from operations and our highest margin in the collection lines of business in more than six years. We increased our income from operations despite lower volumes by flexing costs and maintaining our pricing discipline. In our waste-to-energy line of business, income from operations declined $10 million, primarily related to the expiration of a long-term power capacity agreement in our South Florida market. In the fourth quarter, we expect income from operations in our waste-to-energy business to be flat when compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. Our position as a leader in the North American recycling business continues to be a strength in 2011, with increased commodity prices and volumes contributing about $0.05 of positive year-over-year earnings per diluted share in the third quarter. Commodity prices have increased approximately 29% and recycling volumes, including acquisitions, have increased approximately 14% when compared with the same quarter last year.
In the fourth quarter, we expect commodity prices to decline modestly from their current levels and we expect earnings per diluted share from recycling to be about flat compared to the fourth quarter last year. As you may recall, recycling prices in the fourth quarter of 2010 remained strong throughout the quarter. But we expect 2011 to be more in line with long-term historic trends, with commodity prices showing a seasonal downtick in the fourth quarter. We saw the beginning of that seasonal downtick in late October.
The integration of Oakleaf into our company is progressing as we expected. Since the acquisition, we closed on several new business opportunities and expanded some existing contracts. We're continuing to work with the customers and the third-party hauler network to ensure a smooth transition. Our relationship with the third quarter party haulers is strong and we're working with them provide solutions that will benefit customers, haulers and Waste Management. With the holiday season upon us, customers want to make ensure that any service transition will not interrupt their seasonal business. So the integration will slow somewhat over the holiday season and will speed up beginning in the first quarter of trouble. Consequently, we should see the benefits from the Oakleaf acquisition begin to ramp up in the second quarter of next year.
In the third quarter of 2011, we saw the best volume performance we've seen in sometime, which is encouraging. However, we need to see for the strength in our MSW and commercial lines before we can be comfortable that this is a sustainable trend and that we'll see positive year-over-year volume comparisons. So for the remainder of the year, we expect volumes to follow the same pattern as the rest of the year, at about negative 1.5% to negative 2%, which makes it important that we maintain our focus on cost and pricing. By doing so, we still expect to achieve full year adjusted earnings of between $2.14 and $2.18 per share, per diluted share. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve."

I'm also looking forward to meeting many of you on the phone in the near future as I get out on the road. So I'm going to give an overview of our costs and our cash flows and then we will open the line up for some questions. Our operating costs increased by $172 million in the quarter to 63.2% of revenue. The biggest contributor was cost of goods sold, which increased $92 million in the quarter, mainly because of rebates to recycling customers due to higher recycling commodity prices and volumes. Direct fuel costs increased about $39 million. That was primarily because of a 32% increase in price per gallon of diesel fuel, and in the third quarter the fuel surcharge revenue actually offset the higher cost of the fuel completely. Labor costs increased $21 million in the quarter, primarily related to merit increases, tuck in and other acquisitions contributed about $17 million to the increase in foreign currency translation. Of course, operations accounted for an increase of about $7 million. We also achieved approximately $28 million of benefit in operating expense in the third quarter from the actions that we took to reduce discretionary spending and eliminate positions, as well as from the expanded rollout of our procurement initiatives. We expect to see an increasing benefit from those initiatives in the fourth quarter, even more so going into 2012. SG&A costs in the third quarter were flat year-over-year but improved as a percentage of revenue by 60 basis points to 10.8%, despite the fact that we spent about $10 million on those procurement and cost reduction initiatives.
Our third quarter of 2011 was affected by several special second items that were identified in our press release. As we normally do, we have adjusted for asset impairments and restructuring costs. We also excluded the accounting impact on our environmental remediation obligations due to changes in the 10-year treasury rate, which have declined from 3.5% to 2.0% and finally, last year, we excluded the negative impact of creating a $28 million closed landfill remediation reserve. So in the third quarter, we also excluded a $9 million benefit from reducing that reserve when a lower caused remediation was selected by the EPA. And as we mentioned on the second quarter conference call, we also adjusted for Oakleaf integration costs and operations.
Our interest expense for the third quarter decreased $9 million compared with the prior year period, primarily due to the improved pricing of our $2 billion revolving credit facility, which was amended in May of 2011. Also at the end of the quarter our average weighted average cost of debt was 5.3%. Our debt to total capital ratio for the quarter was 60.5%. That was consistent with our target ratio of 60% and the floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 17% at the end of the quarter. Our income tax rate, as reported for the third quarter of 2011, was 32.3%. The reduction in our third quarter rate is primarily due to audit settlements and adjustments from filing our 2010 income tax return that benefited our EPS by about $0.02 per share. For the full year, we expect the recurring effective tax rate to be approximately 35%. 
Turning now to cash flow. Third quarter 2011 net cash provided by operating activities was $659 million. In the third quarter of 2010, we received a federal tax refund of $65 million so if you exclude that item, net cash provided from operations increased $47 million or 7.7%. Our capital expenditures for the third quarter were $313 million, leading us to a free cash flow for the third quarter of $372 million, which was $52 million less than the prior year. That was largely due to an increase in CapEx of $51 million, as well as the $65 million federal tax refund we received in 2010. We still expect our free cash flow for 2011 to be about $1.25 billion.
In the third quarter of 2011, we paid $158 million in dividends. We also repurchased $360 million worth of our common stock, continuing our long-standing emphasis on returning cash to shareholders. In October, we also repurchased an additional $47 million of common stock to complete our Board authorized share repurchase program for 2011 of $575 million. And finally, we completed approximately $488 million in business acquisitions including Oakleaf during the third quarter.
So in conclusion, we are entering the fourth quarter with a stable price and volume environment, solid momentum in our procurement and cost reduction initiatives, as well as good progress on the Oakleaf acquisition. So with that, Brandi, let's open the line for questions."

Look, in a slow economy I'd rather see that stable environment where it was 3 years ago in the great economy 3.5% but in a slow economy, you'd expect there to be a little more competitive reaction and we've seen that but it hasn't been anything dramatic. So when we look at the third quarter, most of the pricing actions that we took, the raise in the environmental fee and moving up price increases, most of them occurred throughout the quarter so we didn't get the full benefit in the third quarter. We certainly will see that uptick in the fourth quarter so in the third quarter, it was offset a little bit by residential pricing, both CPI and price rollbacks that we've had to put in to maintain contracts but again those are good decisions, we're going to get the right pricing actions to maintain the right business. And so we continue to have rollbacks albeit at a much lower level than in the second quarter, we continued to see residential pricing a little bit weak so that was the headwind in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, again, we've got that one big contractual headwind in South Florida from our waste-to-energy plant.

And think of the next to 2 to 3 quarters as being heavy integration periods so I think in the next couple of quarter you'd expect it to look roughly like we do now. I think some of those integration costs are going to hit sequentially over the next few quarter. Getting in to the middle of next year, we would really begin to see -- we expect to see a pretty significant ramp in the benefit from Oakleaf and that comes from really 2, 3 primary areas. It comes from working with third-party haulers to expand our relationships with them so that Oakleaf is giving a hauler business we have the opportunity not looking to get to the disposal work on that particular haul but to expand our relationship. So it's an important incentive to drive disposal volume to our facilities. Secondly, the number of the markets, Waste Management will be taking some of that volume and internalizing it and then thirdly, there is a significant opportunity to consolidate the operational side of the 2 companies we have many aspects of what both companies do are overlapping. And as we put those on 1 platform, we would expect to see the benefits. So as you ramp that up, the next 2 or 3 quarters, we would be sequentially taking some costs to drive that integration. Some of that's going to be for streamlining. Some of that's going to be for equipment that we put out in the field and repair and it really sort of in the second quarter going through the third, fourth quarters of next year, we would expect to see that ramping. Full year next year, I don't think it's going to be a significant impact but the run rate coming out of 2012 sort of fourth quarter going into the following year is when we would expect to really be achieving that full benefit."

And so traditionally, what you see in the fourth quarter is you see the pricing tick down as the Chinese mills start, they've already shipped a lot of their Christmas goods. And so they're starting to slowdown in the back half of the year so you see the China mills start to slow down and then you'll see the domestic mills start to slow down and that's frankly, exactly what we're seeing today. We're seeing the Chinese mills starting to slow down so you're seeing pricing come back in China 15% to 20%. That really hasn't hit the domestic market yet. We fully expect that the domestic market will soften beginning in throughout the November timeframe and then we'll go back into a stable pricing environment as we come out of the new year. That's been the historical trend. Last year, frankly, was the anomaly. Last year, fourth quarter prices stayed strong throughout the fourth quarter. So what we're seeing here is nothing that we didn't expect. We're looking at flat year-over-year earnings. If we continue to see deterioration in the export market, could we have maybe $0.01, negative $0.01 impact in the fourth quarter, we could. But it's certainly not what we're projecting right now."

I want to welcome Steve Preston on his first earnings call as our Executive Vice President of Finance. As you know, Bob Simpson retired on September 30, but he worked hard up to that day to make the transition a smooth one. We all miss Bob, of course, but we're excited to welcome Steve to the team. Welcome, Steve. 
We're pleased with the results of our operations for the third quarter, as we overcame a number of headwinds from a sluggish economy, $0.01 of negative impact from Hurricane Irene on the East Coast and continued investment in our growth initiatives to produce $0.63 of diluted earnings per share in the quarter. We took a lot of costs out in the quarter, and we will continue to attack costs. However, we'll also continue to focus on our long-term cost and revenue initiatives, because in a slow growth environment, those initiatives will help to drive earnings improvement.
Revenue for the third quarter increased by $181 million or 5.6% from the prior year period. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of positive year-over-year revenue comparison. We achieved this despite the third quarter of 2010 having benefited significantly from the Gulf Coast cleanup effort. Excluding Gulf Coast volumes from the comparison, volumes would have been down only 0.3%, which was the best performance we've seen in years. Higher commodity prices, improved recycling volumes, acquisitions, year-over-year internal revenue growth from yield and surcharge increases all contributed to the revenue growth. 
Internal revenue from growth from yield on our collection and disposal operations was 1.6% in the quarter and is at 2% year-to-date through September 30. The quarter's result is consistent with our results in the second quarter of 2011, demonstrating our continued pricing discipline. The combined internal revenue growth from yield at the industrial, commercial and residential lines of our collection business was 2.1% in the third quarter. Commercial and industrial yields were 3% and 2.2%, respectively. IRG from yield in our residential line of business was 0.8%.
We continue to meet with municipality for their seeking concessions and we're working with them to change service levels, extend contracts or offer value propositions that would benefit both the municipality and Waste Management. These are good business decisions, but they've negatively impacted our residential and our overall yield.
In the third quarter of 2011, we saw improvement in our price rollbacks as they returned to more normal levels after a spike in the second quarter. We maintained customer churn at about 10.7% in the third quarter, a 10 basis point improvement from the same quarter in the prior year. We need to continue to focus on retaining our customers, and we expect our churn rate to improve into 2012. On the landfill yield front, the special waste and C&D waste streams had the sixth consecutive quarter of positive internal revenue growth from yield. 
In recent months, we've increased our environmental fees as our environmental costs continue to rise. We've also continued our general price increase program, and those actions will be reflected in our fourth quarter yield results. However, a change in contract pricing at one of our waste-to-energy operations in South Florida will have between a negative $5 million and a negative $6 million impact on yield in the fourth quarter. Excluding this from our yield calculations, we expect our fourth quarter results to bring us very close to achieving 2% yield for the full year.
On the volume side of the business, internal revenue growth from volume declined 2% in the quarter. If you exclude the volumes associated with the Gulf Coast cleanup efforts in 2010, IRG from volume declined only 0.3% in the quarter. Our commercial collection line of business saw a year-over-year IRG from volume declined of 4.1%, and the residential line of business saw a 3.4% decline year-over-year. Both of these collection lines improved sequentially from the second quarter and are the best IRG volume results that we've seen in 2011 for these business lines. 
Industrial IRG from volume declined by 2.9% on a year-over-year basis, which is an improvement from the second quarter of 2011. So collection volumes are improving but not as fast as volumes from recycling, which on an organic basis, grew 8% year-over-year. If we include recycling volumes we obtained from acquisitions, our recycling volumes have increased 14% year-over-year. As you know, customers are becoming more interested in diversion and we have a growing network of MRFs to support this demand. We will continue to invest in recycling assets to better meet our customers' needs.
In the landfill side of the business, third quarter 2011 internal revenue growth from volume improved by 1.5% compared to the third quarter of 2010. IRG from volume for special waste was positive 3.6% year-over-year. IRG from C&D volume declined 0.4% and MSW volumes declined 4.8% year-over-year. The MSW internal revenue growth from volume improved 270 basis points from the second quarter of 2011.
Income from operations in the collection line of business improved 2% in the third quarter when compared to the same quarter last year. This was our highest third quarter income from operations and our highest margin in the collection lines of business in more than six years. We increased our income from operations despite lower volumes by flexing costs and maintaining our pricing discipline. 
In our waste-to-energy line of business, income from operations declined $10 million, primarily related to the expiration of a long-term power capacity agreement in our South Florida market. In the fourth quarter, we expect income from operations in our waste-to-energy business to be flat when compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. Our position as a leader in the North American recycling business continues to be a strength in 2011, with increased commodity prices and volumes contributing about $0.05 of positive year-over-year earnings per diluted share in the third quarter. 
Commodity prices have increased approximately 29% and recycling volumes, including acquisitions, have increased approximately 14% when compared with the same quarter last year. In the fourth quarter, we expect commodity prices to decline modestly from their current levels and we expect earnings per diluted share from recycling to be about flat compared to the fourth quarter last year. As you may recall, recycling prices in the fourth quarter of 2010 remained strong throughout the quarter. But we expect 2011 to be more in line with long-term historic trends, with commodity prices showing a seasonal downtick in the fourth quarter. We saw the beginning of that seasonal downtick in late October.
The integration of Oakleaf into our company is progressing as we expected. Since the acquisition, we've closed on several new business opportunities and expanded some existing contracts. We're continuing to work with the customers and the third-party hauler network to ensure a smooth transition. Our relationship with the third-party haulers is strong and we're working with them to find solutions that will benefit customers, haulers and Waste Management. 
With the holiday season upon us, customers want to ensure that any service transition will not interrupt their seasonal business. So the integration will slow somewhat over the holiday season and will speed up beginning in the first quarter of 2012. Consequently, we should see the benefits from the Oakleaf acquisition begin to ramp up in the second quarter of next year.
In the third quarter of 2011, we saw the best volume performance we've seen in sometime, which is encouraging. However, we need to see further strength in our MSW and commercial lines before we can be comfortable that this is a sustainable trend and that we'll see positive year-over-year volume comparisons. So for the remainder of the year, we expect volumes to follow the same pattern as the rest of the year, at about negative 1.5% to negative 2%, which makes it important that we maintain our focus on costs and pricing. By doing so, we still expect to achieve full year adjusted earnings of between $2.14 and $2.18 per share -- per diluted share. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve."
190694,140333966,179232,"Waste Management, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2011",2011-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","All right. Thank you, David. It's great to be here. It sure beats competing against Waste Management. I'm also looking forward to meeting many of you on the phone in the near future as I get out on the road. So I'm going to give an overview of our costs a",794,"All right. Thank you, David. It's great to be here. It sure beats competing against Waste Management. I'm also looking forward to meeting many of you on the phone in the near future as I get out on the road. So I'm going to give an overview of our costs and our cash flows, and then we will open the line up for some questions. 
Our operating costs increased by $172 million in the quarter to 63.2% of revenue. The biggest contributor was cost of goods sold, which increased $92 million in the quarter, mainly because of rebates to recycling customers due to higher recycling commodity prices and volumes. Direct fuel costs increased about $39 million. That was primarily because of a 32% increase in price per gallon of diesel fuel. And in the third quarter, the fuel surcharge revenue actually offset the higher cost of the fuel completely. 
Labor costs increased $21 million in the quarter, primarily related to merit increases. Tuck-in and other acquisitions contributed about $17 million to the increase in foreign currency translation for our Canadian operations accounted for an increase of about $7 million. 
We also achieved approximately $28 million of benefit in operating expense in the third quarter from the actions that we took to reduce discretionary spending and eliminate positions, as well as from the expanded rollout of our procurement initiatives. We expect to see an increasing benefit from those initiatives in the fourth quarter, even more so, going into 2012. SG&A costs in the third quarter were flat year-over-year but improved as a percentage of revenue by 60 basis points to 10.8%, despite the fact that we spend about $10 million on those procurement and cost reduction initiatives.
Our third quarter of 2011 was affected by several special items that were identified in our press release. As we normally do, we have adjusted for asset impairments and restructuring costs. We also excluded the accounting impact on our environmental remediation obligations due to changes in the 10-year Treasury rate, which have declined from 3.5% to 2.0%. 
And finally, last year, we excluded the negative impact of creating a $28 million closed landfill remediation reserve. So in the third quarter, we also excluded a $9 million benefit from reducing that reserve when a lower cost remediation was selected by the EPA. And as we mentioned on the second quarter conference call, we also adjusted for Oakleaf integration costs and operations.
Our interest expense for the third quarter has decreased $9 million compared with the prior year period, primarily due to the improved pricing of our $2 billion revolving credit facility, which was amended in May of 2011. And also, at the end of the quarter, our average -- weighted average cost of debt was 5.3%. Our debt to total capital ratio for the quarter was 60.5%. That was consistent with our target ratio of 60%, and the floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 17% at the end of the quarter. 
Our income tax rate, as reported for the third quarter of 2011, was 32.3%. The reduction in our third quarter rate is primarily due to audit settlements and adjustments from filing our 2010 income tax return that benefited our EPS by about $0.02 a share. For the full year, we expect the recurring effective tax rate to be approximately 35%. 
Turning now to cash flow. Third quarter 2011 net cash provided by operating activities was $659 million. In the third quarter of 2010, we received a federal tax refund of $65 million. So if you exclude that item, net cash provided from operations increased $47 million or 7.7%. Our capital expenditures for the third quarter were $313 million, leading us to a free cash flow for the third quarter of $372 million, which was $52 million less than the prior year. That was largely due to an increase in CapEx of $51 million, as well as the $65 million federal tax refund we received in 2010. We still expect our free cash flow for 2011 to be about $1.25 billion.
In the third quarter of 2011, we paid $158 million in dividends. We also repurchased $360 million worth of our common stock, continuing our long-standing emphasis on returning cash to shareholders. In October, we also repurchased an additional $47 million of common stock to complete our board-authorized share repurchase program for 2011 of $575 million. And finally, we completed approximately $488 million in business acquisitions, including Oakleaf, during the third quarter.
So in conclusion, we are entering a fourth quarter with a stable price and volume environment, solid momentum in our procurement and cost reduction initiatives, as well as good progress on the Oakleaf acquisition. 
So with that, Brandi, let's open the line for questions."

It includes the revenue improvement initiatives that some of which David went through. The environmental surcharge and the price increases includes the labor reductions that I mentioned. It includes the procurement initiatives. So there are a number of different pieces that go in there. And so I think every one of those components is actually going to see some sequential strength from third to fourth quarter. Now some of that is going to -- from a year-over-year basis, it's going to be somewhat offset by the commodity pricing that you mentioned because we had a strong benefit from commodities in the third quarter. Fourth quarter to fourth quarter, we're going to see less of that. So to an extent, some of that benefit we're seeing on the cost side is going to be -- is going to serve to offset the commodity price benefit we got in the third quarter."

But in a slow economy, you'd expect there to be a little more competitive reaction and we've seen that but it hasn't been anything dramatic. So when we look at the third quarter, most of the pricing actions that we took, the raise in the environmental fee and moving up price increases, most of them occurred throughout the quarter so we didn't get the full benefit in the third quarter. We certainly will see that uptick in the fourth quarter. So in the third quarter, it was offset a little bit by residential pricing, both CPI and price rollbacks that we've had to put in to maintain contracts. But again, those are good decisions. We're going to take the right pricing actions to maintain the right business. And so we continue to have rollbacks albeit at a much lower level than in the second quarter. We continue to see residential pricing a little bit weak. So that was the headwind in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, again, we've got that one big contractual headwind in South Florida from our waste-to-energy plant.

And that is really the mixture of fully unintegrated Oakleaf plus any integration costs associated with that, as well as higher interest expense. And think of the next 2 to 3 quarters as being heavy integration periods. So I think, in the next couple of quarters, we would expect it to look roughly like we do now. I think some of those integration costs are going to hit sequentially over the next few quarters. Getting into the middle of next year, we would really begin to see -- we expect to see a pretty significant ramp in the benefit from Oakleaf, and that comes from really 2 -- 3 primary areas. Okay? It comes from working with third-party haulers to expand our relationships with them. So that if Oakleaf is giving a hauler business, we have the opportunity, not looking to get the disposal work on that particular haul, but to expand our relationship. So it's an important incentive to drive disposal volume to our facilities. Secondly, in a number of the markets, Waste Management will be taking some of that volume and internalizing it. And then thirdly, there is a significant opportunity to consolidate the operational side of the 2 companies we have. Many aspects of what both companies do are overlapping. And as we put those on one platform, we would expect to see the benefit. So as you ramp that up, the next 2 or 3 quarters, we would be sequentially taking some costs to drive that integration. Some of that is going to be for streamlining. Some of that is going to be for equipment that we put out in the field and repair. And then really sort of in the second quarter going through the third, fourth quarters of next year, we would expect to see that ramping. Full year next year, I don't think it's going to be a significant impact. But the run rate coming out of 2012, sort of fourth quarter going into the following year, is when we would expect to really be achieving that full benefit."

We're more and more moving toward that in our business, and commodities have become certainly a worldwide market. And so you've got the export market, primarily China, driving a lot of pricing, including driving some of the domestic pricing. And so traditionally, what you see in the fourth quarter is you see the pricing tick down as the Chinese mills start. They've already shipped a lot of their Christmas goods, and so they're starting to slow down in the back half of the year. So you see the China mills start to slow down, and then you'll see the domestic mills start to slow down. And that's, frankly, exactly what we're seeing today. We're seeing the Chinese mills starting to slow down, and so you're seeing pricing come back in China 15% to 20%. That really hasn't hit the domestic market yet. We fully expect that the domestic market will soften beginning and sort of throughout the November time frame. And then we'll go back into a stable pricing environment as we come out of the new year. That's been the historical trend. Last year, frankly, was the anomaly. Last year, fourth quarter prices stayed strong throughout the fourth quarter. So what we're seeing here is nothing that we didn't expect. We're looking at flat year-over-year earnings. If we continue to see deterioration in the export market, could we have maybe $0.01 impact, a negative $0.01 impact in the fourth quarter?

Some of those risks and uncertainties are detailed in our earnings press release this morning and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Form 10-K.  
Additionally, during the call, David and Steve will discuss our results on an as-adjusted basis including revenue; net income; earnings per fully diluted share, which they may refer to as EPS; interest expense; operating expenses; SG&A expense; and expenses as a percent of revenue. These financial measures have been adjusted for items management believes do not reflect the fundamental business performance or are not indicative of our results of operations.

I want to welcome Steve Preston on his first earnings call as our Executive Vice President of Finance. As you know, Bob Simpson retired on September 30, but he worked hard up to that day to make the transition a smooth one. We all miss Bob, of course, but we're excited to welcome Steve to the team. Welcome, Steve. 
We're pleased with the results of our operations for the third quarter, as we overcame a number of headwinds from a sluggish economy, $0.01 of negative impact from Hurricane Irene on the East Coast and continued investment in our growth initiatives to produce $0.63 of diluted earnings per share in the quarter. We took a lot of costs out in the quarter, and we will continue to attack costs. However, we'll also continue to focus on our long-term cost and revenue initiatives, because in a slow growth environment, those initiatives will help to drive earnings improvement.
Revenue for the third quarter increased by $181 million or 5.6% from the prior year period. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of positive year-over-year revenue comparison. We achieved this despite the third quarter of 2010 having benefited significantly from the Gulf Coast cleanup effort. Excluding Gulf Coast volumes from the comparison, volumes would have been down only 0.3%, which was the best performance we've seen in years. Higher commodity prices, improved recycling volumes, acquisitions, year-over-year internal revenue growth from yield and surcharge increases all contributed to the revenue growth. 
Internal revenue from growth from yield on our collection and disposal operations was 1.6% in the quarter and is at 2% year-to-date through September 30. The quarter's result is consistent with our results in the second quarter of 2011, demonstrating our continued pricing discipline. The combined internal revenue growth from yield at the industrial, commercial and residential lines of our collection business was 2.1% in the third quarter. Commercial and industrial yields were 3% and 2.2%, respectively. IRG from yield in our residential line of business was 0.8%.
We continue to meet with municipalities that are seeking concessions and we're working with them to change service levels, extend contracts or offer value propositions that would benefit both the municipality and Waste Management. These are good business decisions, but they've negatively impacted our residential and our overall yield.
In the third quarter of 2011, we saw improvement in our price rollbacks as they returned to more normal levels after a spike in the second quarter. We maintained customer churn at about 10.7% in the third quarter, a 10 basis point improvement from the same quarter in the prior year. We need to continue to focus on retaining our customers, and we expect our churn rate to improve into 2012. On the landfill yield front, the special waste and C&D waste streams had the sixth consecutive quarter of positive internal revenue growth from yield. 
In recent months, we've increased our environmental fees as our environmental costs continue to rise. We've also continued our general price increase program, and those actions will be reflected in our fourth quarter yield results. However, a change in contract pricing at one of our waste-to-energy operations in South Florida will have between a negative $5 million and a negative $6 million impact on yield in the fourth quarter. Excluding this from our yield calculations, we expect our fourth quarter results to bring us very close to achieving 2% yield for the full year.
On the volume side of the business, internal revenue growth from volume declined 2% in the quarter. If you exclude the volumes associated with the Gulf Coast cleanup efforts in 2010, IRG from volume declined only 0.3% in the quarter. Our commercial collection line of business saw a year-over-year IRG from volume decline of 4.1%, and the residential line of business saw a 3.4% decline year-over-year. Both of these collection lines improved sequentially from the second quarter and are the best IRG volume results that we've seen in 2011 for these business lines. 
Industrial IRG from volume declined by 2.9% on a year-over-year basis, which is an improvement from the second quarter of 2011. So collection volumes are improving but not as fast as volumes from recycling, which on an organic basis, grew 8% year-over-year. If we include recycling volumes we obtained from acquisitions, our recycling volumes have increased 14% year-over-year. As you know, customers are becoming more interested in diversion and we have a growing network of MRFs to support this demand. We will continue to invest in recycling assets to better meet our customers' needs.
In the landfill side of the business, third quarter 2011 internal revenue growth from volume improved by 1.5% compared to the third quarter of 2010. IRG from volume for special waste was positive 3.6% year-over-year. IRG from C&D volume declined 0.4% and MSW volumes declined 4.8% year-over-year. The MSW internal revenue growth from volume improved 270 basis points from the second quarter of 2011.
Income from operations in the collection line of business improved 2% in the third quarter when compared to the same quarter last year. This was our highest third quarter income from operations and our highest margin in the collection lines of business in more than 6 years. We increased our income from operations despite lower volumes by flexing costs and maintaining our pricing discipline. 
In our waste-to-energy line of business, income from operations declined $10 million, primarily related to the expiration of a long-term power capacity agreement in our South Florida market. In the fourth quarter, we expect income from operations in our waste-to-energy business to be flat when compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. Our position as a leader in the North American recycling business continues to be a strength in 2011, with increased commodity prices and volumes contributing about $0.05 of positive year-over-year earnings per diluted share in the third quarter. 
Commodity prices have increased approximately 29% and recycling volumes, including acquisitions, have increased approximately 14% when compared with the same quarter last year. In the fourth quarter, we expect commodity prices to decline modestly from their current levels and we expect earnings per diluted share from recycling to be about flat compared to the fourth quarter last year. As you may recall, recycling prices in the fourth quarter of 2010 remained strong throughout the quarter. But we expect 2011 to be more in line with long-term historic trends, with commodity prices showing a seasonal downtick in the fourth quarter. We saw the beginning of that seasonal downtick in late October.
The integration of Oakleaf into our company is progressing as we expected. Since the acquisition, we've closed on several new business opportunities and expanded some existing contracts. We're continuing to work with the customers and the third-party hauler network to ensure a smooth transition. Our relationship with the third-party haulers is strong and we're working with them to find solutions that will benefit customers, haulers and Waste Management. 
With the holiday season upon us, customers want to ensure that any service transition will not interrupt their seasonal business. So the integration will slow somewhat over the holiday season and will speed up beginning in the first quarter of 2012. Consequently, we should see the benefits from the Oakleaf acquisition begin to ramp up in the second quarter of next year.
In the third quarter of 2011, we saw the best volume performance we've seen in sometime, which is encouraging. However, we need to see further strength in our MSW and commercial lines before we can be comfortable that this is a sustainable trend and that we'll see positive year-over-year volume comparisons. So for the remainder of the year, we expect volumes to follow the same pattern as the rest of the year, at about negative 1.5% to negative 2%, which makes it important that we maintain our focus on costs and pricing. By doing so, we still expect to achieve full year adjusted earnings of between $2.14 and $2.18 per share -- per diluted share. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve."
190694,140333966,179378,"Waste Management, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2011",2011-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","All right. Thank you, David. It's great to be here. It sure beats competing against Waste Management. I'm also looking forward to meeting many of you on the phone in the near future as I get out on the road. So I'm going to give an overview of our costs a",791,"All right. Thank you, David. It's great to be here. It sure beats competing against Waste Management. I'm also looking forward to meeting many of you on the phone in the near future as I get out on the road. So I'm going to give an overview of our costs and our cash flows, and then we will open the line up for some questions. 
Our operating costs increased by $172 million in the quarter to 63.2% of revenue. The biggest contributor was cost of goods sold, which increased $92 million in the quarter, mainly because of rebates to recycling customers due to higher recycling commodity prices and volumes. Direct fuel costs increased about $39 million. That was primarily because of a 32% increase in price per gallon of diesel fuel. And in the third quarter, the fuel surcharge revenue actually offset the higher cost of the fuel completely. 
Labor costs increased $21 million in the quarter, primarily related to merit increases. Tuck-in and other acquisitions contributed about $17 million to the increase in foreign currency translation for our Canadian operations accounted for an increase of about $7 million. 
We also achieved approximately $28 million of benefit in operating expense in the third quarter from the actions that we took to reduce discretionary spending and eliminate positions, as well as from the expanded rollout of our procurement initiatives. We expect to see an increasing benefit from those initiatives in the fourth quarter, even more so, going into 2012. SG&A costs in the third quarter were flat year-over-year but improved as a percentage of revenue by 60 basis points to 10.8%, despite the fact that we spent about $10 million on those procurement and cost reduction initiatives.
Our third quarter of 2011 was affected by several special items that were identified in our press release. As we normally do, we have adjusted for asset impairments and restructuring costs. We also excluded the accounting impact on our environmental remediation obligations due to changes in the 10-year Treasury rate, which have declined from 3.5% to 2.0%. 
And finally, last year, we excluded the negative impact of creating a $28 million closed landfill remediation reserve. So in the third quarter, we also excluded a $9 million benefit from reducing that reserve when a lower cost remediation was selected by the EPA. And as we mentioned on the second quarter conference call, we also adjusted for Oakleaf integration costs and operations.
Interest expense for the third quarter decreased $9 million compared with the prior year period, primarily due to the improved pricing of our $2 billion revolving credit facility, which was amended in May of 2011. And also, at the end of the quarter, our average -- weighted average cost of debt was 5.3%. Our debt to total capital ratio for the quarter was 60.5%. That was consistent with our target ratio of 60%, and the floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 17% at the end of the quarter. 
Our income tax rate, as reported for the third quarter of 2011, was 32.3%. The reduction in our third quarter rate is primarily due to audit settlements and adjustments from filing our 2010 income tax return that benefited our EPS by about $0.02 a share. For the full year, we expect the recurring effective tax rate to be approximately 35%. 
Turning now to cash flow. Third quarter 2011 net cash provided by operating activities was $659 million. In the third quarter of 2010, we received a federal tax refund of $65 million. So if you exclude that item, net cash provided from operations increased $47 million or 7.7%. Our capital expenditures for the third quarter were $313 million, leading us to a free cash flow for the third quarter of $372 million, which was $52 million less than the prior year. That was largely due to an increase in CapEx of $51 million, as well as the $65 million federal tax refund we received in 2010. We still expect our free cash flow for 2011 to be about $1.25 billion.
In the third quarter of 2011, we paid $158 million in dividends. We also repurchased $360 million worth of our common stock, continuing our long-standing emphasis on returning cash to shareholders. In October, we also repurchased an additional $47 million of common stock to complete our board-authorized share repurchase program for 2011 of $575 million. And finally, we completed approximately $488 million in business acquisitions, including Oakleaf, during the third quarter.
So in conclusion, we are entering fourth quarter with a stable price and volume environment, solid momentum in our procurement and cost reduction initiatives, as well as good progress on the Oakleaf acquisition. 
So with that, Brandi, let's open the line for questions."

And so I think every one of those components is actually going to see some sequential strength from third to fourth quarter. Now some of that is going to -- from a year-over-year basis, it's going to be somewhat offset by the commodity pricing that you mentioned because we had a strong benefit from commodities in the third quarter.

So to an extent, some of that benefit we're seeing on the cost side is going to be -- is going to serve to offset the commodity price benefit we got in the third quarter."

But in a slow economy, you'd expect there to be a little more competitive reaction and we've seen that but it hasn't been anything dramatic. So when we look at the third quarter, most of the pricing actions that we took, the raise in the environmental fee and moving up price increases, most of them occurred throughout the quarter so we didn't get the full benefit in the third quarter. We certainly will see that uptick in the fourth quarter. So in the third quarter, it was offset a little bit by residential pricing, both CPI and price rollbacks that we've had to put in to maintain contracts. But again, those are good decisions. We're going to take the right pricing actions to maintain the right business. And so we continue to have rollbacks albeit at a much lower level than in the second quarter. We continue to see residential pricing a little bit weak. So that was the headwind in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, again, we've got that one big contractual headwind in South Florida from our waste-to-energy plant.

I think some of those integration costs are going to hit sequentially over the next few quarters. Getting into the middle of next year, we would really begin to see -- we expect to see a pretty significant ramp in the benefit from Oakleaf, and that comes from really 2 -- 3 primary areas. Okay? It comes from working with third-party haulers to expand our relationships with them. So that if Oakleaf is giving a hauler business, we have the opportunity, not only to get the disposal work on that particular haul, but to expand our relationship. So it's an important incentive to drive disposal volume to our facilities. Secondly, in a number of the markets, Waste Management will be taking some of that volume and internalizing it. And then thirdly, there is a significant opportunity to consolidate the operational side of the 2 companies we have. Many aspects of what both companies do are overlapping. And as we put those on one platform, we would expect to see the benefit. So as you ramp that up, the next 2 or 3 quarters, we would be sequentially taking some costs to drive that integration. Some of that is going to be for streamlining. Some of that is going to be for equipment that we put out in the field and repair. And then really sort of in the second quarter going through the third, fourth quarters of next year, we would expect to see that ramping. Full year next year, I don't think it's going to be a significant impact. But the run rate coming out of 2012, sort of fourth quarter going into the following year, is when we would expect to really be achieving that full benefit."

And so we don't see any sort of unusual pricing action in any particular area of the company. Where we've seen the most pricing pressure has been on the rollback side and then in the residential line. And then you've got -- the South has certainly had struggles. Part of it is down in South Florida with our waste energy plants. A lot of those contracts, a lot of those disposal contracts were long-term disposal contracts. And they happen to be rolling off much like some of our electricity contracts. They happen to be rolling off at a time when the market isn't as strong as it was 4 years ago. If that -- if this contract had rolled off 4 years ago, we'd be in a heck of a lot better shape than we would be today. It just so happens that contract is rolling off in South Florida, and that's going to --  that's going to hit us. But again, if you eliminate that contract from the fourth quarter, we fully expect to see price begin its march back up. And then next year, when you see CPI getting better, we'd expect that to continue. Now again, next year -- every year is harder than the prior year because you've got a lot of different things like fees and surcharges anniversaring. And so we've got to find a way to overcome those."

We're more and more moving toward that in our business, and commodities have become certainly a worldwide market. And so you've got the export market, primarily China, driving a lot of pricing, including driving some of the domestic pricing. And so traditionally, what you see in the fourth quarter is you see the pricing tick down as the Chinese mills start -- they've already shipped a lot of their Christmas goods, and so they're starting to slow down in the back half of the year. So you see the China mills start to slow down, and then you'll see the domestic mills start to slow down. And that's, frankly, exactly what we're seeing today. We're seeing the Chinese mills starting to slow down, and so you're seeing pricing come back in China 15% to 20%. That really hasn't hit the domestic market yet. We fully expect that the domestic market will soften beginning in sort of throughout the November time frame. And then we'll go back into a stable pricing environment as we come out of the new year. That's been the historical trend. Last year, frankly, was the anomaly. Last year, fourth quarter prices stayed strong throughout the fourth quarter. So what we're seeing here is nothing that we didn't expect. We're looking at flat year-over-year earnings. If we continue to see deterioration in the export market, could we have maybe $0.01 impact, a negative $0.01 impact in the fourth quarter? We could, but it's certainly not what we're projecting right now."

Remember, we grew volume by 14% year-over-year so that helps make up for the earnings on a year-over-year comparison. But you're absolutely right, it goes back to what Steve was talking about earlier. On a sequential basis, you will see weakening in prices.
