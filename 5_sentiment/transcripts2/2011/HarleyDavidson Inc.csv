As you saw on this morning's press release, Harley-Davidson made great progress in 2010 on restructuring our company to take advantage of the opportunities that we believe lie ahea",579,"Thank you, Amy. Good morning, everyone, thanks for joining us on the call. As you saw on this morning's press release, Harley-Davidson made great progress in 2010 on restructuring our company to take advantage of the opportunities that we believe lie ahead. 
First, let me say just how much our entire leadership team appreciate all the extraordinary work of our employees to achieve these results, and make this transformation possible. We did a lot of change in a short amount of time and our employees have truly done a great job. I'd also like to thank our dealers for all their hard work to bring a great Harley-Davidson experience to customers in what has continued to be a challenging business environment.
Let's take a quick look at where we are, what we've achieved and where we're going. Our strategy to deliver results through focus, which we rolled out in late 2009, we've been restructuring the business and focusing our investments in ways that will strengthen the Harley-Davidson brand, lower our cost structure, foster continuous improvement and promote growth in the U.S. as well as globally. And while we feel good about all that we've achieved, we know it's crucial for us to stay fully on the throttle here. 
In 2011, we will continue the important work of transforming our manufacturing operations, our product development capabilities to be more lean and world-class, and these initiatives are key when it comes to our ability to bringing new innovative products to the market in a more timely manner and to grow. 
In manufacturing, the transformational new labor agreements and structural changes in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin will, when completed, provide a seasonal flexibility, model flexibility and efficiency improvement that we expect will allow us to be more responsive to market demand and deliver greater returns. This week, we will begin labor negotiations in Kansas City to address these same issues of competitiveness, flexibility and efficiency. Now our overall goal is to having world-class, team-based, lean operating structure across all our production operations with continuous improvement and standardized processes at the center of everything we do.
Turning to product development. Our products are hitting the mark. For example, more than 2/3 of the SuperLow sales are to customers new to Harley-Davidson, and we believe the new Blackline, unveiled last weekend, will further bolster market penetration among young adults where we already hold the number one share position.
Our transformation and product development is focusing on improvement in two key areas with, one is to reduce the time it takes to run new products to market through lean engineering methodologies. And the second is to increase our development capacity to simultaneously handle more product development initiatives through best-in-class systems. Now here too, we've made a lot of ground work and are well on our way. Over the coming years, we will begin to see the fruits of these efforts. 
So in summary, 2010 was a very busy year for us, and I'm extremely proud of all our accomplishments. As I look forward, all these changes will allow us to be more customer lead in everything that we do. For 2011, we continue to have a measured outlook while at the same time, we're encouraged by indications of a strengthening economy, and we anticipate further improvement in our performance. 
So I'll be back later in the call for questions. Now I'd like to turn it over to John Olin who will walk us through the numbers."

I'll review the financial results starting on Slide 9. We'll start with the fourth quarter results.

I'll review the financial results starting on Slide 9. We'll start with the fourth quarter results. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson motorcycles and products revenue was up 20%, behind a 23.8% increase in shipment of Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Our financial performance included significantly improved gross margin as we lapped last year's fourth quarter, which included Buell exit costs. 
In addition, restructuring spend was over $100 million lower in the fourth quarter of this year compared to last year. Despite the improved performance in the fourth quarter from the Motorcycles and Related Products segment and another very strong quarter from HDFS [Harley-Davidson Financial Services], we recorded a loss of $42.1 million for the quarter. The results were impacted by a one-time charge of $85 million and a repurchase of $297 million of high interest debt that we issued in February of 2009. As compared to prior year, our fourth quarter income from continuing operations improved by $105.1 million.
Moving onto retail sales on Slide 10. World violates retail sales at Harley-Davidson motorcycles were down modestly in the fourth quarter. We were encouraged by the fact that the quarterly retail sales declined moderated from prior quarters. However, we remain cautious as we move into 2011 given the faster global economic recovery, which is characterized by high unemployment, low consumer environment and depressed home values. 
In the U.S., retail salse in the quarter were stronger than expected, down only 0.2% for the full year. U.S. retail sales were down 11.7% however, our full-year market share strengthened by 1.6 percentage points to 54.9%. In international markets, retail sales for the quarter were down 2.1%, which was in line with the full-year decline of 1.9%. 
Fourth quarter retail sales in the Europe region were down 8.9% compared to last year. The year-over-year decline was partially driven by earlier availability of new model motorcycles in Europe, which in effect, pulled sales up in the fourth quarter and drove a retail sales increase of 11.4% in the third quarter. 
Through November, our market share in Europe increased 0.6 percentage points to 12.7%, which moves up into the second place in market share for the Europe year region. Asia-Pacific region was up 3.4% driven by incremental sales in our expansion markets including India. All other international region results are noted on the slide. For the full year, worldwide retail sales were down 8.5% compared to 2009.
On Slide 11, you will see all sales shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the quarter and within the expected range of 41,00 to 46,000 units. Shipments in the quarter were up significantly compared to last year when we slowed production during the fourth quarter. 
Sportster as a percent of total shipments was 18.3% in the quarter, 5.4 percentage higher than last year's fourth quarter when we shut down Sportster production to right size inventory in the dealer network. In 2010, international shipments were up as we continue to focus on growth in international markets. As a result of reduced full-year shipments and a stronger-than-expected fourth quarter retail sales, U.S. dealer networks year-end inventory was down 11,800 units compared to last year, which you'll see on Slide 12. This is the lowest level of dealer inventory in many years. 
During the fourth quarter, retail inventory dipped below what we believe as an appropriate, and we expect a portion of the dealer inventory will be replenished as we continue to aggressively managed supply, in line with demand. The dealer network has also been collectively managing the businesses through the downturn. For example, many dealers have enhanced their revenue by increasing used bike sales, used bike sales in the network were up double digits from November. Despite dealer networks to improve revenue and managed cost, the profitability impacted in the downturn. So we believe the U.S. dealer network in aggregate remains profitable. In the U.S., 36 dealer points closed in 2010. This contraction was expected and in line with our desire to modestly consolidate our U.S. dealer network in response to our overall volume since the economic downturn took hold.
Slide 13, you will see revenue for the Motorcycles and Related Products segment was up significantly for the fourth quarter and down slightly for the full year compared to last year. During the quarter, average revenue for Harley-Davidson units sold increased $326,000 from the prior year as a result of favorable product mix, lower year-over-year sales incentives and foreign currency exchange.
Turning to restructuring on Slide 14. For the last two years, we have been intensely focused on improving our cost structure and transforming the business to be stronger and more profitable in the future. During the fourth quarter, we incurred $18 million in restructuring expenses and $164 million for the full year, which was lower than anticipated. We have adjusted our projected restructuring cost to reflect the timing, define timing in 2011 and reduce our total expected program cost due to favorability today. We now expect cost in 2011 to be between $85 million and $95 million. But total expected costs associated with our restructuring has been reduced $10 million to $25 million, and we now expect to be at $495 million to $510 million. 
As of the end of the year, we realized $172 million in annual ongoing savings, which is more than anticipated for the year. We are very proud of the organization's focus on and execution of the highly critical restructuring initiatives. We continue to expect total ongoing annual savings of between $290 million and $310 million upon completion of restructuring activities.
On Slide 15, you will see gross margin in the quarter was 29.6%, 9.3 percentage points above the same quarter last year. This was primarily driven by four things: First, the absence of Buell exit costs that were occurred in the fourth quarter of 2009; second, a richer mix of products, despite a higher cost of Sports, the product mix overall was rich driven by strong sales and a high rate for the powerpack and ABS options. Third, foreign currency exchange was favorable; and fourth, manufacturing was favorably impacted by strong productivity, input on the margin and higher volumes partially offset by temporary inefficiencies associated with the transition of non-core operations out of York. 
For the full year, gross margin was 34.2%, which was up nearly two percentage points compared to the prior-year and exceeded our full-year guidance range of 32.5% to 34%. We are pleased with the gross margins strength of the core business in 2010 despite motorcycle shipment declines of 5.6% from 2009.
On Slide 16, operating margin as percent of revenue for the fourth quarter was negative 0.7% versus negative 29% in 2009. Operating margin was favorably impacted by increased gross margin and lower year-over-year restructuring costs. SG&A in the quarter was largely flat in 2009 and was adversely affected by charge associated with the efforts to expand our presence and network of dealers in Brazil. The accruals for employee Short-Term Incentive Pay, or STIP, which did not occur last year, and the continued execution of our growth strategy. Largely offsetting these costs was the fact that last year's fourth quarter was negatively impacted by approximately $19 million of warranty and recall charges that did not repeat in 2010.
For the full year, SG&A increased $34 million from 2009 largely a result of the charge associated with Brazil, STIP, and future investment in growth. Higher SG&A on a full-year basis coupled with lower revenues resulted in an increase of SG&A as a percentage of revenue from 19.9% to 21.2%. As we look forward, we will aggressively manage our expenses while continuing to prudently invest in our growth opportunities. And as we have previously stated, we expect SG&A to decline as a percent of revenue between 2009 and 2014. 
Now moving on to our Financial Services segment on Slide 17. In the fourth quarter, HDFS posted a $43.5 million operating profit, an improvement of $51 million compared to last year. The key drivers of the fourth quarter 2010 results were net interest income, which was favorable by $48.7 million compared to last year as a result of the increase in on balance sheet receivables and an improvement in net interest spread as the cost to fund the HDFS has increased, which included the impact of transferring higher interest rate debt from HDFS to H-D Inc. in 2009. Next, the provision for retail credit losses, which is associated with all on balance sheet retail receivables decreased by $12.7 million primarily due to improved credit loss rates and the result of favorable retail receivable performance. 
Next, the impact of the provision for old sale receivables was unfavorable by $5.5 million during the quarter compared to last year as we worked out of certain dealer credit situations. For the full year, however, the provision for wholesale credit losses were favorable by $7.9 million. And finally, operating expenses were up in the quarter and full year by approximately $7 million. On a full-year basis, the operating expense increase was driven by the restoration of HDFS and short-term incentive compensation as there was none earned in 2009.
On a full-year basis, HDFS posted an operating profit of $182 million, an increase of $300 million compared to last year. And we're very pleased with the improvement in HDFS's business, which has benefited from lower cost of funds, significantly reduced credit loss rates and the fact that HDFS recorded $101 million of one-time items last year. 
Now, Larry will provide more details on HDFS operations. Larry?"

During the fourth quarter, HDFS originated $306 million in retail motorcycles levels, up 7.7% compared to the same period last year primarily due to higher used motorcycle loan originations. For the full year, HDFS originated $1.8 billion in retail motorcycle loans, down 7.9% compared to last year, primarily due to lower retail sales of new motorcycles in the U.S. For the full year, 80% to 85% of our loan origination were prime compared to our historical experience of approximately 75%, prior to significant underwriting adjustments that were made in January of 2009. At year end, over 50% of the total portfolio was comprised of loans originated post underwriting changes. HDFS's retail market share of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles sold in the U.S. was 47.9% for the full year of 2010, down approximately 1% compared to last year. 
Regarding competition. We continue to see increased activity, particularly in the primary customer segments. At the end of the fourth quarter, the approximately $6.2 billion of net finance receivables, $5.4 billion in retail and $814 million were wholesale.
Now, moving on to delinquencies and losses on Slide 19. We continue to see good credit performance on loans originated after the underwriting adjustments were made in 2009. The 30-day delinquency rate for managed retail motorcycle loans at December 31, 2010, was 5.07%, an improvement of 144 basis points compared to last year. Annual retail credit losses improved by 75 basis points to 2.11% for 2010, driven by lower frequency of loss, the impact of changes in underwriting and improvements in the recovery values of repossessed motorcycles. We are pleased with the progress of HDFS in 2010. 
During the year, we maintain a strong liquidity position, reduced our cost of funds and returned to profitability. We remain focused on enabling retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles while providing an appropriate return to Harley-Davidson Inc. And I'm also pleased to report that last week, HDFS paid $125 million dividend to Harley-Davidson Inc.
So in conclusion, we are encouraged by the forward momentum in HDFS, and I believe our employees have an attractive job managing the business in a different environment. So we remained cautious, given the continuing economic challenges with unemployment in over 9% and as our book of loans decline as a result of lower wholesale shipments in retail sales in North America, over the last couple of years. 
Now let me turn it back to John."
277444,117444739,94652,"Harley-Davidson, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2011",2011-01-25,"Earnings Calls","Harley-Davidson, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry. We are pleased that HDFS do to profitability in 2010 and continue to provide credit for our Harley-Davidson dealers and writers while delivering appropriate returns and profitability. Now let's take a look at cash and liquidity on Slide 2",929,"Thanks, Larry. We are pleased that HDFS do to profitability in 2010 and continue to provide credit for our Harley-Davidson dealers and writers while delivering appropriate returns and profitability. 
Now let's take a look at cash and liquidity on Slide 20. During the quarter, we utilized to $381 million of cash on hand to repurchase nearly half of the unsecured notes that were issued at 15% in February 2009. You'll see that at the end of the quarter, we had $1.16 billion of cash and marketable securities, which includes the impact of a $600 million asset-backed securitization transaction that HDFS completed during the quarter. In addition, HDFS had approximately $1.16 billion of available liquidity to bring credit and conduit facilities. 
Earlier this month, there were two transactions related to cash. First, we made $200 million contribution to our qualified pension plans, which will reduce our year end pension and post retirement liability of $537 million. And second, as Larry mentioned, HDFS paid a dividend of $125 million to H-D Inc. This is the first time HDFS has returned capital to H-D Inc, which is reflective of HDFS's reduced capital needs based on lower finance receivable balances. HDFS remains focused on delivering an appropriate return on equity and prudently managing expected equity ratio. 
Our overall cash strategy requires to require maintaining a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and/or credit facilities. Now I'll review the remaining Harley-Davidson Inc. financials on Slide 21. I'd like to highlight a few items on this slide. 
First with regards to continuing operations, the company has generated operating cash of $1.16 billion during 2010, and the Motorcycle business continued to generate strong cash flows. Of the total, the Motorcycles and Related Products segment generated $622 million of operating cash. And second, for the full year, our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 33.5% compared to 60.5% in 2009. The 2009 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by a one-time cash charge related to Wisconsin tax law change and a nondeductible goodwill charge as well as the impact of reduced earnings. The 2010 tax rate was favorably impacted by the settlement of an IRS audit and an increase in tax benefit related to domestic manufacturing offset by tax impact of federal legislation. In 2011, we expect a full year effective income tax rate will be approximately 35%. In terms of discontinued operations, as most of you know, we concluded the sale of MV Agusta in 2010. During the year, losses on discontinued operations net of taxes totaled $113.1 million.
In summary, the full year 2010 results are on Slide 22. While the global economies continue to struggle, we had net income of $259.7 million from continuing operations in 2010, which was up significantly from the prior year. Earnings were impacted by improved operating margins for the Motorcycles and Related Products segment and strong HDFS operating income partially offset by a one-time charge on the repurchase of $297 million of debt.
We are pleased with the progress of our restructuring of the company, as we are encouraged by the moderation in the rate of retail sales decline from the third to fourth quarter of 2010 as well as the strength of our brand as evidenced by our increasing share in many of our markets. We are also optimistic about the long-term as we execute against our strategies to transform and grow our business. We do however remain cautious as we transition into 2011 and will continue to take a prudent approach as we manage the business throughout the year. 
On Slide 23, you will see that for 2011, we expect Harley-Davidson motorcycles shipments to be between 221,000 and 228,000 units, up 5% to 8% from 2010. During 2011, we will continue to aggressively manage shipments in line with retail demand. In 2011, we plan to ship motorcycles to dealers and we expect it in retail, primarily in response to a stronger-than-expected fourth quarter 2010 retail sales, which resulted in the aggregate U.S. dealer inventory level hitting below what we view as an appropriate level. We expect 2011 gross margin to be between 54% and 35% for the full year. And we'll continue to prudently manage capital expenditures. In 2011, we expect full year capital expenditures to be between $210 million and $230 million, which includes between $60 million and $75 million of capital related to restructuring.
As we look 2010, we're pleased to see progress in many fronts. We increased our focus on Harley-Davidson brand as we exited Buell and MV Agusta. We made great strides toward becoming best in class in manufacturing and product development by moving to common operating system, focusing on core competencies, negotiating a transformational labor agreement to Wisconsin unions, reducing our time to market for new products and driving a continuous improvement minds across the company. We focused on our International business by entering new markets such as India and positioning ourselves to add more dealerships in markets such as Brazil. We also return to HDFS back to profitability. And finally, we improved our financial strength by increasing operating margins, reducing debt, increasing returns on invested capital and by continuing to deliver strong cash flows. We believe our prudently managing the company and remaining disciplined in the execution of future growth strategy, we will continue to make progress along our journey to growth. We are focused on delivering strong margins, strong returns and value our shareholders. Thank you for your continued confidence and investment at Harley-Davidson.

The four quarter, we improved gross margin for three of them. I think the first quarter was down about 0.5% and then obviously, the fourth quarter was very strong largely because we had the Buell exit costs a year ago. As we look forward, our guidance is that we expect gross margins will fall between 34% and 35% of revenue. As we look at that versus 2010, we believe that the gross margin will benefit continued productivity and restructuring savings. And again, the restructuring that we provide in the midpoints were somewhere in the neighborhood of $50 million that will hit cost of goods sold. We also think that we'll benefit from incremental margin from the higher production volumes behind our shipping guidance is up 5% to 8%. And then expect a very modest mix favorability.

Clearly, that world-class dealer network and incredibly powerful brand. But our layer customers and we've had a great success on all the segments such as woman and youth. And then we finally, we believe that the firming up of used bikes spaces are also contributing to new bikes sales."

As you saw on this morning's press release, Harley-Davidson made great progress in 2010 on restructuring our company to take advantage of the opportunities that we believe",586,"Thank you, Amy, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call. As you saw on this morning's press release, Harley-Davidson made great progress in 2010 on restructuring our company to take advantage of the opportunities that we believe lie ahead. 
First, let me say just how much our entire leadership team appreciate all the extraordinary work of our employees to achieve these results and make this transformation possible. We dealt with a lot of changes in a short amount of time, and our employees have truly done a great job. I'd also like to thank our dealers for all their hard work to bring a great Harley-Davidson experience to customers in what has continued to be a challenging business environment.
Let's take a quick look at where we are, what we've achieved and where we're going. Through our strategy to deliver results through focus, which we rolled out in late 2009, we've been restructuring the business and focusing our investments in ways that will strengthen the Harley-Davidson brand, lower our cost structure, foster continuous improvement and promote growth in the U.S. as well as globally. And while we feel good about all what we've achieved, we know it's crucial for us to stay fully on the throttle here.  
 
In 2011, we will continue the important work of transforming our manufacturing operations, our product development capabilities to be more lean and world-class, and these initiatives are key when it comes to our ability to bring new innovative products to the market in a more timely manner and to grow. 
In manufacturing, the transformational new labor agreements and structural changes in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin will, when completed, provide a seasonal flexibility, model mix flexibility and efficiency improvements that we expect will allow us to be more responsive to market demand and deliver greater returns. This week, we will begin labor negotiations in Kansas City to address these same issues of competitiveness, flexibility and efficiency. Now our overall goal is to having world-class, team-based, lean operating structure across all our production operations with continuous improvement and standardized processes at the center of everything we do.
Turning to product development. Our new products are hitting the mark. For example, more than 2/3 of the SuperLow sales are to customers new to Harley-Davidson, and we believe the new Blackline motorcycle, unveiled last weekend, will further bolster our market penetration among young adults, where we already hold the number one share position.
Our transformation in product development is focused on improvement in two key areas. One is to reduce the time it takes to run new products to market through lean engineering methodologies, and the second is to increase our development capacity to simultaneously handle more product development initiatives through best-in-class planning systems. Well, here, too, we've made a lot of ground work and are well on our way. Over the coming years, we will begin to see the fruits of these efforts. 
So in summary, 2010 was a very busy year for us, and I'm extremely proud of all our accomplishments. As we look forward, all these changes will allow us to be more customer-lead in everything that we do. For 2011, we continue to have a measured outlook, while at the same time, we're encouraged by indications of a strengthening economy, and we anticipate further improvement in our performance. 
So I'll be back later in the call for questions. Now I'd like to turn it over to John Olin, who will walk us through the numbers."

I'll review the financial results starting on Slide 9. We'll start with the fourth quarter results. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson Motorcycles and Related Products revenue was up 20%, behind a 23.8% increase in shipment of Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Our financial performance included significantly improved gross margin as we lap last year's fourth quarter, which included Buell exit costs. 
In addition, restructuring spend was over $100 million lower in the fourth quarter of this year compared to last year. Despite the improved performance in the fourth quarter from the Motorcycles and Related Products segment and another very strong quarter from HDFS [Harley-Davidson Financial Services], we recorded a loss of $42.1 million for the quarter. The results were impacted by a onetime charge of $85 million and a repurchase of $297 million of high-interest debt that we issued in February of 2009. As compared to prior year, our fourth quarter income from continuing operations improved by $105.1 million.
Moving on to retail sales on Slide 10. Worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were down modestly in the fourth quarter. We were encouraged by the fact that the quarterly retail sales decline moderated from prior quarters. However, we remain cautious as we move into 2011, given the fragile global economic recovery, which is characterized by high unemployment, low consumer confidence and depressed home values. 
In the U.S., retail salse in the quarter were stronger than expected, down only 0.2%. For the full year, U.S. retail sales were down 11.7%, however, our full year market share strengthened by 1.6 percentage points to 54.9%. In the international markets, retail sales for the quarter were down 2.1%, which was in line with the full year decline of 1.9%. 
Fourth quarter retail sales in the Europe region were down 8.9% compared to last year. The year-over-year decline was partially driven by earlier availability of new model year motorcycles in Europe, which, in effect, pulled sales up into the third quarter and drove a retail sales increase of 11.4% in the third quarter. 
Through November, our market share in Europe increased 0.6 percentage points to 12.7%, which moved up into the second place in market share for the Europe region. Asia-Pacific region was up 3.4%, driven by incremental sales in our expansion markets including India. All other international region results are noted on the slide. For the full year, worldwide retail sales were down 8.5% compared to 2009.
On Slide 11, you will see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the quarter were within the expected range of 41,000 to 46,000 units. Shipments during the quarter were up significantly compared to last year when we slowed production during the fourth quarter. 
Sportster, as a percent of total shipments, was 18.3% in the quarter, 5.4 percentage points higher than last year's fourth quarter when we shut down Sportster production to right-size Sportster inventory in the dealer network. In 2010, international shipments were up as we continue to focus on growth in international markets. As a result of reduced full year shipments and stronger-than-expected fourth quarter retail sales, U.S. dealer networks' year-end inventory was down 11,800 units compared to last year, which you'll see on Slide 12. This is the lowest level of dealer inventory in many years. 
During the fourth quarter, retail inventory dipped below what we believe as an appropriate level, and we expect that a portion of dealer inventory will be replenished as we continue to aggressively manage supply in line with demand. The dealer network has also been collectively managing the businesses through the downturn. For example, many dealers have enhanced their revenue by increasing used bike sales. Used bike sales in the dealer network were up double digits through November. Despite dealer efforts to improve revenue and manage cost, the profitability had been impacted in the downturn. So we believe the U.S. dealer network in aggregate remains profitable. In the U.S., 36 dealer points closed in 2010. This contraction was expected and in line with our desire to modestly consolidate our U.S. dealer network in response to lower overall volume since the economic downturn took hold.
On Slide 13, you will see revenue for the Motorcycles and Related Products segment was up significantly for the fourth quarter and down slightly for the full year compared to last year. During the quarter, average revenue for Harley-Davidson units sold increased $326 from the prior year as a result of favorable product mix, lower year-over-year sales incentives and foreign currency exchange.
Turning to restructuring on Slide 14. For the last two years, we have been intensely focused on improving our cost structure and transforming the business to be stronger and more profitable in the future. During the fourth quarter, we incurred $18 million in restructuring expenses and $164 million for the full year, which was lower than anticipated. We have adjusted our projected restructuring cost to reflect the lead time [ph], defined timing in 2011 and reduced our total expected program cost due to favorability today. We now expect cost in 2011 to be between $85 million and $95 million. But total expected costs associated with our restructuring had been reduced $10 million to $25 million, and we now expect to be at $495 million to $510 million. 
As of the end of the year, we realized $172 million in annual ongoing savings, which is more than anticipated for the year. We are very proud of the organization's focus on and execution of the highly critical restructuring initiatives. We continue to expect total ongoing annual savings of between $290 million and $310 million upon completion of restructuring activities.
On Slide 15, you will see gross margin in the quarter was 29.6%, 9.3 percentage points above the same quarter last year. This was primarily driven by four things. First, the absence of Buell exit costs that were occurred in the fourth quarter of 2009. Second, a richer mix of products. Despite a higher percentage of Sportsters, the product mix overall was rich, driven by strong Touring and CVO sales and a high rate for the power pack and ABS options. Third, foreign currency exchange was favorable. And fourth, manufacturing was favorably impacted by strong productivity, incremental margin on higher volumes partially offset by temporary inefficiencies associated with the transition of non-core operations out of York. 
For the full year, gross margin was 34.2%, which was up nearly two percentage points compared to the prior year and exceeded our full year guidance range of 32.5% to 34%. We are pleased with the gross margin strength of the core business in 2010 despite motorcycle shipment declines of 5.6% from 2009.
On Slide 16, operating margin as percent of revenue for the fourth quarter was negative 0.7% versus negative 29% in 2009. Operating margin was favorably impacted by increased gross margin and lower year-over-year restructuring costs. SG&A in the quarter was largely flat to 2009 and was adversely impacted by charges associated with the efforts to expand our presence and network of dealers in Brazil; the accruals for employee short-term incentive pay or STIP, which did not occur last year; and the continued execution of our growth strategy. Largely offsetting these costs was the fact that last year's fourth quarter was negatively impacted by approximately $19 million of warranty and recall charges that did not repeat in 2010.
For the full year, SG&A increased $34 million from 2009, largely a result of the charges associated with Brazil, STIP and future investment in growth. Higher SG&A on a full year basis coupled with lower revenues resulted in an increase of SG&A as a percentage of revenue from 19.9% to 21.2%. As we look forward, we will aggressively manage our expenses while continuing to prudently invest in our growth opportunities. And as we have previously stated, we expect the SG&A to decline as a percent of revenue between 2009 and 2014. 
Now moving on to our Financial Services segment on Slide 17. In the fourth quarter, HDFS posted a $43.5 million operating profit, an improvement of $51 million compared to last year. The key drivers of the fourth quarter 2010 results were net interest income, which was favorable by $48.7 million compared to last year as a result of the increase in on-balance sheet receivables and an improvement in the net interest spread as the cost to fund the HDFS increased, which included the impact of transferring higher interest rate debt from HDFS to H-D Inc. in 2009. Next, the provision for retail credit losses, which is associated with all on-balance sheet retail receivables, decreased by $12.7 million, primarily due to improved credit loss rates and the result of favorable retail receivable performance. 
Next, the impact of the provision for wholesale receivables was unfavorable by $5.5 million during the quarter compared to last year as we worked out of certain dealer credit situations. For the full year, however, the provision for wholesale credit losses were favorable by $7.9 million. And finally, operating expenses were up in the quarter and full year by approximately $7 million. On a full year basis, the operating expense increase was driven by the restoration of HDFS and short-term incentive compensation as there was none earned in 2009.
On a full year basis, HDFS posted an operating profit of $182 million, an increase of $300 million compared to last year. And we're very pleased with the improvements in HDFS's business, which has benefited from lower cost of funds, significantly reduced credit loss rates and the fact that HDFS recorded $101 million of onetime items last year. 
Now, Larry will provide more detail on HDFS's operations. Larry?"

During the fourth quarter, HDFS originated $306 million in retail motorcycles levels, up 7.7% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to higher used motorcycle loan originations. For the full year, HDFS originated $1.8 billion in retail motorcycle loans, down 7.9% compared to last year, primarily due to lower retail sales of new motorcycles in the U.S. For the full year, 80% to 85% of our new loan originations were prime compared to our historical experience of approximately 75% prior to significant underwriting adjustments that were made in January of 2009. At year-end, over 50% of the total portfolio was comprised of loans originated post underwriting changes. HDFS's retail market share of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles sold in the U.S. was 47.9% for the full year of 2010, down approximately 1% compared to last year. 
Regarding competition, we continue to see increased activity particularly in the primary customer segment. At the end of the fourth quarter, of the approximately $6.2 billion of net finance receivables, $5.4 billion in retail and $814 million were wholesale.
Now moving on to delinquencies and losses on Slide 19. We continue to see good credit performance on loans originated after the underwriting adjustments were made in 2009. The 30-day delinquency rate for managed retail motorcycle loans at December 31, 2010, was 5.07%, an improvement of 144 basis points compared to last year. Annual retail credit losses improved by 75 basis points to 2.11% for 2010, driven by lower frequency of loss, the impact of changes in underwriting and improvements in the recovery values of repossessed motorcycles. We are pleased with the progress of HDFS in 2010. 
During the year, we maintained a strong liquidity position, reduced our cost of funds and returned to profitability. We remained focused on enabling retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles while providing an appropriate return to Harley-Davidson Inc. And I'm also pleased to report that last week, HDFS paid $125 million dividend to Harley-Davidson Inc.
So in conclusion, we are encouraged by the forward momentum in HDFS, and I believe our employees have done a fantastic job managing the business in a difficult environment. So we remain cautious, given the continuing economic challenges with unemployment at over 9%, and as our book of loans declines as a result of lower wholesale shipments and retail sales in North America over the last couple of years. 
Now let me turn it back to John."
277444,117444739,94913,"Harley-Davidson, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2011",2011-01-25,"Earnings Calls","Harley-Davidson, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry. We are pleased that HDFS returned to profitability in 2010 and continue to provide credit for our Harley-Davidson dealers and riders while delivering appropriate returns and profitability. Now let's take a look at cash and liquidity on Sl",932,"Thanks, Larry. We are pleased that HDFS returned to profitability in 2010 and continue to provide credit for our Harley-Davidson dealers and riders while delivering appropriate returns and profitability. 
Now let's take a look at cash and liquidity on Slide 20. During the quarter, we utilized $381 million of cash on hand to repurchase nearly half of the unsecured notes that were issued at 15% in February 2009. You'll see that at the end of the quarter, we had $1.16 billion of cash and marketable securities, which includes the impact of a $600 million asset-backed securitization transaction that HDFS completed during the quarter. In addition, HDFS had approximately $1.16 billion of available liquidity to bank credit and conduit facilities. 
Earlier this month, there were two transactions related to cash. First, we made a $200 million contribution to our qualified pension plans, which will reduce our year-end pension and post-retirement liability of $537 million. And second, as Larry mentioned, HDFS paid a dividend of $125 million to H-D Inc. This is the first time HDFS has returned capital to H-D Inc., which is reflective of HDFS's reduced capital needs based on lower finance receivable balances. HDFS remains focused on delivering an appropriate return on equity and prudently managing its debt-to-equity ratio. 
Our overall cash strategy continues to require maintaining a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity need in cash and/or credit facilities. Now I'll review the remaining Harley-Davidson Inc. financials on Slide 21. I'd like to highlight a few items on this slide. 
First, with regards to continuing operations, the company generated operating cash of $1.16 billion during 2010, and the Motorcycle business continued to generate strong cash flows. Of the total, the Motorcycles and Related Products segment generated $622 million of operating cash. And second, for the full year, our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 33.5% compared to 60.5% in 2009. The 2009 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by a onetime cash charge related to Wisconsin tax law change and a nondeductible goodwill charge, as well as the impact of reduced earnings. The 2010 tax rate was favorably impacted by the settlement of an IRS audit and an increase in the tax benefit related to domestic manufacturing offset by tax impact of federal healthcare legislation. In 2011, we expect the full year effective income tax rate will be approximately 35%. In terms of discontinued operations, as most of you know, we concluded the sale of MV Agusta in 2010. During the year, losses on discontinued operations, net of taxes, totaled $113.1 million.
In summary, the full year 2010 results are on Slide 22. While the global economy continued to struggle, we had net income of $259.7 million from continuing operations in 2010, which was up significantly from the prior year. Earnings were impacted by improved operating margins for the Motorcycles and Related Products segment and strong HDFS operating income, partially offset by a onetime charge on the repurchase of $297 million of debt.
We are pleased with the progress of our restructuring of the company as we are encouraged by the moderation in the rate of retail sales decline from the third to fourth quarter of 2010, as well as the strength of our brand as evidenced by our increasing share in many of our markets. We are also optimistic about the long term as we execute against our strategies to transform and grow our business. We do, however, remain cautious as we transition into 2011, and we'll continue to take a prudent approach as we manage the business throughout the year. 
On Slide 23, you will see that for 2011, we expect Harley-Davidson motorcycle shipments to be between 221,000 and 228,000 units, up 5% to 8% from 2010. During 2011, we will continue to aggressively manage shipments in line with retail demand. In 2011, we plan to ship [indiscernible] motorcycles to dealers, and we expect [indiscernible] retail, primarily in response to a stronger-than-expected fourth quarter 2010 retail sales which resulted in the aggregate U.S. dealer inventory level hitting below what we view as an appropriate level. We expect 2011 gross margin to be between 34% and 35% for the full year, and we'll continue to carefully manage capital expenditures. In 2011, we expect full year capital expenditures to be between $210 million and $230 million, which includes between $60 million and $75 million of capital related to restructuring.
As we look back in 2010, we're pleased to see progress on many fronts. We increased our focus on Harley-Davidson brand as we exited Buell and MV Agusta. We made great strides toward becoming best in class in manufacturing and product development by moving to a common operating system, focusing on core competencies, negotiating a transformational labor agreement to Wisconsin unions, reducing our time to market for new products and driving a continuous improvement mindset across the company. We focused on our international business by entering new markets such as India and positioning ourselves to add more dealerships in markets such as Brazil. We also returned HDFS back to profitability. And finally, we improved our financial strength by increasing operating margins, reducing debt, increasing returns on invested capital and by continuing to deliver strong cash flows. We believe by prudently managing the company and remaining disciplined in the execution of our future growth strategy, we will continue to make progress along our journey to growth. We are focused on delivering strong margins, strong returns and value our shareholders. Thank you for your continued confidence and investment at Harley-Davidson.

I'm just wondering first of all, can you maybe elaborate on why the margin guidance is in the 34% to 35% range? What are some of the headwinds? And then also, how should we be thinking about operating expenses going forward? On Slide 16, you showed kind of a $3.8 million drag from higher SG&A in the quarter and $34 million for the year.

Out of the four quarters, we improved gross margin for three of them. I think the first quarter was down about 0.5%, and then obviously, the fourth quarter was very strong largely because we lapped the Buell exit costs of a year ago. As we look forward, Rod, our guidance is that we expect gross margin will fall between 34% and 35% of revenue. As we look at that versus 2010, we believe that the gross margin will benefit from continued productivity and restructuring savings. And again, the restructuring that we provide, I think the midpoints were somewhere in the neighborhood of $50 million that will hit cost of goods sold. We also think that we'll benefit from incremental margin from the higher production volumes behind our shipping guidance of being up 5% to 8%. And then expect a very modest mix favorability. So to your question as to the headwinds, if there are some, we expect them to be partially offset by foreign exchange, temporary inefficiencies at our York facility as we continue to outsource non-core parts and as we cut over our assembly operations to new line later in the fall.

As you saw in this morning's press release, Harley-Davidson made great progress in 2010 on restructuring our company to take advantage of the opportunities that we believe",586,"Thank you, Amy, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call. As you saw in this morning's press release, Harley-Davidson made great progress in 2010 on restructuring our company to take advantage of the opportunities that we believe lie ahead. 
First, let me say just how much our entire leadership team appreciate all the extraordinary work by our employees to achieve these results and make this transformation possible. We dealt with a lot of change in a short amount of time, and our employees have truly done a great job. I'd also like to thank our dealers for all their hard work to bring a great Harley-Davidson experience to customers in what has continued to be a challenging business environment.
Let's take a quick look at where we are, what we've achieved and where we're going. Through our strategy to deliver results through Focus, which we rolled out in late 2009, we've been restructuring the business and focusing our investments in ways that will strengthen the Harley-Davidson brand, lower our cost structure, foster continuous improvement and promote growth in the U.S. as well as globally. And while we feel good about all that we've achieved, we know it's crucial for us to stay fully on the throttle here.  
 
In 2011, we will continue the important work of transforming our manufacturing operations, our product development capabilities to be more lean and world-class, and these initiatives are key when it comes to our ability to bring new innovative products to the market in a more timely manner and to grow. 
In manufacturing, the transformational new labor agreements and structural changes in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin will, when completed, provide the seasonal flexibility, model mix flexibility and efficiency improvements that we expect will allow us to be more responsive to market demand and deliver greater returns. This week, we will begin labor negotiations in Kansas City to address these same issues of competitiveness, flexibility and efficiency. Now our overall goal is to having world-class, team-based, lean operating structure across all our production operations with continuous improvement and standardized processes at the center of everything we do.
Turning to product development. Our new products are hitting the mark. For example, more than 2/3 of the SuperLow sales are to customers new to Harley-Davidson, and we believe the new Blackline motorcycle, unveiled last weekend, will further bolster our market penetration among young adults, where we already hold the number one share position.
Our transformation in product development is focused on improvement in two key areas. One is to reduce the time it takes to run new products to market through lean engineering methodologies, and the second is to increase our development capacity to simultaneously handle more product development initiatives through best-in-class planning systems. Now here, too, we've laid a lot of ground work and are well on our way. Over the coming years, we will begin to see the fruits of these efforts. 
So in summary, 2010 was a very busy year for us, and I'm extremely proud of all our accomplishments. As we look forward, all these changes will allow us to be more customer-led in everything that we do. For 2011, we continue to have a measured outlook, while at the same time, we're encouraged by indications of a strengthening economy, and we anticipate further improvement in our performance. 
So I'll be back later in the call for questions. Now I'd like to turn it over to John Olin, who will walk us through the numbers."

I'll review the financial results starting on Slide 9. We'll start with the fourth quarter results.

I'll review the financial results starting on Slide 9. We'll start with the fourth quarter results. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson Motorcycles and Related Products revenue was up 20%, behind a 23.8% increase in shipment of Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Our financial performance included significantly improved gross margin as we lap last year's fourth quarter, which included Buell exit costs. 
In addition, restructuring spending was over $100 million lower in the fourth quarter of this year compared to last year. Despite the improved performance in the fourth quarter from the Motorcycles and Related Products segment and another very strong quarter from HDFS [Harley-Davidson Financial Services], we recorded a loss of $42.1 million for the quarter. The results were impacted by a onetime charge of $85 million and a repurchase of $297 million of high-interest debt that we issued in February of 2009. As compared to prior year, our fourth quarter income from continuing operations improved by $105.1 million.
Moving on to retail sales on Slide 10. Worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were down modestly in the fourth quarter. We were encouraged by the fact that the quarterly retail sales decline moderated from prior quarters. However, we remain cautious as we move into 2011, given the fragile global economic recovery, which is characterized by high unemployment, low consumer confidence and depressed home values. 
In the U.S., retail sales in the quarter were stronger than expected, down only 0.2%. For the full year, U.S. retail sales were down 11.7%, however, our full year market share strengthened by 1.6 percentage points to 54.9%. In the international markets, retail sales for the quarter were down 2.1%, which was in line with the full year decline of 1.9%. 
Fourth quarter retail sales in the Europe region were down 8.9% compared to last year. The year-over-year decline was partially driven by earlier availability of new model year motorcycles in Europe, which, in effect, pulled sales up into the third quarter and drove a retail sales increase of 11.4% in the third quarter. 
Through November, our market share in Europe increased 0.6 percentage points to 12.7%, which moved up into the second place in market share for the Europe region. Asia-Pacific region was up 3.4%, driven by incremental sales in our expansion markets including India. All other international region results are noted on the slide. For the full year, worldwide retail sales were down 8.5% compared to 2009.
On Slide 11, you will see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the quarter were within the expected range of 41,000 to 46,000 units. Shipments for the quarter were up significantly compared to last year when we slowed production during the fourth quarter. 
Sportster, as a percent of total shipments, was 18.3% in the quarter, 5.4 percentage points higher than last year's fourth quarter when we shut down Sportster production to right-size Sportster inventory in the dealer network. In 2010, international shipments were up as we continue to focus on growth in international markets. As a result of reduced full year shipments and stronger-than-expected fourth quarter retail sales, U.S. dealer networks' year-end inventory was down 11,800 units compared to last year, which you'll see on Slide 12. This is the lowest level of dealer inventory in many years. 
During the fourth quarter, retail inventory dipped below what we believe is an appropriate level, and we expect that a portion of dealer inventory will be replenished as we continue to aggressively manage supply in line with demand. The dealer network has also been collectively managing the businesses through the downturn. For example, many dealers have enhanced their revenue by increasing used bike sales. Used bike sales in the dealer network were up double digits through November. Despite dealer efforts to improve revenue and manage cost, the profitability has been impacted in the downturn. Still, we believe the U.S. dealer network in aggregate remains profitable. In the U.S., 36 dealer points closed in 2010. This contraction was expected and in line with our desire to modestly consolidate our U.S. dealer network in response to lower overall volume since the economic downturn took hold.
On Slide 13, you will see revenue for the Motorcycles and Related Products segment was up significantly for the fourth quarter and down slightly for the full year compared to last year. During the quarter, average revenue for Harley-Davidson units sold increased $326 from the prior year as a result of favorable product mix, lower year-over-year sales incentives and foreign currency exchange.
Turning to restructuring on Slide 14. For the last two years, we have been intensely focused on improving our cost structure and transforming the business to be stronger and more profitable in the future. During the fourth quarter, we incurred $18 million in restructuring expenses and $164 million for the full year, which was lower than anticipated. We have adjusted our projected restructuring cost to reflect the lead time [ph], defined timing in 2011 and reduced our total expected program cost due to favorability to date. We now expect cost in 2011 to be between $85 million and $95 million. But total expected costs associated with our restructuring had been reduced $10 million to $25 million, and we now expect to be at $495 million to $510 million. 
As of the end of the year, we realized $172 million in annual ongoing savings, which is more than anticipated for the year. We are very proud of the organization's focus on and execution of the highly critical restructuring initiatives. We continue to expect total ongoing annual savings of between $290 million and $310 million upon completion of restructuring activities.
On Slide 15, you will see gross margin in the quarter was 29.6%, 9.3 percentage points above the same quarter last year. This was primarily driven by four things. First, the absence of Buell exit costs that were incurred in the fourth quarter of 2009. Second, a richer mix of products. Despite a higher percentage of Sportsters, the product mix overall was rich, driven by strong Touring and CVO sales and a high rate for the power pack and ABS options. Third, foreign currency exchange was favorable. And fourth, manufacturing was favorably impacted by strong productivity, incremental margin on higher volumes partially offset by temporary inefficiencies associated with the transition of non-core operations out of York. 
For the full year, gross margin was 34.2%, which was up nearly two percentage points compared to the prior year and exceeded our full year guidance range of 32.5% to 34%. We are pleased with the gross margin strength of the core business in 2010 despite motorcycle shipment declines of 5.6% from 2009.
On Slide 16, operating margin as percent of revenue for the fourth quarter was negative 0.7% versus negative 29% in 2009. Operating margin was favorably impacted by increased gross margin and lower year-over-year restructuring costs. SG&A in the quarter was largely flat to 2009 and was adversely impacted by charges associated with the efforts to expand our presence and network of dealers in Brazil; the accruals for employee short-term incentive pay or STIP, which did not occur last year; and the continued execution of our growth strategy. Largely offsetting these costs was the fact that last year's fourth quarter was negatively impacted by approximately $19 million of warranty and recall charges that did not repeat in 2010.
For the full year, SG&A increased $34 million from 2009, largely a result of the charges associated with Brazil, STIP and future investment and growth. Higher SG&A on a full year basis coupled with lower revenues resulted in an increase of SG&A as a percent of revenue from 19.9% to 21.2%. As we look forward, we will aggressively manage our expenses while continuing to prudently invest in our growth opportunities. And as we have previously stated, we expect the SG&A to decline as a percent of revenue between 2009 and 2014. 
Now moving on to our Financial Services segment on Slide 17. In the fourth quarter, HDFS posted a $43.5 million operating profit, an improvement of $51 million compared to last year. The key drivers of the fourth quarter 2010 results were net interest income, which was favorable by $48.7 million compared to last year as a result of the increase in on-balance sheet receivables and an improvement in the net interest spread as the costs to fund the HDFS increased, which included the impact of transferring higher interest rate debt from HDFS to H-D Inc. in 2009. Next, the provision for retail credit losses, which is associated with all on-balance sheet retail receivables, decreased by $12.7 million, primarily due to improved credit loss rates as the result of favorable retail receivable performance. 
Next, the impact of the provision for wholesale receivables was unfavorable by $5.5 million during the quarter compared to last year as we worked out of certain dealer credit situations. For the full year, however, the provision for wholesale credit losses were favorable by $7.9 million. And finally, operating expenses were up in the quarter and full year by approximately $7 million. On a full year basis, the operating expense increase was driven by the restoration of HDFS and short-term incentive compensation as there was none earned in 2009.
On a full year basis, HDFS posted an operating profit of $182 million, an increase of $300 million compared to last year. And we're very pleased with the improvements in HDFS's business, which have benefited from lower cost of funds, significantly reduced credit loss rates and the fact that HDFS recorded $101 million of onetime items last year. 
Now, Larry will provide more detail on HDFS's operations. Larry?"

During the fourth quarter, HDFS originated $306 million in retail motorcycles levels, up 7.7% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to higher used motorcycle loan originations. For the full year, HDFS originated $1.8 billion in retail motorcycle loans, down 7.9% compared to last year, primarily due to lower retail sales of new motorcycles in the U.S. For the full year, 80% to 85% of our new loan originations were prime compared to our historical experience of approximately 75% prior to significant underwriting adjustments that were made in January of 2009. At year-end, over 50% of the total portfolio was comprised of loans originated post underwriting changes. HDFS's retail market share of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles sold in the U.S. was 47.9% for the full year of 2010, down approximately 1% compared to last year. 
Regarding competition, we continue to see increased activity particularly in the primary customer segment. At the end of the fourth quarter, of the approximately $6.2 billion of net finance receivables, $5.4 billion were retail and $814 million were wholesale.
Now moving on to delinquencies and losses on Slide 19. We continue to see good credit performance on loans originated after the underwriting adjustments were made in 2009. The 30-day delinquency rate for managed retail motorcycle loans at December 31, 2010, was 5.07%, an improvement of 144 basis points compared to last year. Annual retail credit losses improved by 75 basis points to 2.11% for 2010, driven by lower frequency of loss, the impact of changes in underwriting and improvements in the recovery values of repossessed motorcycles. We are pleased with the progress at HDFS in 2010. 
During the year, we maintained a strong liquidity position, reduced our cost of funds and returned to profitability. We remained focused on enabling retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles while providing an appropriate return to Harley-Davidson Inc. And I'm also pleased to report that last week, HDFS paid $125 million dividend to Harley-Davidson Inc.
So in conclusion, we are encouraged by the forward momentum in HDFS, and I believe our employees have done a fantastic job managing the business in a difficult environment. So we remain cautious, given the continuing economic challenges with unemployment at over 9%, and as our book of loans declines as a result of lower wholesale shipments and retail sales in North America over the last couple of years. 
Now let me turn it back to John."
277444,117444739,95091,"Harley-Davidson, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2011",2011-01-25,"Earnings Calls","Harley-Davidson, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry. We are pleased that HDFS returned to profitability in 2010 and continue to provide credit for our Harley-Davidson dealers and riders while delivering appropriate returns and profitability. Now let's take a look at cash and liquidity on Sl",934,"Thanks, Larry. We are pleased that HDFS returned to profitability in 2010 and continue to provide credit for our Harley-Davidson dealers and riders while delivering appropriate returns and profitability. 
Now let's take a look at cash and liquidity on Slide 20. During the quarter, we utilized $381 million of cash on hand to repurchase nearly half of the unsecured notes that were issued at 15% in February 2009. You'll see that at the end of the quarter, we had $1.16 billion of cash and marketable securities, which includes the impact of a $600 million asset-backed securitization transaction that HDFS completed during the quarter. In addition, HDFS had approximately $1.16 billion of available liquidity to bank credit and conduit facilities. 
Earlier this month, there were two transactions related to cash. First, we made a $200 million contribution to our qualified pension plans, which will reduce our year-end pension and post-retirement liability of $537 million. And second, as Larry mentioned, HDFS paid a dividend of $125 million to H-D Inc. This is the first time HDFS has returned capital to H-D Inc., which is reflective of HDFS's reduced capital needs based on lower finance receivable balances. HDFS remains focused on delivering an appropriate return on equity and prudently managing its debt-to-equity ratio. 
Our overall cash strategy continues to require maintaining a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and/or committed credit facilities. Now I'll review the remaining Harley-Davidson Inc. financials on Slide 21. I'd like to highlight a few items on this slide. 
First, with regards to continuing operations, the company generated operating cash of $1.16 billion during 2010, and the Motorcycle business continued to generate strong cash flows. Of the total, the Motorcycles and Related Products segments generated $622 million of operating cash. And second, for the full year, our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 33.5% compared to 60.5% in 2009. The 2009 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by a one-time tax charge related to Wisconsin tax law change and a nondeductible goodwill charge, as well as the impact of reduced earnings. The 2010 tax rate was favorably impacted by the settlement of an IRS audit and an increase in the tax benefit related to domestic manufacturing offset by tax impact of federal healthcare legislation. In 2011, we expect the full year effective income tax rate will be approximately 35%. In terms of discontinued operations, as most of you know, we concluded the sale of MV Agusta in 2010. During the year, losses on discontinued operations, net of taxes, totaled $113.1 million.
In summary, the full year 2010 results are on Slide 22. While the global economy continued to struggle, we had net income of $259.7 million from continuing operations in 2010, which was up significantly from the prior year. Earnings were impacted by improved operating margins for the Motorcycles and Related Products segment and strong HDFS operating income, partially offset by a one-time charge on the repurchase of $297 million of debt.
We are pleased with the progress of our restructuring of the company and we are encouraged by the moderation in the rate of retail sales decline from the third to fourth quarter of 2010, as well as the strength of our brand as evidenced by our increasing share in many of our markets. We are also optimistic about the long term as we execute against our strategies to transform and grow our business. We do, however, remain cautious as we transition into 2011, and we'll continue to take a prudent approach as we manage the business throughout the year. 
On Slide 23, you will see that for 2011, we expect Harley-Davidson motorcycle shipments to be between 221,000 and 228,000 units, up 5% to 8% from 2010. During 2011, we will continue to aggressively manage shipments in line with retail demand. In 2011, we plan to ship [indiscernible] motorcycles to dealers, and we expect [indiscernible] retail, primarily in response to a stronger-than-expected fourth quarter 2010 retail sales which resulted in the aggregate U.S. dealer inventory level dipping below what we view as an appropriate level. We expect 2011 gross margin to be between 34% and 35% for the full year, and we'll continue to carefully manage capital expenditures. In 2011, we expect full year capital expenditures to be between $210 million and $230 million, which includes between $60 million and $75 million of capital related to restructuring.
As we look back on 2010, we're pleased to see progress on many fronts. We increased our focus on Harley-Davidson brand as we exited Buell and MV Agusta. We made great strides toward becoming best in class in manufacturing and product development by moving to a common operating system, focusing on core competencies, negotiating a transformational labor agreement with the Wisconsin unions, reducing our time to market for new products and driving a continuous improvement mindset across the company. We focused on our international business by entering new markets such as India and positioning ourselves to add more dealerships in markets such as Brazil. We also returned HDFS back to profitability. And finally, we improved our financial strength by increasing operating margins, reducing debt, increasing returns on invested capital and by continuing to deliver strong cash flows. We believe by prudently managing the company and remaining disciplined in the execution of our future growth strategy, we will continue to make progress along our journey to growth. We are focused on delivering strong margins, strong returns and value our shareholders. Thank you for your continued confidence and investment at Harley-Davidson.

I'm just wondering first of all, can you maybe elaborate on why the margin guidance is in the 34% to 35% range? What are some of the headwinds? And then also, how should we be thinking about operating expenses going forward? On Slide 16, you showed kind of a $3.8 million drag from higher SG&A in the quarter and $34 million for the year.

Out of the four quarters, we improved gross margin for three of them. I think the first quarter was down about 0.5%, and then obviously, the fourth quarter was very strong largely because we lapped the Buell exit costs of a year ago. As we look forward, Rod, our guidance is that we expect gross margin will fall between 34% and 35% of revenue. As we look at that versus 2010, we believe that the gross margin will benefit from continued productivity and restructuring savings. And again, the restructuring that we provide, I think the midpoints were somewhere in the neighborhood of $50 million that will hit cost of goods sold. We also think that we'll benefit from incremental margin from the higher production volumes behind our shipping guidance of being up 5% to 8%. And then expect a very modest mix favorability. So to your question as to the headwinds, is there are some, we expect them to be partially offset by foreign currency exchange, temporary inefficiencies at our York facility as we continue to outsource non-core parts and as we cut over our assembly operations to new line later in the fall.

As you saw in this morning's press release, Harley-Davidson made great progress in 2010 on restructuring our company to take advantage of the opportunities that we believe",586,"Thank you, Amy, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call. As you saw in this morning's press release, Harley-Davidson made great progress in 2010 on restructuring our company to take advantage of the opportunities that we believe lie ahead. 
First, let me say just how much our entire leadership team appreciate all the extraordinary work by our employees to achieve these results and make this transformation possible. We dealt with a lot of change in a short amount of time, and our employees have truly done a great job. I'd also like to thank our dealers for all their hard work to bring a great Harley-Davidson experience to customers in what has continued to be a challenging business environment.
Let's take a quick look at where we are, what we've achieved and where we're going. Through our strategy to deliver results through Focus, which we rolled out in late 2009, we've been restructuring the business and focusing our investments in ways that will strengthen the Harley-Davidson brand, lower our cost structure, foster continuous improvement and promote growth in the U.S. as well as globally. And while we feel good about all that we've achieved, we know it's crucial for us to stay fully on the throttle here.  
 
In 2011, we will continue the important work of transforming our manufacturing operations, our product development capabilities to be more lean and world-class, and these initiatives are key when it comes to our ability to bring new innovative products to the market in a more timely manner and to grow. 
In manufacturing, the transformational new labor agreements and structural changes in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin will, when completed, provide the seasonal flexibility, model mix flexibility and efficiency improvements that we expect will allow us to be more responsive to market demand and deliver greater returns. This week, we will begin labor negotiations in Kansas City to address these same issues of competitiveness, flexibility and efficiency. Now our overall goal is to having world-class, team-based, lean operating structure across all our production operations with continuous improvement and standardized processes at the center of everything we do.
Turning to product development. Our new products are hitting the mark. For example, more than 2/3 of the SuperLow sales are to customers new to Harley-Davidson, and we believe the new Blackline motorcycle, unveiled last weekend, will further bolster our market penetration among young adults, where we already hold the number one share position.
Our transformation in product development is focused on improvement in two key areas. One is to reduce the time it takes to run new products to market through lean engineering methodologies, and the second is to increase our development capacity to simultaneously handle more product development initiatives through best-in-class planning systems. Now here, too, we've laid a lot of ground work and are well on our way. Over the coming years, we will begin to see the fruits of these efforts. 
So in summary, 2010 was a very busy year for us, and I'm extremely proud of all our accomplishments. As we look forward, all these changes will allow us to be more customer-led in everything that we do. For 2011, we continue to have a measured outlook, while at the same time, we're encouraged by indications of a strengthening economy, and we anticipate further improvement in our performance. 
So I'll be back later in the call for questions. Now I'd like to turn it over to John Olin, who will walk us through the numbers."
277444,117444739,95230,"Harley-Davidson, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2011",2011-01-25,"Earnings Calls","Harley-Davidson, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. I'll review the financial results starting on Slide 9. We'll start with the fourth quarter results.

I'll review the financial results starting on Slide 9. We'll start with the fourth quarter results. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson Motorcycles and Related Products revenue was up 20%, behind a 23.8% increase in shipment of Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Our financial performance included significantly improved gross margin as we lap last year's fourth quarter, which included Buell exit costs. 
In addition, restructuring spending was over $100 million lower in the fourth quarter of this year compared to last year. Despite the improved performance in the fourth quarter from the Motorcycles and Related Products segment and another very strong quarter from HDFS [Harley-Davidson Financial Services], we recorded a loss of $42.1 million for the quarter. The results were impacted by a onetime charge of $85 million and a repurchase of $297 million of high-interest debt that we issued in February of 2009. As compared to prior year, our fourth quarter income from continuing operations improved by $105.1 million.
Moving on to retail sales on Slide 10. Worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were down modestly in the fourth quarter. We were encouraged by the fact that the quarterly retail sales decline moderated from prior quarters. However, we remain cautious as we move into 2011, given the fragile global economic recovery, which is characterized by high unemployment, low consumer confidence and depressed home values. 
In the U.S., retail sales in the quarter were stronger than expected, down only 0.2%. For the full year, U.S. retail sales were down 11.7%, however, our full year market share strengthened by 1.6 percentage points to 54.9%. In the international markets, retail sales for the quarter were down 2.1%, which was in line with the full year decline of 1.9%. 
Fourth quarter retail sales in the Europe region were down 8.9% compared to last year. The year-over-year decline was partially driven by earlier availability of new model year motorcycles in Europe, which, in effect, pulled sales up into the third quarter and drove a retail sales increase of 11.4% in the third quarter. 
Through November, our market share in Europe increased 0.6 percentage points to 12.7%, which moved up into the second place in market share for the Europe region. Asia-Pacific region was up 3.4%, driven by incremental sales in our expansion markets including India. All other international region results are noted on the slide. For the full year, worldwide retail sales were down 8.5% compared to 2009.
On Slide 11, you will see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the quarter were within the expected range of 41,000 to 46,000 units. Shipments for the quarter were up significantly compared to last year when we slowed production during the fourth quarter. 
Sportster, as a percent of total shipments, was 18.3% in the quarter, 5.4 percentage points higher than last year's fourth quarter when we shut down Sportster production to right-size Sportster inventory in the dealer network. In 2010, international shipments were up as we continue to focus on growth in international markets. As a result of reduced full year shipments and stronger-than-expected fourth quarter retail sales, U.S. dealer networks' year-end inventory was down 11,800 units compared to last year, which you'll see on Slide 12. This is the lowest level of dealer inventory in many years. 
During the fourth quarter, retail inventory dipped below what we believe is an appropriate level, and we expect that a portion of dealer inventory will be replenished as we continue to aggressively manage supply in line with demand. The dealer network has also been collectively managing the businesses through the downturn. For example, many dealers have enhanced their revenue by increasing used bike sales. Used bike sales in the dealer network were up double digits through November. Despite dealer efforts to improve revenue and manage cost, the profitability has been impacted in the downturn. Still, we believe the U.S. dealer network in aggregate remains profitable. In the U.S., 36 dealer points closed in 2010. This contraction was expected and in line with our desire to modestly consolidate our U.S. dealer network in response to lower overall volume since the economic downturn took hold.
On Slide 13, you will see revenue for the Motorcycles and Related Products segment was up significantly for the fourth quarter and down slightly for the full year compared to last year. During the quarter, average revenue for Harley-Davidson units sold increased $326 from the prior year as a result of favorable product mix, lower year-over-year sales incentives and foreign currency exchange.
Turning to restructuring on Slide 14. For the last two years, we have been intensely focused on improving our cost structure and transforming the business to be stronger and more profitable in the future. During the fourth quarter, we incurred $18 million in restructuring expenses and $164 million for the full year, which was lower than anticipated. We have adjusted our projected restructuring cost to reflect the lead time [ph], defined timing in 2011 and reduced our total expected program cost due to favorability to date. We now expect cost in 2011 to be between $85 million and $95 million. But total expected costs associated with our restructuring had been reduced $10 million to $25 million, and we now expect to be at $495 million to $510 million. 
As of the end of the year, we realized $172 million in annual ongoing savings, which is more than anticipated for the year. We are very proud of the organization's focus on and execution of the highly critical restructuring initiatives. We continue to expect total ongoing annual savings of between $290 million and $310 million upon completion of restructuring activities.
On Slide 15, you will see gross margin in the quarter was 29.6%, 9.3 percentage points above the same quarter last year. This was primarily driven by four things. First, the absence of Buell exit costs that were incurred in the fourth quarter of 2009. Second, a richer mix of products. Despite a higher percentage of Sportsters, the product mix overall was rich, driven by strong Touring and CVO sales and a high rate for the power pack and ABS options. Third, foreign currency exchange was favorable. And fourth, manufacturing was favorably impacted by strong productivity, incremental margin on higher volumes partially offset by temporary inefficiencies associated with the transition of non-core operations out of York. 
For the full year, gross margin was 34.2%, which was up nearly two percentage points compared to the prior year and exceeded our full year guidance range of 32.5% to 34%. We are pleased with the gross margin strength of the core business in 2010 despite motorcycle shipment declines of 5.6% from 2009.
On Slide 16, operating margin as percent of revenue for the fourth quarter was negative 0.7% versus negative 29% in 2009. Operating margin was favorably impacted by increased gross margin and lower year-over-year restructuring costs. SG&A in the quarter was largely flat to 2009 and was adversely impacted by charges associated with the efforts to expand our presence and network of dealers in Brazil; the accruals for employee short-term incentive pay or STIP, which did not occur last year; and the continued execution of our growth strategy. Largely offsetting these costs was the fact that last year's fourth quarter was negatively impacted by approximately $19 million of warranty and recall charges that did not repeat in 2010.
For the full year, SG&A increased $34 million from 2009, largely a result of the charges associated with Brazil, STIP and future investment and growth. Higher SG&A on a full year basis coupled with lower revenues resulted in an increase of SG&A as a percent of revenue from 19.9% to 21.2%. As we look forward, we will aggressively manage our expenses while continuing to prudently invest in our growth opportunities. And as we have previously stated, we expect the SG&A to decline as a percent of revenue between 2009 and 2014. 
Now moving on to our Financial Services segment on Slide 17. In the fourth quarter, HDFS posted a $43.5 million operating profit, an improvement of $51 million compared to last year. The key drivers of the fourth quarter 2010 results were net interest income, which was favorable by $48.7 million compared to last year as a result of the increase in on-balance sheet receivables and an improvement in the net interest spread as the costs to fund the HDFS increased, which included the impact of transferring higher interest rate debt from HDFS to H-D Inc. in 2009. Next, the provision for retail credit losses, which is associated with all on-balance sheet retail receivables, decreased by $12.7 million, primarily due to improved credit loss rates as the result of favorable retail receivable performance. 
Next, the impact of the provision for wholesale receivables was unfavorable by $5.5 million during the quarter compared to last year as we worked out of certain dealer credit situations. For the full year, however, the provision for wholesale credit losses were favorable by $7.9 million. And finally, operating expenses were up in the quarter and full year by approximately $7 million. On a full year basis, the operating expense increase was driven by the restoration of HDFS and short-term incentive compensation as there was none earned in 2009.
On a full year basis, HDFS posted an operating profit of $182 million, an increase of $300 million compared to last year. And we're very pleased with the improvements in HDFS's business, which have benefited from lower cost of funds, significantly reduced credit loss rates and the fact that HDFS recorded $101 million of onetime items last year. 
Now, Larry will provide more detail on HDFS's operations. Larry?"

During the fourth quarter, HDFS originated $306 million in retail motorcycles levels, up 7.7% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to higher used motorcycle loan originations. For the full year, HDFS originated $1.8 billion in retail motorcycle loans, down 7.9% compared to last year, primarily due to lower retail sales of new motorcycles in the U.S. For the full year, 80% to 85% of our new loan originations were prime compared to our historical experience of approximately 75% prior to significant underwriting adjustments that were made in January of 2009. At year-end, over 50% of the total portfolio was comprised of loans originated post underwriting changes. HDFS's retail market share of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles sold in the U.S. was 47.9% for the full year of 2010, down approximately 1% compared to last year. 
Regarding competition, we continue to see increased activity particularly in the primary customer segment. At the end of the fourth quarter, of the approximately $6.2 billion of net finance receivables, $5.4 billion were retail and $814 million were wholesale.
Now moving on to delinquencies and losses on Slide 19. We continue to see good credit performance on loans originated after the underwriting adjustments were made in 2009. The 30-day delinquency rate for managed retail motorcycle loans at December 31, 2010, was 5.07%, an improvement of 144 basis points compared to last year. Annual retail credit losses improved by 75 basis points to 2.11% for 2010, driven by lower frequency of loss, the impact of changes in underwriting and improvements in the recovery values of repossessed motorcycles. We are pleased with the progress at HDFS in 2010. 
During the year, we maintained a strong liquidity position, reduced our cost of funds and returned to profitability. We remained focused on enabling retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles while providing an appropriate return to Harley-Davidson Inc. And I'm also pleased to report that last week, HDFS paid $125 million dividend to Harley-Davidson Inc.
So in conclusion, we are encouraged by the forward momentum in HDFS, and I believe our employees have done a fantastic job managing the business in a difficult environment. So we remain cautious, given the continuing economic challenges with unemployment at over 9%, and as our book of loans declines as a result of lower wholesale shipments and retail sales in North America over the last couple of years. 
Now let me turn it back to John."

We are pleased that HDFS returned to profitability in 2010 and continue to provide credit for our Harley-Davidson dealers and riders while delivering appropriate returns and profitability. Now let's take a look at cash and liquidity on Sl",934,"Thanks, Larry. We are pleased that HDFS returned to profitability in 2010 and continue to provide credit for our Harley-Davidson dealers and riders while delivering appropriate returns and profitability. 
Now let's take a look at cash and liquidity on Slide 20. During the quarter, we utilized $381 million of cash on hand to repurchase nearly half of the unsecured notes that were issued at 15% in February 2009. You'll see that at the end of the quarter, we had $1.16 billion of cash and marketable securities, which includes the impact of a $600 million asset-backed securitization transaction that HDFS completed during the quarter. In addition, HDFS had approximately $1.16 billion of available liquidity to bank credit and conduit facilities. 
Earlier this month, there were two transactions related to cash. First, we made a $200 million contribution to our qualified pension plans, which will reduce our year-end pension and post-retirement liability of $537 million. And second, as Larry mentioned, HDFS paid a dividend of $125 million to H-D Inc. This is the first time HDFS has returned capital to H-D Inc., which is reflective of HDFS's reduced capital needs based on lower finance receivable balances. HDFS remains focused on delivering an appropriate return on equity and prudently managing its debt-to-equity ratio. 
Our overall cash strategy continues to require maintaining a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and/or committed credit facilities. Now I'll review the remaining Harley-Davidson Inc. financials on Slide 21. I'd like to highlight a few items on this slide. 
First, with regards to continuing operations, the company generated operating cash of $1.16 billion during 2010, and the Motorcycle business continued to generate strong cash flows. Of the total, the Motorcycles and Related Products segments generated $622 million of operating cash. And second, for the full year, our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 33.5% compared to 60.5% in 2009. The 2009 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by a one-time tax charge related to Wisconsin tax law change and a nondeductible goodwill charge, as well as the impact of reduced earnings. The 2010 tax rate was favorably impacted by the settlement of an IRS audit and an increase in the tax benefit related to domestic manufacturing offset by tax impact of federal healthcare legislation. In 2011, we expect the full year effective income tax rate will be approximately 35%. In terms of discontinued operations, as most of you know, we concluded the sale of MV Agusta in 2010. During the year, losses on discontinued operations, net of taxes, totaled $113.1 million.
In summary, the full year 2010 results are on Slide 22. While the global economy continued to struggle, we had net income of $259.7 million from continuing operations in 2010, which was up significantly from the prior year. Earnings were impacted by improved operating margins for the Motorcycles and Related Products segment and strong HDFS operating income, partially offset by a one-time charge on the repurchase of $297 million of debt.
We are pleased with the progress of our restructuring of the company and we are encouraged by the moderation in the rate of retail sales decline from the third to fourth quarter of 2010, as well as the strength of our brand as evidenced by our increasing share in many of our markets. We are also optimistic about the long term as we execute against our strategies to transform and grow our business. We do, however, remain cautious as we transition into 2011, and we'll continue to take a prudent approach as we manage the business throughout the year. 
On Slide 23, you will see that for 2011, we expect Harley-Davidson motorcycle shipments to be between 221,000 and 228,000 units, up 5% to 8% from 2010. During 2011, we will continue to aggressively manage shipments in line with retail demand. In 2011, we plan to ship [indiscernible] motorcycles to dealers, and we expect [indiscernible] retail, primarily in response to a stronger-than-expected fourth quarter 2010 retail sales which resulted in the aggregate U.S. dealer inventory level dipping below what we view as an appropriate level. We expect 2011 gross margin to be between 34% and 35% for the full year, and we'll continue to carefully manage capital expenditures. In 2011, we expect full year capital expenditures to be between $210 million and $230 million, which includes between $60 million and $75 million of capital related to restructuring.
As we look back on 2010, we're pleased to see progress on many fronts. We increased our focus on Harley-Davidson brand as we exited Buell and MV Agusta. We made great strides toward becoming best in class in manufacturing and product development by moving to a common operating system, focusing on core competencies, negotiating a transformational labor agreement with the Wisconsin unions, reducing our time to market for new products and driving a continuous improvement mindset across the company. We focused on our international business by entering new markets such as India and positioning ourselves to add more dealerships in markets such as Brazil. We also returned HDFS back to profitability. And finally, we improved our financial strength by increasing operating margins, reducing debt, increasing returns on invested capital and by continuing to deliver strong cash flows. We believe by prudently managing the company and remaining disciplined in the execution of our future growth strategy, we will continue to make progress along our journey to growth. We are focused on delivering strong margins, strong returns and value our shareholders. Thank you for your continued confidence and investment at Harley-Davidson.

The other question that you asked, Ed, is are we making progress against our strategy to improve used bike pricing through holding inventories or managing inventories very much aligned with demand.

Your gross margin in 2010 was a little bit over 34%. You're talking about higher production volume, and it should be about 100 basis points of cost savings, based on your table, hitting the gross margin line. I'm just wondering first of all, can you maybe elaborate on why the margin guidance is in the 34% to 35% range? What are some of the headwinds? And then also, how should we be thinking about operating expenses going forward? On Slide 16, you showed kind of a $3.8 million drag from higher SG&A in the quarter and $34 million for the year. That's 64% of your savings, so far, than in the SG&A. How should we think about the SG&A level as we proceed net of some of the investments you're making?"

Out of the four quarters, we improved gross margin for three of them. I think the first quarter was down about 0.5%, and then obviously, the fourth quarter was very strong largely because we lapped the Buell exit costs of a year ago. As we look forward, Rod, our guidance is that we expect gross margin will fall between 34% and 35% of revenue. As we look at that versus 2010, we believe that the gross margin will benefit from continued productivity and restructuring savings. And again, the restructuring that we provide, I think the midpoints were somewhere in the neighborhood of $50 million that will hit cost of goods sold. We also think that we'll benefit from incremental margin from the higher production volumes behind our shipping guidance of being up 5% to 8%. And then expect a very modest mix favorability. So to your question as to the headwinds, is there are some, we expect them to be partially offset by foreign currency exchange, temporary inefficiencies at our York facility as we continue to outsource non-core parts and as we cut over our assembly operations to new line later in the fall. And then finally, we're expecting higher raw material cost."

Does it indicate that maybe there's further room go in terms of the loss rates and incremental income at HDFS?

It's been nearly two years since I joined Harley-Davidson as CEO. And in that time, through the hard work and dedication of all of our employees, we've undertaken one of the biggest transformations in the company's history from a foundation as one of the most iconic brands in the world, we are transforming Harley-Davidson to be linger, more agile and more effective than ever at delivering great products and experiences to an increasing the global community of customers. We are making great progress, and today, we reported further evidence of this renewal with earnings per share up more than 75% from the year-ago period and worldwide retail new motorcycle sales turning positive, up 3.5%. Dealer new retail motorcycle sales in international markets grew more than 11% during the quarter, with Europe in particular, showing strength and U.S. was nearly level with year-ago. While it's good to see this overall retail improvement, we have said all along that we would have a cautious outlook for the year, particularly in the United States.
We now have the market share data for new on-road motorcycle sales for 2010 and again, Harley-Davidson was the number one seller in the U.S. to young adults, ages 18 to 34. In fact, we increased our market share among these customers to more than 30%. And just to be clear, that's in sales to young adults across all sizes of on-road motorcycles. In just the heavyweight category, we had nearly half of all young adults sales last year. The story is similar for on-road, new motorcycle sales among other demographic groups as well. We increased our market share among U.S. women, selling more than half of all new motorcycles sold to this riders. Our dealers sold nearly half of all the new motorcycles sold to Hispanic customers, and we increased our market share across all CCs among African-Americans to nearly 43%. We are pleased to see these results, which reflect the impact of our multi-generational and multicultural strategy.
Regarding our financial performance. In the first quarter, we saw earnings improvements at HDFS [Harley-Davidson Financial Services]. The team at HDFS has done an outstanding job of managing that business. On the Motorcycle side of the business, we announced this morning that we could see a modest effect on shipments this year as a result of a subcomponent suppliers issue related to last month's earthquake in Japan. First, our hearts go out to the people in Japan in the aftermath of the tragic events there. And I just want to recognize all the members of the Harley-Davidson family in Japan where our employees and dealers are truly doing a remarkable job under a very difficult circumstances. 
Relative to our production operations, the transformation that's underway continues to move full speed ahead, and we expect to yield outstanding dividends over the long haul, not only in terms of financial returns but also in our ability to be much more customer lead in our production capabilities. Here too, our employees are doing some monumental work. However, it's important to remember that we expect short-term inefficiencies as we make the transition at York.
In the first quarter, we reached another milestone in the transformation of our motorcycle operations with the ratification of the new labor agreement at Arkansas City plant, which follows the ratification of new agreements in Wisconsin last fall. We are now through the cycle of contract negotiations. Working with our union leadership, we now have seven-year agreements in place in all of our facilities. And now, it's all hands on deck in implementing the changes that will lead us to the future by being more flexible and customer led.
While we in the midst of a lot of change, our employees are excited and energized because our through strategy, we are taking one of the world's greatest iconic brands to the many roads of the world. We are ensuring like never before that we're customer lead in all we do, making customers dreams a reality by delivering remarkable products and extraordinary experiences. And we are transforming the business in ways that preserve Harley-Davidson's great heritage, even as we explore new ways to grow the reach of our brand globally.
While there are very many challenges ahead, these are exciting times for our company, and we are pleased with our progress. So in closing I want to thank all of our employees, dealers and suppliers for their outstanding efforts to move Harley-Davidson forward. I continue to be impressed with their dedication and commitment. I'll be back later for questions. So let me turn it over to John for details on the quarter."

I'll review the financial results starting on Slide 10 with the first quarter results. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson Inc. consolidated revenue was up 1.5% behind the 0.3% increase in shipments of Harley-Dav",1512,"Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. I'll review the financial results starting on Slide 10 with the first quarter results. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson Inc. consolidated revenue was up 1.5% behind the 0.3% increase in shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Our first quarter income from continuing operations improved to $119.3 million, an increase of 73.5%. Similarly, diluted earnings per share rose to $0.51 per share, up from the year-ago quarter, which was $0.29 per share. Our improved financial performance for the quarter was driven by strong operating income at HDFS and lower year-over-year interest expense as a result of last December's repurchase of $297 million of high interest notes and a lower effective tax rate than last year's first quarter. Operating income from the Motorcycle business was flat to last year's first quarter as lower gross margin, largely impacted by the inefficiencies at York, was offset by lower spending and our ongoing restructuring activities.
We are pleased with the quarter's results and our continued progress against our growth strategies and transformation of our business.
Moving on to retail sales on Slide 11, worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were up 3.5% in the first quarter, driven by strength of international sales, which were up 11.3% in the quarter compared to last year. In the U.S., retail sales in the quarter were down 0.5%, and market share was 53.4%, down 1.9 percentage points from year ago, and down slightly from the historical high we reached at the end of last year. 
I would like to recognize the continued efforts and progress of our U.S. dealers despite the impact of challenging macroeconomic conditions, which include persistently high unemployment, falling home values and low consumer confidence. The U.S. dealer network is facing fierce price competition from deep competitive discounting and from strong values on used Harley-Davidson motorcycles.
Strength in the international markets was primarily driven by Europe region, which was up 22.7% compared to last year. The year-over-year improvement was consistent with most countries in our Europe region and was aided by improved product availability compared to the first quarter of 2010, especially with respect to Sportster motorcycles, which was impacted by the shutdown of Arkansas City plant in the fourth quarter of 2009. Canada sales were also up 7.5% in the quarter. The Asia-Pacific region was down 3.9%, driven primarily by the impact of the retail sales related to the natural disaster in Japan and severe flooding in Australia. And the Latin America region was down 5.4% as we closed at the previously existing dealer network in Brazil and started the process of appointing new dealers. This was planned as part of the agreement that was announced in December 2010 to terminate the exclusive dealer contract that was in place and allows us to expand our presence in Brazil.
On Slide 12, you will see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the quarter were about flat to last year and within our expected range of 51,000 to 56,000 motorcycles. First quarter shipments were not impacted by the aftermath of the earthquake in Japan. Shipment makes up touring, custom and Sportster motorcycles were all within historical ranges. 
Slide 13 summarizes a few key points about our dealer network in the U.S. As I mentioned last quarter, as a result of stronger-than-expected fourth quarter 2010 retail sales, the U.S. dealer network's 2010 year-end inventory was at the lowest level in many years and below what we believe is appropriate ongoing level. During the first quarter in the U.S., we shipped about 35,000 Harley-Davidson motorcycles, and our dealers sold roughly 32,000 at retail. While U.S. dealer inventories increased modestly over Q4 2010 levels in preparation for the spring selling season, it was down about 10,500 units compared to the first quarter of 2010. We continue to believe aggregate dealer inventory in the U.S. is below an appropriate level to keep our brand healthy and execute our growth strategy. And therefore, even with a modest chip and guidance that's just been announced today, we expect to replenish a portion of dealer inventory by year end.
We will continue to aggressively manage the supply of new bikes in line with demand while we also support the dealer's efforts to sell more used bikes. Healthy used bikes sales enhance dealer revenue, maintain resale values and narrow the gap between new and used motorcycle pricing. Used bikes sales in the U.S. dealer network were up double digits through February compared to the same period last year. When you combine strong used Harley-Davidson sales with new retail sales in the U.S., total demand for Harley-Davidson motorcycles continues to be strong.
As the economic conditions continue to be challenging, dealers continue to proactively manage their businesses, and we believe the U.S. dealer network in aggregate remains profitable.
On Slide 14, you will see revenue for the motorcycles and related products segment was up in the first quarter. During the quarter, average motorcycle revenue for Harley-Davidson units sold increased $414 from the prior year as a result of favorable mix and currency exchange. Parts and Accessories sales were up over 10% during the quarter, driven in part by a focus on product availability, high demand for our new accessory product offerings and growth in worldwide retail motorcycle sales.
General Merchandise was down 5.6% in the first quarter compared to last year, largely related to the timing of delivery of product between the first and second quarters of this year.
Turning to restructuring on Slide 15. Our efforts to improve our cost structure and transform the business to be stronger and more profitable in the future are well underway. During the first quarter, we incurred $23 million in restructuring expenses, which was about $25 million less than last year's first quarter when we incurred charges associated with the initial implementation of York's labor agreement. Our expected full-year total costs and savings associated with our restructuring activities are summarized on the slide. The summary also includes the expected cost savings and associated changes to Arkansas City operations that Keith mentioned.
On Slide 16, you'll see gross margin in the quarter was 33.1%, 3.5 percentage points lower than the same quarter last year. Gross margin for the quarter was impacted by four key drivers. First, foreign currency exchange was unfavorable by $6 million during the first quarter. Next, mix was favorable by $5.3 million despite a higher percentage mix of Sportsters versus higher margin touring and custom motorcycles. Mix was positively impacted by mix within families and by our power packed options offered at the start of the 2011 model year. While materials were unfavorable $5.7 million due to increasing metals and fuel costs. 
And finally, as expected, manufacturing costs for the first quarter were unfavorable and productivity was impacted by temporary inefficiencies at our York facility as we restructure and transform our operations at that site. As we have discussed for the past couple of quarters, the magnitude of change that is occurring in York is quite significant. That includes restraining our entire workforce in our new operating system, outsourcing nearly 2,000 non-core parts and subassemblies, moving and reconfiguring production lines, implementing a new ERP system and redefining our vehicle delivery process. The restructuring of our York facility is expected to be largely complete in the first half of next year. For the next several quarters, we continue to expect York efficiencies will be adversely impacted by restructuring activities. Also reflected in the manufacturing line on the slide are higher product costs compared to last year due to new features and content that are offered on model year 2011 motorcycles.
On Slide 17, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the first quarter was 11.8% versus 12.2% in 2010. Operating margin was negatively impacted by lower gross margin, which is largely offset by lower restructuring spending as we lap last year's first quarter, which included significant charges associated with York's new labor contract. SG&A was slightly lower during the quarter compared to the same period last year as we continue to carefully manage our expenses while we invest in our growth strategy. As we have previously stated, we expect SG&A spending will decline as a percent of revenue between 2009 and 2014.
Now moving on to our Financial Services segment on Slide 18. In the first quarter, HDFS posted a $67.9 million operating profit, an improvement of $41.2 million compared to last year. The key drivers of the first quarter results were net interest income of $12.6 million higher in the first quarter of 2011 versus the first quarter of 2010 due to widening interest rate spreads driven by lower cost of funds on a lower resealable base; the provision for retail credit losses was $28.8 million lower in the first quarter of 2011 versus first quarter 2010, primarily due to improved credit loss rates as a result of favorable receivable performance. During the quarter, HDFS reduced the total allowance for credit losses by $14 million to $159.7 million to reflect lower anticipated credit losses.
Now Larry will provide more detail on HDFS's operations. Larry?"

During the first quarter, HDFS originated $453.7 million in retail motorcycle loans, up 21.2% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to higher used Harley-Davidson motorcycle loan originations. This corresponds to the increasing number of used Harley-Davidson motorcycle sales being made by the dealer network. HDFS also increased its share of new Harley-Davidson loan originations, growing retail market share by 5.3 percentage points to 47.4% during the first quarter compared to the same period last year.
At the end of the first quarter of the approximately $6.2 billion of finance receivables, $5.2 billion were retail and $1 billion were wholesale. At the end of the quarter, over 50% of the retail portfolio was comprised of loans originated after underwriting changes were made in January 2009. Consistent with recent quarters, retail loan originations were 80% to 85% prime. The 30-day delinquency rate for managed retail motorcycle loans at the end of the first quarter was 3.68% or 89 basis points better than the same period last year, and while retail credit losses improved by 125 basis points to 1.58% in the first quarter compared to the first quarter last year. This improvement was driven by the impact of changes in underwriting, as well as lower frequency of loss and improvement in the recovery values of repossessed motorcycles.
We are pleased to the continued improvement in credit performance during the first quarter and will continue to monitor the unemployment picture, motorcycle recovery values and the pace of the recovery in the U.S. consumer environment. During the first quarter, HDFS delivered increased profits, maintained a strong liquidity position and reduced our cost of funds. We remain focused on enabling retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycle while providing an appropriate return to Harley-Davidson Inc. 
Now let me turn it back to John."

Now we'll take a look at cash and liquidity on Slide 21. As you mentioned during the Q4 conference call, HDFS paid $125 million dividend to H-D Inc. during the first quarter, reflective of HDFS's reduced capital needs on a lower receivables balance. HDFS remains focused on delivering an appropriate return on equity and prudently managing its debt-to-equity ratio.
Also during the quarter, H-D made a $200 million conservation to qualify our pension plans, which reduced our pension and postretirement liability to $354 million. You'll see at the end of the quarter, we had $1.05 billion of cash and marketable securities. In addition, HDFS had approximately $1.24 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities.
For our cash and liquidity strategy, we continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and/or committed credit facilities. 
Now I'll review the remaining Harley-Davidson Inc. financials on Slide 22.  I would like to highlight two items on the slide. First, with regards to continuing operations, the company used operating cash of $105 million during the first quarter, driven by the $200 million contribution to our pension plans. And second, our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 34.8% compared to 47.2% in 2010. The Q1 2010 tax rate was negatively impacted by a one-time tax charge of $13.3 million associated with the Federal Health Care Reform Legislation. In 2011, we continue to expect full-year effective income tax rate will be approximately 35%.
Now turning to guidance on Slide 23. Based on what we know today about the anticipated subcomponent supply issue related to the aftermath of the earthquake in Japan, we have made a modest adjustment by reducing the low end of our shipment guidance to account for the uncertainty. We now expect full-year 2011 Harley-Davidson motorcycle shipments to be between 215,000 and 228,000 units, up 2% to 8% from 2010.  During the second quarter, we expect to ship between 62,000 and 67,000 units. We are also reducing the low end of our 2011 gross margin guidance. We now expect gross margin will be between 33.5% and 35% for the full year due to incremental costs and potential unfavorable impact of mix and lost absorption associated with the expected supply chain disruption. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be between $210 million and $230 million, which includes between $60 million and $75 million of capital related to restructuring.
As we look back on the first quarter 2011, while the global economies continue to be challenged, we are happy to report our first retail sales growth since before the economic downturn took hold. We are also pleased to see strong profits at HDFS and progress with our restructuring and transformation of the Motorcycle business. We are encouraged by the progress being made in our international markets with Europe and Canada retail sales well over last year's levels, Brazil already appointing new dealers to serve our customer in that market and in Asia where we're humbled by the resilience and courage of our employees and our dealers as they manage in the wake of tragedy. And as I mentioned earlier, we continue to be pleased by the efforts of our U.S. dealers as they face challenges. Overall, we're excited about the long-term as we execute our strategy to transform and grow our business. We will continue to manage the business prudently and have adjusted guidance as we navigate through the uncertainties that 2011 might bring. We'll also remain disciplined in the execution of our growth strategy throughout the year. The supply chain issues for Japan is certainly a bump in the road, but the fundamentals of our business are strong, and we won't be deterred as we make progress along our journey to grow and we remain focused on delivering strong margins, strong returns and value to our shareholders.

The inefficiencies of York during the quarter will -- let's take a step back. Let's look at overall gross margin, let's get back at what we discussed last quarter when we issued initial gross margin guidance of 34% to 35%. So we said several things that happen. First three things that would positively affect gross margin. First was a gross margin would benefit from continued productivity and restructuring savings in the neighborhood of $50 million. And that's on the restructuring slide and certainly in line with to delivered at. Next,w e said we expected incremental margin from higher shipment volumes behind our initial guidance of 5% to 8%. And finally, we expected modest mix favorability that would largely hit in the first half before we lap the benefits of the power pack introduction. We then said that these positive impact the gross margin would be partially offset by headwinds from foreign currency exchange, higher raw material costs. And finally, we said that we would incur temporary inefficiencies at our York facility as we continue to outsource non-core parts and cut some of the operations over to a single-line. Now let's look at the first quarter results and how we did against that. First, currency was unfavorable by $6 million in the quarter or 6/10 of our gross margin point. Next, mix was favorable despite higher shipment mix of Sportsters. This is more than offset by the favorable mix within families and higher rate on the power pack option. Raw materials were unfavorable by nearly $6 million, and that was largely driven by steel, aluminum and copper. And then, we had significantly higher fuel costs. And finally, manufacturing costs were unfavorable despite the fact that volumes were flat. When we look at that, we talk about the fact volumes. First, we talked about having incremental margin on a full-year basis given the flat volumes in the first quarter, we didn't get any benefit from incremental margins, but we still anticipate incremental margins will benefit us as we grow volumes for the remainder of the year and on a full-year basis up 2% to 8%. And that should come in the second quarter as we got a volume call on 3% to 7%. Again, favorable manufacturing varies as largely explained by two items: First, we had higher product cost driven by features and content from the model year. Second, the manufacturing cost that, the temporary inefficiencies associated with the transformation of the York facility. These were about $11 million in the quarter. And again, we will expect them to continue throughout the transformation, which show will run through the second half -- the first half of next year. The year-over-year cost of these will improve as we move into the back half of this year. So as we that the cost it started in the third quarter of last year and so last year, Sharon, about $5 million in each quarter, I think it was $5 million.and $4 million in the third quarter and $5 million in the fourth quarter that we had last year. $11 million the first quarter of this year and again, those expenses should taper off as we continue the execution and the transformation through the first half of next year. And on a year-over-year basis, it will be mitigated by lapping the year-over-year cost in the back half of the year."

They were up through February 23.4%, and that drove our total demand for Harley-Davidson motorcycles. When you look at both new and used motorcycles, total demand was up 18%. So if we step back and look back at what happened last year, on a full-year basis, total demand was up 3.1%, which was driven by used bike sales up 11.8% and new bikes down 11.7%. And obviously, the new bike sales rate of decline improved as we went through last year. And so now into the first quarter, the first two months of the year used bikes continue to sell well. So we're clearing a lot of used bikes with the market should, which was good and in line with our strategy to narrow the gap between new and used pricing.

What we would do is we are seeing the exact model and color that they wanted. And it's going to take a little bit of time to get as the dealer go throughout the dealer network.

It's been nearly 2 years since I joined Harley-Davidson as CEO. And in that time, through the hard work and dedication of all of our employees, we've undertaken one of the biggest transformations in the company's history. From a foundation as one of the most iconic brands in the world, we are transforming Harley-Davidson to be leaner, more agile and more effective than ever at delivering great products and experiences to an increasingly global community of customers. 
We are making great progress, and today, we reported further evidence of this renewal with earnings per share up more than 75% from the year-ago period and worldwide retail new motorcycle sales turning positive, up 3.5%. Dealer new retail motorcycle sales in international markets grew more than 11% during the quarter, with Europe in particular, showing strength and the U.S. was nearly level with the year ago. And while it's good to see this overall retail improvement, we have said all along that we would have a cautious outlook for the year, particularly in the United States.
We now have the market share data for new on-road motorcycle sales for 2010 and again Harley-Davidson was the #1 seller in the U.S. to young adults, ages 18 to 34. In fact, we increased our market share among these customers to more than 30%. And just to be clear, that's in sales to young adults across all sizes of on-road motorcycles. In just the heavyweight category, we had nearly 1/2 of all young adults sales last year. The story is similar for on-road, new motorcycle sales among other demographic groups as well. We increased our market share among U.S. women, selling more than 1/2 of all new motorcycles sold to these riders. Our dealers sold nearly 1/2 of all the new motorcycles sold to Hispanic customers, and we increased our market share across all CCs among African-Americans to nearly 43%. We are pleased to see these results, which reflect the impact of our multi-generational and multicultural strategy.
Regarding our financial performance. In the first quarter, we saw earnings improvements at HDFS [Harley-Davidson Financial Services]. The team at HDFS has done an outstanding job of managing that business. 
On the Motorcycle side of the business, we announced this morning that we could see a modest effect on shipments this year as a result of a subcomponent suppliers issue related to last month's earthquake in Japan. First, our hearts go out to the people of Japan in the aftermath of the tragic events there. And I just want to recognize all the members of the Harley-Davidson family in Japan where our employees and dealers are truly doing a remarkable job under a very difficult circumstances. 
Relative to our production operations, the transformation that's underway continues to move full speed ahead, and we expected to yield outstanding dividends over the long haul, not only in terms of financial returns but also in our ability to be much more customer led in our production capabilities. Here, too, our employees are doing some monumental work. However, it's important to remember that we expect short-term inefficiencies as we make the transition at York.
In the first quarter, we reached another milestone in the transformation of our motorcycle operations with the ratification of the new labor agreement at our Kansas City plant, which follows the ratification of new agreements in Wisconsin last fall. We are now through the cycle of contract negotiations. Working with our union leadership, we now have 7-year agreements in place in all of our facilities. And now it's all hands on deck in implementing the changes that will lead us to the future by being more flexible and customer led.
While we are in the midst of a lot of change, our employees are excited and energized because through our strategy, we are taking one of the world's greatest iconic brands to the many roads of the world. We are ensuring like never before that we're customer led in all we do, making customers' dreams a reality by delivering remarkable products and extraordinary experiences. And we are transforming the business in ways that preserve Harley-Davidson's great heritage even as we explore new ways to grow the reach of our brand globally. While there are very many challenges ahead, these are exciting times for our company, and we are pleased with our progress. 
So in closing, I want to thank all of our employees, dealers and suppliers for their outstanding efforts to move Harley-Davidson forward. I continue to be impressed with their dedication and commitment. 
I'll be back later for questions. So let me turn it over to John for details on the quarter."

I'll review the financial results starting on Slide 10 with the first quarter results. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson, Inc. consolidated revenue was up 1.5% behind the 0.3% increase in shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Our first quarter income from continuing operations improved to $119.3 million, an increase of 73.5%. Similarly, diluted earnings per share rose to $0.51 per share, up from the year-ago quarter, which was $0.29 per share. Our improved financial performance for the quarter was driven by strong operating income at HDFS and lower year-over-year interest expense as a result of last December's repurchase of $297 million of high interest notes and a lower effective tax rate than last year's first quarter. 
Operating income from the Motorcycle business was flat to last year's first quarter as lower gross margin, largely impacted by the inefficiencies at York, was offset by lower spending and our ongoing restructuring activities.
We are pleased with the quarter's results and our continued progress against our growth strategies and transformation of our business.
Moving on to retail sales on Slide 11. Worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were up 3.5% in the first quarter, driven by strength of international sales, which were up 11.3% in the quarter compared to last year. In the U.S., retail sales in the quarter were down 0.5% and market share was 53.4%, down 1.9 percentage points from year ago and down slightly from the historical high we reached at the end of last year. 
I would like to recognize the continued efforts and progress of our U.S. dealers despite the impact of challenging macroeconomic conditions, which include persistently high unemployment, falling home values and low consumer confidence. The U.S. dealer network is facing fierce price competition from deep competitive discounting and from strong values on used Harley-Davidson motorcycles.
Strength in the international markets was primarily driven by Europe region, which was up 22.7% compared to last year. The year-over-year improvement was consistent with most countries in our Europe region and was aided by improved product availability compared to the first quarter of 2010, especially with respect to Sportster motorcycles, which was impacted by the shutdown of our Kansas City plant in the fourth quarter of 2009. Canada sales were also up 7.5% in the quarter. The Asia-Pacific region was down 3.9%, driven primarily by the impact on retail sales related to the natural disaster in Japan and severe flooding in Australia. And the Latin America region was down 5.4% as we closed the previously existing dealer network in Brazil and started the process of appointing new dealers. This was planned as part of the agreement that was announced in December 2010 to terminate the exclusive dealer contract that was in place and allows us to expand our presence in Brazil.
On Slide 12, you will see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the quarter were about flat to last year and within our expected range of 51,000 to 56,000 motorcycles. First quarter shipments were not impacted by the aftermath of the earthquake in Japan. Shipment makes up Touring, custom and Sportster motorcycles were all within historical ranges. 
Slide 13 summarizes a few key points about our dealer network in the U.S. As I mentioned last quarter, as a result of stronger-than-expected fourth quarter 2010 retail sales, the U.S. dealer network's 2010 year-end inventory was at the lowest level in many years and below what we believe is at appropriate ongoing level. During the first quarter in the U.S., we shipped about 35,000 Harley-Davidson motorcycles, and our dealers sold roughly 32,000 at retail. While U.S. dealer inventory increased modestly over Q4 2010 levels in preparation for the spring selling season, it was down about 10,500 units compared to the first quarter of 2010. We continue to believe aggregate dealer inventory in the U.S. is below an appropriate level to keep our brand healthy and execute our growth strategy. And therefore, even with a modest shipment guidance that's just been announced today, we expect to replenish a portion of dealer inventory by year end.
We will continue to aggressively manage the supply of new bikes in line with demand while we also support the dealer's efforts to sell more used bikes. Healthy used bikes sales enhance dealer revenue, maintain resale values and narrow the gap between new and used motorcycle pricing. Used bikes sales through the.S. dealer network were up double digits through February compared to the same period last year. When you combine these strong, used Harley-Davidson sales with new retail sales in the U.S., total demand for Harley-Davidson motorcycles continues to be strong.
As the economic conditions continued to be challenging, dealers continued to proactively manage their businesses, and we believe the U.S. dealer network in aggregate remains profitable.
On Slide 14, you will see revenue for the Motorcycles and Related Products segment was up in the first quarter. During the quarter, average motorcycle revenue for Harley-Davidson units sold increased $414 from the prior year as a result of favorable mix and currency exchange. 
Parts and Accessories sales were up over 10% during the quarter, driven in part by a focus on product availability, high demand for our new accessory product offerings and growth in worldwide retail motorcycle sales.
General Merchandise was down 5.6% in the first quarter compared to last year, largely related to the timing of delivery of products between the first and second quarters of this year.
Turning to restructuring on Slide 15. Our efforts to improve our cost structure and transform the business to be stronger and more profitable in future are well underway. During the first quarter, we incurred $23 million in restructuring expenses, which was about $25 million less than last year's first quarter when we incurred charges associated with the initial implementation of York's new labor agreement. Our expected full year total costs and savings associated with our restructuring activities are summarized on the slide. The summary also includes the expected cost savings and associated changes to our Kansas City operations that Keith mentioned.
On Slide 16, you'll see gross margin in the quarter was 33.1%, 3.5 percentage points lower than the same quarter last year. Gross margin for the quarter was impacted by 4 key drivers: First, foreign currency exchange was unfavorable by $6 million during the first quarter. Next, mix was favorable by $5.3 million despite a higher percentage mix of Sportsters versus higher margin Touring and custom motorcycles. Mix was positively impacted by mix within families and by our power-packed options offered at the start of the 2011 model year. Raw materials were unfavorable $5.7 million due to increasing metals and fuel costs. 
And finally, as expected, manufacturing costs for the first quarter were unfavorable and productivity was impacted by temporary inefficiencies at our York facility as we restructure and transform our operations at that site. As we have discussed for the past couple of quarters, the magnitude of change that is occurring at York is quite significant. It includes restraining our entire workforce on a new operating system, outsourcing nearly 2,000 non-core parts and subassemblies, moving and reconfiguring production lines, implementing a new ERP system and redefining our vehicle delivery process. The restructuring of our York facility is expected to be largely complete in the first half of next year. Through the next several quarters, we continue to expect York efficiencies will be adversely impacted by restructuring activities. Also reflected in the manufacturing line on the slide are higher product costs compared to last year due to new features and content that are offered on model year 2011 motorcycles.
On Slide 17, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the first quarter was 11.8% versus 12.2% in 2010. Operating margin was negatively impacted by lower gross margin, which was largely offset by lower restructuring spending as we lap last year's first quarter, which included significant charges associated with York's new labor contract. 
SG&A was slightly lower during the quarter compared to the same period last year as we continued to carefully manage our expenses while we invest in our growth strategy. As we have previously stated, we expect SG&A spending will decline as a percent of revenue between 2009 and 2014.
Now moving on to our Financial Services segment on Slide 18. In the first quarter, HDFS posted a $67.9 million operating profit, an improvement of $41.2 million compared to last year. The key drivers of the first quarter results were: net interest income of $12.6 million higher in the first quarter of 2011 versus the first quarter of 2010 due to widening interest rate spreads driven by lower cost of funds on a lower receivable base; the provision for retail credit losses was $28.8 million lower in the first quarter of 2011 versus first quarter 2010, primarily due to improved credit loss rates as a result of favorable retail receivable performance. During the quarter, HDFS reduced the total allowance for credit losses by $14 million to $159.7 million to reflect lower anticipated credit losses.
Now Larry will provide more detail on HDFS' operations. Larry?"

During the first quarter, HDFS originated $453.7 million in retail motorcycle loans, up 21.2% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to higher used Harley-Davidson motorcycle loan originations. This corresponds to the increasing number of used Harley-Davidson motorcycle sales being made by the dealer network. HDFS also increased its share of new Harley-Davidson loan originations, growing retail market share by 5.3 percentage points to 47.4% during the first quarter compared to the same period last year.
At the end of the first quarter of the approximately $6.2 billion of finance receivables, $5.2 billion were retail and $1 billion were wholesale. At the end of the quarter, over 50% of the retail portfolio was comprised of loans originated after underwriting changes were made in January 2009. 
Consistent with recent quarters, retail loan originations were 80% to 85% prime. The 30-day delinquency rate for managed retail motorcycle loans at the end of the first quarter was 3.68% or 89 basis points better than the same period last year. Annual retail credit losses improved by 125 basis points to 1.58% in the first quarter compared to the first quarter last year. This improvement was driven by the impact of changes in underwriting, as well as lower frequency of loss and improvement in the recovery values of repossessed motorcycles.
We are pleased with the continued improvement in credit performance during the first quarter, and we'll continue to monitor the unemployment picture, motorcycle recovery values and the pace of the recovery in the U.S. consumer environment. 
During the first quarter, HDFS delivered increased profits, maintained a strong liquidity position and reduced our cost of funds. We remain focused on enabling retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycle while providing an appropriate return to Harley-Davidson, Inc. 
Now let me turn it back to John."

Now let's take a look at cash and liquidity on Slide 21. As we mentioned during the Q4 conference call, HDFS paid $125 million dividend to H-D, Inc. during the first quarter, reflective of HDFS' reduced capital needs on a lower receivables balance. HDFS remains focused on delivering an appropriate return on equity and prudently managing its debt-to-equity ratio.
Also during the quarter, H-D, Inc. made a $200 million contribution to our qualified pension plans, which reduced our pension and postretirement liability to $354 million. You'll see at the end of the quarter, we had $1.05 billion of cash and marketable securities. In addition, HDFS had approximately $1.24 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities.
For our cash and liquidity strategy, we continued to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and/or committed credit facilities. 
Now I'll review the remaining Harley-Davidson, Inc. financials on Slide 22.  I would like to highlight 2 items on the slide: First, with regards to continuing operations, the company used operating cash of $105 million during the first quarter, driven by the $200 million contribution to our pension plans. And second, our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 34.8% compared to 47.2% in 2010. The Q1 2010 tax rate was negatively impacted by a onetime tax charge of $13.3 million associated with the federal health care reform legislation. In 2011, we continue to expect full year effective income tax rate will be approximately 35%.
Now turning to guidance on Slide 23. Based on what we know today about the anticipated subcomponent supply issue related to the aftermath of the earthquake in Japan, we have made a modest adjustment by reducing the low end of our shipment guidance to account for the uncertainty. We now expect full year 2011 Harley-Davidson motorcycle shipments to be between 215,000 and 228,000 units, up 2% to 8% from 2010.  During the second quarter, we expect to ship between 62,000 and 67,000 units. We are also reducing the low end of our 2011 gross margin guidance. We now expect gross margin will be between 33.5% and 35% for the full year due to incremental costs and potential unfavorable impact of mix and lost absorption associated with the expected supply chain disruption. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be between $210 million and $230 million, which includes between $60 million and $75 million of capital related to restructuring.
As we look back on the first quarter 2011, while the global economies continue to be challenged, we are happy to report our first retail sales growth since before the economic downturn took hold. We are also pleased to see strong profits at HDFS and progress with our restructuring and transformation of the Motorcycle business. We are encouraged by the progress being made in our international markets with Europe and Canada retail sales well over last year's levels, Brazil already appointing new dealers to serve our customer in that market and in Asia where we're humbled by the resilience and courage of our employees and our dealers as they manage in the wake of tragedy. And as I mentioned earlier, we continue to be pleased by the efforts of our U.S. dealers as they face challenges. 
Overall, we're excited about the long term as we execute our strategy to transform and grow our business. We will continue to manage the business prudently and have adjusted guidance as we navigate through the uncertainties that 2011 might bring. We'll also remain disciplined in the execution of our growth strategy throughout the year. The supply chain issues from Japan are certainly a bump in the road, but the fundamentals of our business are strong, and we won't be deterred as we make progress along our journey to grow and we remain focused on delivering strong margins, strong returns and value to our shareholders.

Let's look at overall gross margin and let's get back to what we had discussed last quarter when we issued initial gross margin guidance of 34% to 35%. Sure, we sa",590,"Yes, Sharon. The inefficiencies of York during the quarter -- well, let's take a step back. Let's look at overall gross margin and let's get back to what we had discussed last quarter when we issued initial gross margin guidance of 34% to 35%. Sure, we said several things would happen. First, 3 things that would positively affect gross margin: First was that gross margin would benefit from continued productivity and restructuring savings in the neighborhood of $50 million. And that's on the restructuring slide and certainly in line to deliver that. Next, we said we expected incremental margin from higher shipment volumes behind our initial guidance of up 5% to 8%. And finally, we said we expected modest mix favorability that would largely hit in the first half before we lap the benefits of the power-pack introduction. We then said that these positive impact to gross margin would be partially offset by headwinds from foreign currency exchange, higher raw material costs. And finally, we said that we would incur temporary inefficiencies at our York facility as we continue to outsource non-core parts and cut some of the operations over to a single line. Now let's look at the first quarter results and how we did against that. First, currency was unfavorable by $6 million in the quarter or 6/10 of a gross margin point. Next, mix was favorable despite higher shipment mix of Sportsters. This was more than offset by the favorable mix within families and higher take rate on the power-pack option. Raw materials were unfavorable by nearly $6 million, and that was driven by -- largely by steel, aluminum and copper. And then we had significantly higher fuel costs. And finally, manufacturing costs were unfavorable despite the fact that volumes were flat. When we look at that -- when we talk about the flat volumes, first -- I'm sorry, we talked about having incremental margin on a full year basis. Given the flat volumes in the first quarter, we didn't get any benefit from incremental margins, but we still anticipate incremental margins will benefit us as we grow volumes for the remainder of the year and on a full year basis up 2% to 8%. And that should start to come in the second quarter as we've got our volume call up 3% to 7%. Again favorable manufacturing variance is largely explained by 2 items: First, we had higher product costs driven by features and content that [indiscernible] the model year. And then second is the manufacturing cost that were temporarily -- the temporary inefficiencies associated with the transformation of our York facility. These were about $11 million in the quarter. And again we will expect them to continue throughout the transformation, which will run through the second half -- I'm sorry, the first half of next year. The year-over-year cost of these will improve as we move into the back half of this year. So as we lap the cost that started in the third quarter of last year and so last year, Sharon, about $5 million in each quarter, I think it was $5 million -- $4 million in the third quarter and $5 million in the fourth quarter that we had last year, $11 million in the first quarter of this year. And again those expenses should taper off as we continue the execution and the transformation through the first half of next year.

I think you mentioned competitive discounting and strong values in used, did the used comments, does that mean to imply that the pricing on used bikes is still relatively low and that's affecting new bike sales?

Overall, sales of used bikes -- and as we look at registrations, as they're month delayed, through February, used bikes did sell very briskly. They were up from February 23.4%. And that drove our total demand for Harley-Davidson motorcycles. When you look at both new and used motorcycles, total demand was up 18%. So if we step back and look at what happened last year, on a full year basis, total demand was up 3.1%, which was driven by used bike sales up 11.8% and new bikes down 11.7%. And obviously, the new bike sales rate of decline improved as we went through last year. And so now into the first quarter, the first two months of the year, used bikes continue to sell well. So we're clearing a lot of used bikes from the market should, which is good and in line with our strategy to narrow the gap between new and used pricing. And so we do have brisk sales as well as rising prices on used bikes."

What we would do is we are seeing some customers wait to get the exact model and color that they've wanted. And it's going to take a little bit of time to get that as the dealers go through all the dealer network or they wait for the bike to be shipped. The second thing that we're seeing and it's certainly in line with our is that a lot of customers are opting to buy used bikes. And again that is firming up used bike prices, and until we get that relationship a little bit tighter, then we'll start to see it shift toward more new bike sales versus used bikes.

And in that time, through the hard work and dedication of all of our employees, we've undertaken",792,"Well, thank you, Amy. And good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call today. It's been nearly 2 years since I joined Harley-Davidson as CEO. And in that time, through the hard work and dedication of all of our employees, we've undertaken one of the biggest transformations in the company's history. From a foundation as one of the most iconic brands in the world, we are transforming Harley-Davidson to be leaner, more agile and more effective than ever at delivering great products and experiences to an increasingly global community of customers. 
We are making great progress, and today, we reported further evidence of this renewal with earnings per share up more than 75% from the year-ago period and worldwide retail new motorcycle sales turning positive, up 3.5%. Dealer new retail motorcycle sales in international markets grew more than 11% during the quarter, with Europe in particular, showing strength and the U.S. was nearly level with the year ago. And while it's good to see this overall retail improvement, we have said all along that we would have a cautious outlook for the year, particularly in the United States.
We now have the market share data for new on-road motorcycle sales for 2010 and again Harley-Davidson was the #1 seller in the U.S. to young adults, ages 18 to 34. In fact, we increased our market share among these customers to more than 30%. And just to be clear, that's in sales to young adults across all sizes of on-road motorcycles. In just the heavyweight category, we had nearly 1/2 of all young adults sales last year. The story is similar for on-road, new motorcycle sales among other demographic groups as well. We increased our market share among U.S. women, selling more than 1/2 of all new motorcycles sold to these riders. Our dealers sold nearly 1/2 of all the new motorcycles sold to Hispanic customers, and we increased our market share across all CCs among African-Americans to nearly 43%. We are pleased to see these results, which reflect the impact of our multi-generational and multicultural strategy.
Regarding our financial performance. In the first quarter, we saw earnings improvements at HDFS [Harley-Davidson Financial Services]. The team at HDFS has done an outstanding job of managing that business. 
On the Motorcycle side of the business, we announced this morning that we could see a modest effect on shipments this year as a result of a subcomponent supply issue related to last month's earthquake in Japan. First, our hearts go out to the people of Japan in the aftermath of the tragic events there. And I just want to recognize all the members of the Harley-Davidson family in Japan where our employees and dealers are truly doing a remarkable job under a very difficult circumstances. 
Relative to our production operations, the transformation that's underway continues to move full speed ahead, and we expected to yield outstanding dividends over the long haul, not only in terms of financial returns but also in our ability to be much more customer led in our production capabilities. Here, too, our employees are doing some monumental work. However, it's important to remember that we expect short-term inefficiencies as we make the transition at York.
In the first quarter, we reached another milestone in the transformation of our motorcycle operations with the ratification of the new labor agreement at our Kansas City plant, which follows the ratification of new agreements in Wisconsin last fall. We are now through the cycle of contract negotiations. Working with our union leadership, we now have 7-year agreements in place in all of our facilities. And now it's all hands on deck in implementing the changes that will lead us to the future by being more flexible and customer led.
While we are in the midst of a lot of change, our employees are excited and energized because through our strategy, we are taking one of the world's greatest iconic brands to the many roads of the world. We are ensuring like never before that we're customer led in all we do, making customers' dreams a reality by delivering remarkable products and extraordinary experiences. And we are transforming the business in ways that preserve Harley-Davidson's great heritage even as we explore new ways to grow the reach of our brand globally. While there are very many challenges ahead, these are exciting times for our company, and we are pleased with our progress. 
So in closing, I want to thank all of our employees, dealers and suppliers for their outstanding efforts to move Harley-Davidson forward. I continue to be impressed with their dedication and commitment. 
I'll be back later for questions. So let me turn it over to John for details on the quarter."

I'll review the financial results starting on Slide 10 with the first quarter results.

I'll review the financial results starting on Slide 10 with the first quarter results. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson, Inc. consolidated revenue was up 1.5% behind the 0.3% increase in shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Our first quarter income from continuing operations improved to $119.3 million, an increase of 73.5%. Similarly, diluted earnings per share rose to $0.51 per share, up from the year-ago quarter, which was $0.29 per share. Our improved financial performance for the quarter was driven by strong operating income at HDFS and lower year-over-year interest expense as a result of last December's repurchase of $297 million of high interest notes and a lower effective tax rate than last year's first quarter. 
Operating income from the Motorcycle business was flat to last year's first quarter as lower gross margin, largely impacted by the inefficiencies at York, was offset by lower spending and our ongoing restructuring activities.
We are pleased with the quarter's results and our continued progress against our growth strategies and transformation of our business.
Moving on to retail sales on Slide 11. Worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were up 3.5% in the first quarter, driven by strength of international sales, which were up 11.3% in the quarter compared to last year. In the U.S., retail sales in the quarter were down 0.5% and market share was 53.4%, down 1.9 percentage points from year ago and down slightly from the historical high we reached at the end of last year. 
I would like to recognize the continued efforts and progress of our U.S. dealers despite the impact of challenging macroeconomic conditions, which include persistently high unemployment, falling home values and low consumer confidence. The U.S. dealer network is facing fierce price competition from deep competitive discounting and from strong values on used Harley-Davidson motorcycles.
Strength in the international markets was primarily driven by Europe region, which was up 22.7% compared to last year. The year-over-year improvement was consistent with most countries in our Europe region and was aided by improved product availability compared to the first quarter of 2010, especially with respect to Sportster motorcycles, which was impacted by the shutdown of our Kansas City plant in the fourth quarter of 2009. Canada sales were also up 7.5% during the quarter. The Asia-Pacific region was down 3.9%, driven primarily by the impact on retail sales related to the natural disaster in Japan and severe flooding in Australia. And the Latin America region was down 5.4% as we closed the previously existing dealer network in Brazil and started the process of appointing new dealers. This was planned as part of the agreement that was announced in December 2010 to terminate the exclusive dealer contract that was in place and allows us to expand our presence in Brazil.
On Slide 12, you will see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the quarter were about flat to last year and within our expected range of 51,000 to 56,000 motorcycles. First quarter shipments were not impacted by the aftermath of the earthquake in Japan. Shipment makes up Touring, custom and Sportster motorcycles were all within historical ranges. 
Slide 13 summarizes a few key points about our dealer network in the U.S. As I mentioned last quarter, as a result of stronger-than-expected fourth quarter 2010 retail sales, the U.S. dealer network's 2010 year-end inventory was at the lowest level in many years and below what we believe is at appropriate ongoing level. During the first quarter in the U.S., we shipped about 35,000 Harley-Davidson motorcycles, and our dealers sold roughly 32,000 at retail. While U.S. dealer inventory increased modestly over Q4 2010 levels in preparation for the spring selling season, it was down about 10,500 units compared to the first quarter of 2010. We continue to believe aggregate dealer inventory in the U.S. is below an appropriate level to keep our brand healthy and execute our growth strategy. And therefore, even with a modest shipment guidance adjustment announced today, we expect to replenish a portion of dealer inventory by year end.
We will continue to aggressively manage the supply of new bikes in line with demand while we also support the dealer's efforts to sell more used bikes. Healthy used bikes sales enhance dealer revenue, maintain resale values and narrow the gap between new and used motorcycle pricing. Used bikes sales through the U.S. dealer network were up double digits through February compared to the same period last year. When you combine these strong, used Harley-Davidson sales with new retail sales in the U.S., total demand for Harley-Davidson motorcycles continues to be strong.
As the economic conditions continued to be challenging, dealers continued to proactively manage their businesses, and we believe the U.S. dealer network in aggregate remains profitable.
On Slide 14, you will see revenue for the Motorcycles and Related Products segment was up in the first quarter. During the quarter, average motorcycle revenue for Harley-Davidson units sold increased $414 from the prior year as a result of favorable mix and currency exchange. 
Parts and Accessories sales were up over 10% during the quarter, driven in part by a focus on product availability, high demand for our new accessory product offerings and growth in worldwide retail motorcycle sales.
General Merchandise was down 5.6% in the first quarter compared to last year, largely related to the timing of delivery of products between the first and second quarters of this year.
Turning to restructuring on Slide 15. Our efforts to improve our cost structure and transform the business to be stronger and more profitable in future are well underway. During the first quarter, we incurred $23 million in restructuring expenses, which was about $25 million less than last year's first quarter when we incurred charges associated with the initial implementation of York's new labor agreement. Our expected full year total costs and savings associated with our restructuring activities are summarized on the slide. The summary also includes the expected cost savings and associated changes to our Kansas City operations that Keith mentioned.
On Slide 16, you'll see gross margin in the quarter was 33.1%, 3.5 percentage points lower than the same quarter last year. Gross margin for the quarter was impacted by 4 key drivers: First, foreign currency exchange was unfavorable by $6 million during the first quarter. Next, mix was favorable by $5.3 million despite a higher percentage mix of Sportsters versus higher margin Touring and custom motorcycles. Mix was positively impacted by mix within families and by our power-packed options offered at the start of the 2011 model year. Raw materials were unfavorable $5.7 million due to increasing metals and fuel costs. 
And finally, as expected, manufacturing costs for the first quarter were unfavorable as productivity was impacted by temporary inefficiencies at our York facility as we restructure and transform our operations at that site. As we have discussed for the past couple of quarters, the magnitude of change that is occurring at York is quite significant. It includes restraining our entire workforce on a new operating system, outsourcing nearly 2,000 non-core parts and subassemblies, moving and reconfiguring production lines, implementing a new ERP system and redefining our vehicle delivery process. The restructuring of our York facility is expected to be largely complete in the first half of next year. Through the next several quarters, we continue to expect York deficiencies will be adversely impacted by restructuring activities. Also reflected in the manufacturing line on the slide are higher product costs compared to last year due to new features and content that are offered on model year 2011 motorcycles.
On Slide 17, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the first quarter was 11.8% versus 12.2% in 2010. Operating margin was negatively impacted by lower gross margin, which was largely offset by lower restructuring spending as we lap last year's first quarter, which included significant charges associated with York's new labor contract. 
SG&A was slightly lower during the quarter compared to the same period last year as we continued to carefully manage our expenses while we invest in our growth strategy. As we have previously stated, we expect SG&A spending will decline as a percent of revenue between 2009 and 2014.
Now moving on to our Financial Services segment on Slide 18. In the first quarter, HDFS posted a $67.9 million operating profit, an improvement of $41.2 million compared to last year. The key drivers of the first quarter results were: net interest income of $12.6 million higher in the first quarter of 2011 versus the first quarter of 2010 due to widening interest rate spreads driven by lower cost of funds on a lower receivable base; the provision for retail credit losses was $28.8 million lower in the first quarter of 2011 versus first quarter 2010, primarily due to improved credit loss rates as a result of favorable retail receivable performance. During the quarter, HDFS reduced the total allowance for credit losses by $14 million to $159.7 million to reflect lower anticipated credit losses.
Now Larry will provide more detail on HDFS's operations. Larry?"

During the first quarter, HDFS originated $453.7 million in retail motorcycle loans, up 21.2% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to higher used Harley-Davidson motorcycle loan originations. This corresponds to the increasing number of used Harley-Davidson motorcycle sales being made by the dealer network. HDFS also increased its share of new Harley-Davidson loan originations, growing retail market share by 5.3 percentage points to 47.4% during the first quarter compared to the same period last year.
At the end of the first quarter of the approximately $6.2 billion of finance receivables, $5.2 billion were retail and $1 billion were wholesale. At the end of the quarter, over 50% of the retail portfolio was comprised of loans originated after underwriting changes were made in January 2009. 
Consistent with recent quarters, retail loan originations were 80% to 85% prime. The 30-day delinquency rate for managed retail motorcycle loans at the end of the first quarter was 3.68% or 89 basis points better than the same period last year. Annual retail credit losses improved by 125 basis points to 1.58% in the first quarter compared to the first quarter last year. This improvement was driven by the impact of changes in underwriting, as well as lower frequency of loss and improvement in the recovery values of repossessed motorcycles.
We are pleased with the continued improvement in credit performance during the first quarter, but we'll continue to monitor the unemployment picture, motorcycle recovery values and the pace of the recovery in the U.S. consumer environment. 
During the first quarter, HDFS delivered increased profits, maintained a strong liquidity position and reduced our cost of funds. We remain focused on enabling retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles while providing an appropriate return to Harley-Davidson, Inc. 
Now let me turn it back to John."

Now let's take a look at cash and liquidity on Slide 21. As we mentioned during the Q4 conference call, HDFS paid $125 million dividend to H-D, Inc. during the first quarter, reflective of HDFS's reduced capital needs on a lower receivables balance. HDFS remains focused on delivering an appropriate return on equity and prudently managing its debt-to-equity ratio.
Also during the quarter, H-D, Inc. made a $200 million contribution to our qualified pension plans, which reduced our pension and postretirement liability to $354 million. You'll see at the end of the quarter, we had $1.05 billion of cash and marketable securities. In addition, HDFS had approximately $1.24 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities.
For our cash and liquidity strategy, we continued to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and/or committed credit facilities. 
Now I'll review the remaining Harley-Davidson, Inc. financials on Slide 22.  I would like to highlight 2 items on this slide: First, with regards to continuing operations, the company used operating cash of $105 million during the first quarter, driven by the $200 million contribution to our pension plans. And second, our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 34.8% compared to 47.2% in 2010. The Q1 2010 tax rate was negatively impacted by a onetime tax charge of $13.3 million associated with the federal health care reform legislation. In 2011, we continue to expect full year effective income tax rate will be approximately 35%.
Now turning to guidance on Slide 23. Based on what we know today about the anticipated subcomponent supply issue related to the aftermath of the earthquake in Japan, we have made a modest adjustment by reducing the low end of our shipment guidance to account for the uncertainty. We now expect full year 2011 Harley-Davidson motorcycle shipments to be between 215,000 and 228,000 units, up 2% to 8% from 2010.  During the second quarter, we expect to ship between 62,000 and 67,000 units. We are also reducing the low end of our 2011 gross margin guidance. We now expect gross margin will be between 33.5% and 35% for the full year due to incremental costs and potential unfavorable impact of mix and lost absorption associated with the expected supply chain disruption. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be between $210 million and $230 million, which includes between $60 million and $75 million of capital related to restructuring.
As we look back on the first quarter 2011, while the global economies continue to be challenged, we are happy to report our first retail sales growth since before the economic downturn took hold. We are also pleased to see strong profits at HDFS and progress with our restructuring and transformation of the Motorcycle business. We are encouraged by the progress being made in our international markets with Europe and Canada retail sales well over last year's levels, Brazil already appointing new dealers to serve our customer in that market and in Asia where we're humbled by the resilience and courage of our employees and our dealers as they manage in the wake of tragedy. And as I mentioned earlier, we continue to be pleased by the efforts of our U.S. dealers as they face challenges. 
Overall, we're excited about the long term as we execute our strategy to transform and grow our business. We will continue to manage the business prudently and have adjusted guidance as we navigate through the uncertainties that 2011 might bring. We'll also remain disciplined in the execution of our growth strategy throughout the year. The supply chain issues from Japan are certainly a bump in the road, but the fundamentals of our business are strong, and we won't be deterred as we make progress along our journey to growth and we remain focused on delivering strong margins, strong returns and value to our shareholders.

The inefficiencies of York during the quarter -- well, let's take a step back. Let's look at overall gross margin and let's step back to what we had discussed last quarter when we issued initial gross margin guidance of 34% to 35%. Sure, we s",589,"Yes, Sharon. The inefficiencies of York during the quarter -- well, let's take a step back. Let's look at overall gross margin and let's step back to what we had discussed last quarter when we issued initial gross margin guidance of 34% to 35%. Sure, we said several things would happen. First, 3 things that would positively affect gross margin: First was that gross margin would benefit from continued productivity and restructuring savings in the neighborhood of $50 million. And that's on the restructuring slide and certainly in line to deliver that. Next, we said we expected incremental margin from higher shipment volumes behind our initial guidance of up 5% to 8%. And finally, we said we expected modest mix favorability that would largely hit in the first half before we lap the benefits of the power-pack introduction. We then said that these positive impacts to gross margin would be partially offset by headwinds from foreign currency exchange, higher raw material costs. And finally, we said that we would incur temporary inefficiencies at our York facility as we continued to outsource non-core parts and cut assembly operations over to a single line. 
Now let's look at the first quarter results and how we did against that. First, currency was unfavorable by $6 million in the quarter or 6/10 of a gross margin point. Next, mix was favorable despite higher shipment mix of Sportsters. This was more than offset by the favorable mix within families and take rate on the power-pack option. Raw materials were unfavorable by nearly $6 million, and that was driven by -- largely by steel, aluminum and copper. And then we had significantly higher fuel costs. And finally, manufacturing costs were unfavorable despite the fact that volumes were flat. When we look at that -- when we talk about the flat volumes, first -- I'm sorry, we talked about having incremental margin on a full year basis. Given the flat volumes in the first quarter, we didn't get any benefit from incremental margins, but we still anticipate incremental margins will benefit us as we grow volumes for the remainder of the year and on a full year basis up 2% to 8%. And that should start to come in the second quarter as we've got our volume call up 3% to 7%. Again favorable manufacturing variance is largely explained by 2 items: First, we had the higher product costs driven by features and content that ratted at the model year. And then second is the manufacturing cost that were temporarily -- the temporary inefficiencies associated with the transformation of our York facility. These were about $11 million in the quarter. And again we will expect them to continue throughout the transformation, which will run through the second half -- I'm sorry, the first half of next year. The year-over-year cost of these will improve as we move into the back half of this year. So as we lap the cost that started in the third quarter of last year and so last year, Sharon, about $5 million in each quarter, I think it was $5 million -- $4 million in the third quarter and $5 million in the fourth quarter that we had last year, $11 million in the first quarter of this year. And again those expenses should taper off as we continue the execution and the transformation through the first half of next year. And on a year-over-year basis, they'll will be mitigated by lapping year-over-year cost in the back half of the year."

Overall, sales though of used bikes and as we look at registrations, those are a month delayed. Through February, used bikes did sell very briskly. They were up from February 23.4%. And that drove our total demand for Harley-Davidson motorcycles. When you look at both new and used motorcycles, total demand was up 18%. So if we step back and look at what happened last year, on a full year basis, total demand was up 3.1%, which was driven by used bike sales up 11.8% and new bikes down 11.7%. And obviously, the new bike sales rate of decline improved as we went through last year. And so now into the first quarter, or into the first two months of the year, used bikes continue to sell well.

So the question is: are we missing any sales because of tight inventories? I don't think that is significant. And if we are, we don't believe we're losing them to the competition. What we would do is we are seeing some customers wait to get the exact model and color that they've wanted. And it's going to take a little bit of time to get that as the dealers go through all the dealer network or they wait for the bike to be shipped. The second thing that we're seeing and it's certainly in line with our strategy is that a lot of customers are opting to buy used bikes. And again that is firming up used bike prices, and until we get that relationship a little bit tighter, then we'll start to see a shift toward more new bike sales versus used bikes. So everything is moving as we expected and as we hoped in the first quarter. And again overall total demand through February is up over 18%."

We are in Anaheim, California with our Harley-Davidson dealers from around the world for the Annual Summer Dealer Meeting and new model launch. It's just one of the many ways that we stay close to what's happening at retail. And it gives us the chance to hear what our dealers are thinking. But this morning, we're going to talk about Harley-Davidson the second quarter and 6 months results. And we truly appreciate all of you joining us on today's call.
Over the past 27 months, we have been focused on making changes that we believe will lead to long-term sustainable success for the business and for our dealers around the world. 
So let me begin by thanking our employees, our dealers and our suppliers for all the hard work and dedication that has gone in to delivering the kind of results that we announced in our press release earlier today. The company saw a strong improvement in many areas, including income in both the Motorcycle and Financial Services segments. We are pleased by the 7.5% growth in new motorcycle retail sales in the U.S., as well as the growth of Harley-Davidson retail sales on a worldwide basis. With strong second quarter retail sales performance, we raised our shipment guidance for the year as we look to support our retail sales activity. The change in shipment guidance also reflects our confidence in being able to maintain continuity of supply for several subcomponents in the aftermath of the March earthquake in Japan. Our supply management team has done an outstanding job of mitigating supply chain risks resulting in no expected downtime or interruption in our production due to these issues.
And while we remain cautious about consumer confidence and the economy in general, we are pleased with the company's second quarter results, which reflect the transformation that is taking place at Harley-Davidson and the strength of the Harley-Davidson brand around the world.
In late 2009, we laid out our strategic plan, which was based on 4 pillars: Growth, continuous improvement, leadership development and sustainability with the intention to transform our business and become best in class in areas that are critical to our long-term success. Our transformation focuses on 3 main areas: Manufacturing, product development, and excellence at retail.
Over the next few weeks, we will reach a milestone in our manufacturing transformation as we combine Touring and soft tail motorcycle production at our York assembly operations with 1 modern efficient operation. We expect the total transformation of our manufacturing operations will be completed by the end of next year. I'd like to note that our employees, our union leadership and management are fully engaged in delivering a sustainable world class manufacturing capability.
And similarly, in product development, we're making tremendous progress in our implementation of lean engineering. The transformation and product development is resulting in reduced time-to-market with new innovative products and more capacity to deliver new models. And we will increasingly see the results of this work over the next few weeks.
The third cornerstone of our transformation is excellence at retail. And that's something that we will be talking a lot about over the next few days here at Anaheim with our dealers from around the world. Harley-Davidson is embarking on a long-term global initiative called Retail 2020 that will provide the clarity and vision to take the Harley-Davidson retail experience to a new level, with outstanding customer-lead experience every day, every time, everywhere. And through Retail 2020, we will position the company and our network of independent dealers to profitably meet the constantly evolving needs of our customers. This will include a completely revamped e-commerce capability that we expect to roll out in 2012.
So to wrap up, let me reiterate how proud I am of our progress as 1 company and 1 team, working in 1 direction. Together with our dealers, we are transforming our business and increasingly taking our iconic brand to the many roads of the world to fulfill the dreams of our customers. 
I'll be back later for questions. But now, let me turn it over to John for a deeper dive into our results and our updated guidance."

I'll review the financial results starting on Slide 11 with the second quarter results. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson Inc. consolidated revenue was up 15%, behind a 13.2% increase in shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Our second quarter income from continuing operations improved to $190.6 million, an increase of 36.8%. Similarly, diluted earnings per share rose to $0.81 per share, up from the year ago quarter, which was $0.59 per share.
Operating income from motorcycle business was up over 39% compared to last year's second quarter. The strong increase in motorcycles business was driven by increased motorcycle shipments and lower spending on ongoing restructuring activities, partially offset by increased spending and our growth initiatives.
Our improved financial performance for the quarter was also driven by strong operating income at HDFS and lower year-over-year interest expense as a result of last December's repurchase of 297 million of high interest notes, partially offset by higher effective tax rate as compared to last year.
We are very pleased with the second quarter results and our continued progress against our growth strategies and the transformation of our business.
Now let's take a look at retail sales on Slide 12. Overall, worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were up 5.6% in the second quarter. The big news for the second quarter was that retail sales in the U.S. were up 7.5% compared to last year. We are very pleased to report these positive results for the U.S. market, which represent the first quarterly growth in the past 17 quarters. Market share in the U.S. was 53.9%, up 1.5 percentage points compared to last year's second quarter, as the Harley-Davidson brand continues to show strength while the competition continues to aggressively discount prices to move aging inventory.
International markets grew 2.4% during the quarter, driven by growth in the Asia-Pacific and Europe regions. The Asia-Pacific region was up 6.7%, driven primarily by strength in emerging markets in the region. Retail sales in Japan were down 3.4%, which represents a considerable improvement from the first quarter, which was down 9.3% following the earthquake and tsunami.
Following very strong first quarter results, retail sales in Europe region were up 2.6% in the quarter compared to 2010. On a sequential basis, this compares to year-over-year retail sales growth in Europe of 23% in the first quarter of this year. 
Looking back to 2010, limited product availability in Europe constrained retail sales in the first quarter while improved product availability benefited second quarter retail sales in that market. Consequently, year-over-year comparisons were relatively easy in Q1 and tougher in Q2. Overall, we are pleased with Europe's first half growth, which was up 9.3%.
Retail sales in both Canada and the Latin America region were down slightly versus last year. Canada was down 2.1%, and Latin America region was down 1.0% compared to last year.
In Brazil, the new dealer network is coming up to speed. As we discussed last quarter, we closed all existing dealerships and have appointed 10 new dealers. This was planned as part of the agreement that we announced in December 2010 to terminate the exclusive dealer contract that was in place and to expand our presence in Brazil. Again, we are very pleased with the worldwide dealer network's overall retail performance during the second quarter.
On Slide 13, you will see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the quarter are up compared to last year and at the high-end of our expected shipment range of 62,000 to 67,000 motorcycles for the quarter. During the quarter, mix shifted between Touring and custom motorcycles, largely due to the York restructuring, which shut down soft tail production line in preparation for the consolidated production of all models built in York into 1 line.
Sportster represented 24% of total shipments, which was in line with last year's Sportster mix. We expect that Sportster as a percent of total shipment will be within the historical range of 18% to 22% for the full year.
Shipments of the 2012 Touring and Sportster motorcycles started at the end of June. Generally, we ship new model year motorcycles after they are introduced to dealers towards the end of July. However, as a result of the inventory situation in the U.S., we began shipping Touring and Sportster models 3 weeks early. Tomorrow, we will introduce the 2012 Dyna, soft tail and DRSC motocycles to our dealers here in Anaheim.
Slide 14 provides some additional detail on the U.S. dealer network inventory and the strength of our brand as measured by total demand. During the second quarter in the U.S., we shipped about 42,600 Harley-Davidson motorcycles, and our dealers sold roughly 53,600 at retail. As a result of strong second quarter retail sales, the U.S. dealer network inventory was drawn down about 11,000 units from the first quarter 2011, and was down about 3,500 units compared to last year's second quarter. 
Consequently, aggregate U.S. dealer inventory continue to be below what we believe is appropriate on an ongoing level. And we will continue to work toward replenishing dealer inventory levels of new motorcycles. We also continue to support the dealers efforts to sell more used bikes. Healthy used bike sales enhance dealer revenue, maintain resale values and help narrow the gap between new and used motorcycle pricing. Used bikes sales by the U.S. dealer network continue to be up double digits through May compared to the same period last year.
When these used bikes are combined with new retail sales in the U.S., total demand for Harley-Davidson motorcycles continues to be strong. This reinforces the strength of the Harley-Davidson brand.
On Slide 15, you'll see revenue for the Motorcycles and Related Products segment was up in the second quarter behind strong growth from all our businesses. During the quarter, average motorcycle revenue for Harley-Davidson units sold increased $968 from the prior year as a result of favorable currency exchange and improved product mix. The increase in average revenue, coupled with a 13.2% increase in shipments, drove Harley-Davidson motorcycle revenue growth to nearly 21% compared to last year. 
Parts and Accessories sales were up over 10% for the quarter and year-to-date, driven in part by a focus on product availability, high demand for our new accessory product offerings and growth in worldwide retail motorcycle sales.
General Merchandise was up over 8% in the quarter compared to last year, largely related to the timing of delivery of product between the first and second quarters of this year.
As we launch the remaining 2012 model year motorcycles tomorrow, we expect revenue will be favorably impacted by approximately 0.5% price increase on a worldwide basis. This is the first meaningful price increase that we have taken on motorcycles since 2007. We feel the price increase reflects the consumer value that has been added to many of our motorcycles, and believe the timing is prudent given the strength of the brand and the tight inventory situation in the U.S.
Turning to restructuring on Slide 16. Our efforts to improve our cost structure and transform the business to be stronger and more profitable in the future are well underway. During the second quarter, we incurred $13.6 million of restructuring expenses and $36.6 million year-to-date. Restructuring activities are largely on plan through the first half of the year. However, we have adjusted 2011, 2012 and expect the total cost associated with all restructuring activities. 
As you will see, we are reducing the expected restructuring cost for 2011 from $95 million to $105 million to $80 million to $90 million, and 2012 cost from $30 million to $35 million to $25 million to $30 million. The total cost are now expected to be $490 million to $505 million.
Additionally, we are increasing our 2011 capital spending estimates associated with restructuring activities from a range of $60 million to $75 million to $70 million to $85 million. The expected savings included in the summary are unchanged.
On Slide 17, you will see gross margin in the quarter was 35%, which was flat to last year. Gross margin for the quarter was impacted by 5 key drivers: First, volume was favorably impacted by increased motorcycle shipments, which were up 13.2% in the quarter and increased Parts and Accessories and General Merchandise sales compared to last year. Second, mix was favorable by $11 million, positively impacted by a higher percentage of Touring shipments and favorable mix within families. Third, raw materials were unfavorable, $9.1 million due to increased metals and fuel costs. Next, foreign currency exchange turned positive during the quarter benefiting gross margin by $4 million. And finally, manufacturing was favorably impacted by restructuring savings, incremental margin on higher volumes, partially offset by approximately $8 million in temporary inefficiencies associated with the transformation underway at our York facility.
On Slide 18, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the second quarter was 16.4% versus 13.9% in 2010. Operating margin was favorably impacted by higher gross margin and lower year-over-year restructuring spending. SG&A was nearly $26 million higher during the quarter compared to the same period last year. Due to a shift in timing of some SG&A spending from 2010 spending patterns, we believe that our spending across the first half is more indicative of the overall rate of spending for the full year.
As we look at as G&A across the first half, it was up $24 million or 5.9%. There are 3 core drivers for the first half spending increase: First, unfavorable currency exchange accounted for nearly 1/3 of the increase or $7.2 million. Next, our product development spending was up nearly $7 million as we execute our focused strategy to deliver remarkable products, utilizing a leaner customer-led approach. And finally, our spending in our international businesses was up nearly $13 million in the first half, which is in line with our objectives to grow international sales at a faster rate than domestic sales and to add between 100 and 150 international dealerships by 2014. 
Excluding these items, largely related to our growth strategy, SG&A spending is up in the first half -- sorry, our SG&A spending in the first half was down slightly compared to prior year. As we invest in our future in order to successfully grow and transform our business according to our strategic plan, we continue to expect SG&A spending to decline as a percent of revenue between 2009 and 2014.
Now moving on to our Financial Services segment on Slide 19. In the second quarter, HDFS operating profit improved $21.2 million or 34.9% compared to last year. The 2 key drivers of the second quarter results were net interest income was $2.6 million higher in the second quarter of 2011 versus the second quarter of 2010 due to lower cost of funds and debt levels, partially offset by reduced revenues on the declining receivables balance; and the provision for retail credit losses was $17.1 million lower in the second quarter 2011 versus the second quarter of 2010, primarily due to improved credit losses as a result of favorable retail receivables performance.
During the quarter, HDFS reduced the total allowance for credit losses on the entire portfolio by $15.3 million to $144.4 million to reflect lower anticipated credit losses and lower receivable balances.
It is important to note that on a year-to-date basis, we have reached approximately $20 million of allowance from the balance sheet, given anticipated credit loss performance across the entire portfolio. While the release of this allowance benefits income this year, we cannot assume a similar financial benefit will reoccur in 2012.
Now Larry will provide more detail on HDFS's operations on Slide 20. Larry?"

During the second quarter, HDFS retail motorcycle loan originations increased 19% or $125 million compared to the same period last year. The increase was driven by higher new motorcycle loan originations behind a strong increase in retail sales and a 2.3 percentage point increase in market share. Used motorcycle loan originations also increased compared to last year. However, as receivables originated prior to the start of the economic downturn, roll off the books, finance receivables outstanding decreased 6.8% compared to year ago. This decline in receivables pool reflects the lower U.S. retail sales over the last 2 years. And that will continue to impact HDFS net interest income.
Over the past several quarters, HDFS has been focused on prudently increasing overall credit application approval rates. And we saw a modest increase in the second quarter, including a slight increase in the percentage of non-prime originations. We are leveraging our nearly 20 years of motorcycle lending experience and looking for opportunities to approve more good well-structured loans. Our goal is to have a portfolio that continues to perform well over time, that delivers an appropriate return on equity.
Moving to portfolio quality, we are very pleased with the improved retail delinquency rate and retail credit losses compared to last year, which you will see on Slide 21. The 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at the end of the second quarter was 3.53% or 97 basis points better than the same date last year. Annualized retail credit losses improved by 98 basis points to 1.06% in the first 6 months compared to the first half of last year. This improvement was driven by the impact of changes in underwriting implemented 2 years ago, as well as the lower frequency of loss and improvements in the recovery values of repossessed motorcycles.
As John mentioned, during the quarter, we reduced the total allowance for credit losses by $15.3 million to reflect lower anticipated credit losses and lower receivable balances. We will continue to evaluate the allowance each quarter using our disciplined process and make adjustments as appropriate.
We are pleased with the continued improvement in credit performance, and we will continue to monitor the unemployment picture, motorcycle recovery values and the pace of the recovery in the economic environment and manage HDFS appropriately.
During the second quarter, HDFS delivered increased profits and maintained a strong liquidity position. We remain focused on enabling retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles while providing an appropriate return to Harley-Davidson Inc.
Now let me turn it back over to John."

You'll see that at the end of the quarter, we have just over $1.2 billion of cash and marketable securities. In addition, HDFS had approximately $1 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facility. In April, the expiring 364-day credit facility was replaced with a new 4-year $675 million facility.
We continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and/or committed credit facilities.
I'm also pleased to report that we increased the second quarter dividend 25% as compared to the first quarter 2011. 
Now I'll review the remaining Harley-Davidson Inc. financials on Slide 23. I would like to highlight 2 items on this Slide. First, with regards the continuing operations, the company generated operating cash of $473 million during the first half of 2011, which included a $200 million contribution to our pension plan. And second, our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 34.8% compared to 36.4% in the first half of 2010. The 2010 effective tax rate to the second quarter was negatively impacted by the healthcare reform legislation, offset by a favorable settlement of an IRS audit.
We continue to expect full year effective income tax rate will approximately 35% for 2011.
Now turning to guidance on Slide 24. We are increasing our expected worldwide motorcycle shipments for the full year 2011. This adjusted rate reflects our comprehensive view of the business, including strong year-to-date retail sales performance and our increased confidence in our ability to minimize the impact from the anticipated subcomponent supply issue related to the aftermath of the earthquake in Japan that we talked about last quarter.
Our guidance also takes into consideration the temporary capacity limitations at York, given the major transformation underway at that facility, as well as concern about the economic recovery, particularly in the U.S. and fragile nature of the worldwide consumer.
As a result, we now expect full year 2011 Harley-Davidson motorcycle shipments to be between 228 million and 235,000 units, up 8% to 12% from 2010.
During the third quarter, we expect to ship between 60,000 and 65,000 units. We are also adjusting gross margin guidance. We now expect full year 2011 gross margin will be between 34% to 35%. This guidance reflects our greater confidence in our ability to minimize the impact from the Japan supply issue, as well as the negative cost impact associated with executing the necessary contingency plans. The new guidance range also takes into account our increased shipment guidance and our 2012 model year price increase, as well as the negative impact of the temporary inefficiencies associated with the transformation at York and higher raw material cost for the full year. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be between $210 million and $230 million, which includes between $70 million and $85 million of capital related to restructuring.
As we look back on the second quarter of 2011, we are certainly happy to report our first year-over-year positive retail sales in the United States since before the economic downturn took hold. We are also excited to be able to increase our 2011 shipment guidance.
We are also encouraged by the strength of the brand, which is demonstrated by solid total demand for new and used Harley-Davidson motorcycles. This strength, as well as firming used bike pricing and stability of new bike prices supported our ability to increase worldwide pricing for the 2012 model year.
Despite our strong Q2 results and improved outlook for the remainder of the year, we recognize the main challenges that lie ahead of us and our customers. And therefore, we will continue to manage the business prudently as we navigate through any uncertainties that the third and fourth quarter of the year might bring.
Overall, the fundamentals of our business are strong, and we are excited about the long-term. We remain focused on executing against our strategies to transform and to grow our business while delivering strong margins, strong returns and value to our shareholders.
Thank you for your continued confidence and investment in Harley-Davidson. And now, let's open up the call to your questions."

Well, a lot of things I mentioned, when I talked about the strategic plan and the intent all along has been to, in a very thoughtful and meaningful way, transform our business. But we really started with the internals, okay? So manufacturing, product development, getting our house in order. And then, the third major component is what we call Retail 2020. And Matt and his team are really leading that initiative. And it's really all about helping our dealers to deliver a great customer-lead experience every day. And so, we're working hard on what are the programs to support type programs that we need to roll out to our dealers to help them do that. What are the metrics and the accountabilities that we need to put in place to make sure that we're driving all of our dealers behaviors to where we want them to be, which is really a simple 2-by-2 matrix. It's a profitable dealers, great customer experience. And so, we're investing in that. We're investing in our international expansion, which is a major part of our strategic plan. And we're also investing more in product development while at the same time leaning the process. So if you think about 2 years ago, when we were investing in 3 different brands and the results of the business were, at that time, deteriorating, we were spending less money on product development. And we were diluting the investment because we were investing in, like I mentioned, 3 different brands. So now, we're able to spend more money on product development, focusing on Harley-Davidson brand to bring some really new, wow, exciting products to our dealer show floors. But our product development process is, at best today, a 5-year process. And we're leaning that to where it will be more 3- to 3.5-year process. So in the very near future, we'll be seeing some of these new products, get our dealers show floor that are intended to do just what our strategic plan mentions, to anchor our existing customer base but to really bring new customers into our dealers show floors and new customers into the Harley-Davidson brand."

And collectively, how do you feel that, that mix will go relative to what you saw with the power pack, the substantial acceptance of the power pack add-on option for model year '11? I guess the root of the question is for the balance of this year and then maybe looking into next year, could mix potentially be better? The comp of the new engines and so forth versus that power pack of last year's as it relates to margin mix?"

U.S. is up about 1%, and Canada is up about 1%, 3/4 represent Europe and largely flat in Latin America and lower in Asia-Pacific by about 2.5%. And that's largely due to the very strong yen and Australian dollar. So we feel very great and very good about our ability to price our motorcycles at this point. And so with that, Tim, let's move on to your second question, which is with regards to mix. Last year, you're absolutely right. We had offered a 103 engine ABS and a security measure, bundled in what we call was a power pack. And we offered that as standard equipment on 3 models last year, Brazil, Ultra Limited, Ultra Guide, and the Road King Class X. In addition, we offered the Power Pack as an option on 5 smiles, and we saw a strong take rate on this option, which drove mixed favorability over the last year. So at model year 2012, product line up, the 103 engine is going to be offered standard on our touring motorcycles. And we'll also be offering what we call the security pack, which is now bundling ABS and the security system together. So when we talk about mix, we expect the second -- we expect mix to be largely flat given the introduction of 103 engine as standard."

Our whole strategy around manufacturing is to be more flexible and to be able to produce product closer to customer demand. There's a lot of reasons in our current structure why we can't do that effectively. And so, our vision for the future is that we want to be customer led in everything we do. So we want our customer to be able to order a bike, get the bike they want, the model they want, the color they want, and to some degree, accessories the way they want it in a reasonable length of time. And that's what HD1 is all about. We look at every one of our customers as a unique individual. And we look at them as wanting a very unique bike, an individualized bike. And HD1 is all about giving our customers the ability to order a bike from the factory, get it at a very reasonable length of time and get it the way it's ordered. We do with the intent to expand that product offering as we go forward, as we get the systems in place, the manufacturing transformations completed and those kinds of things. So we think it's been well received. Our dealers for the most part, I think, like the concept. It's an interesting phenomenon because on average, when our customers order the bike through HD1, they ended up doing more accesorization, when they truck delivery of the bike on average than before. So it's been a good concept."

We feel great about the total demand that we are seeing. Through May, total demand was up 8.2% and that's in relationship to 2010, which was up 3.2%. So we're seeing total demand accelerate in the first half of this year. As we said, we're certainly concerned about some items in the back half, largely the economy and the fragile nature of the worldwide consumer. But we're very pleased with where we see retail sales. So as we took a guidance, we took several things into consideration. One is our year-to-date performance and again, a lot based on the fact that the brand is strong, our market share is good. And then secondly, we looked at the capacity side, which was the other part of your question. There are capacity constraints as we are still moving a tremendous amount of pieces of our York facility.

First of all, on the second quarter, from a manufacturing perspective, we were favorable by $7.2 million. And that follows a first quarter that was unfavorable by $21 million. So we're very pleased with activities that are going on in the manufacturing. So in the first quarter, as we talked about, we felt we hit a high watermark of temporary inefficiencies, driven by the transformation in York of $11 million. That came down in the second quarter, and of course, there's about $8 million of temporary inefficiencies at York. But we're starting to see the restructuring savings come through. And therefore, it's turned positive. So as we look forward, we're going to have to experience temporary inefficiencies throughout the remainder of our work at York, which will take us through the back half of next year. However, the back half, we will be lapping some inefficiencies of about $4 million in the third quarter and $5 million in the fourth quarter. So we expect that it will still be negative but a little bit more favorable. Overall, when you talk about the gross margin percent, again, we're pleased that everything is now positive in the second quarter with the exception of raw materials. And the raw material has quite a drag on the overall margin percent. The other thing that's pulling the percent down a little bit is the fact that the currency, while we've turned positive on currency for the quarter, about $4 million favorable, there was a big impact on revenue for the quarter. So revenue actually during the quarter was positively impacted by $45 million. So that also affects our percent margin on a year-over-year basis and kind of drags it down a little bit because currency is only being added at about an 8% margin versus the motorcycle business that's the 35% range."

So our team in Japan has done a wonderful job working through the issues. We have talked about it at time we have very few of our dealerships that got directly caught up in it. But I think there is a couple. But we couldn't be more pleased with the retail sales from that despite being down. With regards to Brazil, as we've talked about, about halfway through the first quarter, we changed out the 9 existing dealers that we have. We terminated them all and started appointing dealers. At this point, as we end the second quarter, we got 10 dealers appointed. 6 of them are up selling products. And of those 6, about half of them are selling products from temporary locations. So we've got a lot more improvement to come from Brazil's. But James, we do not break out Brazil from the Latin American numbers. But that is the vast majority of the sales are in Brazil. And despite that, we saw sales only down 1% in the second quarter. Again, we couldn't be more pleased with the transition in the team that's working our business in Brazil."

We're in Anaheim, California with our Harley-Davidson dealers from around the world for the Annual Summer Dealer Meeting and new model launch. This is just one of the many ways that we stay close to what's happening at retail, and it gives us the chance to hear what our dealers are thinking. But this morning, we're here to talk about Harley-Davidson's second quarter and 6 months results, and we truly appreciate all of you joining us on today's call.
Over the past 27 months, we had been focused on making changes that we believe will lead to long-term sustainable success for the business and for our dealers around the world. 
So let me begin by thanking our employees, our dealers and our suppliers for all the hard work and dedication that has gone into delivering the kind of results that we announced in our press release earlier today. The company saw a strong improvement in many areas, including income in both the Motorcycle and Financial Services segments. We are pleased by the 7.5% growth in new motorcycle retail sales in the U.S., as well as the growth of Harley-Davidson retail sales on a worldwide basis. With strong second quarter retail sales performance, we have raised our shipment guidance for the year as we look to support our retail sales activity. The change in shipment guidance also reflects our confidence in being able to maintain continuity of supply for several subcomponents in the aftermath of the March earthquake in Japan. Our supply management team has done an outstanding job of mitigating supply chain risks resulting in no expected downtime or interruption in our production due to these issues.
And while we remain cautious about consumer confidence and the economy in general, we are pleased with the company's second quarter results, which reflect the transformation that is taking place at Harley-Davidson, and the strength of the Harley-Davidson brand around the world.
In late 2009, we laid out our strategic plan, which was based on 4 pillars: Growth, continuous improvement, leadership development and sustainability with the intention to transform our business and become best in class in areas that are critical to our long-term success. Our transformation focuses on 3 main areas: Manufacturing, product development and excellence at retail.
Over the next few weeks, we will reach a milestone in our manufacturing transformation as we combine Touring and Softail motorcycle production at our York assembly operations with one modern efficient operation. We expect the total transformation of our manufacturing operations will be completed by the end of next year. I'd like to note that our employees, our union leadership and management are fully engaged in delivering a sustainable world class manufacturing capability.
And similarly, in product development, we're making tremendous progress in our implementation of lean engineering. The transformation and product development is resulting in reduced time-to-market with new innovative products and more capacity to deliver new models. And we will increasingly see the results of this work over the next few years.
The third cornerstone of our transformation is excellence at retail, and that's something that we'll be talking a lot about over the next few days here in Anaheim with our dealers from around the world. Harley-Davidson is embarking on a long-term global initiative called Retail 2020 that will provide the clarity and vision to take the Harley-Davidson retail experience to a new level, with outstanding customer-led experience every day, every time, everywhere. And through Retail 2020, we will position both the company and our network of independent dealers to profitably meet the constantly evolving needs of our customers. This will include a completely revamped e-commerce capability that we expect to roll out in 2012.
So to wrap up, let me reiterate how proud I am of our progress as one company and one team, working in one direction. Together with our dealers, we are transforming our business and increasingly taking our iconic brand to the many roads of the world to fulfill the dreams of our customers. 
I'll be back later for questions. But now, let me turn it over to John for a deeper dive into our results and our updated guidance."

I'll review the financial results starting on Slide 11 with the second quarter results. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson Inc. consolidated revenue was up 15%, behind a 13.2% increase in shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Our second quarter income from continuing operations improved to $190.6 million, an increase of 36.8%. Similarly, diluted earnings per share rose to $0.81 per share, up from the year ago quarter, which was $0.59 per share.
Operating income for the Motorcycle business was up over 39% compared to last year's second quarter. The strong increase in Motorcycle business was driven by increased motorcycle shipments and lower spending on ongoing restructuring activities, partially offset by increased spending and our growth initiatives.
Our improved financial performance for the quarter was also driven by strong operating income at HDFS and lower year-over-year interest expense as a result of last December's repurchase of 297 million of high interest notes, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate as compared to last year.
We are very pleased with the second quarter results and our continued progress against our growth strategies and the transformation of our business.
Now let's take a look at retail sales on Slide 12. Overall, worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were up 5.6% in the second quarter. The big news for the second quarter was that retail sales in the U.S. were up 7.5% compared to last year. We are very pleased to report these positive results for the U.S. market, which represent the first quarterly growth in the past 17 quarters. Market share in the U.S. was 53.9%, up 1.5 percentage points compared to last year's second quarter as the Harley-Davidson brand continues to show strength, while the competition continues to aggressively discount prices to move aging inventory.
International markets grew 2.4% during the quarter, driven by growth in the Asia-Pacific and Europe regions. The Asia-Pacific region was up 6.7%, driven primarily by strength in emerging markets in the region. Retail sales in Japan were down 3.4%, which represents a considerable improvement from the first quarter which was down 9.3%, following the earthquake and tsunami.
Following very strong first quarter results, retail sales in Europe region were up 2.6% in the quarter compared to 2010. On a sequential basis, this compares to year-over-year retail sales growth in Europe of 23% in the first quarter of this year. 
Looking back to 2010, limited product availability in Europe constrained retail sales in the first quarter, while improved product availability benefited second quarter retail sales in that market. Consequently, year-over-year comparisons were relatively easy in Q1 and tougher in Q2. Overall, we are pleased with Europe's first half growth, which was up 9.3%.
Retail sales in both Canada and the Latin America region were down slightly versus last year. Canada was down 2.1%, and Latin America region was down 1.0% compared to last year.
In Brazil, the new dealer network is coming up to speed. As we discussed last quarter, we closed all existing dealerships and have appointed 10 new dealers. This was planned as part of the agreement that we announced in December 2010 to terminate the exclusive dealer contract that was in place and to expand our presence in Brazil. Again, we are very pleased with the worldwide dealer network's overall retail performance during the second quarter.
On Slide 13, you will see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the quarter are up compared to last year and at the high-end of our expected shipment range of 62,000 to 67,000 motorcycles for the quarter. During the quarter, mix shifted between Touring and custom motorcycles, largely due to the York restructuring, which shut down Softail production line in preparation for the consolidated production of all models built in York onto one line.
Sportster represented 24% of total shipments, which was in line with last year's Sportster mix. We expect Sportster as a percent of total shipment will be within the historical range of 18% to 22% for the full year.
Shipments of the 2012 Touring and Sportster motorcycles started at the end of June. Generally, we ship new model year motorcycles after they are introduced to dealers towards the end of July. However, as a result of the inventory situation in the U.S., we began shipping Touring and Sportster models 3 weeks early. Tomorrow, we will introduce the 2012 Dyna, Softail and VRSC motorcycles to our dealers here in Anaheim.
Slide 14 provides some additional detail on the U.S. dealer network inventory and the strength of our brand as measured by total demand. During the second quarter in the U.S., we shipped about 42,600 Harley-Davidson motorcycles, and our dealers sold roughly 53,600 at retail. As a result of strong second quarter retail sales, the U.S. dealer network inventory was drawn down about 11,000 units from the first quarter of 2011, and was down about 3,500 units compared to last year's second quarter. 
Consequently, aggregate U.S. dealer inventories continue to be below what we believe is an appropriate ongoing level, and we will continue to work toward replenishing dealer inventory levels of new motorcycles. We also continue to support the dealers' efforts to sell more used bikes. Healthy used bike sales enhance dealer revenue, maintain resale values and help narrow the gap between new and used motorcycle pricing. Used bike sales by the U.S. dealer networks continue to be up double digits through May, compared to the same period last year.
When these used bikes are combined with new retail sales in the U.S., total demand for Harley-Davidson motorcycles continues to be strong. This reinforces the strength of the Harley-Davidson brand.
On Slide 15, you'll see revenue for the Motorcycles and Related Products segment was up in the second quarter behind strong growth from all our businesses. During the quarter, average motorcycle revenue for Harley-Davidson units sold increased $968 from the prior year as a result of favorable currency exchange and improved product mix. The increase in average revenue, coupled with a 13.2% increase in shipments, drove Harley-Davidson motorcycle revenue growth to nearly 21% compared to last year. 
Parts and Accessories sales were up over 10% for the quarter and year-to-date, driven in part by a focus on product availability, high demand for our new accessory product offerings and growth in worldwide retail motorcycle sales.
General Merchandise was up over 8% in the quarter compared to last year, largely related to the timing of delivery of product between the first and second quarters of this year.
As we launch the remaining 2012 model year motorcycles tomorrow, we expect revenue will be favorably impacted by approximately 0.5% price increase on a worldwide basis. This is the first meaningful price increase that we have taken on motorcycles since 2007. We feel the price increase reflects the consumer value that has been added to many of our Big Twin motorcycles, and believe the timing is prudent, given the strength of the brand and the tight inventory situation in the U.S.
Turning to restructuring on Slide 16. Our efforts to improve our cost structure and transform the business to be stronger and more profitable in the future are well underway. During the second quarter, we incurred $13.6 million of restructuring expenses and $36.6 million year-to-date. Restructuring activities are largely on plan through the first half of the year. However, we have adjusted 2011, 2012 and expect the total costs associated with all restructuring activities. 
As you will see, we are reducing the expected restructuring costs for 2011 from $95 million to $105 million to $80 million to $90 million, and 2012 costs from $30 million to $35 million, to $25 million to $30 million. The total costs are now expected to be $490 million to $505 million.
Additionally, we are increasing our 2011 capital spending estimates associated with restructuring activities from a range of $60 million to $75 million, to $70 million to $85 million. The expected savings included in the summary are unchanged.
On Slide 17, you will see gross margin in the quarter was 35%, which was flat to last year. Gross margin for the quarter was impacted by 5 key drivers. First, volume was favorably impacted by increased motorcycle shipments, which were up 13.2% in the quarter, and increased Parts and Accessories and General Merchandise sales compared to last year. Second, mix was favorable by $11 million, positively impacted by a higher percentage of Touring shipments and favorable mix within families. Third, raw materials were unfavorable, $9.1 million due to increased metals and fuel costs. Next, foreign currency exchange turned positive during the quarter benefiting gross margin by $4 million. And finally, manufacturing was favorably impacted by restructuring savings, incremental margin on higher volumes, partially offset by approximately $8 million in temporary inefficiencies associated with the transformation underway at our York facility.
On Slide 18, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the second quarter was 16.4% versus 13.9% in 2010. Operating margin was favorably impacted by higher gross margin and lower year-over-year restructuring spending. SG&A was nearly $26 million higher during the quarter compared to the same period last year. Due to a shift in timing of some SG&A spending from 2010 spending patterns, we believe that our spending across the first half is more indicative of the overall rate of spending for the full year.
As we look at SG&A across the first half, it was up $24 million or 5.9%. There are 3 core drivers for the first half spending increase. First, unfavorable currency exchange accounted for nearly 1/3 of the increase or $7.2 million. Next, our product development spending was up nearly $7 million as we execute our focus strategy to deliver remarkable products, utilizing a leaner customer-led approach. And finally, our spending on our international businesses was up nearly $13 million in the first half, which is in line with our objectives to grow international sales at a faster rate than domestic sales, and to add between 100 and 150 international dealerships by 2014. 
Excluding these items largely related to our growth strategy, SG&A spending is up in the first half -- I'm sorry, SG&A spending in the first half was down slightly compared to prior year. As we invest in our future in order to successfully grow and transform our business according to our strategic plan, we continue to expect SG&A spending to decline as a percent of revenue between 2009 and 2014.
Now moving on to our Financial Services segment on Slide 19. In the second quarter, HDFS operating profit improved $21.2 million or 34.9% compared to last year. The 2 key drivers of the second quarter results were: Net interest income was $2.6 million higher in the second quarter of 2011 versus the second quarter of 2010 due to lower cost of funds and debt levels, partially offset by reduced revenues on the declining receivables balance; and the provision for retail credit losses was $17.1 million lower in the second quarter of 2011 versus the second quarter of 2010, primarily due to improved credit losses as a result of favorable retail receivables performance.
During the quarter, HDFS reduced the total allowance for credit losses on the entire portfolio by $15.3 million to $144.4 million to reflect lower anticipated credit losses and lower receivable balances.
It is important to note that on a year-to-date basis, we have released approximately $20 million of allowance from the balance sheet, given anticipated credit loss performance across the entire portfolio. While the release of this allowance benefits income this year, we cannot assume a similar financial benefit will reoccur in 2012.
Now Larry will provide more details on HDFS's operations on Slide 20. Larry?"

During the second quarter, HDFS retail motorcycle loan originations increased 19% or $125 million compared to the same period last year.

During the second quarter, HDFS retail motorcycle loan originations increased 19% or $125 million compared to the same period last year. The increase was driven by higher new motorcycle loan originations behind a strong increase in retail sales and a 2.3 percentage point increase in market share. Used motorcycle loan originations also increased compared to last year. However, as receivables originated prior to the start of the economic downturn roll off the books, finance receivables outstanding decreased 6.8% compared to year ago. This declining receivables pool reflects the lower U.S. retail sales over the last 2 years, and that will continue to impact HDFS net interest income.
Over the past several quarters, HDFS has been focused on prudently increasing overall credit application approval rates. And we saw a modest increase in the second quarter, including a slight increase in the percentage of non-prime originations. We are leveraging our nearly 20 years of motorcycle lending experience and looking for opportunities to approve more good, well-structured loans. Our goal is to have a portfolio that continues to perform well over time that delivers an appropriate return on equity.
Moving to portfolio quality, we are very pleased with the improved retail delinquency rate and retail credit losses compared to last year, which you will see on Slide 21. The 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at the end of the second quarter was 3.53% or 97 basis points better than the same date last year. Annualized retail credit losses improved by 98 basis points to 1.06% in the first 6 months compared to the first half of last year. This improvement was driven by the impact of changes in underwriting implemented 2 years ago, as well as a lower frequency of loss and improvements in the recovery values of repossessed motorcycles.
As John mentioned, during the quarter, we reduced the total allowance for credit losses by $15.3 million to reflect lower anticipated credit losses and lower receivable balances. We will continue to evaluate the allowance each quarter using our disciplined process and make adjustments as appropriate.
We are pleased with the continued improvement in credit performance, and we will continue to monitor the unemployment picture, motorcycle recovery values and the pace of the recovery in the U.S. economic environment and manage HDFS appropriately.
During the second quarter, HDFS delivered increased profits and maintained a strong liquidity position. We remain focused on enabling retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles while providing an appropriate return to Harley-Davidson Inc.
Now let me turn it back to John."

You'll see that at the end of the quarter, we had just over $1.2 billion of cash and marketable securities. In addition, HDFS had approximately $1 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. In April, the expiring 364-day credit facility was replaced with a new 4-year $675 million facility.
We continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and/or committed credit facilities. I'm also pleased to report that we increased the second quarter dividend to 25% as compared to the first quarter of 2011. 
Now I'll review the remaining Harley-Davidson Inc. financials on Slide 23. I would like to highlight 2 items on this Slide. First, with regards to continuing operations, the company generated operating cash of $473 million during the first half of 2011, which included a $200 million contribution to our pension plan. And second, our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 34.8%, compared to 36.4% in the first half of 2010. The 2010 effective tax rate to the second quarter was negatively impacted by the healthcare reform legislation, offset by a favorable settlement of an IRS audit.
We continue to expect the full year effective income tax rate will be approximately 35% for 2011.
Now turning to guidance on Slide 24. We are increasing our expected worldwide motorcycle shipments for the full year 2011. This adjusted rate reflects our comprehensive view of the business, including strong year-to-date retail sales performance and our increased confidence in our ability to minimize the impact from the anticipated subcomponent supply issue related to the aftermath of the earthquake in Japan that we talked about last quarter.
Our guidance also takes into consideration the temporary capacity limitations at York, given the major transformation underway at that facility, as well as concern about the economic recovery, particularly in the U.S. and the fragile nature of the worldwide consumer.
As a result, we now expect full year 2011 Harley-Davidson motorcycle shipments to be between 228,000 and 235,000 units, up 8% to 12% from 2010.
During the third quarter, we expect to ship between 60,000 and 65,000 units. We are also adjusting gross margin guidance. We now expect full year 2011 gross margin will be between 34% to 35%. This guidance reflects our greater confidence in our ability to minimize the impact from the Japan supply issue, as well as the negative cost impact associated with executing the necessary contingency plans. The new guidance range also takes into account our increased shipment guidance and our 2012 model year price increase, as well as the negative impact of the temporary inefficiencies associated with the transformation at York and higher raw material costs for the full year. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be between $210 million and $230 million, which includes between $70 million and $85 million of capital related to restructuring.
As we look back on the second quarter of 2011, we are certainly happy to report our first year-over-year positive retail sales in the United States since before the economic downturn took hold. We're also excited to be able to increase our 2011 shipment guidance.
We are also encouraged by the strength of the brand, which is demonstrated by solid total demand for new and used Harley-Davidson motorcycles. This strength, as well as firming used bike pricing and stability of new bike prices, supported our ability to increase worldwide pricing for the 2012 model year.
Despite our strong Q2 results and improved outlook for the remainder of the year, we recognize the main challenges that lie ahead of us and our customers. And therefore, we will continue to manage the business prudently as we navigate through any uncertainties that the third and fourth quarter of the year might bring.
Overall, the fundamentals of our business are strong, and we are excited about the long-term. We remain focused on executing against our strategies to transform and to grow our business while delivering strong margins, strong returns and value to our shareholders.
Thank you for your continued confidence and investment in Harley-Davidson. And now, let's open up the call to your questions."

Well, one of the things I mentioned when I talked about the strategic plan and the intent all along has been to, in a very thoughtful and meaningful way, transform our business. But we really started with the internals, okay? So manufacturing, product development, getting our house in order. And then the third major component is what we call Retail 2020, and Matt Levatich and his team are really leading that initiative. And it's really all about helping our dealers to deliver a great customer-led experience everyday. And so, we're working hard on what are the programs, the support-type programs that we need to roll out to our dealers to help them do that? What are the metrics and the accountabilities that we need to put in place to make sure that we're driving all of our dealers' behaviors to where we want them to be, which is really a simple 2-by-2 matrix. It's profitable dealers, great customer experience. And so, we're investing in that. We're investing in our international expansion, which is a major part of our strategic plan. And we're also investing more in product development, while at the same time leaning the process. So if you think about 2 years ago, when we were investing in 3 different brands and the results of the business were, at that time, deteriorating, we were spending less money on product development and we were diluting the investment because we were investing in, like I mentioned, 3 different brands. So now, we're able to spend more money on product development, focus it on Harley-Davidson brand to bring some really new, wow, exciting products to our dealer show floors. But our product development process is, at best, today, a 5-year process. And we're leaning that to where it'd be more like a 3- to 3.5-year process. So in the very near future, we'll be seeing some of these new products, get our dealers show floor that are intended to do just what our strategic plan mentions, to anchor our existing customer base but to really bring new customers into our dealers' show floors, and new customers into the Harley-Davidson brand."

And so with that, Tim, let's move on to your second question, which is with regards to mix. Last year, you're absolutely right. We had offered a 103 engine ABS and a security measure, bundled in what we call was a power pack. And we offered that as standard equipment on 3 models last year with the Ultra Limited, the Road Guide Ultra and the Road King Class X. In addition, we offered the power pack as an option on 5 models, and we saw a strong take rate on this option which drove mixed favorability over the last year. So with model year 2012, product lineup with the 103 engine is going to be offered standard on our Touring motorcycles. And we'll also be offering what we call the security pack, which is now bundling ABS and the security system together. So when we talk about mix, we expect the second -- we expect mix to be largely flat, given the introduction of the 103 engine as a standard."

So we want our customer to be able to order a bike, get the bike they want, the model they want, the color they want, and to some degree, accessories the way they want it in a reasonable length of time. And that's really what H-D1 is all about. We look at every one of our customers as a unique individual, and we look at them as wanting a very unique bike, an individualized bike. And so H-D1 is all about giving our customers the ability to order a bike from the factory, get it in a very reasonable length of time and get it the way it's ordered. We do intend to expand that product offering as we go forward, as we get the systems in place, the manufacturing transformations completed and those kinds of things. And we think it's been well received. Our dealers, for the most part, I think, like the concept. It's an interesting phenomenon because on average, when our customers order the bike through H-D1, they ended up doing more accessorization, when they took delivery of the bike, on average, than before.

First of all, in the second quarter, from a manufacturing perspective, we were favorable by $7.2 million. And that follows a first quarter that was unfavorable by $21 million. So we're very pleased with the activities that are going on in manufacturing. So in the first quarter, as we talked about, we felt we hit a high watermark of temporary inefficiencies, driven by the transformation at York of $11 million. That came down in the second quarter and posted about $8 million of temporary inefficiencies at York, but we're starting to see the restructuring savings come through. And therefore, it's turned positive. So as we look forward, we're going to have to experience the temporary inefficiencies throughout the remainder of our work at York, which will take us through the first half of next year. However, the back half, we will be lapping some inefficiencies of about $4 million in the third quarter and $5 million in the fourth quarter. So we expect that to still be negative, but a little bit more favorable. Overall, when you talk about the gross margin percent, again, we're pleased that everything is now positive in the second quarter with the exception of raw materials. And the raw materials has quite a drag on the overall margin percent. The other thing that's pulling the percent down a little bit is the fact that the currency, while we've turned positive on currency for the quarter, now $4 million favorable, there was a big impact on revenue for the quarter. So revenue actually during the quarter was positively impacted by $45 million. So that also affects our percent margin on a year-over-year basis and kind of drags it down a little bit because currency is only being added at about an 8% margin versus the motorcycle business that's on the 35% range."

Again, given some of the constraints and how well retail sales are is inventories were down again in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis, about 3,500 units. As we move forward through the remainder of the year, we would hope to build up inventories a little bit to be a little bit ahead of where we were at the end of last year. So at that time, we felt again on an ongoing basis that we're a little bit lower than we needed to be. Actually, inventories at this point in the second quarter go back to about 2002 levels."

However, there is a cost with regards to that. As we had mentioned last quarter, we changed our shipping locations, and you can see some of that in the shipment data between the U.S. and Japan. There's some impacts on mix. And then there's just a overall cost of retooling other suppliers and so on and so forth. We do not have a number for that and those costs and expenses continue.

And we couldn't be more pleased with the retail sales from that despite them being down. With regards to Brazil, as we have talked about, about halfway through the first quarter, we changed out the 9 existing dealers that we had. We terminated them all and started appointing dealers. At this point, as we end the second quarter, we've got 10 dealers appointed. 6 of them are off selling products. And of those 6, about half of them are selling products from temporary locations.

We're in Anaheim, California, with our Harley-Davidson dealers from around the world for the Annual Summer Dealer Meeting and new model launch. This is just one of the many ways that we stay close to what's happening at retail, and it gives us the chance to hear what our dealers are thinking. But this morning, we're here to talk about Harley-Davidson's second quarter and 6 months results, and we truly appreciate all of you joining us on today's call.
Over the past 27 months, we have been focused on making changes that we believe will lead to long-term sustainable success for the business and for our dealers around the world. 
So let me begin by thanking our employees, our dealers and our suppliers for all the hard work and dedication that has gone into delivering the kind of results that we announced in our press release earlier today. The company saw strong improvement in many areas, including income, in both the Motorcycle and Financial Services segments. We are pleased by the 7.5% growth in new motorcycle retail sales in the U.S., as well as the growth of Harley-Davidson retail sales on a worldwide basis. With strong second quarter retail sales performance, we have raised our shipment guidance for the year as we look to support our retail sales activity. The change in shipment guidance also reflects our confidence in being able to maintain continuity of supply for several subcomponents in the aftermath of the March earthquake in Japan. Our supply management team has done an outstanding job of mitigating supply chain risks resulting in no expected downtime or interruption in our production due to these issues.
And while we remain cautious about consumer confidence and the economy in general, we are pleased with the company's second quarter results, which reflect the transformation that is taking place at Harley-Davidson and the strength of the Harley-Davidson brand around the world.
In late 2009, we laid out our strategic plan, which was based on 4 pillars: Growth, continuous improvement, leadership development and sustainability with the intention to transform our business and become best in class in areas that are critical to our long-term success. Our transformation focuses on 3 main areas: Manufacturing, product development and excellence at retail.
Over the next few weeks, we will reach a milestone in our manufacturing transformation as we combine Touring and Softail motorcycle production at our York assembly operations with one modern, efficient operation. We expect the total transformation of our manufacturing operations will be completed by the end of next year. I'd like to note that our employees, our union leadership and management are fully engaged in delivering a sustainable world-class manufacturing capability.
And similarly, in product development, we're making tremendous progress in our implementation of lean engineering. The transformation and product development is resulting in reduced time-to-market with new innovative products and more capacity to deliver new models. And we will increasingly see the results of this work over the next few years.
The third cornerstone of our transformation is excellence at retail, and that's something that we'll be talking a lot about over the next few days here in Anaheim with our dealers from around the world. Harley-Davidson is embarking on a long-term global initiative called Retail 2020 that will provide the clarity and vision to take the Harley-Davidson retail experience to a new level, with outstanding customer-led experience every day, every time, everywhere. And through Retail 2020, we will position both the company and our network of independent dealers to profitably meet the constantly evolving needs of our customers. This will include a completely revamped e-commerce capability that we expect to roll out in 2012.
So to wrap up, let me reiterate how proud I am of our progress as one company and one team working in one direction. Together with our dealers, we are transforming our business and increasingly taking our iconic brand to the many roads of the world to fulfill the dreams of our customers. 
I'll be back later for questions. But now, let me turn it over to John for a deeper dive into our results and our updated guidance."

I'll review the financial results starting on Slide 11 with the second quarter results. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson Inc. consolidated revenue was up 15%, behind a 13.2% increase in shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Our second quarter income from continuing operations improved to $190.6 million, an increase of 36.8%. Similarly, diluted earnings per share rose to $0.81 per share, up from the year-ago quarter, which was $0.59 per share.
Operating income for the Motorcycle business was up over 39% compared to last year's second quarter. The strong increase in Motorcycle business was driven by increased motorcycle shipments and lower spending on ongoing restructuring activities, partially offset by increased spending on our growth initiatives.
Our improved financial performance for the quarter was also driven by strong operating income at HDFS and lower year-over-year interest expense as a result of last December's repurchase of $297 million of high-interest notes, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate as compared to last year.
We are very pleased with the second quarter results and our continued progress against our growth strategies and the transformation of our business.
Now let's take a look at retail sales on Slide 12. Overall, worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were up 5.6% in the second quarter. The big news for the second quarter was that retail sales in the U.S. were up 7.5% compared to last year. We are very pleased to report these positive results for the U.S. market, which represent the first quarterly growth in the past 17 quarters. Market share in the U.S. was 53.9%, up 1.5 percentage points compared to last year's second quarter, as the Harley-Davidson brand continues to show strength, while the competition continues to aggressively discount prices to move aging inventory.
International markets grew 2.4% during the quarter, driven by growth in the Asia-Pacific and Europe regions. The Asia-Pacific region was up 6.7%, driven primarily by strength in emerging markets in the region. Retail sales in Japan were down 3.4%, which represents a considerable improvement from the first quarter which was down 9.3%, following the earthquake and tsunami.
Following very strong first quarter results, retail sales in Europe region were up 2.6% in the quarter compared to 2010. On a sequential basis, this compares to year-over-year retail sales growth in Europe of 23% in the first quarter of this year. 
Looking back to 2010, limited product availability in Europe constrained retail sales in the first quarter, while improved product availability benefited second quarter retail sales in that market. Consequently, year-over-year comparisons were relatively easy in Q1 and tougher in Q2. Overall, we are pleased with Europe's first half growth, which was up 9.3%.
Retail sales in both Canada and the Latin America region were down slightly versus last year. Canada was down 2.1%, and Latin America region was down 1.0% compared to last year.
In Brazil, the new dealer network is coming up to speed. As we discussed last quarter, we closed all existing dealerships and have appointed 10 new dealers. This was planned as part of the agreement that we announced in December 2010 to terminate the exclusive dealer contract that was in place and to expand our presence in Brazil. Again, we are very pleased with the worldwide dealer network's overall retail performance during the second quarter.
On Slide 13, you will see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the quarter were up compared to last year and at the high end of our expected shipment range of 62,000 to 67,000 motorcycles for the quarter. During the quarter, mix shifted between Touring and custom motorcycles, largely due to the York restructuring, which shut down the Softail production line in preparation for the consolidated production of all models built in York onto one line.
Sportster represented 24% of total shipments, which was in line with last year's Sportster mix. We expect that Sportster as a percent of total shipments will be within the historical range of 18% to 22% for the full year.
Shipments of the 2012 Touring and Sportster motorcycles started at the end of June. Generally, we ship new model year motorcycles after they are introduced to dealers toward the end of July. However, as a result of the inventory situation in the U.S., we began shipping Touring and Sportster models 3 weeks early. Tomorrow, we will introduce the 2012 Dyna, Softail and VRSC motorcycles to our dealers here in Anaheim.
Slide 14 provides some additional detail on the U.S. dealer network inventory and the strength of our brand as measured by total demand. During the second quarter in the U.S., we shipped about 42,600 Harley-Davidson motorcycles, and our dealers sold roughly 53,600 at retail. As a result of strong second quarter retail sales, the U.S. dealer network inventory was drawn down about 11,000 units from the first quarter of 2011, and was down about 3,500 units compared to last year's second quarter. 
Consequently, aggregate U.S. dealer inventories continue to be below what we believe is an appropriate ongoing level, and we will continue to work toward replenishing dealer inventory levels of new motorcycles. We also continue to support the dealers' efforts to sell more used bikes. Healthy used bike sales enhance dealer revenues, maintain resale values and help narrow the gap between new and used motorcycle pricing. Used bike sales by the U.S. dealer networks continue to be up double digits through May, compared to the same period last year.
When these used bikes are combined with new retail sales in the U.S., total demand for Harley-Davidson motorcycles continues to be strong. This reinforces the strength of the Harley-Davidson brand.
On Slide 15, you'll see revenue for the Motorcycles and Related Products segment was up in the second quarter behind strong growth from all our businesses. During the quarter, average motorcycle revenue for Harley-Davidson units sold increased $968 from the prior year as a result of favorable currency exchange and improved product mix. The increase in average revenue, coupled with a 13.2% increase in shipments, drove Harley-Davidson motorcycle revenue growth to nearly 21% compared to last year. 
Parts and Accessory sales were up over 10% for the quarter and year-to-date, driven in part by a focus on product availability, high demand for our new accessory product offerings and growth in worldwide retail motorcycle sales.
General Merchandise was up over 8% in the quarter compared to last year, largely related to the timing of delivery of product between the first and second quarters of this year.
As we launch the remaining 2012 model year motorcycles tomorrow, we expect revenue will be favorably impacted by approximately 0.5% price increase on a worldwide basis. This is the first meaningful price increase that we have taken on motorcycles since 2007. We feel the price increase reflects the consumer value that has been added to many of our Big Twin motorcycles, and believe the timing is prudent, given the strength of the brand and the tight inventory situation in the U.S.
Turning to restructuring on Slide 16. Our efforts to improve our cost structure and transform the business to be stronger and more profitable in the future are well underway. During the second quarter, we incurred $13.6 million in restructuring expenses and $36.6 million year-to-date. Restructuring activities are largely on plan through the first half of the year. However, we have adjusted 2011, 2012 and expected total costs associated with all restructuring activities. 
As you will see, we are reducing the expected restructuring costs for 2011 from $95 million to $105 million to $80 million to $90 million, and 2012 costs from $30 million to $35 million to $25 million to $30 million. The total costs are now expected to be $490 million to $505 million.
Additionally, we are increasing our 2011 capital spending estimates associated with restructuring activities from a range of $60 million to $75 million to $70 million to $85 million. The expected savings included in the summary are unchanged.
On Slide 17, you will see gross margin in the quarter was 35%, which was flat to last year. Gross margin for the quarter was impacted by 5 key drivers. First, volume was favorably impacted by increased motorcycle shipments, which were up 13.2% in the quarter, and increased Parts and Accessories and General Merchandise sales compared to last year. Second, mix was favorable by $11 million, positively impacted by a higher percentage of Touring shipments and favorable mix within families. Third, raw materials were unfavorable, $9.1 million due to increased metals and fuel costs. Next, foreign currency exchange turned positive during the quarter benefiting gross margin by $4 million. And finally, manufacturing was favorably impacted by restructuring savings, incremental margin on higher volumes, partially offset by approximately $8 million in temporary inefficiencies associated with the transformation underway at our York facility.
On Slide 18, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the second quarter was 16.4% versus 13.9% in 2010. Operating margin was favorably impacted by higher gross margin and lower year-over-year restructuring spending. SG&A was nearly $26 million higher during the quarter compared to the same period last year. Due to a shift in timing of some SG&A spending from 2010 spending patterns, we believe that our spending across the first half is more indicative of the overall rate of spending for the full year.
As we look at SG&A across the first half, it was up $24 million or 5.9%. There are 3 core drivers for the first half spending increase. First, unfavorable currency exchange accounted for nearly 1/3 of the increase or $7.2 million. Next, our product development spending was up nearly $7 million as we execute our focus strategy to deliver remarkable products, utilizing a leaner customer-led approach. And finally, our spending on our international businesses was up nearly $13 million in the first half, which is in line with our objectives to grow international sales at a faster rate than domestic sales, and to add between 100 and 150 international dealerships by 2014. 
Excluding these items largely related to our growth strategy, SG&A spending is up in the first half -- I'm sorry, SG&A spending in the first half was down slightly compared to prior year. As we invest in our future in order to successfully grow and transform our business according to our strategic plan, we continue to expect SG&A spending to decline as a percent of revenue between 2009 and 2014.
Now moving on to our Financial Services segment on Slide 19. In the second quarter, HDFS operating profit improved $21.2 million or 34.9% compared to last year. The 2 key drivers of the second quarter results were: Net interest income was $2.6 million higher in the second quarter of 2011 versus the second quarter of 2010 due to lower cost of funds and debt levels, partially offset by reduced revenues on the declining receivables balance; and the provision for retail credit losses was $17.1 million lower in the second quarter of 2011 versus the second quarter of 2010, primarily due to improved credit losses as a result of favorable retail receivables performance.
During the quarter, HDFS reduced the total allowance for credit losses on the entire portfolio by $15.3 million to $144.4 million to reflect lower anticipated credit losses and lower receivable balances.
It is important to note that on a year-to-date basis, we have released approximately $28 million of allowance from the balance sheet, given anticipated credit loss performance across the entire portfolio. While the release of this allowance benefits income this year, we cannot assume a similar financial benefit will reoccur in 2012.
Now Larry will provide more details on HDFS's operations on Slide 20. Larry?"

During the second quarter, HDFS retail motorcycle loan originations increased 19% or $125 million compared to the same period last year. The increase was driven by higher new motorcycle loan originations behind a strong increase in retail sales and a 2.3 percentage point increase in market share. Used motorcycle loan originations also increased compared to last year. However, as receivables originated prior to the start of the economic downturn rolled off the books, finance receivables outstanding decreased 6.8% compared to a year ago. This declining receivable pool reflects the lower U.S. retail sales over the last 2 years, and that will continue to impact HDFS net interest income.
Over the past several quarters, HDFS has been focused on prudently increasing overall credit application approval rates. And we saw a modest increase in the second quarter, including a slight increase in the percentage of non-prime originations. We are leveraging our nearly 20 years of motorcycle lending experience and looking for opportunities to approve more good, well-structured loans. Our goal is to have a portfolio that continues to perform well over time that delivers an appropriate return on equity.
Moving to portfolio quality. We are very pleased with the improved retail delinquency rate and retail credit losses compared to last year, which you will see on Slide 21. The 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at the end of the second quarter was 3.53% or 97 basis points better than the same date last year. Annualized retail credit losses improved by 98 basis points to 1.06% in the first 6 months compared to the first half of last year. This improvement was driven by the impact of changes in underwriting implemented 2 years ago, as well as a lower frequency of loss and improvement in the recovery values of repossessed motorcycles.
As John mentioned, during the quarter, we reduced the total allowance for credit losses by $15.3 million to reflect lower anticipated credit losses and lower receivable balances. We will continue to evaluate the allowance each quarter using our disciplined process and make adjustments as appropriate.
We are pleased with the continued improvement in credit performance, and we will continue to monitor the unemployment picture, motorcycle recovery values and the pace of the recovery in the U.S. economic environment and manage HDFS appropriately.
During the second quarter, HDFS delivered increased profits and maintained a strong liquidity position. We remain focused on enabling retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles while providing an appropriate return to Harley-Davidson Inc.
Now let me turn it back to John."

You'll see that at the end of the quarter, we had just over $1.2 billion of cash and marketable securities. In addition, HDFS had approximately $1 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. In April, the expiring 364-day credit facility was replaced with a new 4-year $675 million facility.
We continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and/or committed credit facilities. I am also pleased to report that we increased the second quarter dividend 25% as compared to the first quarter of 2011. 
Now I'll review the remaining Harley-Davidson Inc. financials on Slide 23. I would like to highlight 2 items on this Slide. First, with regards to continuing operations, the company generated operating cash of $473 million during the first half of 2011, which included a $200 million contribution to our pension plan. And second, our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 34.8%, compared to 36.4% in the first half of 2010. The 2010 effective tax rate through the second quarter was negatively impacted by the healthcare reform legislation, offset by a favorable settlement of an IRS audit.
We continue to expect full year effective income tax rate will be approximately 35% for 2011.
Now turning to guidance on Slide 24. We are increasing our expected worldwide motorcycle shipments for the full year 2011. This adjusted rate reflects our comprehensive view of the business, including strong year-to-date retail sales performance and our increased confidence in our ability to minimize the impact from the anticipated subcomponent supply issue related to the aftermath of the earthquake in Japan that we talked about last quarter.
Our guidance also takes into consideration the temporary capacity limitations at York, given the major transformation underway at that facility, as well as concern about the economic recovery, particularly in the U.S.,and the fragile nature of the worldwide consumer.
As a result, we now expect full year 2011 Harley-Davidson motorcycle shipments to be between 228,000 and 235,000 units, up 8% to 12% from 2010.
During the third quarter, we expect to ship between 60,000 and 65,000 units. We are also adjusting gross margin guidance. We now expect full year 2011 gross margin will be between 34% to 35%. This guidance reflects our greater confidence in our ability to minimize the impact from the Japan supply issue, as well as the negative cost impact associated with executing the necessary contingency plans. The new guidance range also takes into account our increased shipment guidance and our 2012 model year price increase, as well as the negative impact of the temporary inefficiencies associated with the transformation at York and higher raw material costs for the full year. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be between $210 million and $230 million, which includes between $70 million and $85 million of capital related to restructuring.
As we look back on the second quarter of 2011, we are certainly happy to report our first year-over-year positive retail sales in the United States since before the economic downturn took hold. We're also excited to be able to increase our 2011 shipment guidance.
We are also encouraged by the strength of the brand, which is demonstrated by solid total demand for new and used Harley-Davidson motorcycles. This strength, as well as firming used bike pricing and stability of new bike prices, supported our ability to increase worldwide pricing for the 2012 model year.
Despite our strong Q2 results and improved outlook for the remainder of the year, we recognize the many challenges that lie ahead of us and our customers. And therefore, we will continue to manage the business prudently as we navigate through any uncertainties that the third and fourth quarter of the year might bring.
Overall, the fundamentals of our business are strong, and we are excited about the long term. We remain focused on executing against our strategies to transform and to grow our business while delivering strong margins, strong returns and value to our shareholders.
Thank you for your continued confidence and investment in Harley-Davidson. And now, let's open up the call to your questions."

Well, one of the things I mentioned, I talked about the strategic plan and the intent all along has been to, in a very thoughtful and meaningful way, transform our business. But we really started with the internals, okay? So manufacturing, product development, getting our house in order. And then the third major component is what we call Retail 2020, and Matt Levatich and his team are really leading that initiative. And it's really all about helping our dealers to deliver a great customer-led experience every day. And so, we're working hard on what are the programs, the support-type programs that we need to roll out to our dealers to help them do that? What are the metrics and the accountabilities that we need to put in place to make sure that we're driving all of our dealers' behaviors to where we want them to be, which is really a simple 2-by-2 matrix. It's profitable dealers, great customer experience. And so we're investing in that. We're investing in our international expansion, which is a major part of our strategic plan. And we're also investing more in product development, while at the same time leaning the process. So if you think about 2 years ago, when we were investing in 3 different brands and the results of the business were, at that time, deteriorating, we were spending less money on product development and we were diluting the investment because we were investing in, like I mentioned, 3 different brands. So now, we're able to spend more money on product development, focus it in Harley-Davidson brand to bring some really new, wow, exciting products to our dealer show floors. But our product development process is, at best, today, a 5-year process. And we're leaning that to where it'd be more like a 3- to 3.5-year process. So in the very near future, we'll be seeing some of these new products hit our dealers show floor that are intended to do just what our strategic plan mentions, to anchor our existing customer base but to really bring new customers into our dealers' show floors, and new customers into the Harley-Davidson brand."

And I'll say a second thing is that a lot of the motorcycles we repossessed are from 2007, 2008. So that's sort of an older motorcycle. It's got more equity in it at that at this point. That's helped drive recovery values. And then, recovery values at auction have improved, but I would say somewhat modestly. But we have seen continued improvement certainly over the last year."

U.S. is up about 1%, and Canada's up about 1%, 3/4 of 1% in Europe and largely flat in Latin America and lower in Asia-Pacific by about 2.5%. And that's largely due to the very strong yen and Australian dollar. So we feel very great and very good about our ability to price our motorcycles at this point. And so with that, Tim, let's move on to your second question, which is with regards to mix. Last year, you're absolutely right, we had offered a 103 engine, ABS and a security system, bundled in what we called power pack. And we offered that as standard equipment on 3 models last year. It was the Ultra Limited, the Road Guide Ultra and the Road King Class X. In addition, we offered the power pack as an option on 5 models, and we saw a strong take rate on this option, which drove mix favorability over the last year. So with model year 2012, product lineup, the 103 engine is going to be offered standard on our Touring motorcycles. And we'll also be offering what we call the security pack, which is now bundling ABS and the security system together. So when we talk about mix, we expect the second -- we expect mix to be largely flat, given the introduction of the 103 engine as standard."

But our whole strategy around manufacturing is to be more flexible and to be able to produce products closer to customer demand. There's a lot of reasons in our current structure why we can't do that effectively. And so, our vision for the future is that we want to be customer-led in everything we do. So we want our customer to be able to order a bike, and get the bike they want, the model they want, the color they want, and to some degree, accessorized the way they want it in a reasonable length of time. And that's really what H-D1 is all about. We look at every one of our customers as a unique individual, and we look at them as wanting a very unique bike, an individualized bike. And so H-D1 is all about giving our customers the ability to order a bike from the factory, get it in a very reasonable length of time and get it the way it's ordered. We do intend to expand that product offering as we go forward, as we get the systems in place, the manufacturing transformations completed and those kinds of things. So, and we think it's been well received. Our dealers, for the most part, I think, like the concept. It was an interesting phenomenon because on average, when our customers ordered a bike through H-D1, they ended up doing more accessorization when they took delivery of the bike, on average, than before. So it's been a good concept."

So we're seeing total demand accelerate in the first half of this year. As we said, we're certainly concerned about some items in the back half, largely the economy and the fragile nature of the worldwide consumer. But we're very pleased with where we see retail sales. So as we took up guidance, we took several things into consideration. One is our year-to-date performance and again, a lot based on the fact that the brand is strong, our market share is good.

First of all, in the second quarter, from a manufacturing perspective, we were favorable by $7.2 million. And that follows a first quarter that was unfavorable by $21 million. So we're very pleased with the activities that are going on in manufacturing. So in the first quarter, as we talked about, we felt we hit a high-water mark of temporary inefficiencies, driven by the transformation at York, of $11 million. That came down in the second quarter and posted about $8 million of temporary inefficiencies at York, but we're starting to see the restructuring savings come through. And therefore, it's turned positive. So as we look forward, we're going to have the experience of temporary inefficiencies throughout the remainder of our work at York, which'll take us through the first half of next year. However, the back half, we will be lapping some inefficiencies of about $4 million in the third quarter and $5 million in the fourth quarter. So we expect that to still be negative, but a little bit more favorable. Overall, when you talk about the gross margin percent, again, we're pleased that everything is now positive in the second quarter with the exception of raw materials. And the raw materials has quite a drag on the overall margin percent. The other thing that's pulling the percent down a little bit is the fact that currency, while we've turned positive on currency for the quarter, and we're now $4 million favorable, there was a big impact on revenue for the quarter. So revenue actually during the quarter was positively impacted by $45 million. So that also affects our percent margin on a year-over-year basis and kind of drags it down a little bit because currency is only being added at about an 8% margin versus the Motorcycle business that's in the 35% range."

But then, we will benefit from that year-over-year impact of the fourth quarter of last year's spend. With regards to gross margin is, yes, we couldn't be more thrilled with the materials organization and the fact that we are continuing to make touring motorcycles with radios. However, there is a cost with regards to that. As we had mentioned last quarter, we changed our shipping locations, and you can see some of that in the shipment data between the U.S. and Japan. There's some impact on mix. And then there's just a overall cost of retooling other suppliers and so on and so forth. We do not have a number for that, and those costs and expenses continue. I would say that they're an irritant at this point. They're nothing hugely material, but they are what we've also factored in when we look at our gross margin guidance going forward of 34% to 35%."

And we couldn't be more pleased with where they're at being down, I think it was only about 3.6% in the second quarter. And the resilience of that market and those customers is incredibly impressive. So our team in Japan has done a wonderful job working through the issues. As we had talked about at that time, we had very few of our dealerships that got directly caught up in it, but I think there was a couple. And we couldn't be more pleased with the retail sales from that despite them being down. With regards to Brazil, as we had talked about, about halfway through the first quarter, we changed out the 9 existing dealers that we had. We terminated them all and started to appoint new dealers. At this point, as we end the second quarter, we've got 10 dealers appointed. 6 of them are off selling products. And of those 6, about half of them are selling products from temporary locations. So we've got a lot more improvement to come from Brazil. But James, we do not break out Brazil from the Latin American numbers, but that is -- the vast majority of the sales are in Brazil. And despite that, we saw sales only down 1% in the second quarter. Again, we couldn't be more pleased with that transition in the team that's working out our business in Brazil."

Good morning, and thanks to all of you for joining us on the Third Quarter Earnings Call. Harley-Davidson again, turned in a strong performance in the third quarter, with earnings nearly doubled those of the year ago period and worldwide deal",663,"Thanks, Amy. Good morning, and thanks to all of you for joining us on the Third Quarter Earnings Call. Harley-Davidson again, turned in a strong performance in the third quarter, with earnings nearly doubled those of the year ago period and worldwide dealer new motorcycle sales up more than 5%, from last year's third quarter. The third quarter results reflect our continued progress in implementing our business strategy. Through these strategy, we are number one, transforming our production operations into a lean, flexible and best in class system. Secondly, breaking lean engineering to our product development, significantly reducing the time it takes to bring new motorcycles to market. We are focusing on retail excellence to deliver a personalized, compelling and premium experience for every customer, every time, everywhere. We're also attracting new groups of customers as we build on our leadership among young adults and other outreach segments and we're expanding the global reach of Harley-Davidson brand as we become truly multicultural and multi-generational. 
In short, there's a tremendous amount of transformational work going on throughout the organization. Each and every one of these strategic initiatives is a major undertaking all on its own. So I can tell you, I'm very proud of the dedication of all of our employees including our union leadership and the focus of everyone in the organization to bring these changes to life. You know, just last week, I spent a day at our final assembly plant in York, Pennsylvania. And the scope of change there is tremendous and there's been a great deal of progress. From 4 separate assembly lines and operations in more than 20 buildings, we now have a much smaller campus and build all soft sale Touring, CVO, and try to be goals on one assembly-line in all the different configurations required for U.S., and international markets. It's an incredibly complex work and many challenges still lie ahead as we bring the new operating system online. But in spite of the short term inefficiencies, the attitudes and engagement, and pride of everyone and being these changes to life, is truly energizing. Similarly, in our Kansas City plant, is now well down the path of implementing the changes there to become best in class. And we're looking ahead to the full implementation of the contracts in the first part of the year in Wisconsin that we expect will enable us to realize the transformational opportunity across our entire company. 
I also want to acknowledge our dealers for their continued efforts to deliver results at retail, which we are seeing at the sales increases of retail even as challenging economic headwinds continue. On last quarter's call, we talked about retail 2020. A long term global initiative to take the Harley-Davidson retail experience as good as it is, to the next level. Retail 2020 will provide the overall arching multichannel approach, systems and processes to grow the Harley-Davidson brand at retail and define the Harley-Davidson standard of retail excellence. Just like the work going on in production, and product development, retail 2020 is about being best in class and positioning Harley-Davidson dealers in the company to profitably meet the constantly evolving needs of our customers. 
Before I wrap it up and turn it over to John for the details of the quarter, let me touch on the current economic climate. We remain cautious about consumer confidence and the economy in general, just as we have been throughout 2011. And we will continue to manage the business prudently. Our strategy and actions we've taken, we believe we are restoring Harley-Davidson to a strong foundation and positioning the company to grow and extend the reach of the brand around the world. These are exciting times at Harley-Davidson as we transform our business to be best in class, in everything we do that make customers dreams a reality by delivering remarkable products and extraordinary customer experiences. I'll be back later for questions, but let me turn it over to John."

I'll review the third quarter financial results starting on Slide 10. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson Inc. consolidated revenue was up 10.9% behind the 50.9% increase in shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycle",2175,"Thanks Keith, and good morning, everyone. I'll review the third quarter financial results starting on Slide 10. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson Inc. consolidated revenue was up 10.9% behind the 50.9% increase in shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Our third quarter income from continuing operations improved to $183.6 million, an increase of 95.9%. Similarly, diluted earnings per share rose to $0.78 per share, up from the year ago quarter, which was $0.40 per share. Operating income from the Motorcycle business was up 78%, compared to last year's third quarter. The strong increase in the Motorcycle business was driven by increased motorcycle shipments and lower spending on ongoing restructuring activities, partially offset by a lower gross margin as compared to last year. Operating income at Harley-Davidson financial Services was up 21.9% behind improved credit loss performance. Finally, our improved financial performance for the quarter was also driven by a lower year-over-year interest expense as a result of last December's repurchase of 297 million of high-interest notes and a lower effective tax rate as compared to last year. We are very pleased with the third quarter's results and continued progress against our growth strategies and the transformation of our business. 
Now let's take a look at retail sales on Slide 11. Overall, worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were up 5.1% in third quarter. In the U.S., retail sales continue to be strong despite a very challenging economic environment. During the quarter, we introduced our 2012 model year motorcycles and they have been well received by both our dealers and customers. Market share in the U.S. was 57.9%, up 1.3 percentage points, compared to last year's third quarter as the Harley-Davidson brand continued to show its strength while many of our competitors continued to discount prices to move aging inventory. Retail sales in the international markets grew 4.4% during the quarter, driven by growth in Latin America, Europe and Asia Pacific regions. The Latin American region was up 27.9% driven primarily by strength in Mexico and Brazil. In Brazil, the new dealer network continues to come up to speed. As we have discussed, we closed all 9 dealerships and have appointed 10 new dealers, on which 8 are up and running. This was planned as part of the agreement that we announced in December 2010, to terminate the exclusive dealer contract that was in place and expand our presence in Brazil. Retail sales in the Europe region were up 4.4% in the quarter compared to 2010. The Europe region saw strong sales in Northern European countries and in our emerging markets in the region, partially offset by soft in Southern European countries. Retail sales in Asia Pacific region were up 1.8% driven by double-digit gains in Australia and emerging markets, which include India and China. We continue to experience declines in Japan as that country works to recover from the tragic events earlier this year. 
On Slide 12, you will see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the quarter were up compared to last year and within our expected range of 60,000 to 65,000 motorcycles for the quarter. During the quarter, mix shifted from Touring and custom motorcycles to Touristers due to the York restructuring, which impacted production at that facility. During the quarter, you're a consolidated Touring, soft sales price and CVO with single consolidated line. We expect York motorcycle production to be continue to be affected over the next couple of quarters as the new consolidated line comes up to speed. Sports have represented 22.3% of total shipments, which was higher than last year's Sportster mix. We expect Sportsters as a percentage of total shipments will be at the upper end of our historical range of an 80 to 82% range for the full year. As we noted last quarter, we began shipping 2012 model year Touring and Sportster motorcycles in the U.S. at the end of June, which was a few weeks earlier than normal. We released these models early as a result of tight retail inventory situation in the U.S.. Shipments of the remaining 2012 models started in late July as they normally do. 
Slide 13 provide some additional detail on the U.S. dealer network inventory and strength of our brand as measured by total demand. During the third quarter in the U.S., we shipped about 41,100 Harley-Davidson motorcycles and dealers sold roughly 42,600 at retail. As a result of strong third quarter retail sales and temperate production constraints experienced at York, U.S. dealer network inventory was drawn down about 1,600 units from the second quarter of 2011 and was down about 1,900 units compared to last year's third quarter. In addition, to overall site inventory, dealers ended the quarter with very low levels of 2011 model year carryover unit. We are pleased to report that U.S. dealer network profit margins have increased behind higher retail sales and prudent management of our cost structures. In light of ongoing uncertain economic challenges, we remain committed to aggressively managing new motorcycle supply in line with demand. However, we do recognize that aggregate U.S. dealer inventory continues to be below what we believe is an appropriate ongoing level and we will continue to work toward replenishing dealer inventory levels of new motorcycles. We continue to support the dealer's efforts to sell more, used bikes. We believe healthy used bikes sales NNS dealer revenue, maintain resale values and help near the gap between new and used motorcycle pricing. Used bike sales by the U.S. dealer network continue to be up double digits through August compared to the same period last year. When used motorcycle sales are combined with new retail sales in the U.S., total demand for Harley-Davidson motorcycles continues to be strong. 
On Slide 14, you will see revenue for the Motorcycles and Related Products segment was up 13.4% in the third quarter behind strong growth from all our businesses. Harley-Davidson motorcycle revenues up 15.5% behind the 15.9% increase in shipments. During the quarter, average motorcycle revenue for Harley-Davidson units shipped decreased $52 from the prior year as a result of unfavorable product mix, partially offset by significant currency exchange favorability in the previously announced price increase on our 2012 model year motorcycles. Parts and accessory sales were up 7.6% for the quarter, driven in part by our focus on product availability, high demand for new accessory product offerings, and growth and worldwide and used retail motorcycle sales. 
General Merchandise was up over 8% in the third quarter as a result of sportswear growth and the impact of worldwide new motorcycle sales increases on leather and riding gear. 
Turning to restructuring on Slide 15, we are continuing our efforts to costs structure and transform the business to be stronger and more profitable in the future to get your continues to be a key focus of our structuring activities. As we mentioned, during the third quarter or the combined assembly of all models produced at York and with a single assembly line. As anticipated, these changes resulted in temporary inefficiencies and temporary capacity constraints. We are pleased to report that all manufacturing at York is now in a single building. The team at York is done an outstanding about reducing our operating costs structure and increasing our manufacturing flexibility. The focus at York for the next couple of quarters will be to consistently increase our throughput until we reach our targeted language. Consequently during the fourth quarter, we anticipate that there will be continued downtime as workers on in the and production comes up to speed. The next step in their structure in which will occur in 2012 will be the implement a new ERP system at York, which we expect will give us many new capabilities across supply chain including the ability to do more made-to-order production, implement production surged on the capabilities in 2013, and provide end-to-end supply chain integration. As we work toward completing our structuring, we will continue to experience temporary inefficiencies and temporary capacity constraints. We continue to expect the manufacturing restructuring to be largely complete by the end of 2012. 
During the third quarter, we incurred $12.4 million in restructuring expenses and $49 million year-to-date. Restructuring activities are largely on plan to the first 9 months of the year and costs are coming in lower than we originally expected. As you will see, we reduced the expected 2011 restructuring cost by $10 million to a range of $70 million to $80 million. Consequently, we now expect total costs to be between $480 million and $495 million by 2013. The expected savings in capital spending estimates associated with a structured activities are unchanged. 
On Slide 16, you will see gross margin in the quarter was 33.7%, which was lower than last year. Gross margin for the quarter was impacted by key drivers. First, volume was favorably impacted by increased motorcycle shipments which were up 19, 15.9% in the quarter, and increased Parts and Accessories and General Merchandise sales compared to last year. Second, you'll see we've added a motorcycle pricing line to the Slide to reflect our previously announced price increase on 2012 motorcycles. During the quarter, gross margin was improved by $7.7 million as a result of the price increase. Third, mix was unfavorable by $26.6 million, largely driven by the temporary disruptions at York, which caused temporary capacity constraints and impacted the mix between families, models and the geographic shipments of motorcycles during the third quarter. Fourth, foreign currency exchange in just a change for the quarter was positively impacted. Gross margin by $2.7 million, while currency exchange during the quarter, had a modest favorable impact on profit currency exchange had an unfavorable impact on gross margin percent of nearly 1 percentage point, largely due to balance sheet revaluations following the significant decline in the Euro, Australian dollars and Rial exchange rates that occurred in the last 3  weeks of the quarter. Next raw materials were unfavorable $7.9 million due to increase metals and you'll costs. And finally, manufacturing benefited from restructuring savings and incremental margin on higher volumes, partially offset by approximately $3 million in temporary inefficiencies associated with the transformation underway at our York facility. 
During the fourth quarter, we expect continued pressure on margins from the currency exchange I mentioned earlier, higher raw material costs, continuing temporary inefficiencies at York. 
On Slide 17, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the third quarter was 14.7%, versus 9.3% in 2010. Operating margin was favorably impacted by higher gross margin and lower year-over-year restructuring spending. As expected, SG&A was roughly $11 million higher during the quarter compared to the same period last year as we continued to invest in the future. During the fourth quarter, we expect SG&A to be higher than last year's fourth quarter due in part to our continued investment in our growth initiatives. We continue to expect SG&A spending to decline as a percent of revenue between 2009 and 2014. 
Now, will be on to our Financial Services segment on Slide 18. In the third quarter, HDFS operating profit improved $11.1 million or 21.9% compared to the last year. The 3 key drivers of the third quarter results were net interest income was $7.9 million lower in the third quarter of 2011 versus third quarter of 2010. During the quarter, HDFS was able to repurchase at market prices approximately $44 million of the outstanding 2018 notes originally issued that an interest rate of 6.8% allowing us to replace this debt with lower interest rate debt. The repurchase of these notes resulted in $8.7 million current period loss. We will continue to evaluate future debt repurchase opportunities as they arise. Next, the provision for retail credit losses was $15.7 million lower in the third quarter of 2011 versus third quarter 2010, primarily due to improved credit losses as a result of favorable retail receivables performance. And finally, the provision for wholesale credit losses was $5 million lower in the third quarter of 2011, primarily due to favorable wholesale loss performance. 
It's important to note that on a year-to-date basis, we've released approximately $37 million of allowance from the balance sheet, given anticipated credit loss performance across the entire portfolio. While the release of this allowance benefits income this year, we cannot assume a similar financial benefit will occur in 2012. As we look forward to 2012, we believe HDFS's operating income will decreased compared to 2011, primarily due to the lapping of $37 million of 2011 balance sheet allowance releases I just mentioned. We expect 2012 negative operating income will also be impacted by lower net interest and the book of retail loans continues to project and modest tightening of margins on prime share retail lending. Despite the anticipated decrease in year-over-year HDFS operating income, the business is healthy and expected to be solidly profitable in 2012. We are very pleased with the performance of the business and believe HDFS provides a competitive advantage for sales, of Harley-Davidson motorcycles and related products. Now, Larry will provide more detail on HDFS as operations on Slide 19. Larry?"

During the third quarter, HDFS retail motorcycle loan originations increased 14.2% or $78 million, compared to the same period last year. The increase was driven by higher new motorcycle loan originations behind a strong in",387,"Thanks, John, and good morning. During the third quarter, HDFS retail motorcycle loan originations increased 14.2% or $78 million, compared to the same period last year. The increase was driven by higher new motorcycle loan originations behind a strong increase in retail sales and a 2.6 percentage point increase in market share. Used motorcycle loan originations also increased compared to last year. However, as a higher level of receivables originated prior to the start of the economic downturn roll off the works, finance receivables outstanding decreased 5.5% compared to a year ago. This declining receivable pool reflects the lower U.S. retail sales over the last 2 years that will continue to impact HDFS net interest income. 
Over the past several quarters, HDFS has been focused on prudently increasing overall credit application approval rates. And we saw a modest increase in the third quarter. Overall, the standard portfolio that continues to perform well over time, and delivers an appropriate return on equity. We are very pleased with the improved retail delinquency rate and retail credit losses compared to last year which you will see on Slide 20. The 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle owners at the end of the third quarter was 3.73%, or 110 basis points better than the same date last year. Annualized retail credit losses improved by 93 basis points to 1.11% in the first 9 months, compared to the first 9 months of last year. This improvement was driven by the impact of changes in underwriting implemented 2 years ago, as well as a lower frequency of loss and improvement in the recovery values of repossessed motorcycles. As John mentioned, during the quarter, we reduced the total allowance for credit losses by $11.8 million to reflect lower anticipated credit losses and lower receivable balances. We will continue to evaluate the allowance each quarter using our disciplined process and make adjustments as appropriate. We are pleased with the continued improvement in credit performance and we will continue to monitor the unemployment picture, motorcycle recovery values, and the overall U.S. economic environment and manage HDFS appropriately. During the third quarter, HDFS delivered increased profits and maintained strong liquidity position. We remain focused on enabling retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles while providing an attractive return to Harley-Davidson Inc.. Now, let me turn it back to John."

You will see that at the end of the quarter, we have just over $1.6 billion of cash and marketable securities. In addition, HDFS had approximately $980 million of available liquidity through bank, credit and conduit facilities. We currently have and will continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and/or committed credit facilities. During the quarter, we completed a $600 million term securitization transaction at a weighted average rate of 0.84% and renewed $600 million conduit facility. I am also very pleased to report that we repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares of Harley-Davidson stock for $91 million. This is in addition, to the 25% second quarter dividend increase. As we have stated, returning value to our shareholders through dividend and share repurchases is a top priority. 
Looking forward, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance value to our shareholders. Now, I'll review the remaining Harley-Davidson financials on Slide 22. I would like to highlight 2 items on this Slide. First, with regards to continuing operations, the company generated operating cash of $902 million during the first 9 months of 2011, which included a $200 million contribution to our pension plans. And second, through 9 months, the company's effective tax rate was 30.4%, compared to 34.0% in the year ago period. The 2011 effective tax rate in the third quarter was favorably impacted by settlement of an IRS audit, as well as a change in the Wisconsin income tax law associated with certain net operating losses. Last year, the effective tax rate through the third quarter was negatively impacted by the Health Care Reform Legislation offset by a favorable settlement of an IRS audit. We now expect the full year effective income tax rate will be approximately 31% for 2011. 
Now, turning to guidance on Slide 23. We continue to expect full year 2011 Harley-Davidson motorcycle shipments to be between 228,000 and 235,000 units of 8% to 12% from 2010. During the fourth quarter, we expect to ship between 45,500 and 52,500 units. We now expect full year 2011 gross margin will be between 33.5% and 34.5%. The guidance has been adjusted to account for the additional pressure we now expect from foreign currency exchange as a result of the significant decrease in valuation of our key currencies that started to occur at the end of the third quarter. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be between $210 million and $230 million, which includes between $70 million and $85 million of capital related to strut restructuring. 
As we look back at the third quarter of 2011, we are pleased to deliver another strong quarter results. We continued to be encouraged by the strength of our brand, which is demonstrated in part by a good response to our twentyfold model year and strong total demand for new and used Harley-Davidson motorcycles. We are also pleased to report that we repurchased under 1 million of our stock in the quarter. While delivering another strong quarter, we recognize the many challenges that lie ahead of us and our customers and therefore will continue to manage the business prudently as we navigate through any uncertainties that the future might bring. Overall, the fundamentals of our business are strong and we are excited about the long term. We continue to build a solid foundation for sustainable growth. We remain focused on executing against our strategies to complete transformation of our organization and grow our business while delivering strong margins, strong returns and value to our shareholders. Thank you for your continued confidence and investment in Harley-Davidson. And now, I'll open the call up to your questions."

I'll go start with the second question first. As the impact of your transformation on the third quarter and then, we'll talk a little bit about the guidance that we presented. When we look at gross margin, the story in the third quarter",483,"Okay, Tim, thanks. I'll go start with the second question first. As the impact of your transformation on the third quarter and then, we'll talk a little bit about the guidance that we presented. When we look at gross margin, the story in the third quarter really comes in 2 areas. One, is in the impact of the York transformation and the other is in the currency. Certainly, the transformation and the aspects included in that were expected. They came in 2 Flavors. One was the mix was impacted. So we saw a favorable mix in the quarter of $26.6 million due to the disruption in the temporary capacity constraints due to York restructuring. And when we look at that, several things happened in mix. One is that given the temporary capacity constraints, we relied more on product coming out of our Kansas City facility, which typically have lower margins. So we shipped less as a percent in Touring and Custom motorcycles then we did on Sportsters. And the temporary capacity constraints also affected our model mix and in the quarter, we should lower content is overpriced bikes and again, that was due to the activities that we were going on in this facility and finally , our geographic mix was affected by the magnitude of change at York and just one second on that, again, Keith had mentioned we took 4 families of motorcycles, some 22 models and put them all under the same line so all our employees building all of our bikes and within that change, we had 95% of our hourly employees are in or will be in new jobs in the short period of time. So again, we experienced a lot of downtime. So a lot of it manifested itself in mix and in the second piece, where it manifested itself was on the manufacturing line. And we saw the manufacturing temporary inefficiencies on year-over-year basis were unfavorable by $3 million. I would like to point out though on the manufacturing line, we did deliver $30 million favorability and if you look back in the first quarter, that was actually a negative $21 million improved to a favorable $7 million in the second quarter. And then, again, this quarter at $20 million. So the second part of your question, Tim, was on the gross margin guidance. So as we look at gross margin, as we sit through 3 quarters, we are at 34.0% and the gross margin guidance that we had was 34% to 35%. So with roughly 80% of the revenue behind us, and the uncertainty related to the currency situation, we felt that it was prudent to lower the range by half a percentage point. It's important to note here that there is nothing concerning to us about our core business or the restructuring. We're very pleased with the retail sales. Our shipments and certainly structuring."

But as I said, Sharon, we will continue to experience the temporary inefficiencies and capacity constraints until the restructuring is complete on a systemwide basis toward the end of 2013.

The second question with regards to the transformation is, the transformation expense so far this year, we had a temporary inefficiencies, $11 million in the first quarter and I believe it was $8 million in the second quarter and on a year-over-year basis $3 million in the third quarter. That would have been gross inefficiencies of $7 million and we're lapping last year's fourth quarter I'm sorry, third quarter results, which was $4 million. Not will move into next quarter, we expect the temporary inefficiencies to continue and next quarter, we will be lapping a year ago number of $5 million and then, as we get into 2012, we're not providing guidance at this time, our gross margin or temporary inefficiencies however, we will begin to lap the temporary inefficiencies that we had this year. Again, $11 million, $8 million and $3 million to the first 3 quarters."

Remember, when we said numerous times in the past, mix is about the bike have a better mix, model mix, geographic mix, option mix and mix within P&A and General Merchandise during the third quarter, we had impacts for many of these factors and with many of them being unfavorable, largely driven by the event at York. So let's go through some of them. Is family mix perspective that was unfavorable, and that was a straight family and the shift between lower-priced bikes and higher-priced bikes largely because York produces most of our higher margin bikes, which are the Touring and Softail line. So we have a couple of percentage point shift between our production at York and in Kansas City. The -- also were affected by the model mix. So for most of the year, we had favorable model mix and that is people trading up to higher priced bikes within the family. And given the activities at York, the model mix was also unfavorable this quarter as the Touring and Softail families reproduced motorcycles with lower content and therefore, lower-priced bikes during the quarter. And finally, the third piece of the York effect was normal shipping patterns were disrupted due to the magnitude of the change was occurring in Europe and that had an impact in our geographic mix or the shipment to various countries and shipping bikes to lower margin countries. And even outside the motorcycle mix, we had unfavorable mix in our P&A business and as we work to increase our share of the consumables line of products, which includes oils and tires, they're at a lower margin than our parts and accessories. So we have a little bit unfavorable mix there. So it's not only motorcycle that's across all of the revenue base and so you can imply all to motorcycle mix, Joe."

We've gotten a lot of questions about York and if we just go back about a year, I mean I don't think that we said all along that first of all the transformation that we were going to go through, not only in York but also in Milwaukee and Tomahawk in Kansas City, is big. So this is not us just sort of shuffling people around you got to remember, we outsource over half of the work in terms of people that were in the York facility. So we're just now going through the belly of that whole transition and coming out of that and as John mentioned, what that means is that a lot of people that worked in stamping or plating or grinding or whatever, have now been shifted over to the new assembly line. So they're all going through massive training and learning on the job. In addition to that, we've taken the dedicated assembly lines where we would produce just 1 family of products, sort of a repetitive manufacturing process that we move now to the flexible manufacturing line whereby all those products can be built on the same line which introduces a lot of complexity in terms of production planning, component planning and those kinds of things. And in addition to that, you can imagine the amount of systems work and software involved in the guided robotic systems that we now produce all of our products on. So it's like a massive amount of change and we've said all along, that we would be out of this part of the change, at least in York, at the end of 2012. So we're still a year away. So it's hard for us to predict quite frankly, from day-to-day, what kind of issues we're going to have. Now if you go back in time about a month, we had some -- a lot of significant issues with downtime because we have outsourced a lot of our subassembly work and we we're having some problems with getting the right parts to the line at the right time. And all those issues now have been, I would say resolved 95%. Our run rates have come up significantly in the last month. We're hitting more of our schedule on a daily basis. And so, I mean, are we disappointed? That things haven't been perfect, yes. But I would tell you that we we're pleased with where we are in this transformation given the magnitude of the work and so I think that it would only get better and again, we're running one shift. Because we cannot absorb that amount of retraining and training on more than one ship at this point in time, so any concerns about capacity in the future, there are 3 shifts in a day, right? So I mean and we said this all along, capacity is not going to be an issue. And the ability for us to get our mix back in line isn't going to be an issue in the future. And we will be able to produce at line rates, et cetera. Now is that going to be 3 days from now? Or 10 days from now or 18 days from now? I mean, it's hard for me to say. But I hope that helps clarify that what we're doing here is, if you go back to our strategic plan and you go back to our transformation plan, what we're doing is putting in a flexible, world-class, manufacturing process, which, when completed, will give us the flexibility to be closer to our customer, to be much more cost effective, and to be able to move more toward customization of production in the plant. So this is a little bit longer term solution that we're looking at here and we have a lot of great people on-site, working through these issues everyday and we feel good about where we're at."

277444,140640739,173295,"Harley-Davidson, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2011",2011-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Harley-Davidson, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Amy. Good morning, and thanks to all of you for joining us on the Third Quarter Earnings Call. Harley-Davidson again turned in a strong performance in the third quarter, with earnings nearly doubled those of the year ago period and worldwide deale",660,"Thanks, Amy. Good morning, and thanks to all of you for joining us on the Third Quarter Earnings Call. Harley-Davidson again turned in a strong performance in the third quarter, with earnings nearly doubled those of the year ago period and worldwide dealer new motorcycle sales up more than 5% from last year's third quarter. The third quarter results reflect our continued progress at implementing our business strategy. Through this strategy, we are number one, transforming our production operations into a lean, flexible and best-in-class system. Secondly, bringing lean engineering to our product development, significantly reducing the time it takes to bring new motorcycles to market. We are focusing on retail excellence to deliver a personalized, compelling and premium experience for every customer, every time, everywhere. We're also attracting new groups of customers as we build on our leadership among young adults and other outreach segments and we're expanding the global reach of Harley-Davidson brand as we become truly multicultural and multi-generational. 
In short, there's a tremendous amount of transformational work going on throughout the organization. Each and every one of these strategic initiatives is a major undertaking all on its own. So I can tell you I'm very proud of the dedication of all of our employees, including our union leadership and the focus of everyone in the organization to bring these changes to life. You know, just last week, I spent a day at our final assembly plant in York, Pennsylvania. And the scope of change there is tremendous and there's been a great deal of progress. From 4 separate assembly lines and operations in more than 20 buildings, we now have a much smaller campus and build all Softail, Touring, CVO, and Trike vehicles on one assembly line in all of the different configurations required for U.S. and international markets. It's an incredibly complex work and many challenges still lie ahead as we bring the new operating system online. But in spite of the short-term inefficiencies, the attitudes, engagement and pride of everyone in bringing these changes to life is truly energizing. Similarly, in our Kansas City plant is now well down the path of implementing the changes there to become best in class. And we're looking ahead to the full implementation of the contracts in the first part of the year in Wisconsin that we expect will enable us to realize the transformational opportunity across our entire company. 
I also want to acknowledge our dealers for their continued efforts to deliver results at retail, which we are seeing in the sales increases of retail even as challenging economic headwinds continue. On last quarter's call, we talked about Retail 2020,  a long-term global initiative to take the Harley-Davidson retail experience, as good as it is, to the next level. Retail 2020 will provide the overall arching multichannel approach, systems and processes to grow the Harley-Davidson brand at retail and define the Harley-Davidson standard of retail excellence. Just like the work going on in production and product development, Retail 2020 is about being best in class and positioning Harley-Davidson dealers in the company alike to profitably meet the constantly evolving needs of our customers. 
Before I wrap it up and turn it over to John for the details of the quarter, let me touch on the current economic climate. We remain cautious about consumer confidence and the economy in general, just as we have been throughout 2011, and we will continue to manage the business prudently. But through our strategy and actions we've taken, we believe we are restoring Harley-Davidson to a strong foundation and positioning the company to grow and extend the reach of the brand around the world. These are exciting times at Harley-Davidson as we transform our business to be best in class in everything we do that make customers' dreams a reality by delivering remarkable products and extraordinary customer experiences. I'll be back later for questions, but let me turn it over to John."

I'll review the third quarter financial results starting on Slide 10. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson Inc. consolidated revenue was up 10.9% behind the 15.9% increase in shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycle",2170,"Thanks Keith, and good morning, everyone. I'll review the third quarter financial results starting on Slide 10. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson Inc. consolidated revenue was up 10.9% behind the 15.9% increase in shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Our third quarter income from continuing operations improved to $183.6 million, an increase of 95.9%. Similarly, diluted earnings per share rose to $0.78 per share, up from the year ago quarter, which was $0.40 per share. Operating income from the Motorcycle business was up 78% compared to last year's third quarter. The strong increase in the Motorcycle business was driven by increased motorcycle shipments and lower spending on ongoing restructuring activities, partially offset by a lower gross margin as compared to last year. Operating income at Harley-Davidson Financial Services was up 21.9% behind improved credit loss performance. Finally, our improved financial performance for the quarter was also driven by a lower year-over-year interest expense as a result of last December's repurchase of $297 million of high-interest notes and a lower effective tax rate as compared to last year. We are very pleased with the third quarter's results and continued progress against our goal strategies and the transformation of our business. 
Now let's take a look at retail sales on Slide 11. Overall, worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were up 5.1% in third quarter. In the U.S., retail sales continue to be strong despite a very challenging economic environment. During the quarter, we introduced our 2012 model year motorcycles and they have been well received by both our dealers and customers. Market share in the U.S. was 57.9%, up 1.3 percentage points compared to last year's third quarter, as the Harley-Davidson brand continued to show its strength while many of our competitors continue to discount prices to move aging inventory. Retail sales in the international markets grew 4.4% during the quarter, driven by growth in Latin America, Europe and Asia Pacific regions. The Latin America region was up 27.9%, driven primarily by strength in Mexico and Brazil. In Brazil, the new dealer network continues to come up to speed. As we have discussed, we closed all 9 dealerships and have appointed 10 new dealers, of which 8 are up and running. This was planned as part of the agreement that we announced in December 2010 to terminate the exclusive dealer contract that was in place and expand our presence in Brazil. Retail sales in the Europe region were up 4.4% in the quarter compared to 2010. The Europe region saw strong sales in Northern European countries and in our emerging markets in the region, partially offset by softness in Southern European countries. Retail sales in Asia Pacific region were up 1.8% driven by double-digit gains in Australia and emerging markets, which include India and China. We continue to experience declines in Japan as that country works to recover from the tragic events earlier this year. 
On Slide 12, you will see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the quarter were up compared to last year and within our expected range of 60,000 to 65,000 motorcycles for the quarter. During the quarter, mix shifted from Touring and custom motorcycles to Sportsters, largely due to the York restructuring, which impacted production at that facility. During the quarter, York consolidated Touring, Softail, Trike and CVO production and with single consolidated line. We expect York motorcycle production to be continue to be affected over the next couple of quarters as the new consolidated line comes up to speed. Sportsters represented 22.3% of total shipments, which was higher than last year's Sportster mix. We expect Sportsters as a percentage of total shipments will be at the upper end of our historical range of 18% to 22% for the full year. 
As we noted last quarter, we began shipping 2012 model year Touring and Sportster motorcycles in the U.S. at the end of June, which was a few weeks earlier than normal. We released these models early as a result of tight retail inventory situation in the U.S.. Shipments of the remaining 2012 models started in late July as they normally do. 
Slide 13 provides some additional detail on the U.S. dealer network inventory and strength of our brand as measured by total demand. During the third quarter in the U.S., we shipped about 41,100 Harley-Davidson motorcycles and dealers sold roughly 42,600 at retail. As a result of strong third quarter retail sales and temperate production constraints experienced at York, U.S. dealer network inventory was drawn down about 1,600 units from the second quarter of 2011 and was down about 1,900 units compared to last year's third quarter. In addition to overall site inventory, dealers ended the quarter with very low levels of 2011 model year carryover units. We are pleased to report that U.S. dealer network profit margins have increased behind higher retail sales and prudent management of the cost structures. In light of ongoing uncertain economic challenges, we remain committed to aggressively managing new motorcycle supply in line with demand. However, we do recognize that aggregate U.S. dealer inventory continues to be below what we believe is an appropriate ongoing level and we will continue to work toward replenishing dealer inventory levels of new motorcycles. We continue to support the dealer's efforts to sell more used bikes. We believe healthy used bikes sales enhance dealer revenue, maintain resale values and help near the gap between new and used motorcycle pricing. Used bike sales by the U.S. dealer network continue to be up double digits through August compared to the same period last year. When used motorcycle sales are combined with new retail sales in the U.S., total demand for Harley-Davidson motorcycles continues to be strong. 
On Slide 14, you will see revenue for the Motorcycles and Related Products segment was up 13.4% in the third quarter behind strong growth from all our businesses. Harley-Davidson motorcycle revenue was up 15.5% behind the 15.9% increase of shipments. During the quarter, average motorcycle revenue for Harley-Davidson units shipped decreased $52 from the prior year as a result of unfavorable product mix, partially offset by significant currency exchange favorability in the previously announced price increase on our 2012 model year motorcycles. Parts and Accessories sales were up 7.6% for the quarter, driven in part by a focus on product availability, high demand for new accessory product offerings and growth and worldwide and used retail motorcycle sales.  General Merchandise was up over 8% in the third quarter as a result of sportswear growth and the impact of worldwide new motorcycle sales increases on leather and riding gear. 
Turning to restructuring on Slide 15, we are continuing our efforts to improve our cost structure and transform the business to be stronger and more profitable in the future. York continues to be a key focus of our restructuring activities. As we mentioned, during the third quarter, we combined assembly of all models produced at York and with a single assembly line. As anticipated, these changes resulted in temporary inefficiencies and temporary capacity constraints. 
We are pleased to report that all manufacturing at York is now in a single building. The team at York has done an outstanding job of reducing our operating cost structure and increasing our manufacturing flexibility. The focus at York for the next couple of quarters will be to consistently increase our throughput until we reach our targeted lease. Consequently, during the fourth quarter, we anticipate that there will be continued downtime as workers on a new production lines are trained and production comes up to speed. 
The next step in the structuring, which will occur in 2012, will be to implement a new ERP system at York, which we expect will give us many new capabilities across the supply chain, including the ability to do more made-to-order production, implement production surge capabilities in 2013 and provide end-to-end supply chain integration. As we work toward completing our restructuring, we will continue to experience temporary inefficiencies and temporary capacity constraints. We continue to expect the manufacturing restructuring to be largely complete by the end of 2012. 
During the third quarter, we incurred $12.4 million in restructuring expenses and $49 million year-to-date. Restructuring activities are largely on plan through the first 9 months of the year and costs are coming in lower than we originally expected. As you will see, we reduced the expected 2011 restructuring cost by $10 million to a range of $70 million to $80 million. Consequently, we now expect total costs to be between $480 million and $495 million by 2013. The expected savings in capital spending estimates associated with restructuring activities are unchanged. 
On Slide 16, you will see gross margin in the quarter was 33.7%, which was lower than last year. Gross margin for the quarter was impacted by key drivers. First, volume was favorably impacted by increased motorcycle shipments, which were up 15.9% in the quarter, and increased Parts and Accessories and General Merchandise sales compared to last year. Second, you'll see we've added a motorcycle pricing line to the Slide to reflect our previously announced price increase on 2012 motorcycles. During the quarter, gross margin was improved by $7.7 million as a result of the price increase. Third, mix was unfavorable by $26.6 million, largely driven by the temporary disruptions at York, which caused temporary capacity constraints and impacted the mix between families, models and the geographic shipments of motorcycles during the third quarter. Fourth, foreign currency exchange during the quarter has positively impacted gross margin by $2.7 million. While currency exchange during the quarter had a modest favorable impact on profit, currency exchange had an unfavorable impact on gross margin percent of nearly 1 percentage point, largely due to balance sheet revaluations following the significant decline in the Euro, Australian dollar and Rial exchange rates that occurred in the last 3  weeks of the quarter. Next raw materials were unfavorable $7.9 million due to increase metals and fuel costs. And finally, manufacturing benefited from restructuring savings and incremental margin on higher volumes, partially offset by approximately $3 million in temporary inefficiencies associated with the transformation underway at our York facility. 
During the fourth quarter, we expect continued pressure on margins from the currency exchange I mentioned earlier, higher raw material costs and continuing temporary inefficiencies at York. 
On Slide 17, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the third quarter was 14.7% versus 9.3% in 2010. Operating margin was favorably impacted by higher gross margin and lower year-over-year restructuring spending. As expected, SG&A was roughly $11 million higher during the quarter compared to the same period last year as we continue to invest in the future. During the fourth quarter, we expect SG&A to be higher than last year's fourth quarter due in part to our continued investment in our growth initiatives. We continue to expect SG&A spending to decline as a percent of revenue between 2009 and 2014. 
Now moving on to our Financial Services segment on Slide 18. In the third quarter, HDFS operating profit improved $11.1 million, or 21.9%, compared to the last year. The 3 key drivers of the third quarter results were net interest income was $7.9 million lower in the third quarter of 2011 versus third quarter of 2010. During the quarter, HDFS was able to repurchase at market prices approximately $44 million of the outstanding 2018 medium-term notes originally issued at an interest rate of 6.8%, allowing us to replace this debt with lower interest rate debt. The repurchase of these notes resulted in $8.7 million current period loss. We will continue to evaluate future debt repurchase opportunities as they arise. Next, the provision for retail credit losses was $15.7 million lower in the third quarter of 2011 versus third quarter 2010, primarily due to improved credit losses as a result of favorable retail receivables performance. And finally, the provision for wholesale credit losses was $5 million lower in the third quarter of 2011, primarily due to favorable wholesale loss performance. 
It's important to note that on a year-to-date basis, we've released approximately $37 million of allowance from the balance sheet, given anticipated credit loss performance across the entire portfolio. While the release of this allowance benefits income this year, we cannot assume a similar financial benefit will occur in 2012. As we look forward to 2012, we believe HDFS's operating income will decrease compared to 2011, primarily due to the lapping of $37 million of 2011 balance sheet allowance releases I just mentioned. We expect 2012 operating income will also be impacted by lower net interest and the book of retail loans continues to contract, and modest tightening of margins on prime share retail lending. Despite the anticipated decrease in year-over-year HDFS operating income, the business is healthy and expected to be solidly profitable in 2012. We are very pleased with the performance of the business and believe HDFS provides a competitive advantage for sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles and related products. Now Larry will provide more detail on HDFS as operations on Slide 19. Larry?"

During the third quarter, HDFS retail motorcycle loan originations increased 14.2%, or $78 million, compared to the same period last year. The increase was driven by higher new motorcycle loan originations behind a strong increase in retail sales and a 2.6 percentage point increase in market share. Used motorcycle loan originations also increased compared to last year. However, as the higher level of receivables originated prior to the start of the economic downturn roll off the books, finance receivables outstanding decreased 5.5% compared to a year ago. This decline in receivables pool reflects the lower U.S. retail sales over the last 2 years that will continue to impact HDFS net interest income. 
Over the past several quarters, HDFS has been focused on prudently increasing overall credit application approval rates. And we saw a modest increase in the third quarter. Our goal is to have a portfolio that continues to perform well over time and delivers an appropriate return on equity. 
We are very pleased with the improved retail delinquency rate and retail credit losses compared to last year, which you will see on Slide 20. The 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at the end of the third quarter was 3.73%, or 110 basis points better than the same date last year. Annualized retail credit losses improved by 93 basis points to 1.11% in the first 9 months compared to the first 9 months of last year. This improvement was driven by the impact of changes in underwriting implemented 2 years ago, as well as a lower frequency of loss and improvement in the recovery values of repossessed motorcycles. As John mentioned, during the quarter, we reduced the total allowance for credit losses by $11.8 million to reflect lower anticipated credit losses and lower receivable balances. We will continue to evaluate the allowance each quarter using our disciplined process and make adjustments as appropriate. We are pleased with the continued improvement in credit performance and we will continue to monitor the unemployment picture, motorcycle recovery values, and the overall U.S. economic environment and manage HDFS appropriately. 
During the third quarter, HDFS delivered increased profits and maintained a strong liquidity position. We remain focused on enabling retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles while providing an attractive return to Harley-Davidson Inc. Now let me turn it back to John."

You will see that at the end of the quarter, we had just over $1.6 billion of cash and marketable securities. In addition, HDFS had approximately $980 million of available liquidity through bank, credit and conduit facilities. We currently have and will continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and/or committed credit facilities. During the quarter, we completed a $600 million term securitization transaction at a weighted average rate of 0.84% and renewed $600 million conduit facility. I am also very pleased to report that we repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares of Harley-Davidson stock for $91 million. This is in addition to the 25% second quarter dividend increase. As we have stated, returning value to our shareholders through dividend and share repurchases is a top priority.  Looking forward, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance value to our shareholders. 
Now I'll review the remaining Harley-Davidson financials on Slide 22. I would like to highlight 2 items on this Slide. First, with regards to continuing operations, the company generated operating cash of $902 million during the first 9 months of 2011, which included a $200 million contribution to our pension plans. And second, through 9 months, the company's effective tax rate was 30.4%, compared to 34.0% in the year ago period. The 2011 effective tax rate in the third quarter was favorably impacted by settlement of an IRS audit, as well as a change in the Wisconsin income tax law associated with certain net operating losses. Last year, the effective tax rate through the third quarter was negatively impacted by the Health Care Reform Legislation offset by a favorable settlement of an IRS audit. We now expect the full year effective income tax rate will be approximately 31% for 2011. 
Now turning to guidance on Slide 23. We continue to expect full year 2011 Harley-Davidson motorcycle shipments to be between 228,000 and 235,000 units of 8% to 12% from 2010. During the fourth quarter, we expect to ship between 45,500 and 52,500 units. We now expect full year 2011 gross margin will be between 33.5% and 34.5%. The guidance has been adjusted to account for the additional pressure we now expect from foreign currency exchange as a result of the significant decrease in valuation of our key currencies that started to occur at the end of the third quarter. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be between $210 million and $230 million, which includes between $70 million and $85 million of capital related to restructuring. 
As we look back on the third quarter of 2011, we are pleased to deliver another strong quarter of results. We continue to be encouraged by the strength of our brand, which is demonstrated in part by a great response to our 2012 model year motorcycles and strong total demand for new and used Harley-Davidson motorcycles. We are also pleased to report that we repurchased $91 million of our stock during the quarter. While delivering another strong quarter, we recognize the many challenges that lie ahead of us and our customers, and therefore, will continue to manage the business prudently as we navigate through any uncertainties that the future might bring. Overall, the fundamentals of our business are strong and we are excited about the long term. We continue to build a solid foundation for sustainable growth. We remain focused on executing against our strategies to complete the transformation of our organization and grow our business while delivering strong margins, strong returns and value to our shareholders. Thank you for your continued confidence and investment in Harley-Davidson. And now, I'll open the call up to your questions."

Well, I'm going to start with the second question first, is the impact of your transformation on the third quarter and then we'll talk a little bit about the guidance that we presented. When we look at gross margin, the story in the third quart",487,"Okay, Tim. Well, I'm going to start with the second question first, is the impact of your transformation on the third quarter and then we'll talk a little bit about the guidance that we presented. When we look at gross margin, the story in the third quarter really comes in 2 areas. One is in the impact of the York transformation and the other is in the currency. Certainly, the transformation and the aspects included in that were expected. They came in 2 flavors. One was mix was impacted so we saw unfavorable mix in the quarter of $26.6 million due to the disruption in the temporary capacity constraints due to York restructuring. And when we look at that, several things happened in mix. One is that given the temporary capacity constraints, we relied more on product coming out of our Kansas City facility, which typically have lower margins. So we shipped less as a percent in Touring and custom motorcycles than we did our Sportsters. And the temporary capacity constraints also affected our model mix. And within the quarter, we shipped lower content in lower priced bikes and again, that was due to all the activities that we were going on in this facility. And finally , our geographic shipment mix was affected by the magnitude of change at York. And just one second on that, again, Keith had mentioned we took 4 families of motorcycles, some 22 models and put them all under the same line so all our employees are building all of our bikes. And within that change, we had 95% of our hourly employees are in or will be in new jobs in the short period of time. So again, we experienced a lot of downtime. So a lot of it manifested itself in mix and in the second piece, where it manifested itself was on the manufacturing line. And we saw the manufacturing temporary inefficiencies on year-over-year basis were unfavorable by $3 million. I would like to point out though on the manufacturing line, we did deliver $20 million of favorability. And if you look back in the first quarter, that was actually a negative $21 million improved to a favorable $7 million in the second quarter. And then, again, this quarter at $20 million. So the second part of your question, Tim, was on the gross margin guidance. So as we look at gross margin, as we sit through 3 quarters, we are at 34.0% and the gross margin guidance that we had was 34% to 35%. So with roughly 80% of the revenue behind us and the uncertainty related to the currency situation, we felt it was prudent to lower the range by half a percentage point. It's important to note here that there is nothing concerning to us about our core business or the restructuring. We're very pleased with the retail sales, our shipments and certainly the restructuring."

I think in the third quarter, we certainly experienced that more than we had in previous quarters, and we expect that to loosen up a little bit in the fourth quarter. So when we look at overall mix, we do expect mix to improve a bit in the third and the fourth quarter, given the fact that the temporary capacity constraints are not as significant at that time. But as I said, Sharon, we will continue to experience the temporary inefficiencies and capacity constraints until the restructuring is complete on a systemwide basis toward the end of 2013. So while we're not providing shipment guidance at this point for next year, we do believe that there is modest opportunity for increases in production next year despite the temporary constraints."

It impacted overall gross margins by nearly a percentage point and that was due to the favorable revenue side of it and much less favorable on the profit side. The profit side was brought down quite considerably as we revalued. So every quarter we've got to revalue our foreign assets given the currency exchange rates and that happens at the exchange rate at the end of the quarter. And so they drop significantly from the beginning of the quarter. Euro fell 5%, Australian dollars fell 7% and the Rial fell 14% from the beginning of the quarter. So we don't know what will happen in the fourth quarter if currency exchange rates improve, the revaluation will be favorable if they're higher than they were in the first -- beginning of the fourth quarter. So we don't know what that is, but overall, the Euro, Australian dollar and Rial are lower than they were that we enjoyed on an average basis on the third quarter. And so we're cautious about currency at this point. But we don't know where it's going to end up and all as we know it, it's been hit largely -- taking place in Europe."

Remember, when we've said numerous times in the past, mix is affected by family mix, model mix, geographic mix, option mix and mix within P&A and General Merchandise. During the third quarter, we had impacts for many of these factors and with many of them being unfavorable, largely driven by the events at York. So let's go through some of them. Is family mix perspective that was unfavorable, and that was straight family on a shift between lower-priced bikes and higher-priced bikes, largely because York produces most of our higher margin bikes, which are the Touring and Softail line. So we have a couple of percentage point shift between our production at York and in Kansas City. The -- also were affected by the model mix. So for most of the year, we had favorable model mix and that is people trading up to higher-priced bikes within a family. And given the activities at York, the model mix was also unfavorable this quarter as the Touring and Softail families reproduced motorcycles with lower content and therefore, lower-priced bikes during the quarter. And finally, the third piece of the York effect was normal shipping patterns were disrupted due to the magnitude of change that was occurring in York. And that had an impact in our geographic mix or the shipment to various countries and shipping bikes to lower-margin countries. And even outside the motorcycle mix, we had unfavorable mix in our P&A business. And as we work to increase our share of the consumables line of products, which includes oils and tires, but they're at a lower margin than our parts and accessories, so we had a little bit unfavorable mix there. So it's not only motorcycle that's across all of the revenue base. And so you can apply it all to motorcycle margins, Joe."

And so if we just sort of go back about a year, I mean I don't think anything's a whole lot different than what we've said. We said all along that first of all, the transformation that we were going to go through, not only in York but also in Milwaukee and Tomahawk in Kansas City, is big. So this is not us just sort of shuffling people around. You got to remember we outsource over half of the work in terms of people that were in the York facility. So we're just now going through the belly of that whole transition and coming out of that. And as John mentioned, so what that means is that a lot of people that worked in stamping or plating or grinding or wherever are now -- have now been shifted over to the new assembly line. So they're all going through massive training and learning on the job. In addition to that, we've taken the dedicated assembly lines where we would produce just one family of products, sort of a repetitive manufacturing process, that we move now to the flexible manufacturing line whereby all those products can be built on the same line, which introduces a lot of complexity in terms of production planning, component planning and those kinds of things. And in addition to that, you can imagine the amount of systems work and software involved in the guided robotic systems that we now produce all of our products on. So it's like a massive amount of change. And we've said all along that we would be out of this part of the change, at least in York, at the end of 2012. So we're still a year away. So it's hard for us to predict, quite frankly, from day-to-day, what kind of issues we're going to have. Now if you go back in time about a month, we had some -- a lot of significant issues with downtime because we have outsourced a lot of our subassembly work and we we're having some problems with getting the right parts to the line at the right time. And all those issues now have been, I would say resolved 95%. Our run rates have come up significantly in the last month. We're hitting more of our schedule on a daily basis. And so, I mean, are we disappointed that things haven't been perfect? Yes. But I will tell you that we we're pleased with where we are in this transformation, given the magnitude of the work. And so I think it will only get better. And again, we're running one shift because we just could not -- we cannot absorb that amount of retraining and training on more than one  shift at this point in time. So any concerns about capacity in the future, there are 3 shifts in a day, right? So, I mean, and we've said this all along, capacity is not going to be an issue. And the ability for us to get our mix back in line isn't going to be an issue in the future. And we will be able to produce at line rates, et cetera. Now is that going to be 3 days from now or 10 days from now or 18 days from now? I mean, it's hard for me to say. But I hope that helps clarify that what we're doing here is, if you go back to our strategic plan and you go back to our transformation plan, what we're doing is putting in a flexible, world-class, manufacturing process, which, when completed, will give us the flexibility to be closer to our customer, to be much more cost effective, and to be able to move more toward customization of production in the plant. So this is a little bit longer term solution that we're looking at here and we have a lot of great people on-site, working through these issues everyday and we feel good about where we're at."

Good morning, and thanks to all of you for joining us on the Third Quarter Earnings Call. Harley-Davidson again turned in a strong performance in the third quarter, with earnings nearly doubled those of the year ago period and worldwide dealer new motorcycle sales up more than 5% from last year's third quarter. The third quarter results reflect our continued progress at implementing our business strategy. Through this strategy, we are, number one, transforming our production operations into a lean, flexible and best-in-class system; secondly, bringing lean engineering to our product development, significantly reducing the time it takes to bring new motorcycles to market. We are focusing on retail excellence to deliver a personalized, compelling and premium experience for every customer, every time, everywhere. We're also attracting new groups of customers as we build on our leadership among young adults and other outreach segments, and we're expanding the global reach of Harley-Davidson brand as we become truly multicultural and multi-generational. 
In short, there's a tremendous amount of transformational work going on throughout the organization. Each and every one of these strategic initiatives is a major undertaking all on its own. So I can tell you, I'm very proud of the dedication of all of our employees, including our union leadership, and the focus of everyone in the organization to bring these changes to life. 
You know, just last week, I spent a day at our final assembly plant in York, Pennsylvania. And the scope of change there is tremendous and there's been a great deal of progress. From 4 separate assembly lines and operations in more than 20 buildings, we now have a much smaller campus and build all Softail, Touring, CVO, and Trike vehicles on one assembly line in all of the different configurations required for U.S. and international markets. It's an incredibly complex work and many challenges still lie ahead as we bring the new operating system online. But in spite of the short-term inefficiencies, the attitudes, engagement and pride of everyone in bringing these changes to life is truly energizing. 
Similarly, in our Kansas City plant is now well down the path of implementing the changes there to become best in class. And we're looking ahead to the full implementation of the contracts in the first part of the year in Wisconsin that we expect will enable us to realize the transformational opportunity across our entire company. 
I also want to acknowledge our dealers for their continued efforts to deliver results at retail, which we are seeing in the sales increases of retail even as challenging economic headwinds continue. On last quarter's call, we talked about Retail 2020,  a long-term global initiative to take the Harley-Davidson retail experience, as good as it is, to the next level. Retail 2020 will provide the overall arching multichannel approach, systems and processes to grow the Harley-Davidson brand at retail and define the Harley-Davidson standard of retail excellence. Just like the work going on in production and product development, Retail 2020 is about being best in class and positioning Harley-Davidson dealers and the company alike to profitably meet the constantly evolving needs of our customers. 
Before I wrap it up and turn it over to John for the details of the quarter, let me touch on the current economic climate. We remain cautious about consumer confidence and the economy in general, just as we have been throughout 2011, and we will continue to manage the business prudently. But through our strategy and actions we've taken, we believe we are restoring Harley-Davidson to a strong foundation and positioning the company to grow and extend the reach of the brand around the world. These are exciting times at Harley-Davidson as we transform our business to be best in class in everything we do that make customers' dreams a reality by delivering remarkable products and extraordinary customer experiences. 
I'll be back later for questions, but let me turn it over to John."

I'll review the third quarter financial results starting on Slide 10. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson Inc. consolidated revenue was up 10.9% behind the 15.9% increase in shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Our third quarter income from continuing operations improved to $183.6 million, an increase of 95.9%. Similarly, diluted earnings per share rose to $0.78 per share, up from the year ago quarter, which was $0.40 per share. Operating income from the Motorcycle business was up 78% compared to last year's third quarter. The strong increase in the Motorcycle business was driven by increased motorcycle shipments and lower spending on ongoing restructuring activities, partially offset by a lower gross margin as compared to last year. 
Operating income at Harley-Davidson Financial Services was up 21.9% behind improved credit loss performance. Finally, our improved financial performance for the quarter was also driven by a lower year-over-year interest expense as a result of last December's repurchase of $297 million of high-interest notes and a lower effective tax rate as compared to last year. We are very pleased with the third quarter's results and continued progress against our goal strategies and the transformation of our business. 
Now let's take a look at retail sales on Slide 11. Overall, worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were up 5.1% in third quarter. In the U.S., retail sales continue to be strong despite a very challenging economic environment. During the quarter, we introduced our 2012 model year motorcycles and they have been well received by both our dealers and customers. Market share in the U.S. was 57.9%, up 1.3 percentage points compared to last year's third quarter, as the Harley-Davidson brand continued to show its strength while many of our competitors continue to discount prices to move aging inventory. 
Retail sales in the international markets grew 4.4% during the quarter, driven by growth in Latin America, Europe and Asia Pacific regions. The Latin America region was up 27.9%, driven primarily by strength in Mexico and Brazil. In Brazil, the new dealer network continues to come up to speed. As we have discussed, we closed all 9 dealerships and have appointed 10 new dealers, of which 8 are up and running. This was planned as part of the agreement that we announced in December 2010 to terminate the exclusive dealer contract that was in place and expand our presence in Brazil. 
Retail sales in the Europe region were up 4.4% in the quarter compared to 2010. The Europe region saw strong sales in Northern European countries and in our emerging markets in the region, partially offset by softness in Southern European countries. Retail sales in Asia Pacific region were up 1.8% driven by double-digit gains in Australia and emerging markets, which include India and China. We continue to experience declines in Japan as that country works to recover from the tragic events earlier this year. 
On Slide 12, you will see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the quarter were up compared to last year and within our expected range of 60,000 to 65,000 motorcycles for the quarter. During the quarter, mix shifted from Touring and custom motorcycles to Sportsters, largely due to the York restructuring, which impacted production at that facility. During the quarter, York consolidated Touring, Softail, Trike and CVO production and with single consolidated line. We expect York motorcycle production to be continue to be affected over the next couple of quarters as the new consolidated line comes up to speed. Sportsters represented 22.3% of total shipments, which was higher than last year's Sportster mix. We expect Sportsters as a percentage of total shipments will be at the upper end of our historical range of 18% to 22% for the full year. 
As we noted last quarter, we began shipping 2012 model year Touring and Sportster motorcycles in the U.S. at the end of June, which was a few weeks earlier than normal. We released these models early as a result of tight retail inventory situation in the U.S.. Shipments of the remaining 2012 models started in late July as they normally do. 
Slide 13 provides some additional detail on the U.S. dealer network inventory and strength of our brand as measured by total demand. During the third quarter in the U.S., we shipped about 41,100 Harley-Davidson motorcycles and dealers sold roughly 42,600 at retail. As a result of strong third quarter retail sales and temperate production constraints experienced at York, U.S. dealer network inventory was drawn down about 1,600 units from the second quarter of 2011 and was down about 1,900 units compared to last year's third quarter. In addition to overall site inventory, dealers ended the quarter with very low levels of 2011 model year carryover units. 
We are pleased to report that U.S. dealer network profit margins have increased behind higher retail sales and prudent management of the cost structures. In light of ongoing uncertain economic challenges, we remain committed to aggressively managing new motorcycle supply in line with demand. However, we do recognize that aggregate U.S. dealer inventory continues to be below what we believe is an appropriate ongoing level and we will continue to work toward replenishing dealer inventory levels of new motorcycles. 
We continue to support the dealer's efforts to sell more used bikes. We believe healthy used bikes sales enhance dealer revenue, maintain resale values and help near the gap between new and used motorcycle pricing. Used bike sales by the U.S. dealer network continue to be up double digits through August compared to the same period last year. When used motorcycle sales are combined with new retail sales in the U.S., total demand for Harley-Davidson motorcycles continues to be strong. 
On Slide 14, you will see revenue for the Motorcycles and Related Products segment was up 13.4% in the third quarter behind strong growth from all our businesses. Harley-Davidson motorcycle revenue was up 15.5% behind the 15.9% increase of shipments. During the quarter, average motorcycle revenue for Harley-Davidson units shipped decreased $52 from the prior year as a result of unfavorable product mix, partially offset by significant currency exchange favorability in the previously announced price increase on our 2012 model year motorcycles. Parts and Accessories sales were up 7.6% for the quarter, driven in part by a focus on product availability, high demand for new accessory product offerings and growth and worldwide and used retail motorcycle sales.  General Merchandise was up over 8% in the third quarter as a result of sportswear growth and the impact of worldwide new motorcycle sales increases on leather and riding gear. 
Turning to restructuring on Slide 15. We are continuing our efforts to improve our cost structure and transform the business to be stronger and more profitable in the future. York continues to be a key focus of our restructuring activities. As we mentioned, during the third quarter, we combined assembly of all models produced at York and with a single assembly line. As anticipated, these changes resulted in temporary inefficiencies and temporary capacity constraints. 
We are pleased to report that all manufacturing at York is now in a single building. The team at York has done an outstanding job of reducing our operating cost structure and increasing our manufacturing flexibility. The focus at York for the next couple of quarters will be to consistently increase our throughput until we reach our targeted lease. Consequently, during the fourth quarter, we anticipate that there will be continued downtime as workers on a new production lines are trained and production comes up to speed. 
The next step in the structuring, which will occur in 2012, will be to implement a new ERP system at York, which we expect will give us many new capabilities across the supply chain, including the ability to do more made-to-order production, implement production surge capabilities in 2013 and provide end-to-end supply chain integration. As we work toward completing our restructuring, we will continue to experience temporary inefficiencies and temporary capacity constraints. We continue to expect the manufacturing restructuring to be largely complete by the end of 2012. 
During the third quarter, we incurred $12.4 million in restructuring expenses and $49 million year-to-date. Restructuring activities are largely on plan through the first 9 months of the year and costs are coming in lower than we originally expected. As you will see, we reduced the expected 2011 restructuring cost by $10 million to a range of $70 million to $80 million. Consequently, we now expect total costs to be between $480 million and $495 million by 2013. The expected savings in capital spending estimates associated with restructuring activities are unchanged. 
On Slide 16, you will see gross margin in the quarter was 33.7%, which was lower than last year. Gross margin for the quarter was impacted by 6 key drivers. First, volume was favorably impacted by increased motorcycle shipments, which were up 15.9% in the quarter, and increased Parts and Accessories and General Merchandise sales compared to last year. Second, you'll see we've added a motorcycle pricing line to the Slide to reflect our previously announced price increase on 2012 motorcycles. During the quarter, gross margin was improved by $7.7 million as a result of the price increase. Third, mix was unfavorable by $26.6 million, largely driven by the temporary disruptions at York, which caused temporary capacity constraints and impacted the mix between families, models and the geographic shipments of motorcycles during the third quarter. Fourth, foreign currency exchange during the quarter has positively impacted gross margin by $2.7 million. While currency exchange during the quarter had a modest favorable impact on profit, currency exchange had an unfavorable impact on gross margin percent of nearly 1 percentage point, largely due to balance sheet revaluations following the significant decline in the Euro, Australian dollar and Rial exchange rates that occurred in the last 3  weeks of the quarter. Next, raw materials were unfavorable $7.9 million due to increase metals and fuel costs. And finally, manufacturing benefited from restructuring savings and incremental margin on higher volumes, partially offset by approximately $3 million in temporary inefficiencies associated with the transformation underway at our York facility. 
During the fourth quarter, we expect continued pressure on margins from the currency exchange I mentioned earlier, higher raw material costs and continuing temporary inefficiencies at York. 
On Slide 17, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the third quarter was 14.7% versus 9.3% in 2010. Operating margin was favorably impacted by higher gross margin and lower year-over-year restructuring spending. As expected, SG&A was roughly $11 million higher during the quarter compared to the same period last year as we continue to invest in the future. During the fourth quarter, we expect SG&A to be higher than last year's fourth quarter due in part to our continued investment in our growth initiatives. We continue to expect SG&A spending to decline as a percent of revenue between 2009 and 2014. 
Now moving on to our Financial Services segment on Slide 18. In the third quarter, HDFS operating profit improved $11.1 million, or 21.9%, compared to the last year. The 3 key drivers of the third quarter results were net interest income was $7.9 million lower in the third quarter of 2011 versus third quarter of 2010. During the quarter, HDFS was able to repurchase at market prices approximately $44 million of the outstanding 2018 medium-term notes originally issued at an interest rate of 6.8%, allowing us to replace this debt with lower interest rate debt. The repurchase of these notes resulted in $8.7 million current period loss. We will continue to evaluate future debt repurchase opportunities as they arise. 
Next, the provision for retail credit losses was $15.7 million lower in the third quarter of 2011 versus third quarter 2010, primarily due to improved credit losses as a result of favorable retail receivables performance. And finally, the provision for wholesale credit losses was $5 million lower in the third quarter of 2011, primarily due to favorable wholesale loss performance. 
It's important to note that on a year-to-date basis, we've released approximately $37 million of allowance from the balance sheet, given anticipated credit loss performance across the entire portfolio. While the release of this allowance benefits income this year, we cannot assume a similar financial benefit will occur in 2012. As we look forward to 2012, we believe HDFS's operating income will decrease compared to 2011, primarily due to the lapping of $37 million of 2011 balance sheet allowance releases I just mentioned. We expect 2012 operating income will also be impacted by lower net interest and the book of retail loans continues to contract, and modest tightening of margins on prime share retail lending. 
Despite the anticipated decrease in year-over-year HDFS operating income, the business is healthy and expected to be solidly profitable in 2012. We are very pleased with the performance of the business and believe HDFS provides a competitive advantage for sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles and related products. 
Now Larry will provide more detail on HDFS as operations on Slide 19. Larry?"

During the third quarter, HDFS retail motorcycle loan originations increased 14.2%, or $78 million, compared to the same period last year. The increase was driven by higher new motorcycle loan originations behind a strong increase in retail sales and a 2.6 percentage point increase in market share. Used motorcycle loan originations also increased compared to last year. However, as the higher level of receivables originated prior to the start of the economic downturn roll off the books, finance receivables outstanding decreased 5.5% compared to a year ago. This decline in receivables pool reflects the lower U.S. retail sales over the last 2 years that will continue to impact HDFS net interest income. 
Over the past several quarters, HDFS has been focused on prudently increasing overall credit application approval rates. And we saw a modest increase in the third quarter. Our goal is to have a portfolio that continues to perform well over time and delivers an appropriate return on equity. 
We are very pleased with the improved retail delinquency rate and retail credit losses compared to last year, which you will see on Slide 20. The 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at the end of the third quarter was 3.73%, or 110 basis points better than the same date last year. Annualized retail credit losses improved by 93 basis points to 1.11% in the first 9 months compared to the first 9 months of last year. This improvement was driven by the impact of changes in underwriting implemented 2 years ago, as well as a lower frequency of loss and improvement in the recovery values of repossessed motorcycles. 
As John mentioned, during the quarter, we reduced the total allowance for credit losses by $11.8 million to reflect lower anticipated credit losses and lower receivable balances. We will continue to evaluate the allowance each quarter using our disciplined process and make adjustments as appropriate. We are pleased with the continued improvement in credit performance and we will continue to monitor the unemployment picture, motorcycle recovery values, and the overall U.S. economic environment and manage HDFS appropriately. 
During the third quarter, HDFS delivered increased profits and maintained a strong liquidity position. We remain focused on enabling retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles while providing an attractive return to Harley-Davidson Inc. 
Now let me turn it back to John."

You will see that at the end of the quarter, we had just over $1.6 billion of cash and marketable securities. In addition, HDFS had approximately $980 million of available liquidity through bank, credit and conduit facilities. We currently have and will continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and/or committed credit facilities. During the quarter, we completed a $600 million term securitization transaction at a weighted average rate of 0.84% and renewed $600 million conduit facility. I am also very pleased to report that we repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares of Harley-Davidson stock for $91 million. This is in addition to the 25% second quarter dividend increase. As we have stated, returning value to our shareholders through dividend and share repurchases is a top priority.  Looking forward, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance value to our shareholders. 
Now I'll review the remaining Harley-Davidson financials on Slide 22. I would like to highlight 2 items on this slide. First, with regards to continuing operations, the company generated operating cash of $902 million during the first 9 months of 2011, which included a $200 million contribution to our pension plans. And second, through 9 months, the company's effective tax rate was 30.4%, compared to 34.0% in the year ago period. The 2011 effective tax rate in the third quarter was favorably impacted by settlement of an IRS audit, as well as a change in the Wisconsin income tax law associated with certain net operating losses. Last year, the effective tax rate through the third quarter was negatively impacted by the Health Care Reform Legislation offset by a favorable settlement of an IRS audit. We now expect the full year effective income tax rate will be approximately 31% for 2011. 
Now turning to guidance on Slide 23. We continue to expect full year 2011 Harley-Davidson motorcycle shipments to be between 228,000 and 235,000 units, up 8% to 12% from 2010. During the fourth quarter, we expect to ship between 45,500 and 52,500 units. We now expect full year 2011 gross margin will be between 33.5% and 34.5%. The guidance has been adjusted to account for the additional pressure we now expect from foreign currency exchange as a result of the significant decrease in valuation of our key currencies that started to occur at the end of the third quarter. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be between $210 million and $230 million, which includes between $70 million and $85 million of capital related to restructuring. 
As we look back on the third quarter of 2011, we are pleased to deliver another strong quarter of results. We continue to be encouraged by the strength of our brand, which is demonstrated in part by a great response to our 2012 model year motorcycles and strong total demand for new and used Harley-Davidson motorcycles. We are also pleased to report that we repurchased $91 million of our stock during the quarter. While delivering another strong quarter, we recognize the many challenges that lie ahead of us and our customers, and therefore, will continue to manage the business prudently as we navigate through any uncertainties that the future might bring. 
Overall, the fundamentals of our business are strong and we are excited about the long term. We continue to build a solid foundation for sustainable growth. We remain focused on executing against our strategies to complete the transformation of our organization and grow our business while delivering strong margins, strong returns and value to our shareholders. Thank you for your continued confidence and investment in Harley-Davidson. 
And now, I'll open the call up to your questions."

And then, yet even though your production in the third quarter was lower, in the lower half of your guidance range, did that impact the gross margin or -- and I guess, in relation to that, is the impact there -- were the inefficiencies at York greater than anticipated during the third quarter.

Well, I'm going to start with the second question first, is the impact of the York transformation on the third quarter, and then we'll talk a little bit about the guidance that we presented. When we look at gross margin, the story in the third quarter really comes in 2 areas. One is in the impact of the York transformation and the other is in the currency. Certainly, the transformation and the aspects included in that were expected. They came in 2 flavors. One was mix was impacted, so we saw unfavorable mix in the quarter of $26.6 million due to the disruption in the temporary capacity constraints due to York restructuring. And when we look at that, several things happened in mix. One is that, given the temporary capacity constraints, we relied more on product coming out of our Kansas City facility, which typically have lower margins. So we shipped less as a percent in Touring and custom motorcycles than we did our Sportsters. And the temporary capacity constraints also affected our model mix. And within the quarter, we shipped lower content in lower priced bikes and, again, that was due to all the activities that we were going on in this facility. And finally, our geographic shipment mix was affected by the magnitude of change at York. And just one second on that, again, Keith had mentioned we took 4 families of motorcycles, some 22 models and put them all under the same line so all our employees are building all of our bikes. And within that change, we had 95% of our hourly employees are in or will be in new jobs in a short period of time. So again, we experienced a lot of downtime. So a lot of it manifested itself in mix. And in the second piece where it manifested itself was on the manufacturing line. And we saw the manufacturing temporary inefficiencies on a year-over-year basis were unfavorable by $3 million. I would like to point out, though, on the manufacturing line, we did deliver $20 million of favorability. And if you look back in the first quarter, that was actually a negative $21 million improved to a favorable $7 million in the second quarter. And then, again, this quarter at $20 million. So the second part of your question, Tim, was on the gross margin guidance. So as we look at gross margin, as we sit through 3 quarters, we are at 34.0% and the gross margin guidance that we had was 34% to 35%. So with roughly 80% of the revenue behind us and the uncertainty related to the currency situation, we felt it was prudent to lower the range by half a percentage point. It's important to note here that there is nothing concerning to us about our core business or the restructuring. We're very pleased with the retail sales, our shipments and certainly the restructuring."

But as I said, Sharon, we will continue to experience the temporary inefficiencies and capacity constraints until the restructuring is complete on a systemwide basis toward the end of 2013. So while we're not providing shipment guidance at this point for next year, we do believe that there is modest opportunity for increases in production next year despite the temporary constraints."

As we look at the fourth quarter, we expect mix to improve modestly, but to continue to be pressured by the continuing restructuring that we have at York. With regards to the currency, it all depends on what happens to our currency exchange rates. They are significantly lower today than they were a quarter ago. And in the near term, we do have some of that hedged. And again, the acute thing that happened in the third quarter was revaluation of our balance sheet assets and liability as that's kind of a low point of currencies and given the situation that we see in Europe. So making no forward projection with regards to what's going to happen to currency exchange rates, but they are lower today than they were as we started out the third quarter. And finally, James, the last question was on the $3 million of temporary inefficiencies, I believe in the third quarter, and how do they look going forward. Again, with the activities that have taken place at York, we expect that to continue to get better and improve. And it just takes a lot of time when you're moving all the assets that we've got and retraining all the workers that are out there and the magnitude of activity that's going on. So we expect that to be better in future quarters and better in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter a year ago, we had temporary inefficiencies at that time, which were driven by us outsourcing all the things that we used to make, the non-core parts, and the excess overheads that we were carrying, and that was a $5 million hit a year ago.

As far as a percentage of our gross margin percent, it impacted overall gross margins by nearly a percentage point.

So every quarter we've got to revalue our foreign assets, given the currency exchange rates, and that happens at the exchange rate at the end of the quarter. And so they drop significantly from the beginning of the quarter. The euro fell 5%, Australian dollars fell 7% and the real fell 14% from the beginning of the quarter. So we don't know what will happen in the fourth quarter. If currency exchange rates improve, the revaluation will be favorable if they're higher than they were in the first -- beginning of the fourth quarter. So we don't know what that is. But overall, the euro, Australian dollar and real are lower than they were, that we enjoyed on an average basis in the third quarter. And so we're cautious about currency at this point.

Is family mix perspective, that was unfavorable. And that was straight family on a shift between lower-priced bikes and higher-priced bikes. Largely because York produces most of our higher margin bikes, which are the Touring and Softail line. So we have a couple of percentage point shift between our production at York and in Kansas City. The -- also were affected by the model mix. So for most of the year, we've had favorable model mix. And that is people trading up to higher-priced bikes within a family. And given the activities at York, the model mix was also unfavorable this quarter as the Touring and Softail families reproduced motorcycles with lower content and, therefore, lower-priced bikes during the quarter. And finally, the third piece of the York effect was normal shipping patterns were disrupted due to the magnitude of change that was occurring in York. And that had an impact in our geographic mix, or the shipment to various countries, and shipping bikes to lower-margin countries. And even outside the motorcycle mix, we had unfavorable mix in our P&A business. And as we work to increase our share of the consumables line of products, which includes oils and tires, they're at a lower margin than our parts and accessories, so we had a little bit unfavorable mix there. So it's not only motorcycle, it's across all of the revenue base. And so you can't apply it all to motorcycle margins, Joe."

It sounds like from your perspective the line rates are about where you would have expected them to be. But you did ship kind of toward the lower end of guidance this quarter and it's a relatively wide range of production expected for the fourth quarter. So just at the margin, it kind of seems like maybe it's -- the line rates are maybe a little lower than where you would ideally think that they would be at this point. Can you just help me reconcile that a little bit with your commentary that it -- you're where you expected to be?"

And so if we just sort of go back about a year, I mean, I don't think anything's a whole lot different than what we've said. We said all along that first of all, the transformation that we were going to go through, not only in York but also in Milwaukee and Tomahawk and Kansas City, is big. So this is not us just sort of shuffling people around. You've got to remember, we outsource over half of the work in terms of people that were in the York facility. So we're just now going through the belly of that whole transition and coming out of that. And as John mentioned, so what that means is, is that a lot of people that worked in stamping or plating or grinding or wherever are now -- have now been shifted over to the new assembly line. So they're all going through massive training and learning on the job. In addition to that, we've taken the dedicated assembly lines where we would produce just one family of products, sort of a repetitive manufacturing process, that we move now to the flexible manufacturing line whereby all those products can be built on the same line, which introduces a lot of complexity in terms of production planning, component planning and those kinds of things. And in addition to that, you can imagine the amount of systems work and software involved in the guided robotic systems that we now produce all of our products on. So it's like a massive amount of change. And we've said all along that we would be out of this part of the change, at least in York, at the end of 2012. So we're still a year away. So it's hard for us to predict, quite frankly, from day-to-day, what kind of issues we're going to have. Now if you go back in time about a month, we had some -- a lot of significant issues with downtime because we had outsourced a lot of our subassembly work and we we're having some problems with getting the right parts to the line at the right time. And all those issues now have been, I would say, resolved 95%. Our run rates have come up significantly in the last month. We're hitting more of our schedule on a daily basis. And so, I mean, are we disappointed that things haven't been perfect? Yes. But I will tell you that we're pleased with where we are in this transformation, given the magnitude of the work. And so I think it will only get better. And again, we're running one shift because we just could not -- we cannot absorb that amount of retraining and training on more than one  shift at this point in time. So any concerns about capacity in the future, there are 3 shifts in a day, right? So, I mean, and we've said this all along, capacity is not going to be an issue. And the ability for us to get our mix back in line isn't going to be an issue in the future. And we will be able to produce at line rates, et cetera. Now is that going to be 3 days from now or 10 days from now or 18 days from now? I mean, it's hard for me to say. But I hope that helps clarify that what we're doing here is, if you go back to our strategic plan and you go back to our transformation plan, what we're doing is putting in a flexible, world-class, manufacturing process, which, when completed, will give us the flexibility to be closer to our customer, to be much more cost effective, and to be able to move more toward customization of production in the plant. So this is a little bit longer term solution that we're looking at here and we have a lot of great people on-site, working through these issues every day and we feel good about where we're at."
