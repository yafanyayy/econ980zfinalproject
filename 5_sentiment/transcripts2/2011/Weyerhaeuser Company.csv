The earnings release and materials for this call can be found at the website or by contacting April Meier at (253) 924-2937. 
Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. Joining me this morning are Dan Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patty Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported Q4 2010 net earnings of $171 million or $0.32 per diluted share, a net sales of $1.7 billion. Fourth quarter earnings include after-tax gains of $119 million from special items, an after-tax gains of $31 million on the sale of five short line railroads, an after-tax charge of $89 million for restructuring, closures and impairment. Income tax adjustments of $177 million, which include benefits of $149 million from the Cellulosic Biofuel Producers Credit and $22 million from the reversal of deferred tax liabilities related to the company's REIT conversion. 
As we commented last quarter, the Cellulosic Biofuels Credit offsets income tax liability. We will carry the credit forward. Excluding these items, the company reported Q4 2010 earnings of $52 million or $0.10 per diluted share. 
For the full year of 2010, Weyerhaeuser reported net earnings of $1,281,000,000 or $3.99 per diluted share on net sales of $6.6 billion. Full year 2010 earnings, include $1,064,000,000 from income tax adjustments related to Weyerhaeuser's conversion to a Real Estate Investment Trust. 
The financial data accompanying our earnings release has been redesigned. We hope you find this new format useful and welcome your comments. Please turn to the earnings information package available on our website. This package includes a GAAP reconciliation of special item. In our discussions in the business segments, we will refer to Charts 4 through 10. 
Turning to Chart 4, changes in contribution to earnings by segment. This chart illustrates the change in contribution by business segments from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. We began our business segment discussion of the fourth quarter with Timberlands, Charts 5 and 6. 
In the fourth quarter, Timberlands contributed $56 million pretax to earnings. The Q3 pretax contribution was $75 million. Earnings from Weyerhaeuser Timberlands disposition decline from $34 million in Q3 to $19 million in Q4. 
Sales volumes declined 3%. Costs were higher due to seasonal downtime in the west and slightly higher fuel costs in silvicultural spending in the south. Key depletion declined 3% in fourth quarter as we continue to defer the harvest. In 2010, the harvest was down an additional 10% from the already reduced level of 2009. 
Western log prices rose 4% while Southern log prices declined 4%. Japanese log export softened in Q4. However, log exports to China increased 10% in the quarter. Japan continues to be our largest log export market. 
Wood Products, Charts 7 and 8. Seasonally slower demand and continued difficult market conditions affected the fourth quarter. Before special items, Wood Products lost $85 million. In the previous quarter, the segment lost $100 million. Log cost was slightly lower in the quarter and SG&A cost decreased. Total sales realizations were flat in Q4 with slight increases in lumber prices offsetting decreases in OSB and plywood prices. Lumber sales realizations increased $6 per thousand or 2%. And OSB prices decreased $7 per thousand square feet or 4%. 
Engineered solid section and sales realizations were flat compared to Q3. Lumber sales volume was down 8% and OSB sales volume decreased 5%. Volumes for engineered solid sections declined 13% and engineered items volumes decrease 10%. Asset impairment, closures and restructuring charges of $103 million pretax were recognized in the fourth quarter. These charges were for the rationalization of capacity, which includes the permanent closure of three Wood Products facility. 
Turning to Cellulose Fibers, Chart 9. In the fourth quarter, on a pretax basis, Cellulose Fibers earned $138 million. In the third quarter, the business earned $181 million. Costs increased and productivity was lower due to the impact of an annual maintenance outage at the New Bern North Carolina mill. There were no maintenance outages in the third quarter. 
Pulp shipment volumes declined 2% due to the timing of shipments. Pulp prices were flat during the quarter. 
And finally turn to Chart 10, Real Estate. Before special items, RECO contributed $13 million pretax in Q4 earnings. In the third quarter, the business contributed $20 million. 
The quarter included a $20 million charge for asset impairment and restructuring. 606 single-family homes were closed in Q4, a 21% increase from Q3. The fourth quarter is typically the highest quarter for closings. 
The average closing price rose to $439,000 from $400,000 due to mix. The margins on single-family homes sold increased to 26.1% from 24.3% in the previous quarter also due to mix. The quarter included $6 million in land sales and related activity. The backlog of single-family homes sold but not closed decreased to 439 units, a backlog of about 2.5 months. At the end of 2009, the backlog was 3.5 months. 
I will now turn the call over to Dan Fulton. Dan?"

Last year was one of continued market challenges but also a year where we enhanced our ability to return value to our shareholders and saw the benefits of the work we've done to put improve our operations. The",655,"Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Last year was one of continued market challenges but also a year where we enhanced our ability to return value to our shareholders and saw the benefits of the work we've done to put improve our operations. 
The most noteworthy at the end of 2010 involved completion of our conversion to a Real Estate Investment Trust. In that process, shareholders received a $5.6 billion special dividend. 
Going forward, we are targeting a dividend payout ratio of 75% of funds available for distribution over the cycle. Our Board will determine and declare the actual dividend on a quarterly basis. But beginning in March, we anticipate paying a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share or $0.60 per share on an annualized basis. 
Converting to a REIT enhances our ability to operate and grow our core asset. The more than 6 million acres of valuable, sustainably managed Timberland that we hold and it provides significant benefits to our shareholders. 
Throughout 2010, market conditions required our business segments to adjust their strategies and their focus. Timberlands continue to defer harvest to preserve the long-term value of our core asset. As Kathy noted, harvest levels dropped 10% compared with 2009. 
We took advantage of our strategically located Western lands and export facilities to grow Pacific-Rim export volumes. Increased exports helped to offset weak domestic demand, which is primarily linked to U.S. housing markets. In 2010, our export volumes grew 18% year-over-year and export share of our total volume increased from 14% to 19%. 
Increases in shipments to China slightly exceeded increases to Japan for the year though Japan still represents over 75% of our total export volume. 
Wood Products fades to highly volatile market in 2010 as prices rose sharply in the first four months of the year before experiencing a precipitous decline beginning at the end of the second quarter. As you know, on October 1, I asked Larry Burrows to lead this business. 
While performance is still unacceptable, our focus on controlling costs, improving cash flow and rightsizing capacity for our long-term needs has begun to show some progress. Wood Products lost narrowed in the fourth quarter even though the quarter is typically our weakest of the year. 
RECO is one of the most profitable homebuilders in the country in 2010 despite another extremely challenging year for the U.S. housing market. For the year, we increased margins from 18% to 24% by aggressively cutting costs and leveraging the unique value propositions and local market knowledge of our experienced managers. 
Our Cellulose Fibers segment set those earnings and production records in 2010. These achievements are the result of our focus on meeting the needs of our global customers by improving mill system productivity and reducing operating costs, actions that positioned us to take full advantage of strong market conditions for pulp. 
As we mentioned in December, we expect similar housing market conditions for our businesses in 2011. This will continue to present challenges for our Timberlands, Wood Products and Homebuilding segments. 
In December, our outlook for Cellulose Fibers assume some weakening in pulp prices in 2011 but we are pleased that pricing so far in 2011 has remained relatively stable. Despite continuing market challenges, I expect improved performance of our businesses due to progress that we made in 2010, and our ongoing improvements, operational changes and enhanced cost efficiencies. 
We expect to continue to defer a portion of our timber harvest although volumes will increase over 2010. In addition, we will flex our harvest in response to market opportunities, including meeting the growing demand from the Asian export market. I expect our Wood Products segment to be cash flow positive. I expect that RECO, our Homebuilding segment, will continue delivering strong delivery performance relative to its peers. And finally, I expect continued strong operating performance from Cellulose Fibers. 
I'll now turn the call over to Patty, who will provide our first quarter outlook"
107633,117935335,99295,"Weyerhaeuser Co., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2011",2011-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Weyerhaeuser Company","Executives","Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everybody.

The outlook comments for the businesses are summarized on Chart 11, and I'll begin my comments with Timberlands. 
In the West, export and domestic log prices are expected to increase somewhat due to continued strong demand from China. Southern log real realizations maybe down slightly. C harvest volumes are anticipated to increase seasonally in both the South and the West. We don't expect to incur any downtime in the West as was the case in the fourth quarter. 
Cost will likely increase in the West due to higher road costs. But in the South, they should decrease due to seasonally lower silviculture cost. Earlier today, we announced the closing of the sale of approximately 82,000 acres of non-strategic plans in the West. This sale represents results in a pretax gain of approximately $150 million in the first quarter.  The transaction represents the sale of the remainder of the storm-damaged whitewoods that we had on the market during 2010. We're pleased with the sales price of approximately $200 million or $2,400 per acre, which is good value given the mix of species and age classes. 
Before the effect of this sale, we expect that earnings in the first quarter will be higher than the fourth quarter. In Wood Products, we expect that prices and volumes for lumber and OSB will increase over the fourth quarter. Engineered wood realizations are likely to be flat. 
Manufacturing costs should be lower for all product lines due to less downtime and obtaining the benefits of recent capacity rationalization and cost reductions. While the first quarter is a traditionally seasonally low quarter, we do anticipate the loss to decrease significantly compared to the fourth quarter.  
Market conditions for our sale of Fiber segment continued to be favorable. Global inventories for pulp were at low levels as we entered the fourth quarter. The weak U.S. dollar, strong Chinese demand and a steadily improving global economy should result in continued strong pricing in the first quarter. 
Our pulp shipment volumes are expected to increase modestly compared to the fourth quarter. Manufacturing costs will likely increase in the first quarter due to higher fiber and chemical costs. Increased scheduled annual maintenance outages will result in higher maintenance costs and decreased productivity compared to the fourth quarter. 
We expect earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment to be lower in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. In our Homebuilding segment, we expect margins and prices declined due to mix. As Kathy has already discussed, we entered the year with a low backlog and market conditions remain challenging. 
The first quarter is seasonally slow quarter for closings and we expect to close approximately 200 fewer homes than in the fourth quarter. We anticipate a slight loss in our single-family homebuilding operations for the first quarter. 
Now I'll turn to some overall financial comments. As we've previously announced in December, we anticipate that the Board will declare quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share to be paid in March. This payout will be approximately $80 million. 
Following our December announcement, we were pleased that S&P issued a report raising the outlook for our credit rating from negative to stable. We ended the year with strong liquidity, including cash balances of over $1.4 billion and then an unused line of credit of $1 billion. We will be focused on renewing this credit line, which expires at the end of this year. 
Our scheduled debt maturities for 2011 are approximately $30 million, although debt maturities at the beginning of 2012 are over $700 million. Capital expenditures for the company totaled $234 million in 2010 before consideration of cash receipts for government credits of approximately $25 million. 
For 2011, we expect to spend approximately $250 million. In addition, we expect to receive approximately $15 million of additional government credits for energy-related products, projects at our Granbury, Alberta pulp mill. Net of these credits, our cash spend is estimated to be $235 million. 
We anticipate that we will have a seasonal working capital build in the first quarter, primarily related to our Wood Products segment. The amount will depend on market conditions and we will continue our focus of matching supply with demand. During the first quarter, we will also make our semiannual interest payments of approximately $130 million. 
We received the proceeds from the 82,000-acre timber sale yesterday and those will help offset these cash outflows. 
So economic conditions maybe challenging in 2011, we are focused on increasing our financial and operating performance and creating value for shareholders. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Dan and I look forward your questions"

So within our Wood Products business, our primary product lines, as you know, our lumber, oriented strand board, engineered Wood Products. And then we have a Distribution business, which is primarily focused on distributing and marketing our engineered products. Our focus in Wood Products starts with a review of capacity utilization. That led us to take the impairments that we announced in December where we took a permanent closure in several facilities that we had shutdown previously but determined that at least in the next two to three year period, we would not need that capacity. So our focus is on managing our capacity to deal with today's level of demand and that we anticipate in the next two to three years. We're focused on improving capacity utilization that will bring down our manufacturing costs. But in the shutdown of those facilities, we'll also be saving some noncash expense in the form of depreciation but also security and maintenance costs that are related to those facilities. In all of our product lines, we're focused on improving margins, both from improved pricing opportunities as well as continued cost reductions both through our operating and manufacturing costs but also in our SG&A. We took G&A out in the fourth quarter. We expect to take out some more this year as well as selling cost. So Gail, our focus in Wood Products is to respond to the market that we have today to be prepared to respond when the market recovers but in fact be cash positive with the demand that we have today."

With respect to the whole market, we and others, entered the year with lower backlogs than we had one year ago. That's an impact primarily of the housing tax credit that was in place at the beginning of 2010 that as you know, went away at the end of April. So we are entering the new year and other builders entering the year with low backlogs. Normally, the spring selling season starts to kick in following the Super Bowl weekend. So don't count on it this week. But believe me, we are going to be looking for traffic signs and sales signs in our own Homebuilding business. But I think what we do is reflective of what other business builders do. So what we and other builders would expect to see is some pickup in activity but traffic has been relatively anemic. Homebuyers are still challenged with qualification for mortgages, if they're a first time buyer. If they're a move-up buyer, they are challenged by number one, the ability to sell their house. And secondly, a number of these move-up buyers may have mortgages that are underwater so that makes the market relatively sticky. So as we look at 2011, we and others, think of 2011 as a bit of a mirror image of 2010. So 2010 started out more strong, ended up weak. We would expect 2011 to start out weak and then be stronger as we go through the year in order to get to the numbers that are forecast by most economists for 2011 starts. In terms of operating rates in the fourth quarter, in our Lumber business that we were operating at about 60% of capacity. In our OSB business, we were operating at 49% of capacity. In our Engineered Wood Products business, it was more in the 30% range. So Engineered Wood Products, as you know, primarily go into new home construction. Lumber, we've got a number of different markets, including the repair and remodel market. OSB has some alternatives other than just new home construction but the Engineered is focused on new home construction."

And as we sit here today, we're just under $500 million underfunded. Now this includes the liability for our nonqualified plans as well as our qualified plans. And as you know, we don't fund the nonqualified plans. That's about $200 million of that balance. As we look at underfunded status, it improved as a result certainly of the contributions that we made, also the return on the assets that we have invested in those funds. So our investment return was probably on the order of around $500 million. payments out of those plans were around $330 million. And then the other big piece that moved in a negative way in terms of this funded status would be in the actuarial assumption around discount rate. Now the discount rate in the U.S. for example, we moved from 5.9 down to 5.4. In Canada, from 6.1 down to 5.3. The interest rate assumptions increased the underfunded status by about $370 million. So that was a negative factor as we look at the funding. So those are some of the puts and takes. And as we filed the 10-K later this month, you'll see all of the details of it, but those are the main swings in the underfunded status. One thing I would point out as, you look forward into 2011, the noncash expense associated with these plans will change. In 2010, we had a $47 million pension credit as we amortized the actuarial assumption changes. As we go into 2011, that will swing to a $60 million noncash expense as we amortize the actuarial losses that are on our balance sheet today and as they sit in other compress of income. So as we amortized those through the P&L and expense, we anticipate about a $60 million pension expense."

So for example as you look on Page 9, I think it is of the analyst package, we've mentioned that we have about $74 million of credit in the Corporate segment in 2010. That 74 higher than the number I gave you before because the offset to it is the expense that's charged in the segment. And we'll give you a breakdown of that. I think it will be about the charge that will go into the segment line. It's about $48 million.

In terms of logs, as I mentioned in my remarks, we've seen a dramatic pickup in exports to China. It is still only about a fifth of the volume that we're sending to Japan but this has all happened over the past several years. For us, the pickup in exports to China started as we started to harvest the storm-damaged woods upon on the West side of Oregon and Washington following the December 2007 storm. So at that point, they were taking storm damage as well as some of that going to Korea. And over time, what we've seen is a steady upgrade in the value and the quality of the wood that they're taking. It's still not the same grade as the Japan log but there has been really a steady increase in both volume as well as the quality of the logs that they are importing. As you know, some of that is related to the slowdown in exports from Russia. But it seems like it's a combination of slowdown in Russia and perhaps some other markets that may have been exporting into China plus the general pickup in the economy. Still going into what we believe our industrial grades and industrial applications, concrete form work et cetera, but there has been steady improvement. With respect to lumber, they started taking lumber primarily out of British Colombia, build damaged wood, and that continues to be the case. We are further away from the coast in D.C. and so that's not a primary market. But the benefit that we see is to the extent that any volume of logs or lumber is being exported to China. On a marginal basis creates more opportunity for us in North America."

I think the way to think about it is that in terms of increased expense over what we spent in the fourth quarter, for maintenance spend itself, it will probably be on the order of say, $25 million to $30 million additional maintenance expense. And then we'll also have an impact of the productivity of those two mills being down and some additional chemical costs. So I think that's the way to think of going from Q4 to Q1.

So I think your analysis about all-in, year-over-year in this segment is going to be pretty similar. So last year, for example, we had a net credit of $47 million. We charged the segments about $42 million, I think. And so, the additional credit that you see on the analyst package on Page 9 for the Corporate segment I think was $74 million. That $74 million also includes an offset of about $16 million that for the post-employment benefit costs. So you've got two things going on there. You got pension and other post-employment costs and we don't charge other post employment out to the very segment. So that would stay in the corporate. So going forward then into 2011, we'll have about $16 million for pension and another $16 million again for other post employment.

The impact of that mill coming back is actually positive because it creates some additional demand for fiber in the region and puts a number of people back to work in that community that were Weyerhaeuser long-time employees. As we look at other facilities, we look at the impact of the mill if we were to sell it, becoming a competitor. So the Cosmopolis mill was not a competitor of ours. If we were to be exiting other manufacturing facilities, including some in the Wood Products business, we would certainly evaluate the impact on our position in the remaining facilities in that sector and make a determination accordingly whether or not we want to sell it or shut it down."

Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. Joining me this morning are Dan Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patty Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported Q4 2010 net earnings of $171 million or $0.32 per diluted share, a net sales of $1.7 billion. Fourth quarter earnings include after-tax gains of $119 million from special items, an after-tax gain of $31 million on the sale of five short line railroads, an after-tax charge of $89 million for restructuring, closures and impairment. Income tax adjustments of $177 million, which include benefits of $149 million from the Cellulosic Biofuel Producers Credit and $22 million from the reversal of deferred tax liabilities related to the company's REIT conversion. 
As we commented last quarter, the Cellulosic Biofuels Credit offsets income tax liability. We will carry the credit forward. Excluding these items, the company reported Q4 2010 net earnings of $52 million or $0.10 per diluted share. 
For the full year of 2010, Weyerhaeuser reported net earnings of $1,281,000,000 or $3.99 per diluted share on net sales of $6.6 billion. Full year 2010 earnings, include $1,064,000,000 from income tax adjustments related to Weyerhaeuser's conversion to a Real Estate Investment Trust. 
The financial data accompanying our earnings release has been redesigned. We hope you find this new format useful and welcome your comments. Please turn to the earnings information package available on our website. This package includes a GAAP reconciliation of special item. In our discussions of the business segments, we will refer to Charts 4 through 10. 
Turning to Chart 4, changes in contribution to earnings by segment. This chart illustrates the change in contribution by business segments from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. We began our business segment discussion of the fourth quarter with Timberlands, Charts 5 and 6. 
In the fourth quarter, Timberlands contributed $56 million pretax to earnings. The Q3 pretax contribution was $75 million. Earnings from non-strategic Timberlands disposition declined from $34 million in Q3 to $19 million in Q4. 
Sales volumes declined 3%. Costs were higher due to seasonal downtime in the West and slightly higher fuel costs in silvicultural spending in the South. Key depletion declined 3% in fourth quarter as we continue to defer the harvest. In 2010, the fee harvest was down an additional 10% from the already reduced level of 2009. 
Western log prices rose 4% while Southern log prices declined 4%. Japanese log export softened in Q4. However, log exports to China increased 10% in the quarter. Japan continues to be our largest log export market. 
Wood Products, Charts 7 and 8. Seasonally slower demand and continued difficult market conditions affected the fourth quarter. Before special items, Wood Products lost $85 million. In the previous quarter, the segment lost $100 million. Log cost were slightly lower in the quarter and SG&A cost decreased. Total sales realizations were flat in Q4 with slight increases in lumber prices offsetting decreases in OSB and plywood prices. Lumber sales realizations increased $6 per thousand board feet or 2%. And OSB prices decreased $7 per thousand square feet or 4%. 
Engineered Solid Section and I-joists sales realizations were flat compared to Q3. Lumber sales volume was down 8% and OSB sales volume decreased 5%. Volumes for Engineered Solid Sections declined 13% and Engineered I-joists volumes decreased 10%. Asset impairment, closures and restructuring charges of $103 million pretax were recognized in the fourth quarter. These charges were for the rationalization of capacity, which includes the permanent closure of three Wood Products facility. 
Turning to Cellulose Fibers, Chart 9. In the fourth quarter, on a pretax basis, Cellulose Fibers earned $138 million. In the third quarter, the business earned $181 million. Costs increased and productivity was lower due to the impact of an annual maintenance outage at the New Bern North Carolina mill. There were no maintenance outages in the third quarter. 
Pulp shipment volumes declined 2% due to the timing of shipments. Pulp prices were flat in the quarter. 
And finally turn to Chart 10, Real Estate. Before special items, WRECO contributed $13 million pretax to Q4 earnings. In the third quarter, the business contributed $20 million. 
The quarter included a $20 million charge for asset impairment and restructuring. 606 single-family homes were closed in Q4, a 21% increase from Q3. The fourth quarter is typically the highest quarter for closings. 
The average closing price rose to $439,000 from $400,000 due to mix. The margins on single-family homes sold increased to 26.1% for 24.3% in the previous quarter also due to mix. The quarter included $6 million in land sales and related activity. The backlog of single-family homes sold but not closed decreased to 439 units, a backlog of about 2.5 months. At the end of 2009, the backlog was 3.5 months. 
I will now turn the call over to Dan Fulton. Dan?"

Last year was one of continued market challenges but also a year where we enhanced our ability to return value to our shareholders and saw the benefits of the work we've done to improve our operations. The most",653,"Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Last year was one of continued market challenges but also a year where we enhanced our ability to return value to our shareholders and saw the benefits of the work we've done to improve our operations. 
The most noteworthy event of 2010 involved the completion of our conversion to a Real Estate Investment Trust. In the process, shareholders received a $5.6 billion special dividend. 
Going forward, we are targeting a dividend payout ratio of 75% of funds available for distribution over the cycle. Our Board will determine and declare the actual dividend on a quarterly basis, but beginning in March, we anticipate paying a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share or $0.60 per share on an annualized basis. 
Converting to a REIT enhances our ability to operate and grow our core asset. The more than 6 million acres of valuable, sustainably managed timberland that we hold and it provides significant benefits to our shareholders. 
Throughout 2010, market conditions required our business segments to adjust their strategies and their focus. Timberlands continue to defer harvest to preserve the long-term value of our core asset. As Kathy noted, harvest levels dropped 10% compared with 2009. 
We took advantage of our strategically located Western lands and export facilities to grow Pacific Rim export volumes. Increased exports helped to offset weak domestic demand, which is primarily linked to U.S. housing markets. In 2010, our export volumes grew 18% year-over-year and export share of our total volume increased from 14% to 19%. 
Increases in shipments to China slightly exceeded increases to Japan for the year though Japan still represents over 75% of our total export volume. 
Wood Products fades to highly volatile market in 2010 as prices rose sharply in the first four months of the year before experiencing a precipitous decline beginning at the end of the second quarter. As you know, on October 1, I asked Larry Burrows to lead this business. 
While performance is still unacceptable, our focus on controlling costs, improving cash flow and rightsizing capacity for our long-term needs has begun to show some progress. Wood Products loss narrowed in the fourth quarter even though that quarter is typically our weakest of the year. 
WRECO is one of the most profitable homebuilders in the country in 2010 despite another extremely challenging year for the U.S. housing market. For the year, we increased margins from 18% to 24% by aggressively cutting costs and leveraging the unique value propositions and local market knowledge of our experienced managers. 
Our Cellulose Fibers segment set both earnings and production records in 2010. These achievements are the result of our focus on meeting the needs of our global customers by improving mill system productivity and reducing operating costs, actions that positioned us to take full advantage of strong market conditions for pulp. 
As we mentioned in December, we expect similar housing market conditions for our businesses in 2011. This will continue to present challenges for our Timberlands, Wood Products and Homebuilding segments. 
In December, our outlook for Cellulose Fibers assume some weakening in pulp prices in 2011 but we're pleased that pricing so far in 2011 has remained relatively stable. Despite continuing market challenges, I expect improved performance from our businesses due to progress that we made in 2010, and our ongoing improvements, operational changes and enhanced cost efficiencies. 
We expect to continue to defer a portion of our timber harvest although volumes will increase over 2010. In addition, we will flex our harvest in response to market opportunities, including meeting the growing demand from the Asian export market. I expect our Wood Products segment to be cash flow positive. I expect that WRECO, our Homebuilding segment, will continue delivering strong delivery performance relative to its peers. And finally, I expect continued strong operating performance from Cellulose Fibers. 
I'll now turn the call over to Patty, who will provide our first quarter outlook"
107633,117935335,99427,"Weyerhaeuser Co., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2011",2011-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Weyerhaeuser Company","Executives","Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everybody. The outlook comments for the businesses are summarized on Chart 11, and I'll begin my comments with Timberlands.

The outlook comments for the businesses are summarized on Chart 11, and I'll begin my comments with Timberlands. 
In the West, export and domestic log prices are expected to increase somewhat due to continued strong demand from China. Southern log realizations may be down slightly. Fee harvest volumes are anticipated to increase seasonally in both the South and the West. We don't expect to incur any downtime in the West as was the case in the fourth quarter. 
Cost will likely increase in the West due to higher road costs. But in the South, they should decrease due to seasonally lower silviculture cost. Earlier today, we announced the closing of the sale of approximately 82,000 acres of non-strategic plans in the West. This sale represents results in a pretax gain of approximately $150 million in the first quarter.  The transaction represents the sale of the remainder of the storm-damaged whitewoods that we had on the market during 2010. We're pleased with the sales price of approximately $200 million or $2,400 per acre, which is good value given the mix of species and age classes. 
Before the effect of this sale, we expect that earnings in the first quarter will be higher than the fourth quarter. In Wood Products, we expect that prices and volumes for lumber and OSB will increase over the fourth quarter. Engineered Wood realizations are likely to be flat. 
Manufacturing costs should be lower for all product lines due to less downtime and obtaining the benefits of recent capacity rationalization and cost reductions. While the first quarter is traditionally a seasonally low quarter, we do anticipate the loss to decrease significantly compared to the fourth quarter.  
Market conditions for our sale of Fiber segment continued to be favorable. Global inventories for pulp were at low levels as we entered the quarter. The weak U.S. dollar, strong Chinese demand and a steadily improving global economy should result in continued strong pricing in the first quarter. 
Our pulp shipment volumes are expected to increase modestly compared to the fourth quarter. Manufacturing costs will likely increase in the first quarter due to higher fiber and chemical costs. Increased scheduled annual maintenance outages will result in higher maintenance costs and decreased productivity compared to the fourth quarter. 
We expect earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment to be lower in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. In our Homebuilding segment, we expect margins and prices to decline due to mix. As Kathy has already discussed, we entered the year with a low backlog and market conditions remain challenging. 
The first quarter is seasonally a slow quarter for closings and we expect to close approximately 200 fewer homes than in the fourth quarter. We anticipate a slight loss in our single-family homebuilding operations for the first quarter. 
Now I'll turn to some overall financial comments. As we previously announced in December, we anticipate that the Board will declare quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share to be paid in March. This payout will be approximately $80 million. 
Following our December announcement, we were pleased that S&P issued a report raising the outlook for our credit rating from negative to stable. We ended the year with strong liquidity, including cash balances of over $1.4 billion and an unused line of credit of $1 billion. We will be focused on renewing this credit line, which expires at the end of this year. 
Our scheduled debt maturities for 2011 are approximately $30 million, although debt maturities at the beginning of 2012 are over $700 million. Capital expenditures for the company totaled $234 million in 2010 before consideration of cash receipts for government credits of approximately $25 million. 
For 2011, we expect to spend approximately $250 million. In addition, we expect to receive approximately $15 million of additional government credits for energy-related products, projects at our Grande Prairie, Alberta pulp mill. Net of these credits, our cash spend is estimated to be $235 million. 
We anticipate that we will have a seasonal working capital build in the first quarter, primarily related to our Wood Products segment. The amount will depend on market conditions and we will continue our focus of matching supply with demand. During the first quarter, we will also make our semi-annual interest payments of approximately $130 million. We received the proceeds from the 82,000-acre timber sale yesterday and those will help offset these cash outflows. 
So economic conditions may be challenging in 2011, we are focused on increasing our financial and operating performance and creating value for shareholders. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Dan and I look forward your questions"

So within our Wood Products business, our primary product lines, as you know, our lumber, Oriented Strand Board, engineered Wood Products. And then we have the Distribution business, which is primarily focused on distributing and marketing our engineered product. Our focus in Wood Products starts with a review of capacity utilization. That led us to take the impairments that we announced in December where we took a permanent closure in several facilities that we had shut down previously but determined that at least in the next two to three year period, we would not need that capacity. So our focus is on managing our capacity to deal with today's level of demand and that we anticipate in the next two to three years. We're focused on improving capacity utilization that will bring down our manufacturing costs. But in the shutdown of those facilities, we'll also be saving some noncash expense in the form of depreciation but also security and maintenance costs that are related to those facilities. In all of our product lines, we are focused on improving margins, both from improved pricing opportunities, as well as continued cost reductions both through our operating and manufacturing costs but also in our SG&A. We took G&A out in the fourth quarter. We expect to take out some more this year as well as selling cost. So Gail, our focus in Wood Products is to respond to the market that we have today, to be prepared to respond when the market recovers but in fact, be cash positive with the demand that we have today."

With respect to the whole market, we and others, entered the year with lower backlogs than we had one year ago. That's an impact primarily of the housing tax credit that was in place at the beginning of 2010 that as you know, went away at the end of April. So we're entering the new year and other builders entering the year with low backlogs. Normally, the spring selling season starts to kick in following the Super Bowl weekend. So don't count on it this week. But believe me, we are going to be looking for traffic signs and sales signs in our own Homebuilding business. But I think what we do is reflective of what other builders do. So what we and other builders would expect to see is some pick up in activity but traffic has been relatively anemic. Homebuyers are still challenged with qualification for mortgages, if they're a first time buyer. If they're a move-up buyer, they are challenged by: number one, the ability to sell their house; and secondly, a number of these move-up buyers may have mortgages that are underwater so that makes the market relatively sticky. And so as we look at 2011, we and others, think of 2011 as a bit of a mirror image of 2010. So 2010 started out more strong, ended up weak. We would expect 2011 to start out weak and then be stronger as we go through the year in order to get to the numbers that are forecast by most economists for 2011 starts. In terms of operating rates in the fourth quarter, in our Lumber business that we were operating at about 60% of capacity. In our OSB business, we were operating at 49% of capacity. In our Engineered Wood Products business, it was more in the 30% range. So Engineered Wood Products, as you know, primarily go into new home construction. Lumber, we've got a number of different markets, including the repair and remodel market. OSB has some alternatives other than just new home construction but the Engineered is focused on new home construction."

And as we sit here today, we're just under $500 million underfunded. Now this includes the liability for our nonqualified plans as well as our qualified plans. And as you know, we don't fund the nonqualified plans. That's about $200 million of that balance. As we look at underfunded status, it improved as a result certainly of the contributions that we made, also the return on the assets that we have invested in those funds. So our investment return was probably on the order of around $500 million. benefit payments out of those plans were around $330 million. And then the other big piece that moved in a negative way in terms of this funded status would be in the actuarial assumption around discount rate. Now the discount rate in the U.S. for example, we moved from 5.9 down to 5.4. In Canada, from 6.1 down to 5.3. The interest rate assumptions increased the underfunded status by about $370 million. So that was a negative factor as we look at the funding. So those are some of the puts and takes. And as we filed the 10-K later this month, you'll see all of the details of it, but those are the main swings in the underfunded status. One thing I would point out as you look forward into 2011, the noncash expense associated with these plans will change. In 2010, we had a $47 million pension credit as we amortized the actuarial assumption changes. As we go into 2011, that will swing to a $60 million noncash expense, as we amortize the actuarial losses that are on our balance sheet today and but they sit in other compress of income. So as we amortized those through the P&L and expense, we anticipate about a $60 million pension expense."

That $74 million is higher than the number I gave you before because the offset to it is the expense that's charged in the segment. And we'll give you a breakdown of that. I think it'll be about the charge that will go into the segment line. It's about $48 million.

In terms of logs, as I mentioned in my remarks, we've seen a dramatic pickup in exports to China. It is still only about a fifth of the volume that we're sending to Japan but this has all happened over the last several years. For us, the pickup in exports to China started as we started to harvest the storm-damaged woods on the west side of Oregon and Washington following the December 2007 storm. So at that point, they were taking storm-damage wood as well as some of that was going to Korea. And over time, what we've seen is a steady upgrade in the value and the quality of the wood that they're taking. It's still not the same grade as the Japan log but there has been really a steady increase in both volume as well as the quality of the logs that they're importing. As you know, some of that's related to the slowdown in exports from Russia. But it seems like it's a combination of slowdown in Russia and perhaps some other markets that may have been exporting into China plus the general pickup in the economy. Still going into what we believe are industrial grades and industrial applications, concrete formwork et cetera, but there's been steady improvement. With respect to lumber, they started taking lumber primarily out of British Colombia, build damaged wood, and that continues to be the case.

So as we go moving from the fourth to the first quarter now, we will have two outages in the first quarter. Those outages will be lumber and some that are more extensive than the New Bern shutdown in the fourth quarter. I think the way to think about it is that in terms of increased expense over what we spent in the fourth quarter, for maintenance spend itself, it will probably be on the order of say, $25 million to $30 million additional maintenance expense. And then we'll also have an impact to productivity of those two mills being down and some additional chemical costs. So I think that's the way to think of going from Q4 to Q1. And then in Q2, it depends on how many mills will be down in Q2 but if it was similar to last year, for example, where we had three, we actually had more maintenance in the second but I don't have that maintenance schedule in front of me."

That $74 million also includes an offset of about $16 million that for the post-employment benefit costs. So you've got two things going on there.

So we don't have a longer-term forecast on the first quarter for you."

Our focus therefore, in our Timberlands Wood Products and WRECO businesses is to continue to improve profitability in today's level of demand, while being prepared to take advantage of our significant operating leverage if the pace of recovery picks up. 
In our Cellulose Fibers business, we'll continue to focus on operational excellence, while meeting the needs of our growing customers. The closing of our approximately $200 million sales of non-strategic lands in the West that we announced earlier today is a solid start for the year and we look forward to building on this space with improving operational performance.

Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. Joining me this morning are Dan Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patty Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported Q4 2010 net earnings of $171 million or $0.32 per diluted share, a net sales of $1.7 billion. Fourth quarter earnings include after-tax gains of $119 million from special items, an after-tax gain of $31 million on the sale of five short line railroads, an after-tax charge of $89 million for restructuring, closures and impairment. Income tax adjustments of $177 million, which include benefits of $149 million from the Cellulosic Biofuel Producers Credit and $22 million from the reversal of deferred tax liabilities related to the company's REIT conversion. 
As we commented last quarter, the Cellulosic Biofuels Credit offsets income tax liability. We will carry the credit forward. Excluding these items, the company reported Q4 2010 net earnings of $52 million or $0.10 per diluted share. 
For the full year of 2010, Weyerhaeuser reported net earnings of $1,281,000,000 or $3.99 per diluted share on net sales of $6.6 billion. Full year 2010 earnings, include $1,064,000,000 from income tax adjustments related to Weyerhaeuser's conversion to a Real Estate Investment Trust. 
The financial data accompanying our earnings release has been redesigned. We hope you find this new format useful and welcome your comments. Please turn to the earnings information package available on our website. This package includes a GAAP reconciliation of special item. In our discussions of the business segments, we will refer to Charts 4 through 10. 
Turning to Chart 4, changes in contribution to earnings by segment. This chart illustrates the change in contribution by business segments from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. We began our business segment discussion of the fourth quarter with Timberlands, Charts 5 and 6. 
In the fourth quarter, Timberlands contributed $56 million pretax to earnings. The Q3 pretax contribution was $75 million. Earnings from non-strategic Timberlands disposition declined from $34 million in Q3 to $19 million in Q4. 
Sales volumes declined 3%. Costs were higher due to seasonal downtime in the West and slightly higher fuel costs in silvicultured spending in the South. Key depletion declined 3% in fourth quarter as we continue to defer the harvest. In 2010, the fee harvest was down an additional 10% from the already reduced level of 2009. 
Western log prices rose 4% while Southern log prices declined 4%. Japanese log export softened in Q4. However, log exports to China increased 10% in the quarter. Japan continues to be our largest log export market. 
Wood Products, Charts 7 and 8. Seasonally slower demand and continued difficult market conditions affected the fourth quarter. Before special items, Wood Products lost $85 million. In the previous quarter, the segment lost $100 million. Log cost were slightly lower in the quarter and SG&A cost decreased. Total sales realizations were flat in Q4 with slight increases in lumber prices offsetting decreases in OSB and plywood prices. Lumber sales realizations increased $6 per thousand board feet or 2%. And OSB prices decreased $7 per thousand square feet or 4%. 
Engineered Solid Section and I-joists sales realizations were flat compared to Q3. Lumber sales volume was down 8% and OSB sales volume decreased 5%. Volumes for Engineered Solid Sections declined 13% and Engineered I-joists volumes decreased 10%. Asset impairment, closures and restructuring charges of $103 million pretax were recognized in the fourth quarter. These charges were for the rationalization of capacity, which includes the permanent closure of three Wood Products facility. 
Turning to Cellulose Fibers, Chart 9. In the fourth quarter, on a pretax basis, Cellulose Fibers earned $138 million. In the third quarter, the business earned $181 million. Costs increased and productivity was lower due to the impact of an annual maintenance outage at the New Bern North Carolina mill. There were no maintenance outages in the third quarter. 
Pulp shipment volumes declined 2% due to the timing of shipments. Pulp prices were flat in the quarter. 
And finally turning to Chart 10, Real Estate. Before special items, WRECO contributed $13 million pretax to Q4 earnings. In the third quarter, the business contributed $20 million. 
The quarter included a $20 million charge for asset impairment and restructuring. 606 single-family homes were closed in Q4, a 21% increase from Q3. The fourth quarter is typically the highest quarter for closings. 
The average closing price rose to $439,000 from $400,000 due to mix. The margins on single-family homes sold increased to 26.1% for 24.3% in the previous quarter also due to mix. The quarter included $6 million in land sales and related activity. The backlog of single-family homes sold but not closed decreased to 439 units, a backlog of about 2.5 months. At the end of 2009, the backlog was 3.5 months. 
I will now turn the call over to Dan Fulton. Dan?"

Last year was one of continued market challenges but also a year where we enhanced our ability to return value to our shareholders and saw the benefits of the work we've done to improve our operations. The most",653,"Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Last year was one of continued market challenges but also a year where we enhanced our ability to return value to our shareholders and saw the benefits of the work we've done to improve our operations. 
The most noteworthy event of 2010 involved the completion of our conversion to a Real Estate Investment Trust. In the process, shareholders received a $5.6 billion special dividend. 
Going forward, we are targeting a dividend payout ratio of 75% of funds available for distribution over the cycle. Our Board will determine and declare the actual dividend on a quarterly basis, but beginning in March, we anticipate paying a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share or $0.60 per share on an annualized basis. 
Converting to a REIT enhances our ability to operate and grow our core asset. The more than 6 million acres of valuable, sustainably managed timberland that we hold and it provides significant benefits to our shareholders. 
Throughout 2010, market conditions required our business segments to adjust their strategies and their focus. Timberlands continue to defer harvest to preserve the long-term value of our core asset. As Kathy noted, harvest levels dropped 10% compared with 2009. 
We took advantage of our strategically located Western lands and export facilities to grow Pacific Rim export volumes. Increased exports helped to offset weak domestic demand, which is primarily linked to U.S. housing markets. In 2010, our export volumes grew 18% year-over-year and export share of our total volume increased from 14% to 19%. 
Increases in shipments to China slightly exceeded increases to Japan for the year though Japan still represents over 75% of our total export volume. 
Wood Products fades to highly volatile market in 2010 as prices rose sharply in the first four months of the year before experiencing a precipitous decline beginning at the end of the second quarter. As you know, on October 1, I asked Larry Burrows to lead this business. 
While performance is still unacceptable, our focus on controlling costs, improving cash flow and rightsizing capacity for our long-term needs has begun to show some progress. Wood Products loss narrowed in the fourth quarter even though that quarter is typically our weakest of the year. 
WRECO is one of the most profitable homebuilders in the country in 2010 despite another extremely challenging year for the U.S. housing market. For the year, we increased margins from 18% to 24% by aggressively cutting costs and leveraging the unique value propositions and local market knowledge of our experienced managers. 
Our Cellulose Fibers segment set both earnings and production records in 2010. These achievements are the result of our focus on meeting the needs of our global customers by improving mill system productivity and reducing operating costs, actions that positioned us to take full advantage of strong market conditions for pulp. 
As we mentioned in December, we expect similar housing market conditions for our businesses in 2011. This will continue to present challenges for our Timberlands, Wood Products and Homebuilding segments. 
In December, our outlook for Cellulose Fibers assume some weakening in pulp prices in 2011 but we're pleased that pricing so far in 2011 has remained relatively stable. Despite continuing market challenges, I expect improved performance from our businesses due to progress that we made in 2010, and our ongoing improvements, operational changes and enhanced cost efficiencies. 
We expect to continue to defer a portion of our timber harvest although volumes will increase over 2010. In addition, we will flex our harvest in response to market opportunities, including meeting the growing demand from the Asian export market. I expect our Wood Products segment to be cash flow positive. I expect that WRECO, our Homebuilding segment, will continue delivering strong delivery performance relative to its peers. And finally, I expect continued strong operating performance from Cellulose Fibers. 
I'll now turn the call over to Patty, who will provide our first quarter outlook"
107633,117935335,99634,"Weyerhaeuser Co., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2011",2011-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Weyerhaeuser Company","Executives","Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everybody.

The outlook comments for the businesses are summarized on Chart 11, and I'll begin my comments with Timberlands. 
In the West, export and domestic log prices are expected to increase somewhat due to continued strong demand from China. Southern log realizations may be down slightly. Fee harvest volumes are anticipated to increase seasonally in both the South and the West. We don't expect to incur any downtime in the West as was the case in the fourth quarter. 
Cost will likely increase in the West due to higher road costs. But in the South, they should decrease due to seasonally lower silviculture cost. Earlier today, we announced the closing of the sale of approximately 82,000 acres of non-strategic plans in the West. This sale represents results in a pretax gain of approximately $150 million in the first quarter.  The transaction represents the sale of the remainder of the storm-damaged whitewoods that we had on the market during 2010. We're pleased with the sales price of approximately $200 million or $2,400 per acre, which is good value given the mix of species and age classes. 
Before the effect of this sale, we expect that earnings in the first quarter will be higher than the fourth quarter. In Wood Products, we expect that prices and volumes for lumber and OSB will increase over the fourth quarter. Engineered Wood realizations are likely to be flat. 
Manufacturing costs should be lower for all product lines due to less downtime and obtaining the benefits of recent capacity rationalization and cost reductions. While the first quarter is traditionally a seasonally slow quarter, we do anticipate the loss to decrease significantly compared to the fourth quarter.  
Market conditions for our sale of Cellulose Fibers segment continued to be favorable. Global inventories for pulp were at low levels as we entered the quarter. The weak U.S. dollar, strong Chinese demand and a steadily improving global economy should result in continued strong pricing in the first quarter. 
Our pulp shipment volumes are expected to increase modestly compared to the fourth quarter. Manufacturing costs will likely increase in the first quarter due to higher fiber and chemical costs. Increased scheduled annual maintenance outages will result in higher maintenance costs and decreased productivity compared to the fourth quarter. 
We expect earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment to be lower in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. In our Homebuilding segment, we expect margins and prices to decline due to mix. As Kathy has already discussed, we entered the year with a low backlog and market conditions remain challenging. 
The first quarter is seasonally a slow quarter for closings and we expect to close approximately 200 fewer homes than in the fourth quarter. We anticipate a slight loss in our single-family homebuilding operations for the first quarter. 
Now I'll turn to some overall financial comments. As we previously announced in December, we anticipate that the Board will declare quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share to be paid in March. This payout will be approximately $80 million. 
Following our December announcement, we were pleased that S&P issued a report raising the outlook for our credit rating from negative to stable. We ended the year with strong liquidity, including cash balances of over $1.4 billion and an unused line of credit of $1 billion. We will be focused on renewing this credit line, which expires at the end of this year. 
Our scheduled debt maturities for 2011 are approximately $30 million, although debt maturities at the beginning of 2012 are over $700 million. Capital expenditures for the company totaled $234 million in 2010 before consideration of cash receipts for government credits of approximately $25 million. 
For 2011, we expect to spend approximately $250 million. In addition, we expect to receive approximately $15 million of additional government credits for energy-related products -- projects at our Grande Prairie, Alberta pulp mill. Net of these credits, our cash spend is estimated to be $235 million. 
We anticipate that we will have a seasonal working capital build in the first quarter, primarily related to our Wood Products segment. The amount will depend on market conditions and we will continue our focus of matching supply with demand. During the first quarter, we will also make our semi-annual interest payments of approximately $130 million. We received the proceeds from the 82,000-acre timber sale yesterday and those will help offset these cash outflows. 
So economic conditions may be challenging in 2011, we are focused on increasing our financial and operating performance and creating value for shareholders. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Dan and I look forward your questions"

So within our Wood Products business, our primary product lines, as you know, our lumber, Oriented Strand Board, Engineered Wood Products. And then we have the Distribution business, which is primarily focused on distributing and marketing our engineered product. Our focus in Wood Products starts with a review of capacity utilization. That led us to take the impairments that we announced in December where we took a permanent closure in several facilities that we had shut down previously but determined that at least in the next two to three year period, we would not need that capacity. So our focus is on managing our capacity to deal with today's level of demand and that we anticipate in the next two to three years. We're focused on improving capacity utilization that will bring down our manufacturing costs. But in the shutdown of those facilities, we'll also be saving some noncash expense in the form of depreciation but also security and maintenance costs that are related to those facilities. In all of our product lines, we are focused on improving margins, both from improved pricing opportunities, as well as continued cost reductions both through our operating and manufacturing costs but also in our SG&A. We took G&A out in the fourth quarter. We expect to take out some more this year as well as selling cost. So Gail, our focus in Wood Products is to respond to the market that we have today, to be prepared to respond when the market recovers but in fact, be cash positive with the demand that we have today."

With respect to the whole market, we and others, entered the year with lower backlogs than we had one year ago. That's an impact primarily of the housing tax credit that was in place at the beginning of 2010 that as you know, went away at the end of April. So we're entering the new year and other builders entering the year with low backlogs. Normally, the spring selling season starts to kick in following the Super Bowl weekend. So don't count on it this week. But believe me, we are going to be looking for traffic signs and sales signs in our own Homebuilding business. But I think what we do is reflective of what other builders do. So what we and other builders would expect to see is some pick up in activity but traffic has been relatively anemic. Homebuyers are still challenged with qualification for mortgages, if they're a first time buyer. If they're a move-up buyer, they are challenged by: number one, the ability to sell their house; and secondly, a number of these move-up buyers may have mortgages that are underwater so that makes the market relatively sticky. And so as we look at 2011, we and others, think of 2011 as a bit of a mirror image of 2010. So 2010 started out more strong, ended up weak. We would expect 2011 to start out weak and then be stronger as we go through the year in order to get to the numbers that are forecast by most economists for 2011 starts. In terms of operating rates in the fourth quarter, in our Lumber business that we were operating at about 60% of capacity. In our OSB business, we were operating at 49% of capacity. In our Engineered Wood Products business, it was more in the 30% range. So Engineered Wood Products, as you know, primarily go into new home construction. Lumber, we've got a number of different markets, including the repair and remodel market. OSB has some alternatives other than just new home construction but the Engineered is focused on new home construction."

And as we sit here today, we're just under $500 million underfunded. Now this includes the liability for our nonqualified plans as well as our qualified plans. And as you know, we don't fund the nonqualified plans. That's about $200 million of that balance. As we look at underfunded status, it improved as a result certainly of the contributions that we made, also the return on the assets that we have invested in those funds. So our investment return was probably on the order of around $500 million. Benefit payments out of those plans were around $330 million. And then the other big piece that moved in a negative way in terms of this funded status would be in the actuarial assumption around discount rate. Now the discount rate in the U.S. for example, we moved from 5.9 down to 5.4.. In Canada, from 6.1 down to 5.3.. The interest rate assumptions increased the underfunded status by about $370 million. So that was a negative factor as we look at the funding. So those are some of the puts and takes. And as we filed the 10-K later this month, you'll see all of the details of it, but those are the main swings in the underfunded status. One thing I would point out as you look forward into 2011, the noncash expense associated with these plans will change. In 2010, we had a $47 million pension credit as we amortized the actuarial assumption changes. As we go into 2011, that will swing to a $60 million noncash expense, as we amortize the actuarial losses that are on our balance sheet today and but they sit in other comprehensive income. So as we amortized those through the P&L and expense, we anticipate about a $60 million pension expense."

So they don't get the whole expense. They do just get the service cost going forward and the offset comes into the corporate line. So for example as you look on Page 9, I think it is of the analyst package, we've mentioned that we have about $74 million of credit in the Corporate segment in 2010. That $74 million is higher than the number I gave you before because the offset to it is the expense that's charged in the segment. And we'll give you a breakdown of that. I think it'll be about the charge that will go into the segment line. It's about $48 million.

In terms of logs, as I mentioned in my remarks, we've seen a dramatic pickup in exports to China. It is still only about a fifth of the volume that we're sending to Japan but this has all happened over the last several years. For us, the pickup in exports to China started as we started to harvest the storm-damaged woods on the west side of Oregon and Washington following the December 2007 storm. So at that point, they were taking storm-damage wood as well as some of that was going to Korea. And over time, what we've seen is a steady upgrade in the value and the quality of the wood that they're taking. It's still not the same grade as the Japan log but there has been really a steady increase in both volume as well as the quality of the logs that they're importing. As you know, some of that's related to the slowdown in exports from Russia. But it seems like it's a combination of slowdown in Russia and perhaps some other markets that may have been exporting into China plus the general pickup in their economy. Still going into what we believe are industrial grades and industrial applications, concrete formwork et cetera, but there's been steady improvement. With respect to lumber, they started taking lumber primarily out of British Colombia, build damaged wood, and that continues to be the case. We are further away from the coast in D.C. and so that's not a primary market. But the benefit that we see is to the extent that any volume of logs or lumber is being exported to China, on a marginal basis creates more opportunity for us in North America."

I think the way to think about it is that in terms of increased expense over what we spent in the fourth quarter, for maintenance spend itself, it will probably be on the order of say, $25 million to $30 million additional maintenance expense. And then we'll also have an impact to productivity of those two mills being down and some additional chemical costs. So I think that's the way to think of going from Q4 to Q1.

So as we said the dividend, talked with the Board and they determined the final dividend for 2011, we did have knowledge about these asset sales at that point in time. And as we said on our dividend call, they were included in the numbers in the consideration for setting the dividend in 2011. I think as we go forward past that, it's the large numbers that if we were to have additional non-strategic plans of a really significant amount that we deal with that at that point in time, we don't have any identified at this point. In terms of an ongoing just the normal timber sales that we do on a regular basis, those would be included in our funds available for distribution. But remember that a lot of those, we do with 1031 exchanges to avoid having to pay the tax on them because even though we are in the REIT for the next 10 years, we will have to pay tax on any timberland that we sell. So I'd anticipate that just as a course of business to the extent we can, we would try to do those with 1031 exchanges."

We charged the segments about $42 million, I think. And so the additional credit that you see on the analyst package on Page 9 for the Corporate segment I think was $74 million. That $74 million also includes an offset of about $16 million that for the post-employment benefit costs. So you've got two things going on there. You've got pension and other post-employment costs and we don't charge the other post employment out to the various segments. So that would stay in the corporate. So going forward then into 2011, we'll have about $16 million for pension and another $16 million again for other post employment.

The impact of that mill coming back is actually positive because it creates some additional demand for fiber in the region and puts a number of people back to work in that community that were long-time Weyerhaeuser employees. As we look at other facilities, we look at the impact of the mill if we were to sell it, becoming a competitor. So the Cosmopolis mill is not a competitor of ours. If we were to be exiting other manufacturing facilities, including some in the Wood Products business, we would certainly evaluate the impact on our position in the remaining facilities in that sector and make a determination accordingly whether or not we wanted to sell it or shut it down."

Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. 
Joining me this morning are Dan Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patty Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported Q1 2011 net earnings of $99 million or $0.18 per diluted share, a net sales of $1.6 billion. First quarter earnings include an after-tax gain of $96 million on a previously announced sale of 82,000 acres of nonstrategic timberlands in Southwest Washington state. Excluding this special item, the company reported net earnings of $3 million, break-even on a per share basis. 
Please turn to the earnings information package on our website. This package includes a GAAP reconciliation of special items. In our discussions of business segments, we will refer to Charts 4 through 10. 
Chart 4, Changes in Contribution to Earnings by Segment. This chart illustrates the changing contribution by business segment from fourth quarter 2010 to first quarter 2011. We begin our business segment discussion of the first quarter with Timberlands, Charts 5 and 6. 
In the first quarter, Timberlands contributed $89 million to pretax earnings before special items, $33 million more than in Q4 2010. Third-party sales volumes rose 4% from Q4. This increase was in part due to Chinese demand for logs. Japan remains our largest export market, accounting for approximately 70% of export volume. 
Third-party average log price realizations increased 5% in the West, and declined 2% in the South. To see harvest increase 11% from the fourth quarter, most of the increase occurred in the West and was driven by export demand. Higher volumes resulted in lower costs in the West. Costs in the South were lower due to less silviculture spending. Some of the cost improvement was offset by rising diesel prices. 
Wood Products, Charts 7 and 8. Excluding special items, Wood Products narrowed its loss from $85 million to a loss of $36 million, an improvement of $49 million. Lumber and OSB sales realizations increased 8%. Lumber volumes are flat. OSB volumes increased 9%. 
Operating rates for lumber and OSB were higher in first quarter. Log costs rose in the West. Solid section volumes were flat and prices declined slightly due to mix. TJI volumes fell 3%, prices modestly increased. 
Cellulose Fibers, Chart 9. Cellulose Fibers contributed $86 million to pretax earnings in Q1, $52 million less than in Q4. Maintenance costs increased and productivity was lower due to 2 scheduled annual outages in the quarter. In addition, we also had $7 million of spending in the first quarter, preparing for the annual maintenance outages scheduled for the second quarter. 
Fiber costs were higher in the West and chemical costs increased. Pulp price realizations declined $14 per ton. The majority of our pulp production, fluff and fluff pulp prices were slightly lower. Pulp volumes were flat. 
Real estate, Chart 10. RECO lost $1 million in the first quarter. First quarter is the seasonally weakest of the year. Single-family closings were down 40% from Q4 and 8% from the first quarter a year ago. The average closing price declined $20,000 to $419,000 due to mix. The gross margin was 22%, down from 26% in Q4, also due to mix. The backlog of single-family homes sold but not closed increased to 611 homes. 
And finally, Corporate & Other. Before special items, Corporate & Other contributed $43 million less to earnings in first quarter. Pension and postretirement expense held in corporate was a non-cash charge of $12 million in Q1. In Q4, it was a credit of $19 million. 
Share-based compensation expense rose $8 million in first quarter, primarily due to the increase in our stock price. I will now turn the call over to Dan Fulton. Dan?"

Over the last several earnings calls, I've been reporting on how we're doing as we battle this dismal housing market. I'm glad to report that we continued to make progress during the first quarter. Our top line",1478,"Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Over the last several earnings calls, I've been reporting on how we're doing as we battle this dismal housing market. I'm glad to report that we continued to make progress during the first quarter. 
Our top line grew year-over-year, as well as our bottom line. And I remind you that this occurred while U.S. housing softened. While margins and returns are still not where we want them to be, we continue to act on the items that we control and take advantage of every opportunity. 
In my remarks this morning, I will comment on 3 subjects: First, I want to talk about general economic conditions, with a particular focus on the U.S. housing market since new home construction has such a critical impact on our company's overall performance. Second, I'll discuss the performance of our businesses during the first quarter, adding some color to the information that's already included in our quarterly analyst package and to the summary that Kathy just provided. And finally, I want to discuss the impact of the Japanese earthquake and tsunami on our business. Although I'll address the importance of the Japanese market to us, I want to emphasize that the strategy had no material impact on our first quarter financial results. We do expect that rebuilding needs in Japan will likely lead to opportunities for increased log and lumber exports over the midterm, but it's too early to tell if there will be any material impact this year.
I'll start with general economic conditions and their effect in our first quarter performance. With respect to the U.S. economy, GDP growth has been trending up slowly, but downward revisions of projected growth in 2011 announced earlier this week by the Fed indicate that the recovery may be stalling. Additional comments by Fed Chairman Bernanke further confirmed that there continues to be an abundance of caution. 
Increasing oil prices are a major concern for us because of the impact on our manufacturing costs, as well as how they affect disposable income and consumer confidence. In Timberlands, for example, increases in diesel prices result in higher harvesting and hauling costs. In our other businesses, higher oil prices result in increased costs for raw materials and energy. 
At the consumer level, increases in oil prices translate quickly to rising gasoline prices, which directly affect the pocketbook of potential homebuyers who may have been ready to reenter the housing market. 
As contrasted the GDP growth in the U.S., global growth is increasing at a faster pace, especially in emerging economies. This faster-paced growth has had a positive impact on our Cellulose Fibers business, which supplies global customers, and our Timberlands business, which leverages the geographic advantage of our Western forests, as well as our long-term trading relationships in key Asian markets. 
Turning to the state of the U.S. housing market, the Fed this week described conditions in the housing sector as depressed. In our press release this morning, we used the medical term anemic to describe current conditions, and the medical analogy seems appropriate. The U.S. housing market has been in intensive care for the last couple of years. We moved to the recovery room last year, boosted by both federal as well as some state housing tax credits, but then the markets suffered a relapse in the second half of 2010. 
As we entered 2011, we were planning on single-family starts recovering to an annual level of approximately 525,000, certainly not an aggressive number at the time, but March data show, starts at a seasonally adjusted rate of only 422,000, 21% lower than one year ago. 
On the positive side, housing affordability is at an all-time high, and we did see a slight improvement nationally in new home sales in March, up from the February level which was the lowest since World War II. Perhaps the worst is behind us but our experience from the last several years causes us to be cautious, and we're focusing on being profitable as will starts while maintaining our ability to respond to improve demand signals. 
To get housing back on track for a slow, steady recovery, our economy still needs to work through the challenges of continued foreclosures, as well as the clear direction from Congress on resolution of the still uncertain future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
Despite the continued drag on our company by the slow recovery in housing, I'm pleased with the progress that we continue to make in improving performance at today's level of starts in our Timberlands, Wood Products and WRECO businesses, while taking advantage of continued strength in global demand for our Cellulose Fibers. 
In Timberlands, the big story this quarter is the Chinese demand for logs. One year ago, China represented 6% of our total export volume, and in the first quarter, the Chinese share of our exports increased to 24%. The location of our Pacific Northwest Timberlands, our extensive logistics systems, our strategically-located port facilities and our long-term trading relationships, uniquely allow us to take full advantage of the Asian market, helping us to offset the continued softness in U.S. housing. 
Though Chinese demand is relatively small in the context of our overall volume, this increased demand has led to rising log prices in the West for both export as well as domestic logs, resulting in higher log realizations for the quarter that Kathy highlighted. 
Turning to our Wood Products business, mill productivity increased as operating rates for lumber, OSB and engineered solid sections all improved as a result of steps taken in 2010 to further rationalize production capacity. The net result of ongoing improvements across the business, including customer selection, pricing improvement and the lower cost structure was an increase in our gross margin and positive cash flow before seasonal build up in working capital. We're still not where we want to be but we are seeing noticeable improvement. 
In our WRECO business as expected, earnings were approximately break-even despite very weak demand. We did, however, see evidence of improvement in some market indicators. Though year-over-year traffic levels are down, our conversion rate of turning shoppers into buyers increased significantly, and our cancellation rates dropped to levels we have not seen since 2003. 
Comparing market conditions across WRECO, the Maryland and Virginia suburbs of Washington D.C. show the greatest improvement, followed by Phoenix and the Puget Sound region. Houston sales remain stable, and California and Nevada activity declined year-over-year, in part because last year's first quarter included several new project openings, which generally boost sales activity. 
Shifting to our Cellulose Fibers business. The softwood pulp market remains tight, driven by increased demand for dissolving pulp. For the quarter, earnings were up significantly year-over-year but fell from our record fourth quarter levels, primarily due to increased expense and downtime related to scheduled maintenance at our mills in Twins River and Longview. 
We are seeing opportunities in Cellulose Fibers for new products that are the outcome of our strategy of continuous innovation to serve the needs of our growing global customers, and we expect that the percentage of revenues from these new products will increase over time. 
Let me close with the discussion of Japan, a trading partner dating back to 1923, when we first entered the market to supply lumber for rebuilding, following the Great Kanto earthquake, which devastated the cities of Tokyo and Yokohama. Since 1923, our relationship has grown to the point where sales to customers in Japan represented approximately 10% of our total revenue last year. While we do not have any manufacturing facilities in Japan, whereas our products sold to Japan include pulp, liquid packaging board, newsprint, logs and lumber and Japan is the primary market for our Westwood shipping line. 
While Japan is an important market for us, we've seen only a small impact from the March 11 earthquake. Our sales to customers in the impacted zone is roughly 2% of our total revenues, and most of these customers were able to shift production to other parts of the country. Immediately following the earthquake, our attention turned to the safety and welfare of our employees and our ship's crews, and thankfully, everyone is safe. We have focused on our ongoing efforts to meet the needs of our customers, redirecting supply lines to address shortages and adjustments in operating projects. 
Mid to longer term, once essential infrastructure needs are met, there should be an increase in demand for logs and Wood Products which should be used to build permanent housing to replace the housing that was lost, and we are well positioned to work with our long-term customers and trading partners to provide materials for rebuilding. Just as we did in 1923, and again in 1995 following the Kobe earthquake.  
And now, Patty will discuss our outlook, and then I'll provide a quick recap before we invite your questions. Patty?"
107633,129484327,119673,"Weyerhaeuser Co., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2011",2011-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Weyerhaeuser Company","Executives","Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. The outlook for the second quarter by business segment is summarized on Chart 11. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands. Export log demand in Asia is anticipated to remain strong. In the West, sales realizat",643,"Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. The outlook for the second quarter by business segment is summarized on Chart 11. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands. 
Export log demand in Asia is anticipated to remain strong. In the West, sales realizations and volumes are expected to increase somewhat, but this will likely be offset by rising prices for diesel fuel and seasonal increases in road and silvicultural costs.  In the South, we anticipate slightly higher sales volumes and flat sales realizations. Earnings in the South will also be negatively affected by rising fuel. 
Overall, not including the effect of any nonstrategic land sales, we expect Timberland earnings to increase somewhat in the second quarter compared to the first. 
Market conditions in Wood Products for the second quarter are very uncertain. We have yet to experience normal signs of the spring building season. However, our forecast does include somewhat higher sales volumes for all products. Sales realizations for most product lines are expected to be flat. Higher productivity as a result of increased production volume should lead to more favorable manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by increased log costs. We expect the loss in the second quarter to narrow compared to the first quarter, and we should be cash positive. 
Global demand in our Cellulose Fibers segment continues to be robust. We expect sales realizations to improve in the second quarter compared to the first. Sales volumes are anticipated to also increase slightly. Freight costs will likely be higher during the quarter. Additional planned maintenance outages will lead to higher maintenance costs and additional lost productivity for the second quarter as compared to the first. After the second quarter, our planned outages will be complete for the year. Despite these increased costs, we expect that overall, earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment will increase compared to the first quarter. 
In our Real Estate segment, we expect our single-family homebuilding business improve seasonally during the second quarter. Homes closed are anticipated to increase to approximately 500 closings compared to 363 closings in Q1. The average closing price will likely decline slightly due to mix. However, we anticipate margins to continue to be strong at around 20% to 22%. We remain focused on actions within our control despite the continued headwinds of weak consumer confidence, only modest job growth and buyers challenged by mortgage qualification issues. We expect to earn a small profit in the second quarter in our single-family Homebuilding business. 
Now I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments. Our cash balance as of the end of the quarter was just under $1.5 billion. Capital spending during the first quarter was approximately $47 million. For the full year, we expect to spend between $250 million to $270 million. We anticipate receiving approximately $15 million in credits from the Canadian government for projects at our Grand Prairie Alberta pulp mill. 
Our current bank credit facility of $1 billion expires at the end of this year. No borrowings are outstanding under the agreement, and we anticipate replacing this facility by the end of the second quarter. We have $30 million of debt payments due in the second quarter, which completes our scheduled debt maturities for the year. 
Our non-cash pension expense and post-retirement expense in the first quarter was a charge of about $24 million. This was slightly higher than what we anticipate on a quarterly basis for the remainder of the year. 
Based on updated estimates of the funded status of our U.S. qualified pension plan, we will not be required to make a contribution for 2011. At year end, we had estimated that the U.S. planned contribution could've been as much as $20 million. We still do expect to fund approximately $80 million into our Canadian plan later this year. Now I'll turn the call back to Dan, and I look forward to your questions."

We're focused on making the most of existing market conditions, and we're prepared to leverage our scale to take full advantage of any market improvement. 
As we now get ready to turn to questions, I want to make one final comment in anticipation of perhaps questions about weather events this week in the South. We've all heard and seen on TV stories of tornadoes throughout the South that's affected some of our operations in both our Timberlands, Cellulose Fibers and Wood Products business. First of all, I want to say that all of our employees and their families are safe. We are assessing damage as we speak. We suffered some limited power outage at our Columbus Modified Fiber facility but our pulp mill is operating. We've had some limited damage of Timberlands, but we won't have any full assessment until we're able to get up in the air and survey the damage. We've had some property damage in some of our Wood Products facilities and some minor power outages, but at this point, it's likely that there will be no material impact on our activities in the second quarter, and we'll have further reports as our people are able to get back out. I just wanted to provide an additional assessment of how we've come through this past week. So with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Patty and invite your questions."

Lumber demand has primarily impacted Canadian lumber producers in the West. In Timberlands business, the log demand from China has occurred primarily in operations in Washington and Oregon. As we noted, we've had a steady increase in the amount of export that we've been shipping to China. In the lumber business in Canada, it started several years ago with shipments of bill-damaged woods, and gradually, the volumes have picked up and the quality has picked up. As we've noted before, the Wood Products are going into industrial uses, primarily forms for concrete work, shoring, pallets and packing. We don't see demand backing off at this point, and so we're taking advantage of the opportunity in our Timberlands business to increase flows to the market because we've got longer-term relationships and we've got strategically advantaged logistical facilities. And we are shipping some lumber out of Canada, but given the location of our sawmills, it's not a heavy percentage."

And so that should help you with the pension and post-retirement benefits. And, you're right in terms of a go-forward number. It's probably $4 million to $5 million left on a per quarter basis than what it was in the first quarter. Now when you think about the variable comp expense tied to the stock, most of that really is a function of the stock price. And it was in a couple of areas. One, we do have some stock appreciation rights that we use for our equity plans in Canada. And then we also have deferred comp patterned in share equivalent. The share equivalents are about, I think, roughly 1 million shares at the end of the quarter, and the stock price moved about $6 in the quarter so that should help you dimension that movement quarter-to-quarter. And on a go-forward basis, I would say exclusive of those items, probably $10 million to $15 million a quarter in the Corporate & Other segment would be a good rule of thumb. As you know, the Corporate & Other segment is a catch-all segment and it does get impacted by things like foreign exchange, stock price, et cetera. So directionally, keeping those things in mind, I think, will help you chart what the corporate expense will be on a go-forward basis."

The most significant aspect of the Kobe rebuild was that wood frame construction performed very well in that earthquake, and so following that earthquake, there was a more significant adoption of Western-styled framing for the construction of single-family homes.  And that's now part of their building code so that's not a barrier that we would have to overcome. Longer term, that may be an opportunity for us in China because the Chinese do not build stick frame homes. They build with concrete and brick. And so terrific long-term opportunity if the Chinese would start to build wood frame houses. So I can't comment on the impact on our log exports. I can just tell you that we've got solid long-term customers that buy our logs, that convert them into structural wood frame products. And so we're positioned with those relationships, not only with the operators of sawmills, but also the trading companies that we've worked with over the years that to the extent that there's a market opportunity and a demand for those products, we'd be able to take advantage of that."

If one were to make an assumption that there's going to be another 400,000 houses but let's just say, just pulling numbers out of there so it would be 50% equivalent of one year, and you flow that over 5 years, then it would perhaps add 10% or so a year to the Japanese housing starts, 10% to 20%, depending on how you calculate it. Would that translate to a 10% to 20% increase for you? Or would it potentially be very different than the 10% to 20%? The last part being kind of the question, if we make a judgment on how much the impacts going to be on Japanese housing starts, that how does that flow back to you?"

The key for us is to leverage the long-term relationships and the logistical advantages that we have, and we will take advantage of this much opportunity as possible. And the timing will play out. As I said, what they need to do with 150,000 homes that were destroyed, their focus right now is on temporary housing, which is both steel and wood frame and then they'll get to focusing on permanent rebuilding.  And in some cases, some of the homes that were damaged are in areas where it's going to be a while before there's any rebuilding because they have concerned about radiation, of course."

As you think about your average outage for our mill sets, on average, they'll run about 10 to 12 days and it will be about $1 million a day, just round numbers. So let's just say that's $12 million a mill. In the first quarter, we had 2 mills that were down so that would be a total of $24 million. And then as Kathy said in her comments, we did spend about $7 million in the first quarter on the outages for the second quarter, just getting ready for those outages. So that would be around just a little bit over $30 million for the maintenance cost itself in the first quarter, and we do expense maintenance as it's incurred. So as we move into the second quarter then, I said we would complete our remaining outages for the year so that means we have 4 in the second quarter. So again, back to our $12 million a mill, that would be $12 million times 4 would be $48 million, and if you took the $7 million that we already spent on that, we'd be just over $40 million. Now those are for average outages and we do have one mill in the second quarter where we will be installing a capital project. So it's outages, a little over twice as long or about twice as long as our normal outage would be. So let's just say it's another $10 million. So roughly quarter-over-quarter, you're looking at probably just over $30 million for the first quarter and just under $50 million for the second quarter for an increase of a little under $20 million."

Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. 
Joining me this morning are Dan Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patty Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported Q1 2011 net earnings of $99 million or $0.18 per diluted share, a net sales of $1.6 billion. First quarter earnings include an after-tax gain of $96 million on a previously announced sale of 82,000 acres of nonstrategic Timberlands in Southwest Washington State. Excluding this special item, the company reported net earnings of $3 million, break-even on a per share basis. 
Please turn to the earnings information package available on our website. This package includes a GAAP reconciliation of special items. In our discussions of business segments, we will refer to Charts 4 through 10. 
Chart 4, Changes in Contribution to Earnings by Segment. This chart illustrates the changing contribution by business segment from fourth quarter 2010 to first quarter 2011. 
We begin our business segment discussion of the first quarter with Timberlands, Charts 5 and 6. In the first quarter, Timberlands contributed $89 million to pretax earnings before special items, $33 million more than in Q4 2010. Third party sales volumes rose 4% from Q4. This increase was in part due to Chinese demand for logs. Japan remains our largest export market accounting for approximately 70% of export volume. 
Third party average log price realizations increased 5% in the West and declined 2% in the South. The fee harvest increased 11% from the fourth quarter, most of the increase occurred in the West and was driven by export demand. 
Higher volumes resulted in lower costs in the West. Costs in the South were lower due to less silviculture spending. Some of the cost improvement was offset by rising diesel prices. 
Wood Products, Charts 7 and 8. Excluding special items, Wood Products narrowed its loss from $85 million to a loss of $36 million, an improvement of $49 million. Lumber and OSB sales realizations increased 8%. Lumber volumes were flat. OSB volumes increased 9%. Operating rates for lumber and OSB were higher in first quarter. Log costs rose in the West. Solid section volumes were flat and prices declined slightly due to mix. TJI volumes fell 10%, prices modestly increased. 
Cellulose Fibers, Chart 9. Cellulose Fibers contributed $86 million to pretax earnings in Q1, $52 million less than in Q4. Maintenance costs increased and productivity was lower due to two scheduled annual outages in the quarter. In addition, we also had $7 million of spending in first quarter, preparing for the annual maintenance outages scheduled for the second quarter. 
Fiber costs were higher in the West and chemical costs increased. Pulp price realizations declined $14 per ton. The majority of our pulp production, fluff and fluff pulp prices were slightly lower. Pulp volumes were flat. 
Real Estate, Chart 10. WRECO lost $1 million in the first quarter. First quarter is the seasonally weakest of the year. Single-family closings were down 40% from Q4 and 8% from the first quarter a year ago. The average closing price declined $20,000 to $419,000 due to mix. The gross margin was 22%, down from 26% in Q4, also due to mix. The backlog of single-family homes sold but not closed increased to 611 homes. 
And finally, Corporate & Other. Before special items, Corporate & Other contributed $43 million less to earnings in first quarter. Pension and postretirement expense held in corporate was a noncash charge of $12 million in Q1. In Q4, it was a credit of $19 million. Share-based compensation expense rose $8 million in the first quarter, primarily due to the increase in our stock price. 
I will now turn the call over to Dan Fulton. Dan?"
107633,129484327,119885,"Weyerhaeuser Co., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2011",2011-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Weyerhaeuser Company","Executives","Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Over the last several earnings calls, I've been reporting on how we're doing as we battle this dismal housing market. I'm glad to report that we continue to make progress during the first quarter. Our top line",1482,"Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Over the last several earnings calls, I've been reporting on how we're doing as we battle this dismal housing market. I'm glad to report that we continue to make progress during the first quarter. 
Our top line grew year-over-year, as well as our bottom line. And I remind you that this occurred while U.S. housing softened. While margins and returns are still not where we want them to be, we continue to act on the items that we control and take advantage of every opportunity. 
In my remarks this morning, I will comment on three subjects. First, I want to talk about general economic conditions, with a particular focus on the U.S. housing market since new home construction has such a critical impact on our company's overall performance. Second, I'll discuss the performance of our businesses during the first quarter, adding some color to the information that's already included in our quarterly analyst package and to the summary that Kathy just provided. And finally, I want to discuss the effect of the Japanese earthquake and tsunami on our business. Although I'll address the importance of the Japanese market to us, I want to emphasize that this tragic event had no material impact on our first quarter financial results. We do expect that rebuilding needs in Japan will likely lead to opportunities for increased log and lumber exports over the midterm, but it's too early to tell if there will be any material impact this year.
I'll start with general economic conditions and their effect on our first quarter performance. With respect to the U.S. economy, GDP growth has been trending up slowly, but downward revisions of projected growth in 2011 announced earlier this week by the Fed indicate that the recovery may be stalling. Additional comments by Fed Chairman Bernanke further confirmed that there continues to be an abundance of caution. 
Increasing oil prices are a major concern for us because of the impact on our manufacturing cost, as well as how they affect disposable income and consumer confidence. In Timberlands, for example, increases in diesel prices result in higher harvesting and hauling costs. In our other businesses, higher oil prices result in increased cost for raw materials and energy. 
At the consumer level, increases in oil prices translate quickly to rising gasoline prices which directly affect the pocketbook of potential homebuyers who may have been ready to reenter the housing market. 
As contrasted the GDP growth in the U.S., global growth is increasing at a faster pace, especially in emerging economies. This faster-paced growth has had a positive impact on our Cellulose Fibers business, which supplies global customers, and our Timberlands business, which leverages the geographic advantage of our Western forests, as well as our long-term trading relationships in key Asian markets. 
Turning to the state of the U.S. housing market, the Fed this week described conditions in the housing sector as depressed. In our press release this morning, we used the medical term anemic to describe current conditions and the medical analogy seems appropriate. The U.S. housing market has been in intensive care for the last couple of years. We moved to the recovery room last year, boosted by both federal as well as some state housing tax credits, but then the markets suffered a relapse in the second half of 2010. 
As we entered 2011, we were planning on single-family starts recovering to an annual level of approximately 525,000, certainly not an aggressive number at that time. But March data shows starts at a seasonally adjusted rate of only 422,000, 21% lower than one year ago. 
On the positive side, housing affordability is at an all-time high and we did see a slight improvement nationally in new home sales in March, up from the February level which was the lowest since World War II. Perhaps the worst is behind us but our experience from the last several years causes us to be cautious, and we're focusing on being profitable at today's level of starts while maintaining our ability to respond to improve demand signals. 
To get housing back on track for a slow, steady recovery, our economy still needs to work through the challenges of continued foreclosures, as well as the clear direction from Congress on resolution of the still uncertain future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
Despite the continued drag on our company by the slow recovery in housing, I'm pleased with the progress that we continue to make in improving performance at today's level of starts in our Timberlands, Wood Products and WRECO businesses while taking advantage of continued strength in global demand for our Cellulose Fibers. 
In Timberlands, the big story this quarter is the Chinese demand for logs. One year ago, China represented 6% of our total export volume, and in the first quarter, the Chinese share of our exports increased to 24%. The location of our Pacific Northwest Timberlands, our extensive logistics systems, our strategically located port facilities and our long-term trading relationships uniquely allow us to take full advantage of the Asian market, helping us to offset the continued softness in U.S. housing. 
Though Chinese demand is relatively small in the context of our overall volume, this increased demand has led to rising log prices in the West for both export as well as domestic logs, resulting in higher log realizations for the quarter that Kathy highlighted. 
Turning to our Wood Products business, mill productivity increased as operating rates for lumber, OSB and engineered solid sections all improved as a result of steps taken in 2010 to further rationalize production capacity. The net result of ongoing improvements across the business, including customer selection, pricing improvement and the lower cost structure was an increase in our gross margin and positive cash flow before seasonal build up in working capital. We're still not where we want to be but we are seeing noticeable improvement. 
In our WRECO business, as expected, earnings were approximately breakeven despite very weak demand. We did, however, see evidence of improvement in some market indicators. Though year-over-year traffic levels are down, our conversion rate of turning shoppers into buyers increased significantly and our cancellation rates dropped to levels we have not seen since 2003. 
Comparing market conditions across WRECO, the Maryland and Virginia suburbs of Washington D.C. show the greatest improvement, followed by Phoenix and the Puget Sound region. Houston sales remain stable and California and Nevada activity declined year-over-year, in part because last year's first quarter included several new project openings which generally boost sales activity. 
Shifting to our Cellulose Fibers business. The softwood pulp market remains tight, driven by increased demand for dissolving pulp. For the quarter, earnings were up significantly year-over-year but fell from our record fourth quarter levels, primarily due to increased expense and downtime related to scheduled maintenance at our mills in Flint River and Longview. 
We are seeing opportunities in Cellulose Fibers for new products that are the outcome of our strategy of continuous innovation to serve the needs of our growing global customers and we expect that the percentage of revenues from these new products will increase over time. 
Let me close with the discussion of Japan, a trading partner dating back to 1923, when we first entered the market to supply lumber for rebuilding, following the Great Kanto earthquake which devastated the cities of Tokyo and Yokohama. Since 1923, our relationship has grown to the point where sales to customers in Japan represented approximately 10% of our total revenue last year. While we do not have any manufacturing facilities in Japan, whereas our products sold to Japan include pulp, liquid packaging board, newsprint, logs and lumber, and Japan is the primary market for our Westwood Shipping line. 
While Japan is an important market for us, we've seen only a small impact from the March 11 earthquake. Our sales to customers in the impacted zone are roughly 2% of our total revenues and most of these customers were able to shift production to other parts of the country. Immediately following the earthquake, our attention turned to the safety and welfare of our employees and our ship's crews, and thankfully, everyone is safe. We have focused on our ongoing efforts to meet the needs of our customers, redirecting supply lines to address shortages and adjustments in operating projects. 
Mid to longer term, once essential infrastructure needs are met, there should be an increase in demand for logs and wood products which would be used to build permanent housing to replace the housing that was lost, and we are well positioned to work with our long-term customers and trading partners to provide materials for rebuilding just as we did in 1923 and again in 1995 following the Kobe earthquake.  
And now, Patty will discuss our outlook, and then I'll provide a quick recap before we invite your questions. Patty?"
107633,129484327,119885,"Weyerhaeuser Co., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2011",2011-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Weyerhaeuser Company","Executives","Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. The outlook for the second quarter by business segment is summarized on Chart 11. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands. Export log demand in Asia is anticipated to remain strong. In the West, sales realizat",645,"Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. The outlook for the second quarter by business segment is summarized on Chart 11. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands. 
Export log demand in Asia is anticipated to remain strong. In the West, sales realizations and volumes are expected to increase somewhat but this will likely be offset by rising prices for diesel fuel and seasonal increases in road and silvicultural costs.  And in South, we anticipate slightly higher sales volumes and flat sales realizations. Earnings in the South will also be negatively affected by rising fuel. 
Overall, not including the effect of any nonstrategic land sales, we expect Timberland earnings to increase somewhat in the second quarter compared to the first. 
Market conditions in Wood Products for the second quarter are very uncertain. We have yet to experience normal signs of the spring building season. However, our forecast does include somewhat higher sales volumes for all products. Sales realizations for most product lines are expected to be flat. Higher productivity as a result of increased production volume should lead to more favorable manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by increased log costs. We expect the loss in the second quarter to narrow compared to the first quarter and we should be cash positive. 
Global demand in our Cellulose Fibers segment continues to be robust. We expect sales realizations to improve in the second quarter compared to the first. Sales volumes are anticipated to also increase slightly. Freight costs will likely be higher during the quarter. Additional planned maintenance outages will lead to higher maintenance costs and additional lost productivity for the second quarter as compared to the first. After the second quarter, our planned outages will be complete for the year. Despite these increased costs, we expect that overall, earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment will increase compared to the first quarter. 
In our Real Estate segment, we expect our single-family homebuilding business to improve seasonally during the second quarter. Homes closed are anticipated to increase to approximately 500 closings compared to 363 closings in Q1. The average closing price will likely decline slightly due to mix. However, we anticipate margins to continue to be strong at around 20% to 22%. We remain focused on actions within our control despite the continued headwinds of weak consumer confidence, only modest job growth and buyers challenged by mortgage qualification issues. We expect to earn a small profit in the second quarter in our single-family homebuilding business. 
Now I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments. Our cash balance as of the end of the quarter was just under $1.5 billion. Capital spending during the first quarter was approximately $47 million. For the full year, we expect to spend between $250 million to $270 million. We anticipate receiving approximately $15 million in credits from the Canadian government for projects at our Grande Prairie Alberta pulp mill. 
Our current bank credit facility of $1 billion expires at the end of this year. No borrowings are outstanding under the agreement and we anticipate replacing this facility by the end of the second quarter. We have $30 million of debt payments due in the second quarter which completes our scheduled debt maturities for the year. 
Our noncash pension expense and postretirement expense in the first quarter was a charge of about $24 million. This was slightly higher than what we anticipate on a quarterly basis for the remainder of the year. 
Based on updated estimates of the funded status of our U.S. qualified pension plan, we will not be required to make a contribution for 2011. At year end, we had estimated that the U.S. planned contribution could have been as much as $20 million. We still do expect to fund approximately $80 million into our Canadian plan later this year. 
Now, I'll turn the call back to Dan, and I look forward to your questions."

We're focused on making the most of existing market conditions and we're prepared to leverage our scale to take full advantage of any market improvement. 
As we now get ready to turn to questions, I want to make one final comment in anticipation of perhaps questions about weather events this week in the South. We've all heard and seen on TV stories of tornadoes throughout the South that's affected some of our operations in both our Timberlands, Cellulose Fibers and Wood Products business. First of all, I want to say that all of our employees and their families are safe. We are assessing damage as we speak. We suffered some limited power outage at our Columbus Modified Fiber facility but our pulp mill is operating. We've had some limited damage of Timberlands, but we won't have any full assessment until we're able to get up in the air and survey the damage. We've had some property damage in some of our Wood Products facilities and some minor power outages, but at this point, it's likely that there will be no material impact on our activities in the second quarter, and we'll have further reports as our people are able to get back out to the field. I just wanted to provide an additional assessment of how we've come through this tough week. 
So with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Patty and invite your questions."

More importantly, for our Wood Products business, we've seen increase in margins which is related to the focus that we've had on focusing on our pricing as well as cost management.

Lumber demand has primarily impacted Canadian lumber producers in the West. In Timberlands business, the log demand from China has occurred primarily in operations in Washington and Oregon. As we noted, we've had a steady increase in the amount of export that we've been shipping to China. In the lumber business in Canada, it started several years ago with shipments of bill-damaged woods, and gradually, the volumes have picked up and the quality has picked up. As we've noted before, the Wood Products are going into industrial uses, primarily forms for concrete work, shoring, pallets and packing. We don't see demand backing off at this point, and so we are taking advantage of the opportunity in our Timberlands business to increase flows to the market because we've got longer-term relationships and we've got strategically advantaged logistical facilities. And we are shipping some lumber out of Canada, but given the location of our sawmills, it's not a heavy percentage."

It's probably $4 million to $5 million left on a per quarter basis than what it was in the first quarter. Now if you think about the variable comp expense tied to the stock, most of that really is a function of the stock price. And it runs in a couple of areas. One, we do have some stock appreciation rights that we use for our equity plans in Canada. And then we also have deferred comp that is in share equivalent. The share equivalents are about, I think, roughly 1 million shares at the end of the quarter, and the stock price moved about $6 in the quarter. So that should help you dimension that movement quarter-to-quarter. And on a go-forward basis, I would say exclusive of those items, probably $10 million to $15 million a quarter in the Corporate & Other segment would be a good rule of thumb.

If one were to make an assumption that there's going to be another 400,000 houses, but let's just say, just pulling numbers out of there so it'd be 50% equivalent of one year. And you flow that over five years, then it would perhaps add 10% or so a year to the Japanese housing starts, 10% to 20%, depending on how you calculate it. Would that translate to a 10% to 20% increase for you, or would it potentially be very different than the 10% to 20%? So the last part being kind of the question of if we make a judgment on how much the impact is going to be on Japanese housing starts, how does that then flow back to you?"

The key for us is to leverage the long-term relationships and the logistical advantages that we have and we will take advantage of this much opportunity as possible. And the timing will play out. As I said, they need to deal with temporary housing. There's about 150,000 homes that were destroyed, their focus right now is on temporary housing which is both steel and wood frame, and then they'll get to focusing on permanent rebuilding. And in some cases, some of the homes that were damaged are in areas where it's going to be a while before there's any rebuilding because they have concerns about radiation, of course."

As you think about your average outage for our mill sets, on average, they'll run about 10 to 12 days and it will be about $1 million a day, just round numbers. So let's just say that's $12 million a mill. In the first quarter, we had two mills that were down. So that would be a total of $24 million. And then as Kathy said in her comments, we did spend about $7 million in the first quarter on the outages for the second quarter, just getting ready for those outages. So that would be around just a little bit over $30 million for the maintenance cost itself in the first quarter, and we do expense maintenance as it's incurred. So as we move into the second quarter then, I said we would complete our remaining outages for the year. So that means we have four in the second quarter. So again, back to our $12 million a mill, that would be $12 million times four, it would be $48 million. And if you took the $7 million that we already spent on that, we'd be just over $40 million. Now those are for average outages. And we do have one mill in the second quarter where we will be installing a capital project. So its outages, a little over twice as long or about twice as long as our normal outage would be. So let's just say that's another $10 million. So roughly quarter-over-quarter, you're looking at probably just over $30 million for the first quarter and just under $50 million for the second quarter for an increase of a little under $20 million."

Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. 
Joining me this morning are Dan Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patty Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported Q1 2011 net earnings of $99 million or $0.18 per diluted share, a net sales of $1.6 billion. First quarter earnings include an after-tax gain of $96 million on a previously announced sale of 82,000 acres of nonstrategic Timberlands in Southwest Washington State. Excluding this special item, the company reported net earnings of $3 million, break-even on a per share basis. 
Please turn to the earnings information package available on our website. This package includes a GAAP reconciliation of special items. In our discussions of business segments, we will refer to Charts 4 through 10. 
Chart 4, Changes in Contribution to Earnings by Segment. This chart illustrates the changing contribution by business segment from fourth quarter 2010 to first quarter 2011. 
We begin our business segment discussion of the first quarter with Timberlands, Charts 5 and 6. In the first quarter, Timberlands contributed $89 million to pretax earnings before special items, $33 million more than in Q4 2010. Third party sales volumes rose 4% from Q4. This increase was in part due to Chinese demand for logs. Japan remains our largest export market accounting for approximately 70% of export volume. 
Third party average log price realizations increased 5% in the West and declined 2% in the South. The fee harvest increased 11% from the fourth quarter, most of the increase occurred in the West and was driven by export demand. 
Higher volumes resulted in lower costs in the West. Costs in the South were lower due to less silviculture spending. Some of the cost improvement was offset by rising diesel prices. 
Wood Products, Charts 7 and 8. Excluding special items, Wood Products narrowed its loss from $85 million to a loss of $36 million, an improvement of $49 million. Lumber and OSB sales realizations increased 8%. Lumber volumes were flat. OSB volumes increased 9%. Operating rates for lumber and OSB were higher in first quarter. Log costs rose in the West. Solid section volumes were flat and prices declined slightly due to mix. TJI volumes fell 10%, prices modestly increased. 
Cellulose Fibers, Chart 9. Cellulose Fibers contributed $86 million to pretax earnings in Q1, $52 million less than in Q4. Maintenance costs increased and productivity was lower due to two scheduled annual outages in the quarter. In addition, we also had $7 million of spending in first quarter, preparing for the annual maintenance outages scheduled for the second quarter. 
Fiber costs were higher in the West and chemical costs increased. Pulp price realizations declined $14 per ton. The majority of our pulp production, fluff and fluff pulp prices were slightly lower. Pulp volumes were flat. 
Real Estate, Chart 10. WRECO lost $1 million in the first quarter. First quarter is the seasonally weakest of the year. Single-family closings were down 40% from Q4 and 8% from the first quarter a year ago. The average closing price declined $20,000 to $419,000 due to mix. The gross margin was 22%, down from 26% in Q4, also due to mix. The backlog of single-family homes sold but not closed increased to 611 homes. 
And finally, Corporate & Other. Before special items, Corporate & Other contributed $43 million less to earnings in first quarter. Pension and postretirement expense held in corporate was a noncash charge of $12 million in Q1. In Q4, it was a credit of $19 million. Share-based compensation expense rose $8 million in the first quarter, primarily due to the increase in our stock price. 
I will now turn the call over to Dan Fulton. Dan?"
107633,129484327,120026,"Weyerhaeuser Co., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2011",2011-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Weyerhaeuser Company","Executives","Thanks, Kathy. And good morning, everyone. Over the last several earnings calls, I've been reporting on how we're doing as we battle this dismal housing market. I'm glad to report that we continue to make progress during the first quarter. Our top line",1482,"Thanks, Kathy. And good morning, everyone. Over the last several earnings calls, I've been reporting on how we're doing as we battle this dismal housing market. I'm glad to report that we continue to make progress during the first quarter. 
Our top line grew year-over-year, as well as our bottom line. And I remind you that this occurred while U.S. housing softened. While margins and returns are still not where we want them to be, we continue to act on the items that we control and take advantage of every opportunity. 
In my remarks this morning, I will comment on three subjects. First, I want to talk about general economic conditions, with a particular focus on the U.S. housing market since new home construction has such a critical impact on our company's overall performance. Second, I'll discuss the performance of our businesses during the first quarter, adding some color to the information that's already included in our quarterly analyst package and to the summary that Kathy just provided. 
And finally, I want to discuss the effect of the Japanese earthquake and tsunami on our business. Although I'll address the importance of the Japanese market to us, I want to emphasize that this tragic event had no material impact on our first quarter financial results. We do expect that rebuilding needs in Japan will likely lead to opportunities for increased log and lumber exports over the midterm, but it's too early to tell if there will be any material impact this year.
I'll start with general economic conditions and their effect on our first quarter performance. With respect to the U.S. economy, GDP growth has been trending up slowly, but downward revisions of projected growth in 2011 announced earlier this week by the Fed indicate that the recovery may be stalling. Additional comments by Fed Chairman Bernanke further confirmed that there continues to be an abundance of caution. 
Increasing oil prices are a major concern for us because of the impact on our manufacturing cost, as well as how they affect disposable income and consumer confidence. In Timberlands, for example, increases in diesel prices result in higher harvesting and hauling costs. In our other businesses, higher oil prices result in increased cost for raw materials and energy. 
At the consumer level, increases in oil prices translate quickly to rising gasoline prices which directly affect the pocketbook of potential homebuyers who may have been ready to reenter the housing market. 
As contrasted the GDP growth in the U.S., global growth is increasing at a faster pace, especially in emerging economies. This faster-paced growth has had a positive impact on our Cellulose Fibers business, which supplies global customers, and our Timberlands business, which leverages the geographic advantage of our Western forests, as well as our long-term trading relationships in key Asian markets. 
Turning to the state of the U.S. housing market, the Fed this week described conditions in the housing sector as depressed. In our press release this morning, we used the medical term anemic to describe current conditions and the medical analogy seems appropriate. The U.S. housing market has been in intensive care for the last couple of years. We moved to the recovery room last year, boosted by both federal as well as some state housing tax credits, but then the markets suffered a relapse in the second half of 2010. 
As we entered 2011, we were planning on single-family starts recovering to an annual level of approximately 525,000, certainly not an aggressive number at that time. But March data shows starts at a seasonally adjusted rate of only 422,000, 21% lower than one year ago. 
On the positive side, housing affordability is at an all-time high and we did see a slight improvement nationally in new home sales in March, up from the February level which was the lowest since World War II. Perhaps the worst is behind us but our experience from the last several years causes us to be cautious, and we're focusing on being profitable at today's level of starts while maintaining our ability to respond to improve demand signals. 
To get housing back on track for a slow, steady recovery, our economy still needs to work through the challenges of continued foreclosures, as well as the clear direction from Congress on resolution of the still uncertain future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
Despite the continued drag on our company by the slow recovery in housing, I'm pleased with the progress that we continue to make in improving performance at today's level of starts in our Timberlands, Wood Products and WRECO businesses while taking advantage of continued strength in global demand for our Cellulose Fibers. 
In Timberlands, the big story this quarter is the Chinese demand for logs. One year ago, China represented 6% of our total export volume, and in the first quarter, the Chinese share of our exports increased to 24%. The location of our Pacific Northwest Timberlands, our extensive logistics systems, our strategically located port facilities and our long-term trading relationships uniquely allow us to take full advantage of the Asian market, helping us to offset the continued softness in U.S. housing. 
Though Chinese demand is relatively small in the context of our overall volume, this increased demand has led to rising log prices in the West for both export as well as domestic logs, resulting in higher log realizations for the quarter that Kathy highlighted. 
Turning to our Wood Products business, mill productivity increased as operating rates for lumber, OSB and engineered solid sections all improved as a result of steps taken in 2010 to further rationalize production capacity. The net result of ongoing improvements across the business, including customer selection, pricing improvement and the lower cost structure was an increase in our gross margin and positive cash flow before seasonal build up in working capital. We're still not where we want to be but we are seeing noticeable improvement. 
In our WRECO business, as expected, earnings were approximately breakeven despite very weak demand. We did, however, see evidence of improvement in some market indicators. Though year-over-year traffic levels are down, our conversion rate of turning shoppers into buyers increased significantly and our cancellation rates dropped to levels we have not seen since 2003. 
Comparing market conditions across WRECO, the Maryland and Virginia suburbs of Washington D.C. show the greatest improvement, followed by Phoenix and the Puget Sound region. Houston sales remain stable and California and Nevada activity declined year-over-year, in part because last year's first quarter included several new project openings which generally boost sales activity. 
Shifting to our Cellulose Fibers business. The softwood pulp market remains tight, driven by increased demand for dissolving pulp. For the quarter, earnings were up significantly year-over-year but fell from our record fourth quarter levels, primarily due to increased expense and downtime related to scheduled maintenance at our mills in Flint River and Longview. 
We are seeing opportunities in Cellulose Fibers for new products that are the outcome of our strategy of continuous innovation to serve the needs of our growing global customers and we expect that the percentage of revenues from these new products will increase over time. 
Let me close with the discussion of Japan, a trading partner dating back to 1923, when we first entered the market to supply lumber for rebuilding, following the Great Kanto earthquake which devastated the cities of Tokyo and Yokohama. 
Since 1923, our relationship has grown to the point where sales to customers in Japan represented approximately 10% of our total revenue last year. While we do not have any manufacturing facilities in Japan, whereas our products sold to Japan include pulp, liquid packaging board, newsprint, logs and lumber, and Japan is the primary market for our Westwood Shipping line. 
While Japan is an important market for us, we've seen only a small impact from the March 11 earthquake. Our sales to customers in the impacted zone are roughly 2% of our total revenues and most of these customers were able to shift production to other parts of the country. 
Immediately following the earthquake, our attention turned to the safety and welfare of our employees and our ship's crews, and thankfully, everyone is safe. We have focused on our ongoing efforts to meet the needs of our customers, redirecting supply lines to address shortages and adjustments in operating projects. 
Mid to longer term, once essential infrastructure needs are met, there should be an increase in demand for logs and wood products which would be used to build permanent housing to replace the housing that was lost, and we are well positioned to work with our long-term customers and trading partners to provide materials for rebuilding, just as we did in 1923 and again in 1995 following the Kobe earthquake.  
And now, Patty will discuss our outlook, and then I'll provide a quick recap before we invite your questions. Patty?"

The outlook for the second quarter by business segment is summarized on Chart 11. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands. Export log demand in Asia is anticipated to remain strong.

I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands. 
Export log demand in Asia is anticipated to remain strong. In the West, sales realizations and volumes are expected to increase somewhat but this will likely be offset by rising prices for diesel fuel and seasonal increases in road and silvicultural costs. In South, we anticipate slightly higher sales volumes and flat sales realizations. Earnings in the South will also be negatively affected by rising fuel. 
Overall, not including the effect of any nonstrategic land sales, we expect Timberland earnings to increase somewhat in the second quarter compared to the first. 
Market conditions in Wood Products for the second quarter are very uncertain. We have yet to experience normal signs of the spring building season. However, our forecast does include somewhat higher sales volumes for all products. Sales realizations for most product lines are expected to be flat. 
Higher productivity as a result of increased production volume should lead to more favorable manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by increased log costs. We expect the loss in the second quarter to narrow compared to the first quarter and we should be cash positive. 
Global demand in our Cellulose Fibers segment continues to be robust. We expect sales realizations to improve in the second quarter compared to the first. Sales volumes are anticipated to also increase slightly. Freight costs will likely be higher during the quarter. 
Additional planned maintenance outages will lead to higher maintenance costs and additional lost productivity for the second quarter as compared to the first. After the second quarter, our planned outages will be complete for the year. Despite these increased costs, we expect that overall, earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment will increase compared to the first quarter. 
In our Real Estate segment, we expect our single-family homebuilding business to improve seasonally during the second quarter. Homes closed are anticipated to increase to approximately 500 closings compared to 363 closings in Q1. The average closing price will likely decline slightly due to mix. However, we anticipate margins to continue to be strong at around 20% to 22%. 
We remain focused on actions within our control despite the continued headwinds of weak consumer confidence, only modest job growth and buyers challenged by mortgage qualification issues. We expect to earn a small profit in the second quarter in our single-family homebuilding business. 
Now I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments. Our cash balance as of the end of the quarter was just under $1.5 billion. Capital spending during the first quarter was approximately $47 million. For the full year, we expect to spend between $250 million to $270 million. We anticipate receiving approximately $15 million in credits from the Canadian government for projects at our Grande Prairie Alberta pulp mill. 
Our current bank credit facility of $1 billion expires at the end of this year. No borrowings are outstanding under the agreement and we anticipate replacing this facility by the end of the second quarter. We have $30 million of debt payments due in the second quarter which completes our scheduled debt maturities for the year. 
Our noncash pension expense and postretirement expense in the first quarter was a charge of about $24 million. This was slightly higher than what we anticipate on a quarterly basis for the remainder of the year. 
Based on updated estimates of the funded status of our U.S. qualified pension plan, we will not be required to make a contribution for 2011. At year end, we had estimated that the U.S. planned contribution could have been as much as $20 million. We still do expect to fund approximately $80 million into our Canadian plan later this year. 
Now, I'll turn the call back to Dan, and I look forward to your questions."

In summary, despite challenging conditions in the U.S. housing market which are worse than one year ago, we continue to make progress during the first quarter to improve our financial performance.

We're focused on making the most of existing market conditions and we're prepared to leverage our scale to take full advantage of any market improvement. 
As we now get ready to turn to questions, I want to make one final comment in anticipation of perhaps questions about weather events this week in the South. We've all heard and seen on TV stories of tornadoes throughout the South that's affected some of our operations in both our Timberlands, Cellulose Fibers and Wood Products business. 
First of all, I want to say that all of our employees and their families are safe. We are assessing damage as we speak. We suffered some limited power outage at our Columbus Modified Fiber facility but our pulp mill is operating. We've had some limited damage of Timberlands, but we won't have any full assessment until we're able to get up in the air and survey the damage. 
We've had some property damage in some of our Wood Products facilities and some minor power outages, but at this point, it's likely that there will be no material impact on our activities in the second quarter, and we'll have further reports as our people are able to get back out to the field. I just wanted to provide an additional assessment of how we've come through this past week. 
So with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Patty and invite your questions."

Lumber demand has primarily impacted Canadian lumber producers in the West. In Timberlands business, the log demand from China has occurred primarily in operations in Washington and Oregon. As we noted, we've had a steady increase in the amount of export that we've been shipping to China. In the lumber business in Canada, it started several years ago with shipments of beetle-damaged wood, and gradually, the volumes have picked up and the quality has picked up. As we've noted before, the Wood Products are going into industrial uses, primarily forms for concrete work, shoring, pallets and packing. We don't see demand backing off at this point, and so we are taking advantage of the opportunity in our Timberlands business to increase flows to the market because we've got longer-term relationships and we've got strategically advantaged logistical facilities. And we are shipping some lumber out of Canada, but given the location of our sawmills, it's not a heavy percentage."

So in the reporting package to try to help you dimension that a little bit better, on Page 4 we give you the total company look by quarter. And then back on Page 9 in the Corporate & Other segment, we give you what portion of that runs through corporate. So that should help you with the pension and postretirement benefits. And you're right in terms of a go-forward number. It's probably $4 million to $5 million left on a per quarter basis than what it was in the first quarter. Now if you think about the variable comp expense tied to the stock, most of that really is a function of the stock price. And it runs in a couple of areas. One, we do have some stock appreciation rights that we use for our equity plans in Canada. And then we also have deferred comp that is 
in share equivalent. The share equivalents are about, I think, roughly 1 million shares at the end of the quarter, and the stock price moved about $6 in the quarter. So that should help you dimension that movement quarter-to-quarter. And on a go-forward basis, I would say exclusive of those items, probably $10 million to $15 million a quarter in the Corporate & Other segment would be a good rule of thumb.

Would that translate to a 10% to 20% increase for you, or would it potentially be very different than the 10% to 20%? So the last part being kind of the question of, if we make a judgment on how much the impact is going to be on Japanese housing starts, how does that then flow back to you?"

I assume that we will receive our share of product demand for rebuilding.

The key for us is to leverage the long-term relationships and the logistical advantages that we have and we will take advantage of this much opportunity as possible. And the timing will play out. As I said, they need to deal with temporary housing. There's about 150,000 homes that were destroyed, their focus right now is on temporary housing which is both steel and wood frame, and then they'll get to focusing on permanent rebuilding. And in some cases, some of the homes that were damaged are in areas where it's going to be a while before there's any rebuilding because they have concerns about radiation, of course."

As you think about your average outage for our mill sets, on average, they'll run about 10 to 12 days and it will be about $1 million a day, just round numbers. So let's just say that's $12 million a mill. In the first quarter, we had two mills that were down. So that would be a total of $24 million. And then as Kathy said in her comments, we did spend about $7 million in the first quarter on the outages for the second quarter, just getting ready for those outages. So that would be around just a little bit over $30 million for the maintenance cost itself in the first quarter, and we do expense maintenance as it's incurred. So as we move into the second quarter then, I said we would complete our remaining outages for the year. So that means we have four in the second quarter. So again, back to our $12 million a mill, that would be $12 million times four, it would be $48 million. And if you took the $7 million that we already spent on that, we'd be just over $40 million. Now those are for average outages. And we do have one mill in the second quarter where we will be installing a capital project. So its outages, a little over twice as long or about twice as long as our normal outage would be. So let's just say that's another $10 million. So roughly quarter-over-quarter, you're looking at probably just over $30 million for the first quarter and just under $50 million for the second quarter for an increase of a little under $20 million."

Joining me this morning are Dan Fulton, President, Chief Executive Officer; and Patty Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported Q2 2011 net earnings of $10 million or $0.02 per diluted share on net sales of $1.8 billion. Second quarter earnings include after-tax charges of $22 million for special items, $16 million for loss on the early extinguishment of debt and an impairment charge of $6 million with the expected sale of the Hardwoods business. 
The company's cash balance decreased $582 million, primarily due to debt repayments. At the end of the second quarter, Weyerhaeuser's cash, cash equivalents was $181 million. 
Please turn to the earnings information package available on our website. The package includes a GAAP reconciliation of special items. In our discussion of the business segments, we will refer to Charts 4 through 10. Chart 4, changes in contribution to earnings by segment for special items. This chart illustrates the change in contribution by business segments from the first quarter 2011 to second quarter 2011. My comments reviewing the second quarter refer to changes from first quarter unless otherwise noted. 
To begin our business segment discussion, the second quarter with Timberlands, Charts 5 and 6. In the second quarter, Timberlands contributed $112 million to pretax earnings, $23 million more than first quarter. Pre-tax earnings of -- were $89 million from the first quarter before special items. Average third-party price realization rose 9% in the West, driven by Chinese demand. Third-party price realizations were flat in the quarter. 
Key harvest volumes increased 8%. This increase was in part due to Chinese demand for logs. Export volume increased 31% for the first quarter. Costs were higher in the West due to roads and diesel. Higher diesel costs also affected the South. Nonstrategic land dispositions were $34 million in second quarter. 
Wood Products, Chart 7 and 8. Excluding a $9 million charge for the expected sale of the Hardwoods business, the Wood Products loss widened by $16 million in the second quarter to a loss of $52 million. In Q1, Wood Products lost $36 million. 
Lumber price realizations declined 5% or $14 per thousand board feet. Oriented trend board prices fell 7% or $14 per thousand square feet. TJI sales realizations were 1% lower than last quarter and section realizations were 3% higher. Sales volumes increased across all product lines except plywood, partially offsetting lower selling prices and higher costs. 
Cellulose Fibers, Chart 9. Cellulose Fibers contributed $80 million to pretax earnings in Q2. This was $6 million less than Q1 pretax earnings of $86 million. There were 4 scheduled maintenance outages in the quarter compared with 2 in the first quarter. The annual mill maintenance schedule has been completed for the year. Maintenance costs were $18 million higher due to the annual outages, and pulp production was 6% lower. Pulp price realizations increased $48 per air-dried metric ton or 5%. Pulp sales volume decreased 2% due to weakening demand from China. 
Real Estate, Chart 10. Second quarter pretax earnings for retail was $8 million, a $9 million increase in the contribution to earnings. In the first quarter, Retail had a pretax loss of $1 million. Closings of single-family homes seasonally increased 26% from 363 units in the first quarter to 459 units in the second quarter. However, closings declined 27% from the year ago quarter. Last year's second quarter benefited from the housing tax credits. 
Average single-family prices declined 7% from $419,000 to $391,000 due to mix. Gross margins increased to 22.4% from 21.7% in the first quarter. The backlog of single-family homes sold but not closed increased to 673 homes. 
And finally, Corporate & Other. Before special items, Corporate & Other contributed $19 million more to earnings in Q2. Corporate & Other includes net pretax charges of $11 million related to discontinued operations. This includes operating earnings of $2 million for Westwood Shipping Lines and charges of $13 million for other discontinued operations, primarily in environmental remediation reserve for previously divested facility. I would now like to turn the call over to Dan Fulton."

Thanks, Kathy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Despite continued weakness in U.S. housing and the overall U.S. economy, we continue to make progress against our goal of delivering superior, sustainable returns for our shareholders. 
In addition to focusing on improving operating performance, we took steps in the quarter that strengthened our balance sheet and liquidity and announced 2 divestments of nonstrategic assets. Our overall financial performance is not where it needs to be, and we remain focused on those variables we can control to improve performance in today's difficult markets. 
In my remarks this morning, I want to provide some context related to broader macroeconomic conditions that affect our results, in particular U.S. housing conditions and demand from China. Then I'll discuss highlights of our quarterly progress in each business segment and key strategic goals before turning to Patty, who will cover our outlook for the third quarter plus financial comments. 
Conditions in the U.S. housing market continued to be weak. Growth in GDP, employment and consumer confidence are all necessary for a housing recovery, and unfortunately, we saw little progress during the quarter on any of those indicators. GDP growth was less than 2% for the quarter, slightly worse than the first quarter and weaker than expected. Employment growth has stalled as evidenced by the recent June figures of over 9% unemployment. Consumer confidence remains weak, affected by high unemployment, increasing gas and food prices and the budget deficit debate. 
Facing these headwinds, we find ourselves in a housing market that is no better than last year's very weak market. In light of continued sluggish conditions, 2011 estimates for single-family starts have decreased to fewer than 500,000, and forecasters are now pushing the beginning of the housing recovery out to 2012. 
Although we faced challenging near-term market conditions, we continue to be bullish on housing demand over the longer term as the U.S. returns to trend demand levels. We're well positioned to take full advantage of the housing recovery in the U.S., as well as to build on our unique strengths to participate in the growth of global markets. 
As I've discussed before, Asia has long been an important market for Weyerhaeuser's Timberlands, Cellulose Fibers and Wood Products businesses. China's recent dramatic growth makes this market even more attractive to us. 
Last quarter, we discussed the positive effect of strong Chinese demand on our first quarter results, particularly in our Timberlands and Cellulose Fibers segments. Demand from China continued to be an important force in the markets early in the second quarter but late in the quarter, there was a noticeable reduction in both price and volume. Some of this change shows up in our second quarter results and will affect our outlook for the third quarter. 
Despite this recent pullback, overall demand is still higher than a year ago, and we believe China will continue to be an important growing, long-term market for our products. 
Let me now turn to a discussion of business and company highlights for the quarter. Earnings from our Timberlands segment were stronger than anticipated as we took full advantage of the opportunity presented by strong demand from Asia. Harvest volume and prices were up from Q1 in response to strong export markets off the West Coast. Our logistically advantaged Western Timberlands allowed us to capitalize on these strong market conditions, resulting in a 31% increase in export volume from Q1. 
During the quarter, the Chinese share of our export volume increased to 26% compared to 15% one year ago. Although we are now seeing somewhat of a retreat in demand from China from the first quarter high, our Japan market continues strong even after the tragic earthquake and tsunami earlier this year. Our Japanese export business continues to benefit from our close, long-term customer relationships, our premium Douglas fir logs and the highly-efficient supply chain. 
Despite continued operating improvements in our Wood Products business, our financial results were weaker than we expected, largely caused by continued softness in U.S. housing, which translated into overall decline in product prices. Sales volumes increased versus the first quarter across all major product lines, even with a weak seasonal increase in housing starts. This allowed us to reduce inventory as we produced less than we sold in the quarter. 
Sales volume increases were offset by lower realizations in all products, except engineered solid sections. In addition, log costs increased in the West. Though performance in this business is still below our expectations, we generated $23 million in cash as we began to work down the seasonal first quarter buildup in working capital. We continue to pull all levers to improve performance at today's low level of housing starts, include expanding our customer base into new geographies and markets outside of U.S. housing, while continuing a relentless focus on improving costs and utilization of our operating facilities. We remain focused on the goal of being cash positive in this business for the full year, but it will be challenging in these difficult markets. 
In WRECO, our Homebuilding business, our performance in the quarter exceeded our expectations. Although traffic was down 15% year-over-year, our conversion rates have increased, and we continued to realize strong margins relative to our competitors. 4 of our 5 homebuilders increased sales year-over-year, and the business earned $8 million for the quarter. 
WRECO remains focused on the basics: costs, cash flow and delivering home to highly satisfied customers. Our customer satisfaction scores, measured by willingness to refer, are among the highest in the industry of over 95% compared to industry averages of 86% to 90%. 
The primary story for the quarter in our Cellulose Fibers business is that we safely completed 4 planned annual maintenance shutdowns with 0 recordable incidents. With our scheduled annual maintenance now complete, we're positioned to run full for the balance of the year. 
price realizations for the quarter were anticipated as were the expenses related to our planned maintenance. Towards the end of the quarter, we saw some price softening due to a decline in demand from China, which resulted in financial results slightly less than expected. 
The decline in Chinese demand was especially evident in decreasing pricing relating to dissolving pulps and NBSK [northern bleached softwood kraft]. This decline affected sales of our Pearl product, which is being used as a dissolving wood pulp extender. 
Finally, I want to address progress that we continue to make during the quarter to implement our strategic direction. During the quarter, we reached agreement to sell 2 nonstrategic businesses, our Hardwoods business and our Westwood Shipping Line. We have owned and operated these businesses for several decades, and as we assessed our future direction, we determined that neither were core to our ongoing strategy. By selling them to new owners, we will better be able to sharpen our own management focus on our long-term strategic direction. 
Both transactions are scheduled to close in the third quarter so Patty will discuss more specifics on her of the comments. Although we are selling these businesses, I'm pleased that we will continue our relationships with our long-term associates as the Hardwoods organization will continue to be a customer for our logs, and we will continue to ship products to our Asian customers on Westwood Shipping Lines. 
A final element of forward progress during the quarter was continued actions we took to strengthen our balance sheet and liquidity position by refinancing our credit facility, repaying our 2012 maturity notes and ending the quarter with a strong cash position.

Slowing export demand from China is expected to result in lower sales realizati",908,"Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. The outlook for the third quarter by business segment is summarized on Chart 11. I'll begin the outlook discussion with Timberlands. 
Slowing export demand from China is expected to result in lower sales realizations and volumes in our Western operations. In addition, we expect domestic markets will continue to soften as sawmills take increased downtime in response to weakening lumber markets, also contributing to the falloff in volumes and prices.  
In the South, realizations for logs are expected to moderate only slightly as those markets did not experience the run-up in pricing during the second quarter that we saw in the West. Volumes may increase seasonally. We anticipate seasonal increases in costs for silviculture and road spending in the third quarter compared to the second. 
Earnings from nonstrategic land sales are anticipated to be much lower in the third quarter. Overall, we expect that earnings in the Timberlands segment will be significantly lower in the third quarter compared to the second. 
Average sales realizations in Wood Products are expected to be 3% to 4% lower for both lumber and OSB compared to the average for the second quarter as market trends reflect soft demand in most geographies. Realizations in Engineered Wood Products are estimated to increase around 1% to 2%, reflecting a July 1 announced price increase. 
Sales volumes are expected to decrease across most product lines, although OSB volumes may increase somewhat. Log costs should decrease, especially in the West, and we expect to take more downtime in the third quarter in lumber due to weak market conditions as we continue to focus on matching supply with demand. We've already taken 6 weeks downtime in July compared to 3 weeks in Q2. 
Excluding the results of the Hardwood business, we expect overall operating results in our Wood Products segment to be comparable to the second quarter. 
In Cellulose Fibers, pulp sales realizations are expected to decrease as the pullback in demand from China continues. However, this should be partially offset by somewhat higher shipment volumes. We had completed all of our planned annual maintenance outages for 2011 by the end of the second quarter. As a result, we will have a significant improvement to maintenance costs and productivity. 
In addition, we expect lower costs for operating supplies and contract services, primarily related to the reduction in maintenance outages. We also anticipate slightly lower seasonal energy costs. 
Although market conditions have softened, we expect that earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment will increase significantly compared to the second quarter. 
Markets in our Real Estate segment continue to be very weak. While we do believe that markets have reached their bottom, we don't see any near-term catalyst that would overcome the continued lackluster job growth and low consumer confidence. Despite these market challenges, we expect closings to increase seasonally in the third quarter. We anticipate closings of over 500 in this quarter compared to 459 in the second quarter. Prices are expected to be flat to slightly lower due to mix, and margins should remain relatively strong at 20% to 22%. We expect slightly improved earnings in our Real Estate segment compared to the second quarter, and we have not assumed any land transactions in our third quarter outlook. 
Now I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments. During the second quarter, we used $551 million to retire debt, which was originally due in March of next year. This amount includes principal, interest and the premium paid on the early extinguishment. While this was a significant use of cash in the quarter, we anticipate an overall interest savings in excess of the premium by executing the May call. 
In addition, we paid $30 million our regularly scheduled debt maturities in the quarter. We ended the second quarter with cash of over $880 million. Debt maturities for the next 5 years totaled just over $600 million, with $200 million due in 2012. 
Also in the second quarter, we replaced our bank credit facility which was set to expire at the end of this year. The new facility has a 4-year term and retains the $1 billion of credit availability. We have no borrowings outstanding under this agreement, and so we have substantial liquidity and a strong balance sheet despite challenging market conditions. 
Capital expenditures for the first 6 months totaled just under $100 million, and we still estimate expenditures for the full year to be on the range of $250 million to $270 million. As we have previously disclosed, we estimate pension contributions this year for our Canadian plant of approximately $80 million, and most of this will be paid in the third quarter. As Dan discussed, we are scheduled to close the sales of our wood -- Hardwood and shipping businesses in the third quarter. We expect to receive total proceeds of approximately $160 million plus transfer of long-term lease obligations. 
Total proceeds for the Hardwoods business will be approximately $108 million, of which $25 million is a note receivable and the remainder in cash. In the third quarter, we will recognize a non-cash pension charge of approximately $10 million to recognize amortization of previously deferred costs. Upon the sale of our shipping business, we anticipate cash proceeds of approximately $53 million, and we will book a pretax gain of approximately $45 million. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Dan for some closing comments, and I look forward to your questions. Dan?"

After several years of relatively quiet market condition",279,"Thanks, Patty. Before we turn to your questions, I want to make a few comments about the current demand for Timberland since we often get questions from you about what we are seeing in the market. 
After several years of relatively quiet market conditions, we have seen increased interest from a wide range of investors in the south, as well as the Pacific Northwest. Recent interest has come from what I consider to be traditional Timberland investors, including other forest products companies, TIMOs and high net worth family interests. 
This year, we've also seen interest from a variety of conservation-oriented investment funds. We are routinely engaged in smaller Timberland transactions, normally structured as exchanges through which we are working to improve our overall returns by blocking up land adjacent to existing ownership where we can benefit from management efficiencies.  In the case of the Pacific Northwest, we're continuing a long-term strategy of shifting our ownership to land best suited for Douglas fir. 
Our sales of nonstrategic coastal properties over the last few years is a result of our strategy in the northwest of moving out of land that was primarily hemlock and extending our Douglas fir ownership. As an example, earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of approximately 6,300 acres of prime Douglas fir timberland in Washington that is adjacent to our own logistically advantaged holdings using exchange proceeds from the sale of nonstrategic acreage in Arkansas that closed in the second quarter. We'll describe our long-term strategy to target profitable growth in our Timberland holdings and we'll continue to explore opportunities to leverage our Timberland's management expertise to add shareholder value. And now, we welcome your questions."

And as we set up our eye-level strategy and brought all of the businesses under that brand, we turned it into more of a channel market, as you note.  And fundamentally, it's been a channel for our Engineered Wood Products business. As we've evaluated that business over the last 12 to 18 months, especially in this continued downturn in housing, we have decided to take on some additional third-party distribution and sale of products that are related to new home construction where we can improve our efficiencies and logistics in selling those products out of those yards where we can put them on a truck. It's already going to a job site where there are Engineered Wood Products, and it will make it a contribution against our fixed cost and help to improve the margins in that business.  And so what you observed is an evolution where we use to distribute to a number of third-party products. And as you observed, we've moved away from that and now we are taking on some strategic third-party products, not on the scale that it used to be but those that are complementary to our own."

We think that's a shorter-term phenomenon but it's playing out in the third quarter forecast that Kathy provided. The good news, let me just talk about Pearl a little bit.

But our Wood Products business, the focus is to generate cash and to improve margins and to improve revenues. In our Homebuilding business, our focus has been to generate cash through normal operations of building homes plus we are an opportunistic seller of land and lots to other builders. We've had some success in doing so, and we expect that activity to continue as the housing market starts to recover and many builders will find themselves being land short and they will need to purchase lots and we'll have some to sell them. In our Timberlands business, we do generate significant cash there, and what we would be looking at in our Timberlands business is some market recovery, especially in the South. In the West, we've benefited in cash flow because of the run-up in prices coming from the export markets. As we mentioned, that's softer now but we would expect that to recover. China will continue to be a strong buyer of products off the West Coast, and we'll be ready to supply them.  And then our Cellulose Fibers business, we have been on a relatively steady capital spend where we're improving our facilities. Those spending initiatives had been bringing down our cash reduction costs. They have been reducing longer-term or maintenance costs, and so we will be better positioned to generate cash in the future because of those. So to your question, what is our focus, it's all of those."

And it's no secret why that is. It's because they have relatively strong employment. Washington D.C. went into the downturn earlier. It's come out ahead of some of the markets. There's not a significant overbuild of inventory. Volumes are not what they used to be but prices are recovering, and we're actually's seeing some incremental improvement in price. Houston is an energy economy and so they come through this market in relatively good shape. We're seeing improved productivity in our Trendmaker operation, both from our routine activity with our Trendmaker Homes plus we have some product enhancements and extensions that have helped us to increase market share and increase volume. Phoenix is a market that's actually showing some growth now. And it -- once again, it's an employment story. Growth will be strong employment, our activity is up in Phoenix and we're starting to see some improvement in margins in that market. In Southern California, we've enjoyed, during the downturn, relatively steady demand in san Diego, and we've had higher margins in San Diego because of our historic land position. That continues to be the case. Market's a little bit softer than it was 6 months in San Diego -- 6 months ago in San Diego, if that's more of a relative comment. We're seeing some improvement in the Pacific Northwest, which had been soft for a period of time, and that's once again related to job growth, relatively more improved job picture in the Pacific Northwest related to the Boeing airplane company and their ramp up of production plus other new employment. In Las Vegas, we're still struggling. It's a tough market but the inventory is being worked down, and we are starting to see some improvement in that market. And then the last submarket is the LA and the Inland Empire, I think we're doing better than others in the Inland Empire, and we're expecting that market to pick up a bit. So it is a slower recovery than what we had anticipated, Gail, but we're seeing some positive movement. And as we talked, I mentioned in my comments, we had 4 of our 5 homebuilders had greater sales in the quarter than they did a year ago.  And one year ago, we had the housing tax credit and so that's good news. The market where we did not see improvement was Southern California and Las Vegas, and so that's the one that's our big engine.  And we need to see some improvement in order to see a real significant pickup in the WRECO activity. But we've been pleased that WRECO were profitable. Our results generally are better than those of our peers. And as Patty mentioned, we're expecting a bit of improvement in the third quarter."

So we're focused on maintaining margin. We're not chasing volume but all of the forecast that I see which suggests that we are expecting to see recovery to start in 2012 clearly didn't happen in 2011. When we went into the year, we were expecting 2011 to be somewhat of a mirror image of 2010. 2010 had a strong first half, a very weak second half, we are expecting a weak first half of 2011 with improvement in the second half of the year, and at this point, we're not expecting to see significant improvement in the back half.  And so we're planning for that and we're focused on recovery starting to take shape in 2012. We do need to see improved consumer confidence.

In terms of fluff prices, Patty provided our forecast for the third quarter in terms of what we're seeing directionally. There has been some additional supply that's come on with Domtar at Plymouth and the Alabama Pine facility. That's had some impact in putting more product on the market. On the other hand, the fluff market continues to grow globally.

We do have a joint venture with Chevron, it's called Catchlight Energy. That joint venture's been operating for about 3 years. The initial focus in that joint venture was to combine the expertise and intellectual capital of Weyerhaeuser. If you think about the oil analogy, as the upstream provider of biomass and then Chevron is downstream in the refining  business. We have, over time, looked at all of the technologies that are out there and have determined at this point that we will form more relationships with those like KiOR that bring in some unique technology. Weyerhaeuser's role in that relationship will be providing biomass. Chevron's role will be to take away the product that would be manufactured or refined by the KiOR. Because ultimately, the challenge in this business is you have to distribute it and get it to an end user. And so the strengths of our partnership are that we, better than anyone, I think understand the upstream challenges and opportunities. Chevron covers the downstream and we are likely to be entering into a number of agreements in what we would call a wraparound strategy where we have the opportunity to work with those that have a variety of technologies.

So we will continue to match our harvest levels with profitable demand. We'll gauge pricing as we look forward and move our harvest.

Please review the warning statement in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call.
Joining me this morning are Dan Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patty Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported Q2 2011 net earnings of $10 million or $0.02 per diluted share on net sales of $1.8 billion. Second quarter earnings include after-tax charges of $22 million for special items, $16 million for loss on the early extinguishment of debt and an impairment charge of $6 million with the expected sale of the hardwoods business. 
The company's cash balance decreased $582 million primarily due to debt repayment. At the end of the second quarter, Weyerhaeuser's cash and cash equivalents was $181 million. 
Please turn to the earnings information package available on our website. This package includes the GAAP reconciliation of special items. In our discussion of the business segments, we will refer to Charts 4 through 10. 
Chart 4, changes in contribution to earnings by segment before special items. This chart illustrates the change in contribution by business segments from first quarter 2011 to second quarter 2011. My comments reviewing the second quarter refer to changes from first quarter unless otherwise noted. 
We begin our business segment discussion of the second quarter with Timberlands, Charts 5 and 6. In the second quarter, Timberlands contributed $112 million to pre-tax earnings, $23 million more than first quarter. Pre-tax earnings of -- were $89 million in the first quarter before special items. Average third-party price realizations rose 9% in the West, driven by Chinese demand. Southern third-party price realizations were flat in the quarter. 
Fee harvest volumes increased 8%. This increase was in part due to Chinese demand for logs. Export volume increased 31% from first quarter. Costs were higher in the West due to roads and diesel. Higher diesel cost also affected the South. Non-strategic land dispositions were $34 million in second quarter. 
Wood Products, Chart 7 and 8. Excluding a $9 million charge for the expected sale of the hardwoods business, the Wood Products loss widened by $16 million in the second quarter to a loss of $52 million. In Q1, Wood Products lost $36 million. 
Lumber price realizations declined 5% or $14 per thousand board feet. Oriented strand board prices fell 7% or $14 per thousand square feet. TJI sales realizations were 1% lower than last quarter, and solid section realizations were 3% higher. Sales volumes increased across all product lines except plywood, partially offsetting lower selling prices and higher cost. 
Cellulose Fibers, Chart 9. Cellulose Fibers contributed $80 million to pre-tax earnings in Q2. This was $6 million less than Q1 pre-tax earnings of $86 million. There were 4 scheduled maintenance outages in the quarter compared with the 2 in the first quarter. The annual mill maintenance schedule has been completed for the year. Maintenance costs were $18 million higher due to the annual outages, and pulp production was 6% lower. Pulp price realizations increased $48 per air-dried metric ton or 5%. Pulp sales volume decreased 2% due to weakening demand from China. 
Real Estate, Chart 10. Second quarter pre-tax earnings for WRECO was $8 million, a $9 million increase in the contribution to earnings. In the first quarter, WRECO had a pre-tax loss of $1 million. Closings of single-family homes seasonally increased 26% from 363 units in the first quarter to 459 units in the second quarter. However, closings declined 27% from the year ago quarter. Last year's second quarter benefited from the housing tax credits. 
Average single-family prices declined 7% from $419,000 to $391,000 due to mix. Gross margins increased to 22.4% from 21.7% in the first quarter. The backlog of single-family homes sold but not closed increased to 673 homes. 
And finally, Corporate and Other. Before special items, Corporate and Other contributed $19 million more to earnings in Q2. Corporate and Other includes net pre-tax charges of $11 million related to discontinued operations. This includes operating earnings of $2 million for Westwood Shipping Lines and charges of $13 million for other discontinued operations, primarily in environmental remediation reserve for a previously divested facility. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Dan Fulton."

Thanks, Kathy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Despite continued weakness in U.S. housing and the overall U.S. economy, we continue to make progress against our goal of delivering superior sustainable returns for our shareholders. 
In addition to focusing on improving operating performance, we took steps in the quarter that strengthened our balance sheet and liquidity and announced 2 divestments of non-strategic assets. Our overall financial performance is not where it needs to be, and we remain focused on those variables we can control to improve performance in today's difficult markets. 
In my remarks this morning, I want to provide some context related to broader macroeconomic conditions that affect our results, in particular U.S. housing conditions and demand from China. Then I'll discuss highlights of our quarterly progress in each business segment and key strategic goals before turning to Patty, who will cover our outlook for the third quarter plus financial comments. 
Conditions in the U.S. housing market continue to be weak. Growth in GDP, employment and consumer confidence are all necessary for a housing recovery, and unfortunately, we saw little progress during the quarter on any of those indicators. 
GDP growth was less than 2% for the quarter, slightly worse than the first quarter and weaker than expected. Employment growth has stalled as evidenced by the recent June figures of over 9% unemployment. Consumer confidence remains weak, affected by high unemployment, increasing gas and food prices and the budget deficit debate. 
Facing these headwinds, we find ourselves in a housing market that is no better than last year's very weak market. In light of continued sluggish conditions, 2011 estimates for single-family starts have decreased to fewer than 500,000, and forecasters are now pushing the beginning of the housing recovery out to 2012. 
Although we faced challenging near-term market conditions, we continue to be bullish on housing demand over the longer term as the U.S. returns to trend demand levels. We're well positioned to take full advantage of the housing recovery in the U.S. as well as to build on our unique strengths to participate in the growth of global markets. 
As I've discussed before, Asia has long been an important market for Weyerhaeuser's Timberlands, Cellulose Fibers and Wood Products businesses. China's recent dramatic growth makes this market even more attractive to us. 
Last quarter, we discussed the positive effect of strong Chinese demand on our first quarter results, particularly in our Timberlands and Cellulose Fibers segments. Demand from China continued to be an important force in the markets early in the second quarter, but late in the quarter, there was a noticeable reduction in both price and volume. Some of this change shows up in our second quarter results and will affect our outlook for the third quarter. 
Despite this recent pullback, overall demand is still higher than a year ago, and we believe China will continue to be an important growing, long-term market for our products. 
Let me now turn to a discussion of business and company highlights for the quarter. Earnings from our Timberlands segment were stronger than anticipated as we took full advantage of the opportunity presented by strong demand from Asia. Harvest volume and prices were up from Q1 in response to strong export markets off the West Coast. Our logistically advantaged Western Timberlands allowed us to capitalize on these strong market conditions, resulting in a 31% increase in export volume from Q1. 
During the quarter, the Chinese share of our export volume increased to 26% compared to 15% one year ago. Although we are now seeing somewhat of a retreat in demand from China from the first quarter high, our Japan market continued strong even after the tragic earthquake and tsunami earlier this year. Our Japanese export business continues to benefit from our close, long-term customer relationships, our premium Douglas fir logs and a highly efficient supply chain. 
Despite continued operating improvements on our Wood Products business, our financial results were weaker than we expected, largely caused by continued softness in U.S. housing, which translated into overall decline in product prices. 
Sales volumes increased versus the first quarter across all major product lines even with a weak seasonal increase in housing starts. This allowed us to reduce inventory as we produced less than we sold in the quarter. Sales volume increases were offset by lower realizations in all products except engineered solid sections. In addition, log cost increased in the West. 
Though performance in this business is still below our expectations, we generated $23 million in cash as we began to work down the seasonal first quarter buildup in working capital. We continue to pull all levers to improve performance at today's low level of housing starts, including expanding our customer base into new geographies and markets outside of U.S. housing, while continuing a relentless focus on improving costs and utilization of our operating facilities. We remain focused on the goal of being cash positive in this business for the full year, but it will be challenging in these difficult markets. 
In WRECO, our homebuilding business, our performance in the quarter exceeded our expectations. Although traffic was down 15% year-over-year, our conversion rates have increased, and we continued to realize strong margins relative to our competitors. 4 of our 5 homebuilders increased sales year-over-year, and the business earned $8 million for the quarter. 
WRECO remains focused on the basics: cost, cash flow and delivering homes to highly satisfied customers. Our customer satisfaction scores, measured by willingness to refer, are among the highest in the industry at over 95% compared to industry averages of 86% to 90%. 
The primary story for the quarter in our Cellulose Fibers business is that we safely completed 4 planned annual maintenance shutdowns with 0 recordable incidents. With our scheduled annual maintenance now complete, we're positioned to run full for the balance of the year. 
Increased price realizations for the quarter were anticipated, as were the expenses related to our planned maintenance. Towards the end of the quarter, we saw some price softening due to a decline in demand from China, which resulted in financial results slightly less than expected. 
The decline in Chinese demand was especially evident in decreasing pricing relating to dissolving pulps and NBSK. This decline affected sales of our Pearl product, which is being used as a dissolving wood pulp extender. 
Finally, I want to address progress that we continue to make during the quarter to implement our strategic direction. During the quarter, we reached agreements to sell 2 non-strategic businesses: our Hardwoods business and our Westwood Shipping Line. 
We have owned and operated these businesses for several decades, and as we assessed our future direction, we determined that neither were core to our ongoing strategy. By selling them to new owners, we will better be able to sharpen our own management focus on our long-term strategic direction. Both transactions are scheduled to close in the third quarter, so Patty will discuss more specifics in her outlook comments. 
Although we are selling these businesses, I'm pleased that we will continue our relationship with our long-term associates as the Hardwoods organization will continue to be a customer for our logs, and we will continue to ship products to our Asian customers on Westwood Shipping Lines. 
A final element of forward progress during the quarter was continued actions we took to strengthen our balance sheet and liquidity position by refinancing our credit facility, repaying our 2012 maturity notes and ending the quarter with a strong cash position.  
And now, I'll ask Patty to discuss our outlook and provide a financial summary and then I'll provide a quick recap before we invite your questions. Patty?"

The outlook for the third quarter by business segment is summarized on Chart 11. I'll begin the outlook discussion with Timberlands. 
Slowing export demand from China is expected to result in lower sales realizations and volumes in our Western operations. In addition, we expect domestic markets will continue to soften as sawmills take increased downtime in response to weakening lumber markets, also contributing to the falloff in volumes and prices.  
In the South, realizations for logs are expected to moderate only slightly as those markets did not experience the run-up in pricing during the second quarter that we saw in the West. Volumes may increase seasonally. We anticipate seasonal increases in cost for silviculture and road spending in the third quarter compared to the second. 
Earnings from non-strategic land sales are anticipated to be much lower in the third quarter. Overall, we expect that earnings in the Timberlands segment will be significantly lower in the third quarter compared to the second. 
Average sales realizations in Wood Products are expected to be 3% to 4% lower for both lumber and OSB compared to the average for the second quarter as market trends reflect soft demand in most geographies. Realizations in engineered wood products are estimated to increase around 1% to 2%, reflecting a July 1-announced price increase. 
Sales volumes are expected to decrease across most product lines, although OSB volumes may increase somewhat. Log cost should decrease, especially in the West, and we expect to take more downtime in the third quarter in lumber due to weak market conditions as we continue to focus on matching supply with demand. We've already taken 6 weeks downtime in July compared to 3 weeks in Q2. 
Excluding the results of the Hardwood business, we expect overall operating results in our Wood Products segment to be comparable to the second quarter. 
In Cellulose Fibers, pulp sales realizations are expected to decrease as the pullback in demand from China continues. However, this should be partially offset by somewhat higher shipment volumes. 
We had completed all of our planned annual maintenance outages for 2011 by the end of the second quarter. As a result, we will have a significant improvement to maintenance cost and productivity. 
In addition, we expect lower cost for operating supplies and contract services, primarily related to the reduction in maintenance outages. We also anticipate slightly lower seasonal energy costs. 
Although market conditions have softened, we expect that earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment will increase significantly compared to the second quarter. 
Markets in our Real Estate segment continue to be very weak. While we do believe that markets have reached their bottom, we don't see any near-term catalyst that would overcome the continued lackluster job growth and low consumer confidence. 
Despite these market challenges, we expect closings to increase seasonally in the third quarter. We anticipate closings of over 500 in this quarter compared to 459 in the second quarter. Prices are expected to be flat to slightly lower due to mix, and margins should remain relatively strong at 20% to 22%. 
We expect slightly improved earnings in our Real Estate segment compared to the second quarter, and we have not assumed any land transactions in our third quarter outlook. 
Now I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments. During the second quarter, we used $551 million to retire debt, which was originally due in March of next year. This amount includes principal, interest and the premium paid on the early extinguishment. While this was a significant use of cash in the quarter, we anticipate an overall interest savings in excess of the premium by executing the May call.
In addition, we paid $30 million of regularly scheduled debt maturities in the quarter. We ended the second quarter with cash of over $880 million. Debt maturities for the next 5 years total just over $600 million, with $200 million due in 2012. 
Also in the second quarter, we replaced our bank credit facility, which was set to expire at the end of this year. The new facility has a 4-year term and retains the $1 billion of credit availability. We have no borrowings outstanding under this agreement, and so we have substantial liquidity and a strong balance sheet despite challenging market conditions. 
Capital expenditures for the first 6 months totaled just under $100 million, and we still estimate expenditures for the full year to be in the range of $250 million to $270 million. 
As we have previously disclosed, we estimate pension contributions this year for our Canadian plant of approximately $80 million, and most of this will be paid in the third quarter. 
As Dan discussed, we are scheduled to close the sales of our wood -- Hardwood and shipping businesses in the third quarter. We expect to receive total proceeds of approximately $160 million plus transfer of long-term lease obligations. Total proceeds for the Hardwoods business will be approximately $108 million, of which $25 million is a note receivable and the remainder in cash. 
In the third quarter, we will recognize a non-cash pension charge of approximately $10 million to recognize amortization of previously deferred cost. 
Upon the sale of our shipping business, we anticipate cash proceeds of approximately $53 million, and we will book a pre-tax gain of approximately $45 million. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Dan for some closing comments, and I look forward to your questions. Dan?"

Before we turn to your questions, I want to make a few comments about the current demand for Timberland, since we often get questions from you about what we are seeing in the market. 
After several years of relatively quiet market conditions, we have seen increased interest from a wide range of investors in the South as well as the Pacific Northwest. Recent interest has come from what I consider to be traditional timberland investors, including other forest products companies, TIMOs and high net worth family interests. This year, we've also seen interest from a variety of conservation-oriented investment funds. 
We are routinely engaged in smaller timberland transactions, normally structured as exchanges, through which we are working to improve our overall returns by blocking up land adjacent to existing ownership where we can benefit from management efficiencies.  In the case of the Pacific Northwest, we're continuing a long-term strategy of shifting our ownership to land best suited for Douglas fir. 
Our sales of non-strategic coastal properties over the last few years is a result of our strategy in the Northwest of moving out of land that was primarily hemlock and expanding our Douglas fir ownership. As an example, earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of approximately 6,300 acres of prime Douglas fir timberland in Washington that is adjacent to our own logistically advantaged holdings using exchange proceeds from the sale of non-strategic acreage in Arkansas that closed in the second quarter. 
We've described our long-term strategy to target profitable growth in our Timberland holdings, and we'll continue to explore opportunities to leverage our Timberland's management expertise to add shareholder value. 
And now, we welcome your questions."

So we've seen some price drops for logs that are being exported. Most of that will start to be evident in the third quarter. In our Cellulose Fibers business, the most dramatic change occurred with our Pearl product. That is small tonnage for us but has been very high margin. And what happened there, it was really early June that Chinese government fundamentally started to tighten credit for businesses in China. They cut back purchases. We think that's a shorter-term phenomenon, but it's playing out in the third quarter forecast that Kathy provided. So the good news, let me -- just talking about Pearl a little bit. That's a product that we make by swinging production from our normal fluff production. And so it's not a dedicated facility to the extent that prices fall back, there's still an attractive margin, but we can swing that volume back to fluff, which is a big advantage for us. So we are opportunistically taking advantage of pricing opportunities in that product, but we have plenty of demand for our fluff production."

We had targeted that we would be cash breakeven for the year. Our focus is to continue to reach that goal, but in the market that we find ourselves, that will be very challenging. But our Wood Products business, the focus is to generate cash and to improve margins and to improve revenues. In our homebuilding business, our focus has been to generate cash through normal operations of building homes. Plus we are an opportunistic seller of land and lots to other builders. We've had some success in doing so. And we expect that activity to continue as the housing market starts to recover, and many builders will find themselves being land short. And they will need to purchase lots, and we'll have some to sell them. In our Timberlands business, we do generate significant cash there. And what we would be looking at in our Timberlands business is some market recovery, especially in the South. In the West, we benefited in cash flow because of the run-up in prices coming from the export markets. As we mentioned, that's softer now, but we would expect that to recover. China will continue to be a strong buyer of products off the West Coast, and we'll be ready to supply them. And then our Cellulose Fibers business, we have been on a relatively steady capital spend, where we're improving our facilities. Those spending initiatives have been bringing down our cash reduction cost. They have been reducing longer-term or maintenance cost, and so we will be better positioned to generate cash in the future because of those.

Strongest markets within WRECO have been Washington D.C. and Houston, and it's no secret why that is. It's because they have relatively strong employment. Washington D.C. went into the downturn earlier. It's come out ahead of some of the other markets. There's not a significant overbuild of inventory. Volumes are not what they used to be, but prices are recovering, and we're actually seeing some incremental improvement in price. Houston is an energy economy, and so they've come through this market in relatively good shape. We're seeing improved activity on our Trendmaker operation, both from our routine activity with our Trendmaker Homes, plus we have some product enhancements and extensions that have helped us to increase market share and increase volume. Phoenix is a market that's actually showing some growth now. And it -- once again, it's an employment story. Relatively strong employment, our activity is up in Phoenix, and we're starting to see some improvements in margins in that market. In Southern California, we've enjoyed, during the downturn, relatively steady demand in San Diego, and we've had high margins in San Diego because of our historic land position. That continues to be the case. Market's a little bit softer than it was 6 months in -- 6 months ago in San Diego, but that's more of a relative comment. We're seeing some improvement in the Pacific Northwest, which had been soft for a period of time, and that's, once again, related to job growth. So relatively more improved job picture in the Pacific Northwest related to the Boeing airplane company and their ramp up of production plus other new employment. In Las Vegas, we're still struggling. It's a tough market, but the inventory is being worked down, and we are starting to see some improvement in that market. And then the last submarket is the LA and the Inland Empire. I think we're doing better than others in the Inland Empire, and we're expecting that market to pick up a bit. So it is a slower recovery than what we had anticipated, Gail, but we're seeing some positive movements. And as we talked and I mentioned in my comments, we had -- 4 of our 5 homebuilders had greater sales in the quarter than they did a year ago, and one year ago, we had the housing tax credit. So that's good news. The market where we did not see improvement was Southern California and Las Vegas. And so that's the one that's our big engine, and we need to see some improvement in order to see a real significant pick-up in the WRECO activity. But we've been pleased that WRECO were profitable. Our results, generally, are better than those of our peers, and as Patty mentioned, we're expecting a bit of improvement in the third quarter."

We talked about Japan on the last call, because it was right after the earthquake and the tsunami, and we had had some disruption. For the most part, all of our customers' operations have stabilized. They've shifted production between their own facilities, and Japan remains very stable for us. It's also an important consideration not just in Cellulose Fibers, but as we talk about our export log business. Once again, to make the point, China has been terrific for us as well as the rest of the industry, because it's been new demand from the West Coast. But our large long-term export market has been and will continue to be Japan."

It's called Catchlight Energy. That joint venture has been operating for about 3 years. The initial focus in that joint venture was to combine the expertise and intellectual capital of Weyerhaeuser. If you think about the oil analogy, as the upstream provider of biomass and then Chevron is downstream in the refining business. We have, over time, looked at all of the technologies that are out there and have determined at this point that we will form more relationships with those like KiOR that bring in some unique technology. Weyerhaeuser's role in that relationship will be providing biomass. Chevron's role will be to take away the product that would be manufactured or refined by the KiORs. Because ultimately, the challenge in this business is you have to distribute it to get it to an end user. And so the strengths of our partnership are that we, better than anyone, I think, understand the upstream challenges and opportunities. Chevron covers the downstream, and we are likely to be entering into a number of agreements in what we would call a wraparound strategy, where we have the opportunity to work with those that have a variety of technologies. We think there's great long-term potential, but it's too early to tell, and I would not be able speculate at this point timing for those technologies.

Please review the warning statement in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call.
Joining me this morning are Dan Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patty Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported Q2 2011 net earnings of $10 million or $0.02 per diluted share on net sales of $1.8 billion. Second quarter earnings include after-tax charges of $22 million for special items, $16 million for loss on the early extinguishment of debt and an impairment charge of $6 million for the expected sale of the Hardwoods business. 
The company's cash balance decreased $582 million primarily due to debt repayment. At the end of the second quarter, Weyerhaeuser's cash and cash equivalents was $181 million (sic) [$881 million]. 
Please turn to the earnings information package available on our website. This package includes the GAAP reconciliation of special items. In our discussion of the business segments, we will refer to Charts 4 through 10. 
Chart 4, changes in contribution to earnings by segment before special items. This chart illustrates the change in contribution by business segments from first quarter 2011 to second quarter 2011. My comments reviewing the second quarter refer to changes from first quarter unless otherwise noted. 
We begin our business segment discussion of the second quarter with Timberlands, Charts 5 and 6. In the second quarter, Timberlands contributed $112 million to pre-tax earnings, $23 million more than first quarter. Pre-tax earnings of -- were $89 million in the first quarter before special items. Average third-party price realizations rose 9% in the West, driven by Chinese demand. Southern third-party price realizations were flat in the quarter. 
Fee harvest volumes increased 8%. This increase was in part due to Chinese demand for logs. Export volume increased 31% from first quarter. Costs were higher in the West due to roads and diesel. Higher diesel cost also affected the South. Nonstrategic land dispositions were $34 million in second quarter. 
Wood Products, Charts 7 and 8. Excluding a $9 million charge for the expected sale of the Hardwoods business, the Wood Products loss widened by $16 million in the second quarter to a loss of $52 million. In Q1, Wood Products lost $36 million. 
Lumber price realizations declined 5% or $14 per thousand board feet. Oriented strand board prices fell 7% or $14 per thousand square feet. TJI sales realizations were 1% lower than last quarter, and solid section realizations were 3% higher. Sales volumes increased across all product lines except plywood, partially offsetting lower selling prices and higher cost. 
Cellulose Fibers, Chart 9. Cellulose Fibers contributed $80 million to pre-tax earnings in Q2. This was $6 million less than Q1 pre-tax earnings of $86 million. There were 4 scheduled maintenance outages in the quarter compared with the 2 in the first quarter. The annual mill maintenance schedule has been completed for the year. Maintenance costs were $18 million higher due to the annual outages, and pulp production was 6% lower. Pulp price realizations increased $48 per air-dried metric ton or 5%. Pulp sales volume decreased 2% due to weakening demand from China. 
Real Estate, Chart 10. Second quarter pre-tax earnings for WRECO was $8 million, a $9 million increase in the contribution to earnings. In the first quarter, WRECO had a pre-tax loss of $1 million. Closings of single-family homes seasonally increased 26% from 363 units in the first quarter to 459 units in the second quarter. However, closings declined 27% from the year ago quarter. Last year's second quarter benefited from the housing tax credits. 
Average single-family prices declined 7% from $419,000 to $391,000 due to mix. Gross margins increased to 22.4% from 21.7% in the first quarter. The backlog of single-family homes sold but not closed increased to 673 homes. 
And finally, Corporate and Other. Before special items, Corporate and Other contributed $19 million more to earnings in Q2. Corporate and Other includes net pre-tax charges of $11 million related to discontinued operations. This includes operating earnings of $2 million for Westwood Shipping Lines and charges of $13 million for other discontinued operations, primarily in environmental remediation reserve for a previously divested facility. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Dan Fulton."

Thanks, Kathy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Despite continued weakness in U.S. housing and the overall U.S. economy, we continue to make progress against our goal of delivering superior sustainable returns for our shareholders. 
In addition to focusing on improving operating performance, we took steps in the quarter that strengthened our balance sheet and liquidity and announced 2 divestments of nonstrategic assets. Our overall financial performance is not where it needs to be, and we remain focused on those variables we can control to improve performance in today's difficult markets. 
In my remarks this morning, I want to provide some context related to broader macroeconomic conditions that affect our results, in particular U.S. housing conditions and demand from China. Then I'll discuss highlights of our quarterly progress in each business segment and key strategic goals before turning to Patty, who will cover our outlook for the third quarter plus financial comments. 
Conditions in the U.S. housing market continue to be weak. Growth in GDP, employment and consumer confidence are all necessary for a housing recovery, and unfortunately, we saw little progress during the quarter on any of those indicators. 
GDP growth was less than 2% for the quarter, slightly worse than the first quarter and weaker than expected. Employment growth has stalled as evidenced by the recent June figures of over 9% unemployment. Consumer confidence remains weak, affected by high unemployment, increasing gas and food prices and the budget deficit debate. 
Facing these headwinds, we find ourselves in a housing market that is no better than last year's very weak market. In light of continued sluggish conditions, 2011 estimates for single-family starts have decreased to fewer than 500,000, and forecasters are now pushing the beginning of the housing recovery out to 2012. 
Although we faced challenging near-term market conditions, we continue to be bullish on housing demand over the longer term as the U.S. returns to trend demand levels. We're well positioned to take full advantage of the housing recovery in the U.S. as well as to build on our unique strengths to participate in the growth of global markets. 
As I've discussed before, Asia has long been an important market for Weyerhaeuser's Timberlands, Cellulose Fibers and Wood Products businesses. China's recent dramatic growth makes this market even more attractive to us. 
Last quarter, we discussed the positive effect of strong Chinese demand on our first quarter results, particularly in our Timberlands and Cellulose Fibers segments. Demand from China continued to be an important force in the markets early in the second quarter, but late in the quarter, there was a noticeable reduction in both price and volume. Some of this change shows up in our second quarter results and will affect our outlook for the third quarter. 
Despite this recent pullback, overall demand is still higher than a year ago, and we believe China will continue to be an important growing, long-term market for our products. 
Let me now turn to a discussion of business and company highlights for the quarter. Earnings from our Timberlands segment were stronger than anticipated as we took full advantage of the opportunity presented by strong demand from Asia. Harvest volume and prices were up from Q1 in response to strong export markets off the West Coast. Our logistically advantaged Western Timberlands allowed us to capitalize on these strong market conditions, resulting in a 31% increase in export volume from Q1. 
During the quarter, the Chinese share of our export volume increased to 26% compared to 15% one year ago. Although we are now seeing somewhat of a retreat in demand from China from the first quarter high, our Japan market continued strong even after the tragic earthquake and tsunami earlier this year. Our Japanese export business continues to benefit from our close, long-term customer relationships, our premium Douglas fir logs and a highly efficient supply chain. 
Despite continued operating improvements on our Wood Products business, our financial results were weaker than we expected, largely caused by continued softness in U.S. housing, which translated into overall decline in product prices. 
Sales volumes increased versus the first quarter across all major product lines even with a weak seasonal increase in housing starts. This allowed us to reduce inventory as we produced less than we sold in the quarter. Sales volume increases were offset by lower realizations in all products except engineered solid sections. In addition, log cost increased in the West. 
Though performance in this business is still below our expectations, we generated $23 million in cash as we began to work down the seasonal first quarter buildup in working capital. We continue to pull all levers to improve performance at today's low level of housing starts, including expanding our customer base into new geographies and markets outside of U.S. housing, while continuing a relentless focus on improving costs and utilization of our operating facilities. We remain focused on the goal of being cash positive in this business for the full year, but it will be challenging in these difficult markets. 
In WRECO, our homebuilding business, our performance in the quarter exceeded our expectations. Although traffic was down 15% year-over-year, our conversion rates have increased, and we continued to realize strong margins relative to our competitors. 4 of our 5 homebuilders increased sales year-over-year, and the business earned $8 million for the quarter. 
WRECO remains focused on the basics: cost, cash flow and delivering homes to highly satisfied customers. Our customer satisfaction scores, measured by willingness to refer, are among the highest in the industry at over 95% compared to industry averages of 86% to 90%. 
The primary story for the quarter in our Cellulose Fibers business is that we safely completed 4 planned annual maintenance shutdowns with 0 recordable incidents. With our scheduled annual maintenance now complete, we're positioned to run full for the balance of the year. 
Increased price realizations for the quarter were anticipated, as were the expenses related to our planned maintenance. Towards the end of the quarter, we saw some price softening due to a decline in demand from China, which resulted in financial results slightly less than expected. 
The decline in Chinese demand was especially evident in decreasing pricing relating to dissolving pulps and NBSK. This decline affected sales of our Pearl product, which is being used as a dissolving wood pulp extender. 
Finally, I want to address progress that we continue to make during the quarter to implement our strategic direction. During the quarter, we reached agreement to sell 2 nonstrategic businesses: our Hardwoods business and our Westwood Shipping Line. 
We have owned and operated these businesses for several decades, and as we assessed our future direction, we determined that neither were core to our ongoing strategy. By selling them to new owners, we will better be able to sharpen our own management focus on our long-term strategic direction. Both transactions are scheduled to close in the third quarter, so Patty will discuss more specifics in her outlook comments. 
Although we are selling these businesses, I'm pleased that we will continue our relationship with our long-term associates as the Hardwoods organization will continue to be a customer for our logs, and we will continue to ship products to our Asian customers on Westwood Shipping Lines. 
A final element of forward progress during the quarter was continued actions we took to strengthen our balance sheet and liquidity position by refinancing our credit facility, repaying our 2012 maturity notes and ending the quarter with a strong cash position.  
And now, I'll ask Patty to discuss our outlook and provide a financial summary, and then I'll provide a quick recap before we invite your questions. Patty?"

The outlook for the third quarter by business segment is summarized on Chart 11. I'll begin the outlook discussion with Timberlands. Slowing export demand from China is expected to result in lower sales realizati",908,"Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. The outlook for the third quarter by business segment is summarized on Chart 11. I'll begin the outlook discussion with Timberlands. 
Slowing export demand from China is expected to result in lower sales realizations and volumes in our Western operations. In addition, we expect domestic markets will continue to soften as sawmills take increased downtime in response to weakening lumber markets, also contributing to the falloff in volumes and prices.  
In the South, realizations for logs are expected to moderate only slightly as those markets did not experience the run-up in pricing during the second quarter that we saw in the West. Volumes may increase seasonally. We anticipate seasonal increases in cost for silviculture and road spending in the third quarter compared to the second. 
Earnings from nonstrategic land sales are anticipated to be much lower in the third quarter. Overall, we expect that earnings in the Timberlands segment will be significantly lower in the third quarter compared to the second. 
Average sales realizations in Wood Products are expected to be 3% to 4% lower for both lumber and OSB compared to the average for the second quarter as market trends reflect soft demand in most geographies. Realizations in engineered wood products are estimated to increase around 1% to 2%, reflecting a July 1 announced price increase. 
Sales volumes are expected to decrease across most product lines, although OSB volumes may increase somewhat. Log cost should decrease, especially in the West, and we expect to take more downtime in the third quarter in lumber due to weak market conditions as we continue to focus on matching supply with demand. We've already taken 6 weeks downtime in July compared to 3 weeks in Q2. 
Excluding the results of the Hardwood business, we expect overall operating results in our Wood Products segment to be comparable to the second quarter. 
In Cellulose Fibers, pulp sales realizations are expected to decrease as the pullback in demand from China continues. However, this should be partially offset by somewhat higher shipment volumes. 
We had completed all of our planned annual maintenance outages for 2011 by the end of the second quarter. As a result, we will have a significant improvement to maintenance cost and productivity. 
In addition, we expect lower cost for operating supplies and contract services, primarily related to the reduction in maintenance outages. We also anticipate slightly lower seasonal energy costs. 
Although market conditions have softened, we expect that earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment will increase significantly compared to the second quarter. 
Markets in our Real Estate segment continue to be very weak. While we do believe that markets have reached their bottom, we don't see any near-term catalyst that would overcome the continued lackluster job growth and low consumer confidence. 
Despite these market challenges, we expect closings to increase seasonally in the third quarter. We anticipate closings of over 500 in this quarter compared to 459 in the second quarter. Prices are expected to be flat to slightly lower due to mix, and margins should remain relatively strong at 20% to 22%. 
We expect slightly improved earnings in our Real Estate segment compared to the second quarter, and we have not assumed any land transactions in our third quarter outlook. 
Now I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments. During the second quarter, we used $551 million to retire debt, which was originally due in March of next year. This amount includes principal, interest and the premium paid on the early extinguishment. While this was a significant use of cash in the quarter, we anticipate an overall interest savings in excess of the premium by executing the May call.
In addition, we paid $30 million of regularly scheduled debt maturities in the quarter. We ended the second quarter with cash of over $880 million. Debt maturities for the next 5 years total just over $600 million, with $200 million due in 2012. 
Also in the second quarter, we replaced our bank credit facility, which was set to expire at the end of this year. The new facility has a 4-year term and retains the $1 billion of credit availability. We have no borrowings outstanding under this agreement, and so we have substantial liquidity and a strong balance sheet despite challenging market conditions. 
Capital expenditures for the first 6 months totaled just under $100 million, and we still estimate expenditures for the full year to be in the range of $250 million to $270 million. 
As we have previously disclosed, we estimate pension contributions this year for our Canadian plant of approximately $80 million, and most of this will be paid in the third quarter. 
As Dan discussed, we are scheduled to close the sales of our wood -- Hardwood and shipping businesses in the third quarter. We expect to receive total proceeds of approximately $160 million plus transfer of long-term lease obligations. Total proceeds for the Hardwoods business will be approximately $108 million, of which $25 million is a note receivable and the remainder in cash. 
In the third quarter, we will recognize a noncash pension charge of approximately $10 million to recognize amortization of previously deferred cost. 
Upon the sale of our shipping business, we anticipate cash proceeds of approximately $53 million, and we will book a pre-tax gain of approximately $45 million. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Dan for some closing comments, and I look forward to your questions. Dan?"

Before we turn to your questions, I want to make a few comments about the current demand for Timberland, since we often get questions from you about what we are seeing in the market. 
After several years of relatively quiet market conditions, we have seen increased interest from a wide range of investors in the South as well as the Pacific Northwest. Recent interest has come from what I consider to be traditional timberland investors, including other forest products companies, TIMOs and high net worth family interests. This year, we've also seen interest from a variety of conservation-oriented investment funds. 
We are routinely engaged in smaller timberland transactions, normally structured as exchanges, through which we are working to improve our overall returns by blocking up land adjacent to existing ownership where we can benefit from management efficiencies. In the case of the Pacific Northwest, we're continuing a long-term strategy of shifting our ownership to land best suited for Douglas fir. 
Our sales of non-strategic coastal properties over the last few years is a result of our strategy in the Northwest of moving out of land that was primarily hemlock and expanding our Douglas fir ownership. As an example, earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of approximately 6,300 acres of prime Douglas fir timberland in Washington that is adjacent to our own logistically advantaged holdings using exchange proceeds from the sale of nonstrategic acreage in Arkansas that closed in the second quarter. 
We've described our long-term strategy to target profitable growth in our Timberland holdings, and we'll continue to explore opportunities to leverage our Timberland's management expertise to add shareholder value. 
And now, we welcome your questions."

As we've evaluated that business over the last 12 to 18 months, especially in this continued downturn in housing, we have decided to take on some additional third-party distribution and sale of the products that are related to new home construction, where we can improve our efficiencies and logistics in selling those products out of those yards, where we can put them on a truck. It's already going to a job site with our engineered wood products, and it will make a contribution against our fixed cost and help to improve the margins in that business. And so what you observed is an evolution where we used to distribute a number of third-party products.

In the case of our export log business, we were able to make most of our shipments during the quarter. And so it's more of a prospective change both in volume and the anticipated price. So we've seen some price drops for logs that are being exported. Most of that will start to be evident in the third quarter. In our Cellulose Fibers business, the most dramatic change occurred with our Pearl product. That is small tonnage for us but has been very high margin. And what happened there, it was really early June that Chinese government fundamentally started to tighten credit for businesses in China. They cut back purchases. We think that's a shorter-term phenomenon, but it's playing out in the third quarter forecast that Kathy provided. So the good news, let me -- just talking about Pearl a little bit. That's a product that we make by swinging production from our normal fluff production. And so it's not a dedicated facility to the extent that prices fall back, there's still an attractive margin, but we can swing that volume back to fluff, which is a big advantage for us. So we are opportunistically taking advantage of pricing opportunities in that product, but we have plenty of demand for our fluff production."

We had targeted that we would be cash breakeven for the year. Our focus is to continue to reach that goal, but in the market that we find ourselves, that will be very challenging. But our Wood Products business, the focus is to generate cash and to improve margins and to improve revenues. In our homebuilding business, our focus has been to generate cash through normal operations of building homes. Plus we are an opportunistic seller of land and lots to other builders. We've had some success in doing so. And we expect that activity to continue as the housing market starts to recover, and many builders will find themselves being land short. And they will need to purchase lots, and we'll have some to sell them. In our Timberlands business, we do generate significant cash there. And what we would be looking at in our Timberlands business is some market recovery, especially in the South. In the West, we benefited in cash flow because of the run-up in prices coming from the export markets. As we mentioned, that's softer now, but we would expect that to recover. China will continue to be a strong buyer of products off the West Coast, and we'll be ready to supply them. And then our Cellulose Fibers business, we have been on a relatively steady capital spend, where we're improving our facilities. Those spending initiatives have been bringing down our cash reduction cost. They have been reducing longer-term or maintenance cost, and so we will be better positioned to generate cash in the future because of those. So to your question, what is our focus, it's all of those."

Strongest markets within WRECO have been Washington D.C. and Houston, and it's no secret why that is. It's because they have relatively strong employment. Washington D.C. went into the downturn earlier. It's come out ahead of some of the other markets. There's not a significant overbuild of inventory. Volumes are not what they used to be, but prices are recovering, and we're actually seeing some incremental improvement in price. Houston is an energy economy, and so they've come through this market in relatively good shape. We're seeing improved activity on our Trendmaker operation, both from our routine activity with our Trendmaker Homes, plus we have some product enhancements and extensions that have helped us to increase market share and increase volume. Phoenix is a market that's actually showing some growth now. And it -- once again, it's an employment story. Relatively strong employment, our activity is up in Phoenix, and we're starting to see some improvements in margins in that market. In Southern California, we've enjoyed, during the downturn, relatively steady demand in San Diego, and we've had high margins in San Diego because of our historic land position. That continues to be the case. Market's a little bit softer than it was 6 months in -- 6 months ago in San Diego, but that's more of a relative comment. We're seeing some improvement in the Pacific Northwest, which had been soft for a period of time, and that's, once again, related to job growth. So relatively more improved job picture in the Pacific Northwest related to the Boeing airplane company and their ramp up in production plus other new employment. In Las Vegas, we're still struggling. It's a tough market, but the inventory is being worked down, and we are starting to see some improvement in that market. And then the last submarket is the L.A. and the Inland Empire. I think we're doing better than others in the Inland Empire, and we're expecting that market to pick up a bit. So it is a slower recovery than what we had anticipated, Gail, but we're seeing some positive movements. And as we talked and I mentioned in my comments, we had -- 4 of our 5 homebuilders had greater sales in the quarter than they did a year ago, and one year ago, we had the housing tax credit. So that's good news. The market where we did not see improvement was Southern California and Las Vegas. And so that's the one that is our big engine, and we need to see some improvement in order to see a real significant pickup in the WRECO activity. But we've been pleased that WRECO were profitable. Our results, generally, are better than those of our peers, and as Patty mentioned, we're expecting a bit of improvement in the third quarter."

When we went into the year, we were expecting 2011 to be somewhat of a mirror image of 2010. 2010 had a strong first half, a very weak second half. We were expecting a weak first half of 2011 with improvement in the second half of the year. At this point, we're not expecting to see significant improvement in the back half. And so we're planning for that, and we're focused on recovery starting to take shape in 2012. We do need to see improved consumer confidence. We need to see improved employment.

There has been some additional supply that's come on with Domtar at Plymouth and the Alabama pine facility. That's had some impact in putting more product on the market. On the other hand, the fluff market continues to grow globally. And all of our large customers are concerned about maintaining supply because they have ambitious growth plans.

We have, over time, looked at all of the technologies that are out there and have determined at this point that we will form more relationships with those like KiOR that bring in some unique technology. Weyerhaeuser's role in that relationship will be providing biomass. Chevron's role will be to take away the product that would be manufactured or refined by the KiORs.

Please review the warning statement in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call.
Joining me this morning are Dan Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patty Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported Q2 2011 net earnings of $10 million or $0.02 per diluted share on net sales of $1.8 billion. Second quarter earnings include after-tax charges of $22 million for special items, $16 million for loss on the early extinguishment of debt and an impairment charge of $6 million for the expected sale of the Hardwoods business. 
The company's cash balance decreased $582 million primarily due to debt repayment. At the end of the second quarter, Weyerhaeuser's cash and cash equivalents was $181 million (sic) [$881 million]. 
Please turn to the earnings information package available on our website. This package includes the GAAP reconciliation of special items. In our discussion of the business segments, we will refer to Charts 4 through 10. 
Chart 4, changes in contribution to earnings by segment before special items. This chart illustrates the change in contribution by business segments from first quarter 2011 to second quarter 2011. My comments reviewing the second quarter refer to changes from first quarter unless otherwise noted. 
We begin our business segment discussion of the second quarter with Timberlands, Charts 5 and 6. In the second quarter, Timberlands contributed $112 million to pre-tax earnings, $23 million more than first quarter. Pre-tax earnings of -- were $89 million in the first quarter before special items. Average third-party price realizations rose 9% in the West, driven by Chinese demand. Southern third-party price realizations were flat in the quarter. 
Fee harvest volumes increased 8%. This increase was in part due to Chinese demand for logs. Export volume increased 31% from first quarter. Costs were higher in the West due to roads and diesel. Higher diesel cost also affected the South. Nonstrategic land dispositions were $34 million in second quarter. 
Wood Products, Charts 7 and 8. Excluding a $9 million charge for the expected sale of the Hardwoods business, the Wood Products loss widened by $16 million in the second quarter to a loss of $52 million. In Q1, Wood Products lost $36 million. 
Lumber price realizations declined 5% or $14 per thousand board feet. Oriented strand board prices fell 7% or $14 per thousand square feet. TJI sales realizations were 1% lower than last quarter, and solid section realizations were 3% higher. Sales volumes increased across all product lines except plywood, partially offsetting lower selling prices and higher cost. 
Cellulose Fibers, Chart 9. Cellulose Fibers contributed $80 million to pre-tax earnings in Q2. This was $6 million less than Q1 pre-tax earnings of $86 million. There were 4 scheduled maintenance outages in the quarter compared with the 2 in the first quarter. The annual mill maintenance schedule has been completed for the year. Maintenance costs were $18 million higher due to the annual outages, and pulp production was 6% lower. Pulp price realizations increased $48 per air-dried metric ton or 5%. Pulp sales volume decreased 2% due to weakening demand from China. 
Real Estate, Chart 10. Second quarter pre-tax earnings for WRECO was $8 million, a $9 million increase in the contribution to earnings. In the first quarter, WRECO had a pre-tax loss of $1 million. Closings of single-family homes seasonally increased 26% from 363 units in the first quarter to 459 units in the second quarter. However, closings declined 27% from the year ago quarter. Last year's second quarter benefited from the housing tax credits. 
Average single-family prices declined 7% from $419,000 to $391,000 due to mix. Gross margins increased to 22.4% from 21.7% in the first quarter. The backlog of single-family homes sold but not closed increased to 673 homes. 
And finally, Corporate and Other. Before special items, Corporate and Other contributed $19 million more to earnings in Q2. Corporate and Other includes net pre-tax charges of $11 million related to discontinued operations. This includes operating earnings of $2 million for Westwood Shipping Lines and charges of $13 million for other discontinued operations, primarily in environmental remediation reserve for a previously divested facility. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Dan Fulton."

Thanks, Kathy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Despite continued weakness in U.S. housing and the overall U.S. economy, we continue to make progress against our goal of delivering superior sustainable returns for our shareholders. 
In addition to focusing on improving operating performance, we took steps in the quarter that strengthened our balance sheet and liquidity and announced 2 divestments of nonstrategic assets. Our overall financial performance is not where it needs to be, and we remain focused on those variables we can control to improve performance in today's difficult markets. 
In my remarks this morning, I want to provide some context related to broader macroeconomic conditions that affect our results, in particular U.S. housing conditions and demand from China. Then I'll discuss highlights of our quarterly progress in each business segment and key strategic goals before turning to Patty, who will cover our outlook for the third quarter plus financial comments. 
Conditions in the U.S. housing market continue to be weak. Growth in GDP, employment and consumer confidence are all necessary for a housing recovery, and unfortunately, we saw little progress during the quarter on any of those indicators. 
GDP growth was less than 2% for the quarter, slightly worse than the first quarter and weaker than expected. Employment growth has stalled as evidenced by the recent June figures of over 9% unemployment. Consumer confidence remains weak, affected by high unemployment, increasing gas and food prices and the budget deficit debate. 
Facing these headwinds, we find ourselves in a housing market that is no better than last year's very weak market. In light of continued sluggish conditions, 2011 estimates for single-family starts have decreased to fewer than 500,000, and forecasters are now pushing the beginning of the housing recovery out to 2012. 
Although we faced challenging near-term market conditions, we continue to be bullish on housing demand over the longer term as the U.S. returns to trend demand levels. We're well positioned to take full advantage of the housing recovery in the U.S. as well as to build on our unique strengths to participate in the growth of global markets. 
As I've discussed before, Asia has long been an important market for Weyerhaeuser's Timberlands, Cellulose Fibers and Wood Products businesses. China's recent dramatic growth makes this market even more attractive to us. 
Last quarter, we discussed the positive effect of strong Chinese demand on our first quarter results, particularly in our Timberlands and Cellulose Fibers segments. Demand from China continued to be an important force in the markets early in the second quarter, but late in the quarter, there was a noticeable reduction in both price and volume. Some of this change shows up in our second quarter results and will affect our outlook for the third quarter. 
Despite this recent pullback, overall demand is still higher than a year ago, and we believe China will continue to be an important growing, long-term market for our products. 
Let me now turn to a discussion of business and company highlights for the quarter. Earnings from our Timberlands segment were stronger than anticipated as we took full advantage of the opportunity presented by strong demand from Asia. Harvest volume and prices were up from Q1 in response to strong export markets off the West Coast. Our logistically advantaged Western Timberlands allowed us to capitalize on these strong market conditions, resulting in a 31% increase in export volume from Q1. 
During the quarter, the Chinese share of our export volume increased to 26% compared to 15% one year ago. Although we are now seeing somewhat of a retreat in demand from China from the first quarter high, our Japan market continued strong even after the tragic earthquake and tsunami earlier this year. Our Japanese export business continues to benefit from our close, long-term customer relationships, our premium Douglas fir logs and a highly efficient supply chain. 
Despite continued operating improvements on our Wood Products business, our financial results were weaker than we expected, largely caused by continued softness in U.S. housing, which translated into overall decline in product prices. 
Sales volumes increased versus the first quarter across all major product lines even with a weak seasonal increase in housing starts. This allowed us to reduce inventory as we produced less than we sold in the quarter. Sales volume increases were offset by lower realizations in all products except engineered solid sections. In addition, log cost increased in the West. 
Though performance in this business is still below our expectations, we generated $23 million in cash as we began to work down the seasonal first quarter buildup in working capital. We continue to pull all levers to improve performance at today's low level of housing starts, including expanding our customer base into new geographies and markets outside of U.S. housing, while continuing a relentless focus on improving costs and utilization of our operating facilities. We remain focused on the goal of being cash positive in this business for the full year, but it will be challenging in these difficult markets. 
In WRECO, our homebuilding business, our performance in the quarter exceeded our expectations. Although traffic was down 15% year-over-year, our conversion rates have increased, and we continued to realize strong margins relative to our competitors. 4 of our 5 homebuilders increased sales year-over-year, and the business earned $8 million for the quarter. 
WRECO remains focused on the basics: cost, cash flow and delivering homes to highly satisfied customers. Our customer satisfaction scores, measured by willingness to refer, are among the highest in the industry at over 95% compared to industry averages of 86% to 90%. 
The primary story for the quarter in our Cellulose Fibers business is that we safely completed 4 planned annual maintenance shutdowns with 0 recordable incidents. With our scheduled annual maintenance now complete, we're positioned to run full for the balance of the year. 
Increased price realizations for the quarter were anticipated, as were the expenses related to our planned maintenance. Towards the end of the quarter, we saw some price softening due to a decline in demand from China, which resulted in financial results slightly less than expected. 
The decline in Chinese demand was especially evident in decreasing pricing relating to dissolving pulps and NBSK. This decline affected sales of our Pearl product, which is being used as a dissolving wood pulp extender. 
Finally, I want to address progress that we continue to make during the quarter to implement our strategic direction. During the quarter, we reached agreement to sell 2 nonstrategic businesses: our Hardwoods business and our Westwood Shipping Line. 
We have owned and operated these businesses for several decades, and as we assessed our future direction, we determined that neither were core to our ongoing strategy. By selling them to new owners, we will better be able to sharpen our own management focus on our long-term strategic direction. Both transactions are scheduled to close in the third quarter, so Patty will discuss more specifics in her outlook comments. 
Although we are selling these businesses, I'm pleased that we will continue our relationship with our long-term associates as the Hardwoods organization will continue to be a customer for our logs, and we will continue to ship products to our Asian customers on Westwood Shipping Lines. 
A final element of forward progress during the quarter was continued actions we took to strengthen our balance sheet and liquidity position by refinancing our credit facility, repaying our 2012 maturity notes and ending the quarter with a strong cash position.  
And now, I'll ask Patty to discuss our outlook and provide a financial summary, and then I'll provide a quick recap before we invite your questions. Patty?"
107633,137331697,149234,"Weyerhaeuser Co., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2011",2011-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Weyerhaeuser Company","Executives","Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone.

Slowing export demand from China is expected to result in lower sales realizati",908,"Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. The outlook for the third quarter by business segment is summarized on Chart 11. I'll begin the outlook discussion with Timberlands. 
Slowing export demand from China is expected to result in lower sales realizations and volumes in our Western operations. In addition, we expect domestic markets will continue to soften as sawmills take increased downtime in response to weakening lumber markets, also contributing to the falloff in volumes and prices.  
In the South, realizations for logs are expected to moderate only slightly as those markets did not experience the run-up in pricing during the second quarter that we saw in the West. Volumes may increase seasonally. We anticipate seasonal increases in cost for silviculture and road spending in the third quarter compared to the second. 
Earnings from nonstrategic land sales are anticipated to be much lower in the third quarter. Overall, we expect that earnings in the Timberlands segment will be significantly lower in the third quarter compared to the second. 
Average sales realizations in Wood Products are expected to be 3% to 4% lower for both lumber and OSB compared to the average for the second quarter as market trends reflect soft demand in most geographies. Realizations in engineered wood products are estimated to increase around 1% to 2%, reflecting a July 1 announced price increase. 
Sales volumes are expected to decrease across most product lines, although OSB volumes may increase somewhat. Log cost should decrease, especially in the West, and we expect to take more downtime in the third quarter in lumber due to weak market conditions as we continue to focus on matching supply with demand. We've already taken 6 weeks downtime in July compared to 3 weeks in Q2. 
Excluding the results of the Hardwood business, we expect overall operating results in our Wood Products segment to be comparable to the second quarter. 
In Cellulose Fibers, pulp sales realizations are expected to decrease as the pullback in demand from China continues. However, this should be partially offset by somewhat higher shipment volumes. 
We had completed all of our planned annual maintenance outages for 2011 by the end of the second quarter. As a result, we will have a significant improvement to maintenance cost and productivity. 
In addition, we expect lower cost for operating supplies and contract services, primarily related to the reduction in maintenance outages. We also anticipate slightly lower seasonal energy costs. 
Although market conditions have softened, we expect that earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment will increase significantly compared to the second quarter. 
Markets in our Real Estate segment continue to be very weak. While we do believe that markets have reached their bottom, we don't see any near-term catalyst that would overcome the continued lackluster job growth and low consumer confidence. 
Despite these market challenges, we expect closings to increase seasonally in the third quarter. We anticipate closings of over 500 in this quarter compared to 459 in the second quarter. Prices are expected to be flat to slightly lower due to mix, and margins should remain relatively strong at 20% to 22%. 
We expect slightly improved earnings in our Real Estate segment compared to the second quarter, and we have not assumed any land transactions in our third quarter outlook. 
Now I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments. During the second quarter, we used $551 million to retire debt, which was originally due in March of next year. This amount includes principal, interest and the premium paid on the early extinguishment. While this was a significant use of cash in the quarter, we anticipate an overall interest savings in excess of the premium by executing the May call.
In addition, we paid $30 million of regularly scheduled debt maturities in the quarter. We ended the second quarter with cash of over $880 million. Debt maturities for the next 5 years total just over $600 million, with $200 million due in 2012. 
Also in the second quarter, we replaced our bank credit facility, which was set to expire at the end of this year. The new facility has a 4-year term and retains the $1 billion of credit availability. We have no borrowings outstanding under this agreement, and so we have substantial liquidity and a strong balance sheet despite challenging market conditions. 
Capital expenditures for the first 6 months totaled just under $100 million, and we still estimate expenditures for the full year to be in the range of $250 million to $270 million. 
As we have previously disclosed, we estimate pension contributions this year for our Canadian plant of approximately $80 million, and most of this will be paid in the third quarter. 
As Dan discussed, we are scheduled to close the sales of our wood -- Hardwood and shipping businesses in the third quarter. We expect to receive total proceeds of approximately $160 million plus transfer of long-term lease obligations. Total proceeds for the Hardwoods business will be approximately $108 million, of which $25 million is a note receivable and the remainder in cash. 
In the third quarter, we will recognize a noncash pension charge of approximately $10 million to recognize amortization of previously deferred cost. 
Upon the sale of our shipping business, we anticipate cash proceeds of approximately $53 million, and we will book a pre-tax gain of approximately $45 million. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Dan for some closing comments, and I look forward to your questions. Dan?"

Recent interest has come from what I consider to be traditional timberland investors, including other forest products companies, TIMOs and high net worth family interests. This year, we've also seen interest from a variety of conservation-oriented investment funds. 
We are routinely engaged in smaller timberland transactions, normally structured as exchanges, through which we are working to improve our overall returns by blocking up land adjacent to existing ownership where we can benefit from management efficiencies. In the case of the Pacific Northwest, we're continuing a long-term strategy of shifting our ownership to land best suited for Douglas fir. 
Our sales of non-strategic coastal properties over the last few years is a result of our strategy in the Northwest of moving out of land that was primarily hemlock and expanding our Douglas fir ownership. As an example, earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of approximately 6,300 acres of prime Douglas fir timberland in Washington that is adjacent to our own logistically advantaged holdings using exchange proceeds from the sale of nonstrategic acreage in Arkansas that closed in the second quarter. 
We've described our long-term strategy to target profitable growth in our Timberland holdings, and we'll continue to explore opportunities to leverage our Timberland's management expertise to add shareholder value. 
And now, we welcome your questions."

And as we set up our eye-level strategy and brought all of the businesses under that brand, we turned it into more of a channel market, as you note. And fundamentally, it's been a channel for our engineered wood products business. As we've evaluated that business over the last 12 to 18 months, especially in this continued downturn in housing, we have decided to take on some additional third-party distribution and sale of the products that are related to new home construction, where we can improve our efficiencies and logistics in selling those products out of those yards, where we can put them on a truck. It's already going to a job site with our engineered wood products, and it will make a contribution against our fixed cost and help to improve the margins in that business. And so what you observed is an evolution where we used to distribute a number of third-party products.

We had targeted that we would be cash breakeven for the year. Our focus is to continue to reach that goal, but in the market that we find ourselves, that will be very challenging. But our Wood Products business, the focus is to generate cash and to improve margins and to improve revenues. In our homebuilding business, our focus has been to generate cash through normal operations of building homes. Plus we are an opportunistic seller of land and lots to other builders. We've had some success in doing so. And we expect that activity to continue as the housing market starts to recover, and many builders will find themselves being land short. And they will need to purchase lots, and we'll have some to sell them. In our Timberlands business, we do generate significant cash there. And what we would be looking at in our Timberlands business is some market recovery, especially in the South. In the West, we benefited in cash flow because of the run-up in prices coming from the export markets. As we mentioned, that's softer now, but we would expect that to recover. China will continue to be a strong buyer of products off the West Coast, and we'll be ready to supply them. And then our Cellulose Fibers business, we have been on a relatively steady capital spend, where we're improving our facilities.

They have been reducing longer-term or maintenance cost, and so we will be better positioned to generate cash in the future because of those.

Strongest markets within WRECO have been Washington D.C. and Houston, and it's no secret why that is. It's because they have relatively strong employment. Washington D.C. went into the downturn earlier. It's come out ahead of some of the other markets. There's not a significant overbuild of inventory. Volumes are not what they used to be, but prices are recovering, and we're actually seeing some incremental improvement in price. Houston is an energy economy, and so they've come through this market in relatively good shape. We're seeing improved activity on our Trendmaker operation, both from our routine activity with our Trendmaker Homes, plus we have some product enhancements and extensions that have helped us to increase market share and increase volume. Phoenix is a market that's actually showing some growth now. And it -- once again, it's an employment story. Relatively strong employment, our activity is up in Phoenix, and we're starting to see some improvements in margins in that market. In Southern California, we've enjoyed, during the downturn, relatively steady demand in San Diego, and we've had high margins in San Diego because of our historic land position. That continues to be the case. Market's a little bit softer than it was 6 months in -- 6 months ago in San Diego, but that's more of a relative comment. We're seeing some improvement in the Pacific Northwest, which had been soft for a period of time, and that's, once again, related to job growth. So relatively more improved job picture in the Pacific Northwest related to the Boeing airplane company and their ramp up in production plus other new employment. In Las Vegas, we're still struggling. It's a tough market, but the inventory is being worked down, and we are starting to see some improvement in that market. And then the last submarket is the L.A. and the Inland Empire. I think we're doing better than others in the Inland Empire, and we're expecting that market to pick up a bit. So it is a slower recovery than what we had anticipated, Gail, but we're seeing some positive movements. And as we talked and I mentioned in my comments, we had -- 4 of our 5 homebuilders had greater sales in the quarter than they did a year ago, and one year ago, we had the housing tax credit. So that's good news. The market where we did not see improvement was Southern California and Las Vegas. And so that's the one that is our big engine, and we need to see some improvement in order to see a real significant pickup in the WRECO activity. But we've been pleased that WRECO were profitable. Our results, generally, are better than those of our peers, and as Patty mentioned, we're expecting a bit of improvement in the third quarter."

Just to give you a range, Gail, in 2012, we have outside forecast that ranged from total housing starts of 630,000 to over 1 million. So there is a wide range of uncertainty related to 2012. We are planning conservatively on the low side and sizing our operation for a slower market, but we -- because of our land position, we're able to respond relatively quickly if we have market opportunity. So we're focused on maintaining margin. We're not chasing volume, but all of the forecast that I see, which suggests that we are expecting to see recovery to start in 2012, clearly didn't happen in 2011. When we went into the year, we were expecting 2011 to be somewhat of a mirror image of 2010. 2010 had a strong first half, a very weak second half. We were expecting a weak first half of 2011 with improvement in the second half of the year. At this point, we're not expecting to see significant improvement in the back half. And so we're planning for that, and we're focused on recovery starting to take shape in 2012. We do need to see improved consumer confidence. We need to see improved employment. And longer term, we need to have a resolution of the mortgage securities market, in particular, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac."

In terms of fluff prices, Patty provided our forecast for the third quarter in terms of what we're seeing directionally. There has been some additional supply that's come on with Domtar at Plymouth and the Alabama pine facility. That's had some impact in putting more product on the market. On the other hand, the fluff market continues to grow globally. And all of our large customers are concerned about maintaining supply because they have ambitious growth plans. And so longer term, we're really positive about fluff.  And then we have some fluff capacity that's been shipped to dissolving pulp, and so we see the market stabilizing."

We have, over time, looked at all of the technologies that are out there and have determined at this point that we will form more relationships with those like KiOR that bring in some unique technology. Weyerhaeuser's role in that relationship will be providing biomass. Chevron's role will be to take away the product that would be manufactured or refined by the KiORs. Because ultimately, the challenge in this business is you have to distribute it to get it to an end user. And so the strengths of our partnership are that we, better than anyone, I think, understand the upstream challenges and opportunities. Chevron covers the downstream, and we are likely to be entering into a number of agreements in what we would call a wraparound strategy, where we have the opportunity to work with those that have a variety of technologies.

Joining me this morning are Dan Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patty Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported third quarter 2011 net earnings of $157 million or $0.29 per diluted share on net sales from continuing operations of $1.6 billion. Earnings for the third quarter include after-tax gains of $91 million from special items. These items include a benefit of $83 million or $0.15 per diluted share related to foreign tax credits. A gain of $32 million or $0.06 per diluted share on disposition, a charge of $24 million or $0.04 per diluted share for impairments of restructuring in Wood Products. Excluding these items, the company reported net earnings of $66 million or $0.12 per diluted share. Please turn to the earnings information package available on our website. This package includes a got for cancellation of the special items. In a discussion of the business segments, I will refer to Charts 4 through 10.
Chart 4, changes in contribution to earnings by segment before special items. This chart illustrates the change in contribution by business segments from second quarter 2011 to third quarter 2011. My comments reviewing the third quarter refer to changes from the second quarter unless otherwise noted.
We begin our business segment discussion of the third quarter with Timberlands, Charts 5 and 6. In the third quarter, Timberlands contributed $62 million to pretax earnings, $50 million less than in Q2. $28 million of the decrease was the result of lower earnings from nonstrategic land sales. Third quarter land disposition were $4 million compared to $32 million in the second quarter. Average third-party price realization in the West declined 5%, as the weakening Chinese market exerted downward pressure on domestic and export prices. In the south, average third-party price realizations declined slightly. De harvest volumes were flat in the quarter, volumes were down in the West as the Chinese export markets softened volumes, rose in the South. Cost received nearly higher. These increases were due to road construction in the West and silviculture spending in the South. Wood Products, Chart 7 and 8. Continuing operations in Wood Products lost $43 million, $10 million less than second quarter. Lumber price realizations were flat, press utilization is always be and engineered solid sections declined slightly, engineered price realizations rose slightly. Operating rates in Q3 were flat in lumber, improved in OSP and was slightly lower in engineered wood products. Restructuring and impairment charges were $38 million, primarily related to the permit closure of 4 previously idled engineered Wood Products facility. This was offset by $5 million gain on the sale of properties. Charges related to the sale of discontinued operations were $13 million in Q3. Cellulose fibers, Chart 9. Third quarter Cellulose Fibers' pretax contributions earnings was $135 million, $55 million higher than second quarter. Average pulp prices sales realizations declined 4% or $40 per metric ton. Pulp sales volumes were flat. Maintenance cost was lower and pulp production increased 13%. There were no maintenance outages during the third quarter. There were 4 scheduled annual maintenance outages in the second quarter. Real Estate, Chart 10. Real estate contributed $10 million to pretax earnings, $2 million more than second quarter. Single-family closings increased seasonally from 459 homes in Q2 to 508 homes in Q3. The average price on homes closed during the quarter increased $12,000 to $403,000. This increase was due to mix. Margins on single-family homes closed, also increased due to mix. Corporate and Other. Excluding discontinued operations, Corporate and Other was $5 million lower in Q3. Foreign exchange charges, primarily related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, reduced Corporate and Other by $18 million. This was partially offset by $7 million of additional gains related to share-based compensation. A decline in the company's stock price during the quarter resulted in a larger mark-to-market adjustment. Discontinued operations included a loss from operations of $4 million and gains of $58 million on the sale of Westwood and properties in the third quarter. Discontinued operations had a charge of $11 million in second quarter. I'll now turn the call over to Dan Fulton. Dan?"

Thanks for joining us today. Despite a more challenging macroeconomic environment than we anticipated just 3 months ago, I'm pleased to report that our quarterly performance improved as increased earnings from 3",1855,"Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Despite a more challenging macroeconomic environment than we anticipated just 3 months ago, I'm pleased to report that our quarterly performance improved as increased earnings from 3 of our 4 businesses offset an anticipated earnings decline in our Timberlands business. In addition to overall factors affecting the U.S. and world economies, the 2 most significant external factors affecting our quarterly performance are the same as they were last quarter, U.S. housing and China. I'd like to comment on this overall themes first but I'll discuss activity in each of our businesses during the quarter. Following my remarks, Kathy will provide our business outlook on the fourth quarter, as well as financial comments. First, let me talk about housing. 3 of our 4 businesses, Timberlands, Wood Products Real Estate, are impacted in varying degrees by current conditions in the U.S. housing market, which I described in this morning's release as languishing. As we entered 2011, our planning assumption was that U.S. single-family housing starts will total 525,000 for the year, which would have been a modest increase over 2010 construction levels. As we sit today in late October, we currently estimate that will end the year at a level of about 425,000, approximately 20% below that planning assumption. Long-term demographics continue to be compelling, but prospective homebuyers today exhibit little sense of urgency. This is a result of the lack of consumer confidence, continued high unemployment rates, concerned about potential downward price was related to an overhang of foreclosed homes and a desire to maintain employment mobility. One last factor affecting home sales as interest rates. Because of German Burnett statements, the market now expects mortgage rates to remain low for an extended period of time. And while lower rates are generally a positive for home sales, the expectation of continued low rates give buyers yet another reason to put off a purchase decision. Once a purchase agreement has been signed, perspective buyers face an increasingly difficult mortgage underwriting process that causes many motivated and qualified buyers to move back to the sidelines and wait. Our political climate has only added to uncertainty and we see little evidence of this point that conditions will improve next year's spring selling season. The glass half full side of me nevertheless see some good news on the housing front. First, although we generally don't highlight conditions in Canada, housing activity in other border has been relatively stable at about 185,000 starts for the year. We produced for this healthy housing market through our lumber, OSB and engineered wood products mills, several of which are located in Canada. Our Canadian Mills also serve export markets am a particularly off the West Coast. Second, although U.S. single-family housing starts are stagnant, multifamily rental construction is relatively strong in response to low vacancy rates and rapidly increasing rents. Rental units are generally smaller than single-family homes. But for the most part, there are wood frame construction and use the full range of wood products that we produce, lumber, OSB and engineered wood. That's good news for our Wood Products and our Timberlands. Third, inventory levels of new homes have been all-time low, so any pickup in new homes sales will quickly lead to increased construction activity. Although our forward planning assumptions are based upon today's levels of starts, we had the ability to flex all of our operations as markets improve, homebuilding, Wood Products manufacturing and in the woods. Let me turn now to China before I provide some specific comments about quarterly performance in each of our business segments. Growth in China affects 3 of our businesses, Timberlands, Wood Products and Cellulose Fibers. We have long-term experience selling products to China. Today, we sell logs, lumber and Cellulose Fibers to a range of Chinese customers. And although Japan has long been our primary agent export market, sales to China has increased significantly over the past 24 months. On the last quarter's call, and that we were beginning to see some pull back in both price and volume from China. Those were early indications of softness were realized in the third quarter as credit tightened and demand slowed. Our view is that the slowdown is temporary and we expect Chinese demand to return to continue to grow over the longer term. In the meantime, we should expect a greater level of volatility than in our more traditional markets. I'll begin my discussion of business and company highlights for the quarter with Timberlands. During the quarter, the impact of slowing Chinese demand led to price declines. Volumes were relatively steady but the fall off in Chinese log prices had a ripple effect on the entire Western log market. Export activity from our Western Timberlands during the quarter was 40% of total volume, split among Japan, China and Korea. Our ability to access export markets from the Western lands has long been a significant source of revenue and competitive strength and reduces somewhat our reliance on the U.S. housing market. During the quarter, we made some progress towards additional market diversification from our other Timberlands. We tested sales of southern yellow pine logs the from the U.S. South to Turkey and pine logs from Uruguay to China. These sales a significance compared to our long-term West Coast Asian markets but they're step in the right direction. Turning to land transactions the $28 million quarterly decrease in Timberland dispositions, which was due to a transaction timing negatively affected quarter-over-quarter Timberland earnings. Our minerals business remained a steady performer during the quarter, contributing approximately $15 million. We continue to receive royalties from hard minerals and from our oil and gas properties. These include both our Haynesville gas shale acreage -- shale gas acreage in North losing Louisiana and bonuses from new leases with shale oil potential in the Tuscaloosa Merwin shale play across the Southern Louisiana. In our Wood Products business, our initiatives to lower costs and improve performance are beginning to show results. Even with weaker market conditions, our EBIT before special items improved $10 million over the quarter and $59 million over the prior year. As we enter the year, I told you that it was my expectation that our Wood Products segment would be cash positive for the year based upon our housing construction forecast. The business was cash negative during the first quarter due to a seasonal buildup in working capital, but we were cash positive in the second quarter and in the third quarter as we continue to reduce working capital. Given the downturn in housing that we've experienced, it is unlikely that we'll meet our cash breakeven objective for the year but we're making progress and it continues to be our focus as part of our return to profitability in this segment. We are pushing all leverage available to us to improve our performance in Wood Products, focusing on revenue enhancements, as well as cost reductions. As in our Timberlands business and Wood Products, we continue to find opportunities to diversify our sales outside North America, especially from our Canadian mills. Export represents 38% of our Canadian lumber volume. Japan is our largest export market with over 60% of export sales, shipments to China have nearly tripled this year. I noted earlier that we're well positioned in all of our Wood Products to meet the growing activity in multifamily construction and we're focused on growing share where we have competitive advantage based upon other products and our geography. I'm impatient but encouraged with our progress. This morning, we made the decision to permanently close our 4 previously curtailed engineered Wood Products facilities, LBL facilities in Albany, Oregon and Louisiana and the new facilities in Pine Hill, Alabama and Dodson, Louisiana. This is another step in reducing the costs associated with closed facilities that we concluded we will not need in the future based upon the pace of the housing recovery. In our Real Estate segment, we turned in another profitable quarter on the strength of our single-family operations. During the second half of the year, when we normally have increased closing activity, closings were up 11% over the prior quarter while margins increased slightly due to mix. Although traffic during the quarter declined 27% year-over-year, sales increased 5%, as we continued to experience higher conversion rates. Local market conditions are mixed. Our most active markets are Houston and the Maryland and Virginia suburbs of Washington D.C. Our weakest markets are Southern California and Las Vegas. The most significant indicator of market strength today is employment. To give you a little local flavor, in Phoenix, where single-family permits are down 19% year-over-year, our sales are up 42%. The longer-term goodness for Phoenix is that job growth will approach 2% in 2011 and the existing home market is remarkably strong, on track to exceed 95,000 transactions compared with the prior peak of 92,000 in 2006. In Houston where home prices are stable, new home sales are down 30% from last year but our sales increased 21%. Similarly in Washington D.C., new home sales activity is 20% lower than a year ago while our sales are up 23%. Turning our Cellulose Fibers segment. We continue to run well and had no plan maintenance downtime. Revenue declined somewhat during the quarter, due to price as well as mix. Even with pressure from declining realizations, the overall business result was a significant quarter-over-quarter earnings improvement. I want to comment on progress on 2 other initiatives at our Cellulose Fibers fiber segment. Both are examples of executing our strategy to grow with key global customers and to make disciplined investment to improve productivity of our mills. In early August, we broke ground on our new modified fiber facility in Gdansk, Poland. Upon completion and estimated start up in early 2013, this facility will convert pulp form our mills in the U.S. South into the proprietary raw material used in manufacturing by a key global customer, supplementing existing production from a similar facility in Columbus, Mississippi. At our Grande Prairie Alberta pulp mill, we're regenerating surplus green electric power from a new generator of fuel by a sustainable black liquor, converting energy expense into energy income. Lastly, during the quarter, we closed on sale of our hardwoods operations in our Westwood Shipping Line. The hardwood sales, which closed on August 1, included 7 hardwood mills. Year-to-date, revenues from these operations totaled $220 million and generated a $3 million operating loss. Our Westwood sale closed on September 30. Year-to-date, revenues from this business were $180 million with no earnings. The sale of these non-core businesses allows us to focus on our long-term strategic direction. As I noted last quarter, we'll maintain a relationship with our former associates as hardwoods will continue to be a log customer, and we'll transport products to our Asian customers on Westwood Shipping Lines. We wish our former associates the best of success with  their new owners. Now I'll ask Patty to discuss our outlook and provide a financial summary and then I'll have a quick recap before we invite your questions. Patty?"

The outlook for the fourth quarter by business segment is summarized on Chart 11. I'll begin the outlook discussion with Timberlands. In our Western operations, we expect lower selling prices for logs as a result of the softening export market, reflecting the back of the inventories into China. De harvest volumes are also projected to be lower. In the south, we anticipate that selling prices and harvest volumes will be flat, as those markets did not experience the same price increases earlier in the year as to the West. We expect growth costs and silvicultural costs to increase seasonally. Excluding the effect of nonstrategic land sales, we expect that earnings in our Timberlands segment will be lower than the third quarter. Earnings from nonstrategic land sales will increase from the very low third quarter level. Our Wood Products business is entering what is traditionally its slowest quarter of the year. Average sales realizations are expected to decrease for both lumber and OSB, as is typical of the seasonal slowdown in the housing market. Sales realizations for engineered wood products will likely be flat. Sale volumes across all product lines are projected to be lower. We expect traditional production curtailments as we match supply with demand and incurred traditional holiday downtime, especially on our lumber system. As a result, per unit manufacturing cost are expected to increase throughout our product lines although log cost should be flat to slightly down. Overall, we anticipate the loss in our Wood Products business to increase in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of this year. However, we expect that it will be less than the fourth quarter of last year, reflecting the improvements we're making in the business as Dan described. In our sale of Fibers segment, global softwood pulp demand is weakening, as a result of the high-level of industry inventories in global economic uncertainty. We expect prices to soften in the fourth quarter, offset by slightly higher shipment volumes. Costs are likely to be somewhat higher for fiber, chemicals and energy due to seasonal increases. We will not have any annual maintenance shutdowns as we completed our scheduled maintenance in the first half of this year. Overall, earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment should be slightly lower in the fourth quarter compared to the third. And we expect to generate another record year of earnings in this segment. In our Real Estate segment, home closings are anticipated to increase over the third quarter. The fourth quarter is traditionally our strongest quarter for closings in our single-family homebuilding business. We expect approximately 600 closings compared to 508 last quarter. Prices will likely be lower, offset by slightly higher margins due to mix. Earnings in our single-family homebuilding business should be higher in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. In addition, we do have some land parcels for sale that have the potential to close in the fourth quarter. However, they are none of significance under contract at this time. One of RICO subsidiary is the minority party to litigation relating to a joint venture in Nevada known as South Edge. Our reserve for this litigation of approximately $38 million was recorded in 2008. A plan of reorganization was approved a few days ago, and we expect to make a payment of approximately $30 million in November in settlement of the litigation. Now I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments starting with the special tax benefit booked in the third quarter. During the third quarter, we made the decision to dividend earnings from our Canadian subsidiary to the United States. Disposition triggered our ability to recognize the tax benefits for the difference between the net amount of taxes paid in previous years in Canada, which is allowed as a foreign tax credits in the United States and the U.S. of taxes due as a result of the dividend. Given our mix of taxable income in 2011, we will carry this benefit forward and anticipate utilizing the credit over the next 3 to 5 years. The full amount of the benefit of $83 million was recognized as a special item in the third quarter. We ended the third quarter with cash of $971 million, an increase of approximately $90 million. Cash flow from operations was $117 million and cash from the sale of assets was $157 million, primarily resulting from the sale of our hardwoods and shipping operations. During the quarter, we invested $66 million in capital expenditures, which brings our total expenditures through the third quarter to $159 million. We expect to spend approximately $100 million in the fourth quarter, which is in line with our earlier guidance of $250 million to $270 million for the full year. We paid $81 million in dividends and repurchased just under 1.8 million shares of our stock for approximately $29 million, at an average price of $16.41 [indiscernible] per share. Approximately $5 million of the cash settled after the end of the quarter. These purchases helped offset the dilution from stock option exercises investing restricting stock that took place earlier in the year. We did not have any the prepayments in the third quarter and we have no further debt due until next year. Earlier this month, we did repurchase approximately 12.5 million of Medium Term Notes due next year for less than their face value. During the fourth quarter, we will contribute approximately $60 million to our Canadian qualified pension plans. With that, I'll turn the call back to Dan and I look forward to your questions. Dan?"

As I remind ourselves internally and I remind you, our focus is to improve operations at today's level of starts. We continue to be optimistic and bullish about long-term recovery, but our experience have shown over the last couple of years that we need to live with today's level of activity. And so that's been our focus. We have, as you noted, continued to bring down our SG&A costs. That continues to be an ongoing focus. And in our Wood Products business, our focus has been on, first of all, moving to cash positive and then earnings positive range. And in the Wood Products business, that takes both cost management but also top line growth. So just a couple of comments on SG&A. We made progress on SG&A as we continue to make decisions such as the sale of our shipping business and our hardwood operations that we concluded in the quarter. That allows us to focus on our ongoing operations. It does leave us with some overhead that we need to address that have those businesses but we've made great progress over the last several years in working down legacy costs and bringing down overall headcount across the company to become more efficient in everything that we do. In our Wood Products operations, our focus across the entire system is a to bring down operating costs, and that includes manufacturing, where we need and have made progress in improving the operating efficiency and utilization of our facilities. That is, in part, related to the decision that we made during the quarter to permanently shut down these 4 facilities. We believe that we can move forward in the housing environment that we have with the facility set that we have in place. And then we have a number of initiatives to grow top line. Some of that comes from increasing markets offshore, as we discussed this morning. And some of it comes from finding opportunities where we have perhaps pricing power, where we have the ability to increase share based upon the products that we manufacture, based upon the location of our operating facilities where we maybe logistically advantaged to serve some markets. And as we look at the homebuilding business focused more on midsize and smaller builders where we can provide products efficiently and cost-effectively. We're also increasing some activity in repair and remodel market, going back into some locations where we have not been active, where we have products that customers would like to sell and where we have an advantage situation relative to our own manufacturing operations. So it's an ongoing effort. One where as I said this morning, I'm somewhat impatient but we're making progress and it continues to be a focus and will continue to be one. This is not a process where we get to a certain point and quit. This is an ongoing effort to improve our cost effectiveness and competitiveness and I'm encouraged with the progress that we're making."

One it's what happens in the quarter, as well as truing up the year-to-date effective rate. And maybe the way to think about the tax rate is a benefit of about 20% after you strip out the discrete items. So if you would look, for example, on the analyst package, the first page that shows consolidated statement of operations, you would see that year-to-date, we have earnings of $202 million. That's the earnings from continuing operations before income taxes. So from that, take out -- we have 3 discrete items this year. The first one would be the large Timberland sale, that was in the first quarter, for $102 million. And then you would add back the second discrete item, which is the $26 million of loss on early extinguishment of debt. And then you would compare that to what we actually booked for income taxes, which is right below the 202, which is the $52 million. And that $52 million benefit, you would have to add back the third discrete item, which was the foreign tax credits. So it's the $52 million, take out the foreign tax credit benefit, take out the willow for sale -- or the Timberland sale, and then also the effect of the debt extinguishment. You need to get $15 million. So our effective rate -- benefit rates through the third quarter and for the year is just under 20% when you strip out those items. It's really a function of the year-to-date rate plus the discrete items that are in the year-to-date and truing it up. If you want more details, certainly give us a call after the call. We're going to be happy to walk you through it."

We've good weather this year and so log inventories should not be a problem in most areas. I think we, as well as others, are very careful in managing inventories of finished product. And the supply chain has shrunk during this entire recession. If you think about the supply chain from the manufacturers to the distributor and ultimately to be builders, we've had shrinkage in the distribution chain, most exhibitors are managing their inventories, which were tightly. And so as the market begins to recover, I think they'll be tension and will tighten up relatively quickly. Do that we didn't have the ability to respond at a range that is likely to occur. I don't see a huge snap back in demand in the first quarter, just because I think we would expect to see some seasonal improvement unless there is a major public policy changes. I believe that the system will respond appropriately. Builders have the ability to put houses on the ground if they have sales. But I wouldn't expect a lot of speculative inventory and I think that the recovery will happen in a measured basis."

We commented on our last call and as I commented this morning, that played out during the third quarter. Our volumes to China were relatively unchanged in the third quarter but we'd expect that there'll be some falloff in the fourth quarter. Most of the slowdown has shown up in pricing. And the evidence is, if there's a buildup of inventory in China, some of that is seasonal, some of it clearly is caused by a tightening of credit in China that has slowed construction. There are some concerns that have been raised about overbuilding in the Real Estate market. We have to remind ourselves that Wood Products loss that are being converted are not going into wood frame construction. They are used for industrial purposes but they are used for construction forms, as well as pallets and packing. Long term, our view is that China is going to continue to grow. It's going to maintain its steady urbanization and there would be like a continued demand for wood products coming out of North America. North America should realize it's share as compared to other sources, which could be New Zealand, Russia, even Scandinavia. But we've been very encouraged by the pickup over the last couple of years.

They would be townhomes in a market like Washington D.C. But the significant change in activity that I was referring to this morning was multifamily rental. That, in this country, that is generally lower price, it is generally built with wood frame material. There's a different mix of products that are used in multifamily units. First of all, the square footage for your average multifamily unit is smaller than a detached unit. There is a higher percentage of engineered Wood Products and especially engineered lumber that go into a multifamily unit. That favors Weyerhaeuser Company because of our significant presence in the engineered business. And then there are also uses of OSB, was these primarily used in forming more than was shaping and multifamily. So you have to actually drill down into the individual products am number, injured Wood Products and OSB in order to establish a relative range of I can use a rough number but it is not exact because it does vary but roughly, the square footage of multifamily rental unit's about half the square footage of a single-family detached unit. And I think you can roughly apply that 50% factor across the Wood Products consumption but it would vary dramatically by a wood product type."

And when we came into the August board meeting, we've terminated that authorization and replaced it with a new authorization for $250 million and then purchased $9 million under that authorization in the quarter. So at the end of the quarter, we had a remaining authorization of about 241 million. So as we look at uses of cash, we do believe that share repurchase is an important tool for returning cash to shareholders. And as we said in the past, we'll utilize that share repurchase on an opportunistic basis. And given the fact that the stock price during the quarter had fallen and that we had received cash for the option -- stock option exercises earlier this year of just a little over $30 million, we believe that, that share repurchase was a good value for shareholders. I wouldn't want to speculate on the amount of timing of what we would do on the future other than to say that we will continue to use that tool opportunistically where we can create additional value."

And secondly for Dan, as you look at your house -- your markets where you build homes and just your intelligence since you guys are on the ground in so many places, measuring that rents are going up even where there's not a lot of job creation because people just can't afford down payment. And in that spirit, are you -- or in that vain, are you seeing new projects for multifamily construction and some of these areas where you're seeing an almost shortage of rental property with people will not be able to afford down payments and needing a place to live?"

And it's a function shift I believe of a couple of things. One is some challenges in purchasing. But I think more importantly, the points that I summarized in my comments this morning, I think that people are sitting on the sidelines, waiting for the signal that it's okay to go back into the home purchase market. And so there is some concern overall about consumer confidence. There's some concerns in some markets about employment. I think this mobility issue is a big one where people who want to maintain their ability to be mobile and they take a job in a different neighborhood or a different metro area if that's what it takes. The mortgage qualification process is much more difficult than it has been even over the last 2 to 3 years. Appraisals are challenged. Down payments are challenged. And I think that, that's an area where we have to address some public policy issues in order to break loose a bit of activity in the system. Rents are high, in many markets it is cheaper to own than to rent. And so people are making a choice to maintain and in effect an option by renting before they come back into the market. We do have lent that we sell to multifamily developers and some locations. So we are not an apartment builder, but where we have a multifamily lead, that's been a benefit because we can sell to traditional developers of a multifamily property and participate in that market but it also putting some pressure on labor cost because we are seeing construction labor flow through multifamily projects."

Because you have a compelling value proposition and we do sell to some buyers that use FHA financing. The challenge quite frankly is not in the nonpayment, the challenge is the credit underwriting process that has become overly burdensome. There's a problem with appraisals because we have changed the appraisal process. It's a much more difficult one. And in some markets, the challenge is you have a willing buyer and seller for a new home. They agree on a price but the house won't appraise for that price because the appraisal includes comparable that maybe foreclosures in same metro area although that buyer wouldn't want to buy that foreclosed home. So that's one of the things that is an impediment in the system today and needs to break loose. And I think that to some extent, the buying public is looking for the green light to go on to say it's okay to go back in and start purchasing. And we have seen some markets investors comic for offshore that our purchasing model family units.

Joining me this morning are Dan Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patty Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported third quarter 2011 net earnings of $157 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, on net sales from continuing operations of $1.6 billion. Earnings for the third quarter include after-tax gains of $91 million from special items. These items include a benefit of $83 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, related to foreign tax credits. A gain of $32 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, on disposition, a charge of $24 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, for impairments and restructuring in wood products. Excluding these items, the company reported net earnings of $66 million, or $0.12 per diluted share. Please turn to the earnings information package available on our website. This package includes a GAAP reconciliation of the special items. In the discussion of the business segment, I will refer to Charts 4 through 10.
Chart 4, changes in contribution to earnings by segment before special items. This chart illustrates the change in contribution by business segment from second quarter 2011 to third quarter 2011. My comments reviewing the third quarter refer to changes from the second quarter unless otherwise noted.
We begin our business segment discussion of the third quarter with Timberlands, Charts 5 and 6. In the third quarter, timberlands contributed $62 million to pretax earnings, $50 million less than in Q2. $28 million of the decrease was the result of lower earnings from nonstrategic land sales. Third quarter land dispositions were $4 million compared to $32 million in the second quarter. Average third-party price realizations in the West declined 5%, as the weakening Chinese market exerted downward pressure on domestic and export prices. In the South, average third-party price realizations declined slightly. Fee harvest volumes were flat in the quarter. Volumes were down in the West as the Chinese export markets softened. Volumes rose in the South. Costs received nearly higher. These increases were due to road construction in the West and silviculture spending in the South. 
Wood Products, Charts 7 and 8. Continuing operations in wood products lost $43 million, $10 million less than second quarter. Lumber price realizations were flat. Price realizations for OSB and engineered solid section declined slightly. Engineered I-Joist price realizations rose slightly. Operating rates in Q3 were flat in lumber, improved in OSB and were slightly lower in engineered wood products. Restructuring and impairment charges were $38 million, primarily related to the permanent closure of 4 previously idled engineered wood products facilities. This was offset by a $5 million gain on the sale of properties. Charges related to the sale of discontinued operations were $13 million in Q3. 
Cellulose Fibers, Chart 9. Third quarter cellulose fibers pretax contribution to earnings was $135 million, $55 million higher than second quarter. Average pulp prices sales realizations declined 4%, or $40 per metric ton. Pulp sales volumes were flat. Maintenance cost was lower and pulp production increased 13%. There were no maintenance outages during the third quarter. There were 4 scheduled annual maintenance outages in the second quarter. 
Real Estate, Chart 10. Real estate contributed $10 million to pretax earnings, $2 million more than second quarter. Single-family closings increased seasonally from 459 homes in Q2 to 508 homes in Q3. The average price on homes closed during the quarter increased $12,000 to $403,000. This increase was due to mix. Margins on single-family homes closed also increased due to mix. 
Corporate and Other. Excluding discontinued operations, Corporate and Other was $5 million lower in Q3. Foreign exchange charges, primarily related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, reduced Corporate and Other by $18 million. This was partially offset by $7 million of additional gains related to share-based compensation. A decline in the company's stock price during the quarter resulted in a larger mark-to-market adjustment. Discontinued operations included a loss from operations of $4 million and gains of $58 million on the sale of Westwood and properties in the third quarter. Discontinued operations had a charge of $11 million in second quarter. 
I will now turn the call over to Dan Fulton. Dan?"

Thanks for joining us today. Despite a more challenging macroeconomic environment than we anticipated just 3 months ago, I'm pleased to report that our quarterly performance improved as increased earnings from 3",1862,"Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Despite a more challenging macroeconomic environment than we anticipated just 3 months ago, I'm pleased to report that our quarterly performance improved as increased earnings from 3 of our 4 businesses offset an anticipated earnings decline in our Timberlands business. In addition to overall factors affecting the U.S. and world economies, the 2 most significant external factors affecting our quarterly performance are the same as they were last quarter, U.S. housing and China. I'd like to comment on these overall themes first and then I'll discuss activity in each of our businesses during the quarter. Following my remarks, Kathy will provide our business outlook on the fourth quarter, as well as financial comments. 
First, let me talk about housing. Three of our 4 businesses, Timberlands, Wood Products and Real Estate, are impacted in varying degrees by current conditions in the U.S. housing market, which I described in this morning's release as languishing. As we entered 2011, our planning assumption was that U.S. single-family housing starts would total 525,000 for the year, which would have been a modest increase over 2010 construction levels. As we sit here today in late October, we currently estimate that we'll end the year at a level of about 425,000, approximately 20% below that planning assumption. Long-term demographics continue to be compelling, but prospective homebuyers today exhibit little sense of urgency. This is a result of a lack of consumer confidence, continued high unemployment rates, concern about potential downward price risk related to an overhang of foreclosed homes and a desire to maintain employment mobility. One last factor affecting home sales is interest rates. Because of Chairman Bernanke's statements, the market now expects mortgage rates to remain low for an extended period of time. And while lower rates are generally a positive for home sales, the expectation of continued low rates give buyers yet another reason to put off a purchase decision. Once a purchase agreement has been signed, prospective buyers face an increasingly difficult mortgage underwriting process that causes many motivated and qualified buyers to move back to the sidelines and wait. Our political climate has only added to uncertainty and we see little evidence at this point that conditions will improve before next year's spring selling season. The glass half-full side of me, nevertheless, see some good news on the housing front. First, although we generally don't highlight conditions in Canada, housing activity north of the border has been relatively stable at about 185,000 starts for the year. We produced for this healthy housing market through our lumber, OSB and engineered wood products mills, several of which are located in Canada. Our Canadian mills also serve export markets, particularly off the West Coast. Second, although U.S. single-family housing starts are stagnant, multifamily rental construction is relatively strong in response to low vacancy rates and rapidly increasing rents. Rental units are generally smaller than single-family homes. But for the most part, they are wood frame construction and use the full range of wood products that we produce: lumber, OSB and engineered wood. That's good news for our wood products and our timberlands. 
Third, inventory levels of new homes have been all-time low, so any pickup in new home sales will quickly lead to increased construction activity. Although our forward planning assumptions are based upon today's level of starts, we have the ability to flex all of our operations as markets improve, homebuilding, wood products manufacturing and in the woods. 
Let me turn now to China before I provide some specific comments about quarterly performance in each of our business segments. Growth in China affects 3 of our businesses: Timberlands, Wood Products and Cellulose Fibers. We have long-term experience selling products to China. Today, we sell logs, lumber and cellulose fibers to a range of Chinese customers. And although Japan has long been our primary agent export market, sales to China has increased significantly over the past 24 months. On the last quarter's call, I noted that we were beginning to see some pull back in both price and volume from China. Those were early indications of softness we realized in the third quarter as credit tightened and demand slowed. Our view is that the slowdown is temporary and we expect Chinese demand to return and to continue to grow over the longer term. In the meantime, we should expect a greater level of volatility than in our more traditional markets. 
I'll begin my discussion of business and company highlights for the quarter with timberlands. During the quarter, the impact of slowing Chinese demand led to price declines. Volumes were relatively steady, but the falloff in Chinese log prices had a ripple effect on the entire Western log market. Export activity from our Western timberlands during the quarter was 40% of total volume, a split among Japan, China and Korea. Our ability to access export markets from the Western lands has long been a significant source of revenue and competitive strength and reduces somewhat our reliance on the U.S. housing market. During the quarter, we made some progress towards additional market diversification from our other timberlands. We tested sales of southern yellow pine logs the from the U.S. South to Turkey and pine logs from Uruguay to China. These sales pale in significance compared to our long-term West Coast Asian markets but they're a step in the right direction. 
Turning to land transactions, the $28 million quarterly decrease in timberland dispositions, which was due to transaction timing, negatively affected quarter-over-quarter timberland earnings. 
Our Minerals business remained a steady performer during the quarter, contributing approximately $15 million. We continue to receive royalties from hard minerals and from our oil and gas properties. These include both our Haynesville gas shale acreage -- shale gas acreage in North Louisiana and bonuses from new leases with shale oil potential in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale play across in Southern Louisiana. 
In our Wood Products business, our initiatives to lower costs and improve performance are beginning to show results. Even with weaker market conditions, our EBIT before special items improved $10 million over the quarter and $59 million over the prior year. As we entered the year, I told you that it was my expectation that our Wood Products segment would be cash positive for the year based upon our housing construction forecast. The business was cash negative during the first quarter due to a seasonal buildup in working capital, but we were cash positive in the second quarter and in the third quarter as we continue to reduce working capital. Given the downturn in housing that we've experienced, it is unlikely that we'll meet our cash breakeven objective for the year, but we're making progress and it continues to be our focus as part of our return to profitability in this segment. We are pushing all leverage available to us to improve our performance in wood products, focusing on revenue enhancement, as well as cost reductions. As in our Timberlands business, in wood products we continue to find opportunities to diversify our sales outside North America, especially from our Canadian mills. Export represents 38% of our Canadian lumber volume. Japan is our largest export market with over 60% of export sales. Shipments to China have nearly tripled this year. I noted earlier that we're well positioned in all of our wood products to meet the growing activity in multifamily construction and we're focused on growing share where we have competitive advantage based upon our products and our geography. I'm impatient, but encouraged with our progress. This morning, we made the decision to permanently close our 4 previously curtailed engineered wood products facilities: LBL facilities in Albany, Oregon and Simsboro, Louisiana and the near facilities in Pine Hill, Alabama and Dodson, Louisiana. This is another step in reducing the costs associated with closed facilities that we concluded we will not need in the future based upon the pace of the housing recovery. 
In our Real Estate segment, we turned in another profitable quarter on the strength of our single-family operations. During the second half of the year, when we normally have increased closing activity, closings were up 11% over the prior quarter while margins increased slightly due to mix. Although traffic during the quarter declined 27% year-over-year, sales increased 5% as we continue to experience higher conversion rates. Local market conditions are mixed. Our most active markets are Houston and the Maryland and Virginia suburbs of Washington D.C. Our weakest markets are Southern California and Las Vegas. The most significant indicator of market strength today is employment. To give you a little local flavor, in Phoenix, where single-family permits are down 19% year-over-year, our sales are up 42%. The longer-term good news for Phoenix is that job growth will approach 2% in 2011 and the existing home market is remarkably strong, on track to exceed 95,000 transactions compared with the prior peak of 92,000 in 2006. In Houston, where home prices are stable, new home sales are down 30% from last year, but our sales increased 21%. Similarly in Washington D.C., new home sales activity is 20% lower than a year ago while our sales are up 23%. 
Turning our Cellulose Fibers segment. We continue to run well and had no planned maintenance downtime. Revenue declined somewhat during the quarter due to price, as well as mix. Even with pressure from declining realizations, the overall business result was a significant quarter-over-quarter earnings improvement. I want to comment on progress on 2 other initiatives in our Cellulose Fibers segment. Both are examples of executing our strategy to grow with key global customers and to make disciplined investment to improve productivity of our mills. In early August, we broke ground on our new modified fiber facility in Gdansk, Poland. Upon completion and estimated start up in early 2013, this facility will convert fluff pulp from our mills in the U.S. South into a proprietary raw material used in diaper manufacturing by a key global customer, supplementing existing production from a similar facility in Columbus, Mississippi. At our Grande Prairie, Alberta pulp mill, we're regenerating surplus green electric power from a new generator fueled by sustainable black liquor, converting an energy expense into energy income. 
Lastly, during the quarter, we closed on the sale of our hardwoods operations in our Westwood Shipping Line. The hardwood sale, which closed on August 1, included 7 hardwood mills. Year-to-date, revenues from these operations totaled $220 million and generated a $3 million operating loss. Our Westwood sale closed on September 30. Year-to-date, revenues from this business were $180 million with no earnings. The sale of these noncore businesses allows us to focus on our long-term strategic direction. As I noted last quarter, we'll maintain a relationship with our former associates as hardwoods will continue to be a log customer, and we'll transport products to our Asian customers on Westwood Shipping Lines. We wish our former associates the best of success with their new owners. 
Now I'll ask Patty to discuss our outlook and provide a financial summary and then I'll have a quick recap before we invite your questions. Patty?"

The outlook for the fourth quarter by business segment is summarized on Chart 11. I'll begin the outlook discussion with timberlands. In our Western operations, we expect lower selling prices for logs as a result o",937,"Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. The outlook for the fourth quarter by business segment is summarized on Chart 11. I'll begin the outlook discussion with timberlands. In our Western operations, we expect lower selling prices for logs as a result of the softening export market, reflecting the backup of log inventories into China. Fee harvest volumes are also projected to be lower. In the South, we anticipate that selling prices and fee harvest volumes will be flat, as those markets did not experience the same price increases earlier in the year as to the West. We expect growth costs and silvicultural costs to increase seasonally. Excluding the effect of nonstrategic land sales, we expect that earnings in our Timberlands segment will be lower than the third quarter. Earnings from nonstrategic land sales will increase from the very low third quarter level. 
Our Wood Products business is entering what is traditionally its slowest quarter of the year. Average sales realizations are expected to decrease for both lumber and OSB, as is typical of the seasonal slowdown in the housing market. Sales realizations for engineered wood products will likely be flat. Sale volumes across all product lines are projected to be lower. We expect traditional production curtailments as we match supply with demand and incur the traditional holiday downtime, especially on our lumber system. As a result, per unit manufacturing costs are expected to increase throughout our product lines although log cost should be flat to slightly down. Overall, we anticipate the loss in our Wood Products business to increase in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of this year. However, we expect that it will be less than the fourth quarter of last year, reflecting the improvements we're making in the business as Dan described. 
In our sale of Fibers segment, global softwood pulp demand is weakening as a result of the high level of industry inventories and global economic uncertainty. We expect prices to soften in the fourth quarter, offset by slightly higher shipment volumes. Costs are likely to be somewhat higher for fiber, chemicals and energy due to seasonal increases. We will not have any annual maintenance shutdowns as we completed our scheduled maintenance in the first half of this year. Overall, earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment should be slightly lower in the fourth quarter compared to the third. And we expect to generate another record year of earnings in this segment. 
In our Real Estate segment, home closings are anticipated to increase over the third quarter. The fourth quarter is traditionally our strongest quarter for closings in our single-family homebuilding business. We expect approximately 600 closings compared to 508 last quarter. Prices will likely be lower, offset by slightly higher margins due to mix. Earnings in our single-family homebuilding business should be higher in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. In addition, we do have some land parcels for sale that have the potential to close in the fourth quarter. However, they are none of significance under contract at this time. One of our WRECO subsidiaries is a minority party to litigation relating to a joint venture in Nevada known as South Edge. A reserve for this litigation of approximately $38 million was recorded in 2008. A plan of reorganization was approved a few days ago, and we expect to make a payment of approximately $30 million in November in settlement of the litigation. 
Now I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments starting with the special tax benefit booked in the third quarter. During the third quarter, we made the decision to dividend earnings from our Canadian subsidiary to the United States. This position triggered our ability to recognize the tax benefit for the difference between the net amount of taxes paid in previous years in Canada, which is allowed as a foreign tax credit in the United States and the U.S. taxes due as a result of the dividend. Given our mix of taxable income in 2011, we will carry this benefit forward and anticipate utilizing the credit over the next 3 to 5 years. The full amount of the benefit of $83 million was recognized as a special item in the third quarter. We ended the third quarter with cash of $971 million, an increase of approximately $90 million. Cash flow from operations was $117 million and cash from the sale of assets was $157 million, primarily resulting from the sale of our hardwoods and shipping operations. 
During the quarter, we invested $66 million in capital expenditures, which brings our total expenditures through the third quarter to $159 million. We expect to spend approximately $100 million in the fourth quarter, which is in line with our earlier guidance of $250 million to $270 million for the full year. We paid $81 million in dividends and repurchased just under 1.8 million shares of our stock for approximately $29 million, at an average price of $16.41 a share. Approximately $5 million of the cash settled after the end of the quarter. These purchases helped offset the dilution from stock option exercises, investing a restricting stock that took place earlier in the year. We did not have any the debt repayments in the third quarter and we have no further debt due until next year. Earlier this month, we did repurchase approximately 12.5 million of medium-term notes due next year for less than their face value. During the fourth quarter, we will contribute approximately $60 million to our Canadian qualified pension plans. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Dan and I look forward to your questions. Dan?"

We continue to be optimistic and bullish about long-term recovery, but our experience has shown over the last couple of years that we need to live with today's level of activity. And so that's been our focus. We have, as you noted, continued to bring down our SG&A costs. That continues to be an ongoing focus. And in our Wood Products business, our focus has been on, first of all, moving to cash positive and then earnings positive range. And in the Wood Products business, that takes both cost management but also top line growth. So just a couple of comments on SG&A. We make progress on SG&A as we continue to make decisions such as the sale of our shipping business and our hardwood operations that we concluded in the quarter. That allows us to focus on our ongoing operations. It does leave us with some overhead that we need to address that have supported those businesses but we've made great progress over the last several years in working down legacy costs and bringing down overall headcount across the company to become more efficient in everything that we do. In our wood products operations, our focus across the entire system is to bring down operating costs, and that includes manufacturing, where we need and have made progress in improving the operating efficiency and utilization of our facilities. That is, in part, related to the decision that we made during the quarter to permanently shut down these 4 facilities. We believe that we can move forward in the housing environment that we have with the facility set that we have in place. And then we have a number of initiatives to grow top line. Some of that comes from increasing markets offshore, as we discussed this morning. And some of it comes from finding opportunities where we have perhaps pricing power, where we have the ability to increase share based upon the products that we manufacture, based upon the location of our operating facilities where we may be logistically advantaged to serve some markets. And as we look at the Homebuilding business focused more on mid-sized and smaller builders where we can provide products efficiently and cost effectively. We're also increasing some activity in repair and remodel market, going back into some locations where we have not been active, where we have products that customers would like to sell and where we have an advantaged situation relative to our own manufacturing operations. So it's an ongoing effort, one where as I said this morning, ""I'm somewhat impatient but we're making progress and it continues to be a focus and will continue to be one."" This is not a process where we get to a certain point and quit. This is an ongoing effort to improve our cost effectiveness and competitiveness and I'm encouraged with the progress that we're making."

One, it's -- what happens in the quarter, as well as truing up the year-to-date effective rate. And maybe the way to think about the tax rate, it's a benefit of about 20% after you strip out the discrete items. So if you were to look, for example, on the analyst package, the first page that shows the consolidated statement of operations, you would see that year-to-date we have earnings of $202 million. That's the earnings from continuing operations before income taxes. So from that, take out -- we have 3 discrete items this year. The first one would be the large timberland sale, that was in the first quarter, for $152 million. And then you would add back the second discrete item, which is the $26 million of loss on early extinguishment of debt. And then you would compare that to what we actually booked for income taxes, which is right below the $202 million, which is the $52 million. And that $52 million benefit, you would have to add back the third discrete item, which was the foreign tax credit. So it's the $52 million, take out the foreign tax credit benefit, take out the Willapa for sale -- the timberland sale, and then also the effect of the debt extinguishment. You need to get $15 million. So our effective rate -- benefit rate through the third quarter and for the year is just under 20% once you strip out those items. It's really a function of the year-to-date rate plus the discrete items that are in the year-to-date and truing it up.

And the supply chain has shrunk during this entire recession. If you think about the supply chain from the manufacturers to the distributor and ultimately to be builders, we've had shrinkage in the distribution chain. Most distributors are managing their inventories much more tightly. And so as the market begins to recover, I think there'll be tension and it'll tighten up relatively quickly. I do the industry does have the ability to respond at a range that is likely to occur. I don't see a huge snapback in demand in the first quarter just because I think we would expect to see some seasonal improvement unless there were some major public policy changes. I believe that the system will respond appropriately. Builders have the ability to put houses on the ground if they have sales.

And we commented on our last call and as I commented this morning, that played out during the third quarter. Our volumes to China were relatively unchanged in the third quarter but we'd expect that there'll be some falloff in the fourth quarter. Most of the slowdown has shown up in pricing. And the evidence is, if there's a buildup of inventory in China, some of that is seasonal, some of it clearly is caused by a tightening of credit in China that has slowed construction. There are some concerns that have been raised about overbuilding in the real estate market. We have to remind ourselves that wood products and the logs that are being converted are not going into wood frame construction. They're used for industrial purposes but they are used for construction forms, as well as pallets and packing. Long term, our view is that China is going to continue to grow. It's going to maintain its steady urbanization and there would be like a continued demand for wood products coming out of North America.

So when we see multifamily statistics, they would include both for-sale housing that's attached, as well as rental housing. We happen to be a builder of some for-sale multifamily and they would be townhomes in a market like Washington D.C. But the significant change in activity that I was referring to this morning was multifamily rental. That -- in this country, that's generally low rise. It is generally built with wood frame material. There's a different mix of products that are used in multifamily units. First of all, the square footage for your average multifamily unit is smaller than a detached unit. There is a higher percentage of engineered wood products and especially engineered lumber that go into a multifamily unit. That favors Weyerhaeuser Co. because of our significant presence in the engineered business. And there are also uses of OSB. OSB is primarily used in flooring, more than wall sheathing in multifamily. So you have to actually drill down into the individual products, lumber, engineered wood products and OSB, in order to establish a relative range. I can use a rough number, but it is not exact because it does vary. But roughly, the square footage of multifamily rental unit's about half the square footage of a single-family detached unit. And I think you can roughly apply that 50% factor across the wood products consumption, but it would vary dramatically by wood product type."

We have continued to invest in capital effect of projects in our Cellulose Fibers business with the goal of driving down production costs, increasing productivity from our existing mills. And that's why I gave an example this morning of what we've just done in Grand Prairie. And we've talked on earlier calls about our longer-term initiative in our Cellulose Fibers business to be stretching out our planned routine maintenance from a 12-month scheduled to an 18-month schedule. And so we see ROI projects with relatively quick payback that have the benefit of increasing productivity, and also they improve our environmental footprint. We've been spending minimal amount as necessary for safety and environmental compliance on our wood products facilities. And we've been cautious in our Real Estate business because we already have a large plan position and we're well positioned to take advantage of a recovery in real estate. So we're relatively well situated, as Patty said in her remarks, and we've bought in a little bit of stock. We thought that, that was an appropriate use of cash during the quarter.

So as you said, when we came into the quarter, we did have an existing authorization that really dated back to 2008 for about $250 million.

And it's a function shift, I believe, of a couple of things. One is some challenges in purchasing. But I think more importantly, the points that I summarized on -- in my comments this morning, I think that people are sitting on the sidelines, waiting for the signal that it's okay to go back into the home purchase market. And so there is some concern overall about consumer confidence. There's some concern in some markets about employment. I think this mobility issue is a big one where people who want to maintain their -- the ability to be mobile and to take a job in a different neighborhood or a different metro area if that's what it takes. The mortgage qualification process is much more difficult than it has been even over the last 2 to 3 years. Appraisals are challenged. Down payments are challenged. And I think that, that's an area where we have to address some public policy issues in order to break loose a bit of activity in the system. Rents are high. In many markets, it is cheaper to own than to rent. And so people are making a choice to maintain and in effect, an option by renting before they come back into the market. We do have land that we sell to multifamily developers in some locations. So we are not an apartment builder, but where we have a multifamily land, that's been a benefit because we can sell to institutional developers of multifamily property and participate in that market.

Because you have a compelling value proposition and we do sell to some buyers that use FHA financing. The challenge, quite frankly, is not in the down payment. The challenge is the credit underwriting process that has become overly burdensome. And then there's a problem with appraisals because we have changed the appraisal process. It's a much more difficult one. And in some markets, the challenge is you have a willing buyer and seller for a new home, they agree on a price but the house won't appraise for that price because the appraisal includes comparables that may be foreclosures in the same metro area although that buyer wouldn't want to buy that foreclosed home. So that's one of the things that is an impediment in the system today and needs to break loose.

Please review the warning statement in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call.
Joining me this morning are Dan Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patty Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported third quarter 2011 net earnings of $157 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, on net sales from continuing operations of $1.6 billion. Earnings for the third quarter include after-tax gains of $91 million from special items. These items include: a benefit of $83 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, related to foreign tax credits; a gain of $32 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, on disposition; a charge of $24 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, for impairments and restructuring in wood products. Excluding these items, the company reported net earnings of $66 million, or $0.12 per diluted share.
Please turn to the earnings information package available on our website. This package includes a GAAP reconciliation of special items. In the discussion of the business segments, I will refer to Charts 4 through 10.
Chart 4, Changes in Contribution to Earnings by Segment before Special Items. This chart illustrates the change in contribution by business segment from second quarter 2011 to third quarter 2011. My comments reviewing the third quarter refer to changes from the second quarter unless otherwise noted.
We begin our business segment discussion of the third quarter with Timberlands, Charts 5 and 6. In the third quarter, Timberlands contributed $62 million to pretax earnings, $50 million less than in Q2. $28 million of the decrease was the result of lower earnings from nonstrategic land sales. Third quarter land dispositions were $4 million compared to $32 million in the second quarter. Average third-party price realizations in the West declined 5%, as a weakening Chinese market exerted downward pressure on domestic and export prices. In the South, average third-party price realizations declined slightly. Fee harvest volumes were flat in the quarter. Volumes were down in the West as the Chinese export market softened. Volumes rose in the South. Costs were seasonally higher. These increases were due to road construction in the West and silviculture spending in the South. 
Wood Products, Charts 7 and 8. Continuing operations in wood products lost $43 million, $10 million less than second quarter. Lumber price realizations were flat. Price realizations for OSB and engineered solid section declined slightly. Engineered I-joist price realizations rose slightly. Operating rates in Q3 were flat in lumber, improved in OSB and were slightly lower in engineered wood products. Restructuring and impairment charges were $38 million, primarily related to the permanent closure of 4 previously idled engineered wood product facilities. This was offset by a $5 million gain on the sale of properties. Charges related to the sale of discontinued operations were $13 million in Q3. 
Cellulose Fibers, Chart 9. Third quarter cellulose fibers' pretax contribution to earnings was $135 million, $55 million higher than second quarter. Average pulp price sales realizations declined 4%, or $40 per metric ton. Pulp sales volumes were flat. Maintenance cost was lower and pulp production increased 13%. There were no maintenance outages during the third quarter. There were 4 scheduled annual maintenance outages in the second quarter. 
Real Estate, Chart 10. Real estate contributed $10 million to pretax earnings, $2 million more than second quarter. Single-family closings increased seasonally from 459 homes in Q2 to 508 homes in Q3. The average price on homes closed during the quarter increased $12,000 to $403,000. This increase was due to mix. Margins on single-family homes closed also increased due to mix. 
Corporate and other. Excluding discontinued operations, Corporate and Other was $5 million lower in Q3. Foreign exchange charges, primarily related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, reduced corporate and other by $18 million. This was partially offset by $7 million of additional gains related to share-based compensation. A decline in the company's stock price during the quarter resulted in a larger mark-to-market adjustment. Discontinued operations included a loss from operations of $4 million and gains of $58 million on the sale of Westwood and properties in the third quarter. Discontinued operations had a charge of $11 million in second quarter. 
I will now turn the call over to Dan Fulton. Dan?"
107633,141350941,180666,"Weyerhaeuser Co., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2011",2011-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Weyerhaeuser Company","Executives","Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Despite a more challenging macroeconomic environment than we anticipated just 3 months ago, I'm pleased to report that our quarterly performance improved as increased earnings from 3",1860,"Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Despite a more challenging macroeconomic environment than we anticipated just 3 months ago, I'm pleased to report that our quarterly performance improved as increased earnings from 3 of our 4 businesses offset an anticipated earnings decline in our Timberlands business. In addition to overall factors affecting the U.S. and world economies, the 2 most significant external factors affecting our quarterly performance are the same as they were last quarter, U.S. housing and China. I'd like to comment on these overall themes first, and then I'll discuss activity in each of our businesses during the quarter. Following my remarks, Patty will provide our business outlook on the fourth quarter, as well as financial comments. 
First, let me talk about housing. Three of our 4 businesses, Timberlands, Wood Products and Real Estate, are impacted in varying degrees by current conditions in the U.S. housing market, which I described in this morning's release as languishing. As we entered 2011, our planning assumption was that U.S. single-family housing starts would total 525,000 for the year, which would have been a modest increase over 2010 construction levels. As we sit here today in late October, we currently estimate that we'll end the year at a level of about 425,000, approximately 20% below that planning assumption.
Long-term demographics continue to be compelling, but prospective homebuyers today exhibit little sense of urgency. This is a result of a lack of consumer confidence, continued high unemployment rates, concern about potential downward price risk related to an overhang of foreclosed homes and a desire to maintain employment mobility. 
One last factor affecting home sales is interest rates. Because of Chairman Bernanke's statements, the market now expects mortgage rates to remain low for an extended period of time. And while low rates are generally a positive for home sales, the expectation of continued low rates give buyers yet another reason to put off a purchase decision. 
Once a purchase agreement has been signed, prospective buyers face an increasingly difficult mortgage underwriting process that causes many motivated and qualified buyers to move back to the sidelines and wait. Our political climate has only added to uncertainty and we see little evidence at this point that conditions will improve before next year's spring selling season. 
The glass half-full side of me, nevertheless, sees some good news on the housing front. First, although we generally don't highlight conditions in Canada, housing activity north of the border has been relatively stable at about 185,000 starts for the year. We produce for this healthy housing market through our lumber, OSB and engineered wood products mills, several of which are located in Canada. Our Canadian mills also serve export markets, particularly off the West Coast. Second, although U.S. single-family housing starts are stagnant, multifamily rental construction is relatively strong in response to low vacancy rates and rapidly increasing rents. Rental units are generally smaller than single-family homes. But for the most part, they are wood-frame construction and use the full range of wood products that we produce: lumber, OSB and engineered wood. That's good news for our wood products and our timberlands. 
Third, inventory levels of new homes are at an all-time low, so any pickup in new home sales will quickly lead to increased construction activity. Although our forward planning assumptions are based upon today's level of starts, we have the ability to flex all of our operations as markets improve, homebuilding, wood products manufacturing and in the woods. 
Let me turn now to China before I provide some specific comments about quarterly performance in each of our business segments. Growth in China affects 3 of our businesses: Timberlands, Wood Products and Cellulose Fibers. We have long-term experience selling products to China. Today, we sell logs, lumber and cellulose fibers to a range of Chinese customers. And although Japan has long been our primary Asian export market, sales to China have increased significantly over the past 24 months. On the last quarter's call, I noted that we were beginning to see some pullback in both price and volume from China. Those early indications of softness were realized in the third quarter as credit tightened and demand slowed. Our view is that the slowdown is temporary, and we expect Chinese demand to return and to continue to grow over the longer term. In the meantime, we should expect a greater level of volatility than in our more traditional markets. 
I'll begin my discussion of business and company highlights for the quarter with Timberlands. During the quarter, the impact of slowing Chinese demand led to price declines. Volumes were relatively steady, but the falloff in Chinese log prices had a ripple effect on the entire Western log market. Export activity from our Western timberlands during the quarter was 40% of total volume, a split among Japan, China and Korea. Our ability to access export markets from our Western lands has long been a significant source of revenue and competitive strength and reduces somewhat our reliance on the U.S. housing market. During the quarter, we made some progress towards additional market diversification from our other timberlands. We tested sales of southern yellow pine logs from the U.S. South to Turkey and pine logs from Uruguay to China. These sales pale in significance compared to our long-term West Coast Asian markets, but they're a step in the right direction. 
Turning to land transactions. The $28 million quarterly decrease in timberland dispositions, which was due to transaction timing, negatively affected quarter-over-quarter timberland earnings. 
Our Minerals business remained a steady performer during the quarter, contributing approximately $15 million. We continue to receive royalties from hard minerals and from our oil and gas properties. These include both our Haynesville gas shale acreage -- shale gas acreage in North Louisiana and bonuses from new leases with shale oil potential in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale play, that crosses Southern Louisiana. 
In our Wood Products business, our initiatives to lower costs and improve performance are beginning to show results. Even with weaker market conditions, our EBIT before special items improved $10 million over the quarter and $59 million over the prior year. As we entered the year, I told you that it was my expectation that our Wood Products segment would be cash positive for the year based upon our housing construction forecast. The business was cash negative during the first quarter due to a seasonal buildup in working capital, but we were cash positive in the second quarter and in the third quarter as we continue to reduce working capital. Given the downturn in housing that we've experienced, it is unlikely that we'll meet our cash breakeven objective for the year, but we're making progress, and it continues to be our focus as part of our return to profitability in this segment. 
We are pushing all levers available to us to improve our performance in Wood Products, focusing on revenue enhancement, as well as cost reductions. As in our Timberlands business, in Wood Products we continue to find opportunities to diversify our sales outside North America, especially from our Canadian mills. Export represents 38% of our Canadian lumber volume. Japan is our largest export market with over 60% of export sales. Shipments to China have nearly tripled this year. 
I noted earlier that we're well positioned in all of our wood products to meet the growing activity in multifamily construction and we're focused on growing share where we have competitive advantage based upon our products and our geography. I'm impatient, but encouraged with our progress. This morning we made the decision to permanently close our 4 previously curtailed engineered wood products facilities: LBL facilities in Albany, Oregon, and Simsboro, Louisiana, and veneer facilities in Pine Hill, Alabama, and Dodson, Louisiana. This is another step in reducing the costs associated with closed facilities that we concluded we will not need in the future based upon the pace of the housing recovery. 
In our Real Estate segment, we turned in another profitable quarter on the strength of our single-family operations. During the second half of the year, when we normally have increased closing activity, closings were up 11% over the prior quarter while margins increased slightly due to mix. Although traffic during the quarter declined 27% year-over-year, sales increased 5% as we continued to experience higher conversion rates. Local market conditions are mixed. Our most active markets are Houston and the Maryland and Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C. Our weakest markets are Southern California and Las Vegas. 
The most significant indicator of market strength today is employment. To give you a little local flavor, in Phoenix, where single-family permits are down 19% year-over-year, our sales are up 42%. The longer-term good news for Phoenix is that job growth will approach 2% in 2011. And the existing home market is remarkably strong, on track to exceed 95,000 transactions compared with the prior peak of 92,000 in 2006. In Houston, where home prices are stable, new home sales are down 30% from last year, but our sales increased 21%. Similarly, in Washington D.C., new home sales activity is 20% lower than a year ago while our sales are up 23%. 
Turning to our Cellulose Fibers segment. We continued to run well and had no planned maintenance downtime. Revenue declined somewhat during the quarter due to price as well as mix. Even with pressure from declining realizations, the overall business result was a significant quarter-over-quarter earnings improvement. 
I want to comment on progress on 2 other initiatives in our Cellulose Fibers segment. Both are examples of executing our strategy to grow with key global customers and to make disciplined investments to improve productivity of our mills. In early August, we broke ground on our new modified fiber facility in Gdansk, Poland. Upon completion and estimated start up in early 2013, this facility will convert fluff pulp from our mills in the U.S. South into a proprietary raw material used in diaper manufacturing by a key global customer, supplementing existing production from a similar facility in Columbus, Mississippi. At our Grande Prairie, Alberta, pulp mill, we're generating surplus green electric power from a new generator fueled by a sustainable black liquor, converting an energy expense into energy income. 
Lastly, during the quarter, we closed on the sale of our hardwoods operations in our Westwood Shipping Line. The hardwood sale, which closed on August 1, included 7 hardwood mills. Year-to-date, revenues from these operations totaled $220 million and generated a $3 million operating loss. Our Westwood sale closed on September 30. Year-to-date, revenues from this business were $180 million with no earnings. The sale of these noncore businesses allows us to focus on our long-term strategic direction. As I noted last quarter, we'll maintain a relationship with our former associates as hardwoods will continue to be a log customer, and will transport products to our Asian customers on Westwood Shipping Lines. We wish our former associates the best of success with their new owners. 
Now I'll ask Patty to discuss our outlook and provide a financial summary, and then I'll have a quick recap before we invite your questions. Patty?"

The outlook for the fourth quarter by business segment is summarized on Chart 11. I'll begin the outlook discussion with timberlands. In our Western operations, we expect lower selling prices for logs as a result of a softening export market, reflecting the backup of log inventories into China. Fee harvest volumes are also projected to be lower. In the South, we anticipate that selling prices and fee harvest volumes will be flat, as those markets did not experience the same price increases earlier in the year as did the West. We expect growth costs and silvicultural costs to increase seasonally. Excluding the effect of nonstrategic land sales, we expect that earnings in our Timberlands segment will be lower than the third quarter. Earnings from nonstrategic land sales will increase from the very low third quarter level. 
Our Wood Products business is entering what is traditionally its slowest quarter of the year. Average sales realizations are expected to decrease for both lumber and OSB, as is typical of the seasonal slowdown in the housing market. Sales realizations for engineered wood products will likely be flat. Sale volumes across all product lines are projected to be lower. We expect additional production curtailments as we match supply with demand and incur the traditional holiday downtime, especially in our lumber system. As a result, per unit manufacturing costs are expected to increase throughout our product lines although log costs should be flat to slightly down. Overall, we anticipate the loss in our Wood Products business to increase in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of this year. However, we expect that it will be less than the fourth quarter of last year, reflecting the improvements we're making in the business, as Dan described. 
In our Cellulose Fibers segment, global softwood pulp demand is weakening as a result of the high level of industry inventories and global economic uncertainty. We expect prices to soften in the fourth quarter, offset by slightly higher shipment volumes. Costs are likely to be somewhat higher for fiber, chemicals and energy due to seasonal increases. We will not have any annual maintenance shutdowns as we completed our scheduled maintenance in the first half of this year. Overall, earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment should be slightly lower in the fourth quarter compared to the third. And we expect to generate another record year of earnings in this segment. 
In our Real Estate segment, home closings are anticipated to increase over the third quarter. The fourth quarter is traditionally our strongest quarter for closings in our single-family homebuilding business. We expect approximately 600 closings compared to 508 last quarter. Prices will likely be lower, offset by slightly higher margins due to mix. Earnings in our single-family homebuilding business should be higher in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. In addition, we do have some land parcels for sale that have the potential to close in the fourth quarter. However, there are none of significance under contract at this time. 
One of our WRECO subsidiaries is a minority party to litigation relating to a joint venture in Nevada known as South Edge. A reserve for this litigation of approximately $38 million was recorded in 2008. A plan of reorganization was approved a few days ago, and we expect to make a payment of approximately $30 million in November in settlement of the litigation. 
Now I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments starting with a special tax benefit booked in the third quarter. During the third quarter, we made the decision to dividend earnings from our Canadian subsidiary to the United States. This decision triggered our ability to recognize a tax benefit for the difference between the net amount of taxes paid in previous years in Canada, which is allowed as a foreign tax credit in the United States, and the U.S. taxes due as a result of the dividend. Given our mix of taxable income in 2011, we will carry this benefit forward and anticipate utilizing the credit over the next 3 to 5 years. The full amount of the benefit of $83 million was recognized as a special item in the third quarter.
We ended the third quarter with cash of $971 million, an increase of approximately $90 million. Cash flow from operations was $117 million, and cash from the sale of assets was $157 million, primarily resulting from the sale of our hardwoods and shipping operations. 
During the quarter, we invested $66 million in capital expenditures, which brings our total expenditures through the third quarter to $159 million. We expect to spend approximately $100 million in the fourth quarter, which is in line with our earlier guidance of $250 million to $270 million for the full year. We paid $81 million in dividends and repurchased just under 1.8 million shares of our stock for approximately $29 million, at an average price of $16.41 a share. Approximately $5 million of the cash settled after the end of the quarter. These purchases helped offset the dilution from stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock that took place earlier in the year. We did not have any debt repayments in the third quarter, and we have no further debt due until next year. Earlier this month, we did repurchase approximately 12.5 million of medium-term notes due next year for less than their face value. During the fourth quarter, we will contribute approximately $60 million to our Canadian qualified pension plans. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Dan, and I look forward to your questions. Dan?"

We continue to be optimistic and bullish about long-term recovery, but our experience has shown over the last couple of years that we need to live with today's level of activity. And so that's been our focus. We have, as you noted, continued to bring down our SG&A cost. That continues to be an ongoing focus. And in our Wood Products business, our focus has been on, first of all, moving to cash-positive and then earnings-positive range. And in the Wood Products business, that takes both cost management but also top line growth. So just a couple of comments on SG&A. We made progress on SG&A as we continued to make decisions such as the sale of our shipping business and our hardwood operations that we concluded in the quarter. That allows us to focus on our ongoing operations. It does leave us with some overhead that we need to address that have supported those businesses but we've made great progress over the last several years in working down legacy costs and bringing down overall headcount across the company to become more efficient in everything that we do. In our Wood Products operations, our focus across the entire system is to bring down operating costs, and that includes manufacturing, where we need and have made progress in improving the operating efficiency and utilization of our facilities. That is, in part, related to the decision that we made during the quarter to permanently shut down these 4 facilities. We believe that we can move forward in the housing environment that we have with the facility set that we have in place. And then we have a number of initiatives to grow top line. Some of that comes from increasing markets offshore, as we discussed this morning. And some of it comes from finding opportunities where we have perhaps pricing power, where we have the ability to increase share based upon the products that we manufacture, based upon the location of our operating facilities where we may be logistically advantaged to serve some markets. And as we look at the Homebuilding business focused more on mid-size and smaller builders where we can provide products efficiently and cost effectively. We're also increasing some activity in repair and remodel market, and going back into some locations where we have not been active, where we have products that customers would like to sell and where we have an advantaged situation relative to our own manufacturing operations. So it's an ongoing effort, one where as I said this morning, I'm somewhat impatient but we're making progress and it continues to be a focus and will continue to be one. This is not a process where we get to a certain point and quit. This is an ongoing effort to improve our cost effectiveness and competitiveness, and I'm encouraged with the progress that we're making."

One, it's -- what happens in the quarter, as well as truing up the year-to-date effective rate. And maybe the way to think about the tax rate, it's a benefit of about 20% after you strip out the discrete items. So if you were to look, for example, on the analyst package, the first page that shows the consolidated statement of operations, you would see that year-to-date we have earnings of $202 million. That's the earnings from continuing operations before income taxes. So from that, take out -- we have 3 discrete items this year. The first one would be the large timberland sale. That was in the first quarter for $152 million. And then you would add back the second discrete item, which is the $26 million of loss on early extinguishment of debt. And then you would compare that to what we actually booked for income taxes, which is right below the $202 million, which is the $52 million. And that $52 million benefit, you would have to add back the third discrete item, which was the foreign tax credit. So it's the $52 million, take out the foreign tax credit benefit, take out the Willapa sale -- the timberland sale, and then also the effect of the debt extinguishment, and you'd get $15 million. So our effective rate -- benefit rate through the third quarter and for the year is just under 20% once you strip out those items. It's really a function of the year-to-date rate plus the discrete items that are in the year-to-date and truing it up.

We've had good weather this year and so log inventories should not be a problem in most areas. I think we, as well as others, are very careful in managing inventories of finished product. And the supply chain has shrunk during this entire recession. If you think about the supply chain from the manufacturers to the distributor and ultimately to the builders, we've had shrinkage in the distribution chain. Most distributors are managing their inventories much more tightly. And so as the market begins to recover, I think there'll be tension, and it'll tighten up relatively quickly. I do think the industry does have the ability to respond at a range that is likely to occur. I don't see a huge snapback in demand in the first quarter just because I think we would expect to see some seasonal improvement, unless there were some major public policy changes. I believe that the system will respond appropriately. Builders have the ability to put houses on the ground if they have sales. But I wouldn't expect a lot of speculative inventory, and I think that the recovery will happen in a measured basis."

And we commented on our last call and as I commented this morning, that played out during the third quarter. Our volumes to China were relatively unchanged in the third quarter, but would expect that there'd be some falloff in fourth quarter. Most of the slowdown has shown up in pricing. And the evidence is, if there's a buildup of inventory in China, some of that is seasonal.  Some of it clearly is caused by a tightening of credit in China that has slowed construction. There are some concerns that have been raised about overbuilding in the real estate market. We have to remind ourselves that the wood products and the logs that are being converted are not going into wood frame construction. They're used for industrial purposes, but they are used for construction forms, as well as pallets and packing. Long term, our view is that China is going to continue to grow. It's going to maintain its steady urbanization, and there would be like a continued demand for wood products coming out of North America. North America should realize its share as compared to other sources, which could be New Zealand, Russia, even Scandinavia. But we've been very encouraged by the pickup over the last couple of years.

We happen to be a builder of some for-sale multifamily, and they would be townhomes in a market like Washington D.C. But the significant change in activity that I was referring to this morning was multifamily rental. That -- in this country, that's generally low-rise. It is generally built with wood- =frame material. There's a different mix of product that are used in multifamily units. First of all, the square footage for your average multifamily unit is smaller than a detached unit. There is a higher percentage of engineered wood products and especially engineered lumber that go into a multifamily unit. That favors Weyerhaeuser Company because of our significant presence in the engineered business. And then there are also uses of OSB. OSB is primarily used in flooring, more than wall sheathing in multifamily. So you have to actually drill down into the individual products, lumber, engineered wood products and OSB, in order to establish a relative range. I can use a rough number, but it is not exact because it does vary. But roughly, the square footage of a multifamily rental unit's about half the square footage of a single-family detached unit. And I think you can roughly apply that 50% factor across the wood products consumption, but it would vary dramatically by wood product type."

We have continued to invest in capital-effective projects in our Cellulose Fibers business with the goal of driving down production costs, increasing productivity from our existing mills. And that's why I gave an example this morning of what we've just done in Grand Prairie. And we've talked on earlier calls about a longer-term initiative in our Cellulose Fibers business to be stretching out our planned routine maintenance from a 12-month schedule to an 18-month schedule. And so we seek high-ROI projects with relatively quick payback that have the benefit of increasing productivity, and also they improve our environmental footprint. We've been spending a minimal amount as necessary for safety and environmental compliance on our wood products facilities.

So as you said, when we came into the quarter, we did have an existing authorization that really dated back to 2008 for about $250 million. And we'd only used a small of that authorization in prior years. Earlier in the quarter, we purchased about $20 million of shares under that authorization. And when we came into the August board meeting, we terminated that authorization and replaced it with a new authorization for $250 million and then purchased $9 million under that authorization in the quarter. So at the end of the quarter, we had a remaining authorization of about 241 million. So as we looked at uses of cash, we do believe that share repurchase is an important tool for returning cash to shareholders. And as we've said in the past, we'll utilize that share repurchase on an opportunistic basis.

And it's a function, Chip, I believe, of a couple of things. One is some challenges in purchasing. But I think more importantly, the points that I summarized on -- in my comments this morning, I think that people are sitting on the sidelines, waiting for the signal that it's okay to go back into the home purchase market. And so there is some concern overall about consumer confidence. There's some concern in some markets about employment. I think this mobility issue is a big one where people want to maintain their -- the ability to be mobile and to take a job in a different neighborhood or a different metro area if that's what it takes. The mortgage qualification process is much more difficult than it has been even over the last 2 to 3 years. Appraisals are a challenge. Down payments are a challenge. And I think that, that's an area where we have to address some public policy issues in order to break loose a bit of activity in the system. Rents are high. In many markets, it is cheaper to own than to rent. And so people are making a choice to maintain, in effect, an option by renting before they come back into the market. We do have land that we sell to multifamily developers in some locations. So we are not an apartment builder, but where we have a multifamily land, that's been a benefit because we can sell to institutional developers of multifamily property and participate in that market.  It's also putting some pressure on labor costs because we are seeing construction labor flow to multifamily projects."

And we do sell to some buyers that use FHA financing. The challenge, quite frankly, is not the down payment. The challenge is the credit underwriting process that has become overly burdensome. And then there's a problem with appraisals because we have changed the appraisal process. It's a much more difficult one. And in some markets, the challenge is you have a willing buyer and seller for a new home, they agree on a price but the house won't appraise for that price because the appraisal includes comparables that may be foreclosures in the same metro area although that buyer wouldn't want to buy that foreclosed home. So that's one of the things that is an impediment in the system today and needs to break loose. And I think that, to some extent, the buying public is looking for the green light to go on to say it's okay to go back in and start purchasing. And what we have seen in some markets is investors coming in from offshore that are purchasing multifamily units.
