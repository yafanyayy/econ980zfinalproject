Welcome to Integrys Energy Group’s Fourth Quarter 2010 Earnings conference call.  Delivering formal remarks with me today are Charlie Schrock, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Joe O’Leary, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  Other executives, including Larry Borgard, our President and Chief Operating Officer, Utilities; Mark Radtke, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer of Integrys Energy Group and Chairman of our non-regulated subsidiary, Integrys Energy Services; and Dan Verbanac, President of Integrys Energy Services are also available for the question and answer session at the conclusion of our formal remarks.
The slide supporting today’s presentation and an associated data package are located on our website at www.integrysgroup.com, select Investor, select Presentation, and then today’s presentation.
Before I begin, I will advise everyone that this call is being recorded and will be available for replay through May 3, 2011.  I need to direct you to Slides 3 and 4 of our presentation and to point out that this presentation contains forward-looking statements within the definition of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Safe Harbor rules, including projected results for Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries.  Forward-looking statements contain factors that are beyond the ability of Integrys Energy Group to control and, in many cases, Integrys Energy Group cannot predict what factors would cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statement.  I’d also refer you to the forward-looking statement section of yesterday’s news release for further information.  Except as may be required by federal securities laws, Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in this presentation, whether the result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Slide 5 indicates that today’s presentation includes non-GAAP financial information related to diluted earnings per share adjusted and adjusted earnings or loss.  We believe that these are useful measures for providing investors with additional insight into our operating performance because they eliminate the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next.  Please review the text in the slide regarding non-GAAP financial information.
I will now turn this call over to Charlie Schrock.  Charlie?

Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us on the call today.  Before we move on with our conference call today, you will note that Steve mentioned both Mark Radtke and Dan Verbanac will be available during our question and answer session after our formal remarks are completed.  Mark has recently accepted the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer for Integrys Energy Group and he remains Chair of our non-regulated subsidiary, Integrys Energy Services.  Dan is President of Integrys Energy Services and is directly responsible for the day-to-day leadership and oversight of our non-regulated operations.  In the future, I expect you will be seeing more of Dan at our investor relations forums.
Moving on to today’s presentation, I will begin by providing a high-level overview of our 2010 fourth quarter and full year financial and operating results.  Joe O’Leary will then discuss our financial results for 2010 in greater detail, in addition to providing insights regarding our investment and financing plans for 2011 and reviewing our guidance for 2011.  We will conclude with a question and answer session.
Turning to Slide 6, I am pleased to report that our fourth quarter and full-year 2010 diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis were stronger than the same periods a year ago.  As a reminder, diluted earnings per share adjusted is how we internally evaluate our financial performance as it eliminates the effect of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next.  
Our positive financial results reflect the effective execution of our business plan.  The benefits of cost control efforts across all of Integrys Energy Group’s subsidiaries are now being seen.  Reductions in workforce at our regulated utilities, Integrys Energy Services, and our business support subsidiary along with furloughs throughout Integrys Energy Group, were key drivers of labor savings.  Our employees have been focused on minimizing non-labor costs without sacrificing safety or reliability, and this has helped drive improved financial performance.  
The solid operating performance of our electric generating fleet resulted in lower fuel and purchase power costs than were authorized to be recovered in rates and increased opportunity sales throughout our system.  Our 2010 financial results also reflect the retail rate increases for our regulated utilities that were implemented in 2010 across our various jurisdictions.  And finally, the improved realized unit margins and lower operating expenses at Integrys Energy Services enabled us to achieve our projected financial results for our non-regulated subsidiary.
We maintained our quarterly dividend at $0.68 per share.  With continued earnings growth, we expect our dividend payout ratio to decrease over time to a level that will be comparable to our utility peer group.  
To complete our high level financial overview, our guidance for 2011 diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis remains between $3.24 and $3.57, although there are some changes within our five reporting segments that Joe will discuss later.
Slide 7 provides a brief overview of the operational activities for our regulated utilities.  We completed rate cases for Upper Peninsula Power at year-end 2010 and Wisconsin Public Service in early 2011.  Our rate case for Michigan Gas Utilities was completed earlier in 2010 and subsequent to that, our appeal on the conservation decoupling mechanism in the case was successful in moving the original effective date of September 1, 2010 to a retroactive date of January 1, 2010.
We also filed for a retail rate increase for Minnesota Energy Resources on November 30, 2010.  It was accepted as complete by the state regulatory commission and interim rates went into effect on February 1, 2011.  And we announced a little more than a week ago that we filed retail natural gas rate cases for Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas, requesting rate increases to be effective in the first quarter of 2012.  Further details regarding these rate cases can be found in the appendix of our slide deck, Slides 25 through 28.
Our customers and shareholders alike benefited from the performance of our generation fleet.  Our Weston 4 plant performed well throughout the year and our operations group took steps to ensure that our entire fleet was available when needed the most, when prices when high in the Midwest independent system operator market.  As a result, our fuel and purchase power costs were less than what was in rates, resulting in customer refunds and additional earnings.
Our employees responded to external events in their usual efficient manner.  Last fall, we had what some called the Storm of the Century, a windstorm that caused more than 70,000 of our regulated electric customers in Wisconsin to be without power.  Focused and safe efforts by our employees kept the length of those power outages to a minimum, which resulted in only a modest $3 million cost impact for restoring power to our customers and zero complaints filed with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin.  Our stringent cost control efforts in this endeavor and elsewhere throughout our regulated electric utilities and our lower fuel and purchase power costs enabled our regulated electric utility segment to exceed its authorized return on equity for 2010.
In January 2010, we received Illinois Commerce Commission approval for our accelerated cast iron main replacement rider for Peoples Gas in the city of Chicago, and that project is now underway.  We are applying the same project management skills to this project that we used to construct Weston 4 power plant on time and under budget.  When completed in 2030, the main replacement project will be the largest construction project in our Company’s history.
I’m sure many of you are wondering how we have done in closing the shortfall between our actual adjusted earnings at the regulated utilities versus where we could be if all of our utilities were earning their respective authorized returns on equity.  Turning to Slide 8, there is very good news on this front as we narrowed the shortfall from a $56.8 million shortfall in 2009 to a $20.4 million in 2010.  Our February 2010 estimated target was a $37 million shortfall for 2010.  The regulated natural gas and electric segments had more adjusted earnings attributed to common shareholders in 2010 than they did in 2009.
In February 2010, we also estimated an adjusted earnings shortfall of $34 million for 2011, but we are now estimating this shortfall to grow slightly to a $37 million adjusted earnings shortfall.  As Joe will explain during his formal remarks, our guidance for 2011 diluted earnings per share adjusted for the regulated utilities is down slightly from what we gave you last November, which translates into this slight increase for the estimated shortfall compared to what we presented a year ago.  Just as we did in 2010, we intend to narrow the 2011 shortfall with continued emphasis on cost controls and the timely filing of rate cases where necessary.  It is unlikely that this adjusted earnings shortfall will reach zero, but we will continue our efforts to reduce it as much as possible.
Turning to Slide 9, let me recap the accomplishments related to our non-regulated operations at Integrys Energy Services.  Our strategy change is essentially complete.  Our recovered invested capital target of $700 million related to the sale of non-core businesses at Integrys Energy Services was achieved in April 2010, and our collateral support requirement target of $500 million related to our retail energy marketing business was achieved at year-end 2010.  That leaves us with a non-regulated energy services subsidiary company that has a reduced scope and scale and a significantly lower risk profile, leading to controlled growth.  Integrys Energy Services is now focused on retail natural gas and electric marketing in the northeast quadrant of the United States as well as solar and other renewal energy projects within selected markets in the United States.  
With that, I will now turn this call over to Joe O’Leary.  Joe?

I’ll cover our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2010 and briefly review our guidance for 2011 diluted earnings per share adjusted.  But before I do, I need to summarize an accounting policy change we made in the fourth quarter of 2010 and provide a brief commentary on bonus tax depreciation.
For our non-regulated renewable energy and solar business, we changed our method of accounting for investment tax credits, also referred to as ITC.  In the fourth quarter of 2010, we changed from the flow-through method to the deferral method which provides better matching of the benefit of these credits with the cost of the related investment.  Under the deferral method, we defer ITC in the year the credit is received and reduce the provision for income taxes over the useful life of the related property.  
Our financial statements for 2009 and 2008 were retrospectively adjusted to reflect this accounting policy change.  The impact of the policy change on net income attributed to common shareholders in 2008 was an after-tax reduction of $9.9 million in 2008, all in the fourth quarter, and an increase in subsequent years on a quarterly basis.  The annual impact on net income attributed to common shareholders in 2009 was an after-tax increase of $1.3 million.  Our 2010 full-year reported net income attributed to common shareholders includes a $900,000 positive after-tax impact as a result of this policy change.
Income attributed to common shareholders in subsequent years will be positively impacted by this accounting policy change by approximately $7.7 million after taxes over the next 13 years for renewable projects at December 31, 2010.  For additional information, see Note 1(d), Change in Accounting Policy, on Page 73 of our Form 10-K.
The tax relief, unemployment insurance reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 included the extension of cash grants related to renewable energy projects and bonus tax depreciation.  We will certainly take advantage of both of these provisions, which will improve our cash flows beginning this year.  We are currently reviewing our options regarding these matters and taking into consideration what is best for our customers and shareholders.   We will most likely further fund our employee benefit plans, defer some future planned equity issuances, and increase capital expenditures as appropriate.  These potential adjustments to our operating plan are not reflected in Slides 13 through 16 that I will discuss later on.
Now let’s move to the financial overview.  Beginning with Slide 10, during the fourth quarter of 2010 in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, we recognized diluted earnings per share of $0.91 for the quarter ended December 31, 2010 compared with $0.30 for the same quarter in 2009.  For the full year 2010 and again in accordance with GAAP, we recognized diluted earnings per share of $2.83 versus a net loss per share of $0.91 for the same period in 2009.  
This slide sets forth the additions and subtractions we have made to arrive at diluted earnings per share adjusted for the fourth quarter and full year 2010 that Charlie commented on during his opening remarks.  I won’t go through each line item here, but I will gladly answer any questions you may have during our question and answer session at the completion of our formal remarks.  The key takeaway is that for 2010, consolidated fourth quarter and full year results show strong improvement over the comparable periods in 2009, and our full year 2010 diluted earnings per share adjusted at $3.13 came in at the higher end of the guidance we provided you in November 2010.  For more information on the comparative fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009, adjusted earnings and diluted earnings per share adjusted are reported by segment on Slides 33 and 34 in the Appendix; and the comparative full year 2010 and 2009 adjusted earnings and diluted earnings per share adjusted results by segment can be found on Slides 40 and 41, also in the Appendix.
On Slide 11, we present the changes in adjusted earnings by segment for the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with the fourth quarter of 2009, and Slide 12 is a similar exhibit for the full year 2010 compared with the full year 2009.  The related key drivers for each segment can be found in the Appendix on Slides 35 through 39 for the quarter, and on Slides 42 through 46 for the full year.  I will not go through the key drivers here, but again I will answer any questions you may have on the key drivers during our question and answer session.
Moving to Slide 13, we have provided an update on our capital expenditure plans for all of our subsidiaries.  The key drivers remain the same as we have discussed recently; that is, the environmental retrofits for our regulated electric utility segment, the cast iron main replacement program for our regulated natural gas segment in Chicago, and renewable energy project investments, predominantly solar, for Integrys Energy Services.  
At Integrys Business support, we will continue to invest in infrastructure projects that support the corporate services we provide to our subsidiaries, and we will continue to invest in American Transmission Company through their annual equity calls, although these are expected to continue declining as American Transmission Company increases its self-funding of transmission projects.
Slide 14 sets forth our expected depreciation expense at the regulated utilities, and Slide 15 provides our expected net growth and regulated utility investment in property, plant and equipment - $708 million for the period 2011 through 2013.  It should be noted, however, that the net growth in rate base investment may not match what we have on this slide.  We have elected to use a revised tax strategy that may allow us to expense rather than capitalize certain costs.  This has the benefit of increasing cash flow and deferred taxes; however, deferred taxes are an offset to rate base investment.  For this reason and how we decide to apply the cash generated from bonus tax depreciation that I discussed earlier, our net growth in utility rate base investment may not be equal to what is depicted on Slide 15.
Moving to Slide 16, let me summarize the slight changes to our financing plan for 2011.  The only long-term debt we currently plan to issue in 2011 is for Peoples Gas, and it could range between $50 million and $100 million.  We also expect our stock investment plan, which includes our dividend reinvestment program, to remain on a new issue basis, and this is expected to generate $50 million of new equity during 2011.  
Our financing plan for 2011 is designed to maintain our current credit ratings.  For those who may have missed the news, Standard & Poor’s changed its outlook for Integrys Energy Group, Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas from stable to positive in January 2011.  Please refer to Slide 47 for a complete listing of our credit ratings.
Turning to Slide 17, our guidance for 2011 diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis is between $3.24 and $3.57.  This slide depicts diluted earnings per share by segment as well as the removal of one special item - the net non-cash gains related to derivative and inventory activities at Integrys Energy Services - to arrive at diluted earnings per share adjusted.  To provide a better perspective on this, I will compare this to 2010 actual results by segment and to the 2011 guidance we provided to you on our last earnings conference call on November 4, 2010 in the next two slides.
Turning to Slide 18, we have provided a waterfall chart that takes you from 2010 actual diluted earnings per share adjusted to our guidance for 2011 diluted earnings per share adjusted.  The $3.41 indicated for 2011 is at the midpoint of our guidance range for Integrys Energy Group of $3.24 and $3.57.  The chart sets forth the reasons for the change by segment.
Moving to Slide 19, we have provided our revised 2011 earnings per share guidance adjusted that we are presenting today side by side with what we presented to you on November 4, 2010.  Consolidated Integrys Energy Group’s range doesn’t change.  The only changes are between the segments themselves.  The largest movement is for the regulated natural gas segment and the change is primarily related to the impact of the increased income taxes for the Illinois utilities and a rate reduction at Wisconsin Public service.  The largest improvement comes from the holding company and other segment, and that is primarily due to expected lower net interest expense.  The other segments have been adjusted slightly to reflect refinements based on our most recent forecasts.
Our ability to retain overall consolidated guidance within the same range as discussed last fall is due to our strategy and diversified business portfolio.  Now I’ll turn the call back over to Charlie Schrock.  Charlie?

Before we take your questions, I will conclude by briefly reviewing why Integrys remains well positioned for the future.  Please turn to Slide 20.
First, the continued successful execution of our strategy is demonstrated by quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in financial performance on an adjusted basis for our consolidated company.  Our cost control efforts and the timely filing of rate cases are providing the desired results of improving our utilities’ return on equity.  Our continued investment in American Transmission Company will continue to contribute to earnings.  Additionally, the successful transition to a smaller, retail-focused non-regulated energy services company with a significantly lower risk profile has helped us to achieve our financial projections.  Our guidance for 2011 diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis remains between $3.24 and $3.57.
We look for 2011 to be a successful year for our Company, a continuation of what we accomplished in 2010.  We have maintained our quarterly dividend rate at $0.68 per share, and we remain confident that our dividend payout ratio will become more comparable with our utility peer group over time.  Finally, we continue to expect growth in diluted earnings per share adjusted of 4 to 6% on an average annualized diluted earnings per share adjusted basis with 2011 as the base year through 2015.
We will now open up the call for your questions.

Before I begin, I will advise everyone that this call is being recorded and will be available for replay through August 2, 2011. I need to direct you to Slides 3 and 4 of our presentation and to point out that this presentation contains forward-looking statements within the definition of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Safe Harbor rules, including projected results for Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries.
Forward-looking statements contain factors that are beyond the ability of Integrys Energy Group to control and, in many cases; Integrys Energy Group cannot predict what factors would cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statement. I’d also refer you to the forward-looking statement section of yesterday’s news release for further information. Except as may be required by federal securities laws, Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in this presentation, whether the result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Slide 5 indicates that today’s presentation includes non-GAAP financial information related to diluted earnings per share adjusted and adjusted earnings or loss. We believe that these are useful financial measures for providing investors with additional insight into our operating performance because they eliminate the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next. Please review the text in the slide for more information regarding this non-GAAP financial information.
I will now turn this call over to Charlie Schrock. Charlie?

I will begin by providing a high level overview of our 2011 first quarter financial and operating results. Joe O’Leary will then discuss our financial results for the quarter in greater detail, in addition to providing a summary of our investment and financing plans for 2011 we will conclude with a question and answer session.
Turning to Slide 6, I am pleased to report that first quarter 2011 diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis were stronger than the same periods a year ago. Our positive financial results reflect the effective execution of our business plan. Operational excellence initiatives and cost control efforts across all of Integrys Energy Group, subsidiaries are a key element of our plan.
Our employees have been focused on reducing cost without sacrificing safety or reliability, and this has helped drive improved financial performance.
Our first quarter 2011 financial results also reflect the retail rate increases for our regulated utilities that were implemented across our various jurisdictions. And finally, the combination of customer mix and discipline pricing higher volumes from retain business and reduced operating expenses enable us to improve on the financial results from a non-regulated business.
To complete our high level financial overview, our guidance for 2011 diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis remains between $3.24 and $3.57, with no changes among our segments.
Slide 7 provides a brief overview of the first quarter 2011 achievements for our regulated utilities. We are implementing a natural gas standardization initiative which is designed to improve processes and reduce costs. Essentially we are integrating processes and procedures at our five regulated natural gas utilities and providing common best practices where possible to increase efficiencies throughout the natural gas group. On our accelerated main replacement project at Peoples Gas responses to bid requests are coming in lower than originally anticipated.
As a result we will be able to replace more main for the dollars we spend. The efficient use of contractors will free up our own employees to work on other high value projects that require timely completions such as service work.
On the regulated electric side, the Public Service Commissioner of Wisconsin approved the environmental control equipment expenditures for the Colombia Power Plant. We jointly owned that power generating facility with other nonaffiliated utilities so our share of this environmental upgrade project will total about $200 million over the next three years.
Other activities that are regulated utilities include our rate cases. Interim rates for Minnesota Energy Resources went into effect on February 1, 2011 we expect final outcomes on the efforts leading in the first quarter of 2012. The rate cases we filed for Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas on February 15, 2011 are on schedule. We expect new rates to go into effect in mid-January of 2012.
The infrastructure rider for People Gas went to - into effect in January with customer surcharges implemented beginning April 1, 2011 for the estimated additional 2011 investment in rate base for this project. Finally, we have filed the limited rate reopened proceeding for 2011 for Wisconsin Public Service on May 2nd. We expect their resolution on the reopened by the end of 2011.
Further details regarding this rate cases, can found in the appendix of our slide deck, Slides 21 through 24.
Turning to slide eight, let me recap the accomplishments related to our non-regulated operations at Integrys Energy Services, we ended 2011 with our strategy change at Integrys Energy Services essentially complete. We now operate this business with a much lower risk profile and a focus on controlled growth. That said I am pleased to report that our retail natural gas and electric volumes for our retained businesses are up in the first quarter of 2011 versus the first quarter of 2010. See slide 25 for the detail.
Unit margins for our retail electric business increased during the first quarter of 2011 versus the first quarter of 2010, due to our customer mix and disciplined pricing. In other words, we remain focus on the appropriate blend of small, medium and large commercial and industrial customers, and see the value proposition in the commodity and related services we provide. Natural gas unit margins were down in the first quarter of 2011 versus the first quarter of 2010 partially due to fees related to our preferred supplier agreement being netted against margin.
As 2010 was a transition year, more of our supply was sourced to the agreement during the first quarter of 2011 versus the first quarter of 2010. Regarding our joint-venture with Duke Energy Generation Services, we have five new solar projects with Pennsylvania schools totaling 1.5 megawatts. Four of the solar installations were completed by April 30, 2011 and the last installation is scheduled to put into service later this summer.
I will now turn the call over to Joe O’Leary. Joe?

I will cover our financial results for the first quarter 2011 and briefly review our guidance for 2011 diluted earnings per share adjusted.
Beginning with slide nine. During the first quarter of 2011 in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP. We’ve recognized diluted earnings per share of $1.56 for the quarter ended March 31, 2011 compared with $0.64 for the same quarter in 2010.
This slide also sets for a few additions and subtractions we have made to drive the diluted earnings per share adjusted for the first quarter of 2011. As commenting on during Charlie’s opening remarks.
I won’t go through each line item here, but I will gladly answer any questions you may have during our question-and-answer session at the completion of our formal remarks. The key takeaway is that for 2011 consolidated first quarter results increased about 5% over the comparable period in 2010.
To more information on the comparative first quarters of 2011 and 2010 adjusted endings undiluted earnings per share adjusted are reported by segment on slides 28 and 29 in the appendix.
On slide 10, we present the changes in adjusted earnings by segment for the first quarter of 2011 compared with the first quarter of 2010. The related key drivers in the quarter for each segment can be found in the appendix on slides 30 to 34. I will not go through the key drivers here, but again I will answer any questions you may have related to the key drivers during our question-and-answer session.
Moving to slide 11, we’ve provided an update on our capital expenditure plans for all of our subsidiaries. The key drivers remain the same as we have discussed recently, that is the environmental retrofits and hydro upgrades mandated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for our regulated electric utility segment. The main replacement program for our regulated natural gas utility segment in Chicago and the renewable energy project investments predominately solar for Integrys Energy Services.
There are some changes in the schedule versus what we presented to you during our last conference call. Over the three-year period, the expenditures for Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas, Minnesota Energy Resources and Michigan Gas Utilities were adjusted upwards, with increase investment to fully take advantage of the cash flow from bonus tax depreciation. The slight increase at Upper Peninsula Power relates to revise estimates in the timing of certain projects.
The $26 million increase in Integrys business support consists of enhancements to our work and asset management system that is designed to automate and streamline many of our business processes and better manage regulatory compliant issues.
Slide 12 set forth our expected depreciation expense at regulated utilities. Moving to slide 13, let me summarize the slight changes to our financing plan for 2011. I will begin with our short-term credit facilities.
During the second quarter of 2011, we have $910 million of credit facility that will expire. We will replace these with $600 million of new credit facilities. This will reduce our overall credit facilities from $2 billion to $1.7 billion and that is by design. We call during our Analyst and Investor Day of presentation in February 2010, that we mentioned it was our intent to reduce our overall credit facilities to $1.7 billion by December 31, 2011 due to reduced sites and scope of Integrys Energy services.
And we are on the way to achieving that milestone. The only long-term debt we currently planned issue in 2011 is for People’s Gas and that is expected to be about $50 million. Additional cash we expect to generate from bonus tax depreciation in 2011 we have elected to eliminate new equity issuances through or stock investment and dividend reinvestment plans as well as our equity-based compensation plans. Through April 2011, we generated about $19.3 million of new equity and that will be the extensive new equity raised in 2011.
Our financing plan for 2011 is designed to maintain our current credit ratings. Please refer to slide 35 for a complete listing of our credit ratings.
Turning to slide 14, our guidance for 2011 diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis remains between $3.24 and $3.57. This slide detects diluted earnings per share by segment as well as the removal of special items, including the net non-cash payments related to derivative and inventory activities at Integrys Energy Services to arrive at diluted earnings per share adjusted.
The elimination of new issue shares to meet the needs of our stock investment, dividend reinvestment and equity-based based compensation plans is not expected to have a meaningful impact on the share account versus what we presented during our last earnings conference call.
Now I will turn the call back over to Charlie Schrock. Charlie?

Before we take your questions I will conclude by briefly reviewing why we believe Integrys is well positioned for the future. Please turn to slide 15. First, the continued successful execution of our business plan is demonstrated by quarter-over-quarter increases in financial performance on an adjusted basis for our consolidated company.
Our operational excellence initiatives, cost control efforts and the timely filing of rate cases are improving our quarter-over-quarter performance. Our 34% ownership in the American Transmission Company will continue to contribute to earnings. You may have seen that in April 2011, American Transmission Company and Duke Energy announced the creation of Duke American Transmission Company. This was a joint venture that will build, own and operate new electric transmission infrastructure in North America. This is a good step forward in American Transmission company’s efforts to expand outside its traditional footprint. But at this point, it is too early to project the impact of this joint venture.
Regarding our non-utility operations, the successful transition to a smaller retail focused non-regulated energy services companies with a significantly lower risk profile has helped us to achieve our financial projections.
Our guidance for 2011 diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis has not changed and that remains between $3.24 and $3.57. We look for 2011 to be a successful year for our company with continuation of what we accomplished in 2010.
Finally, we continue to expect growth in diluted earnings per share adjustment of 4 to 6% on an average annualized diluted earnings per share adjusted basis with 2011 as the base year through 2015.
We will now open the call all your questions.

Other executives, including Larry Borgard, our President and Chief Operating Officer of Utilities; Mark Radtke, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer of Integrys Energy Group and Dan Verbanac, President of Integrys Energy Services are also available for the question and answer session at the conclusion of our formal remarks.
The slide supporting today’s presentation and an associated data package are located on our website at www.integrysgroup.com, select Investor, select Presentation, and then today’s presentation.
Before we begin, I will advise everyone that this call is being recorded and will be available for replay through November 1, 2011. I need to direct you to Slides 3 of our presentation and to point out that this presentation contains forward-looking statements within the definition of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s Safe Harbor rules, including projected results for Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries.
Forward-looking statements contain factors that are beyond the ability of Integrys Energy Group to control and, in many cases, Integrys Energy Group cannot predict what factors would cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statement. Except as required by federal securities laws, Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in this presentation, whether the result of new information, future events or otherwise.
This slide is condensed commentary on forward-looking statements and all are encouraged to read and understand the more specific language that is contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including quarterly report on Form 10-Q we filed this morning, the forward-looking statement section of yesterday news release and slide 49 in the appendix.
Slide 4 indicates that today’s presentation includes non-GAAP financial information related to diluted earnings per share adjusted and adjusted earnings or loss. We believe that these are useful financial measures for providing investors with additional insight into our operating performance because they eliminate the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next. Please review the text of this slide for information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures.
I will now turn this call over to Charlie Schrock. Charlie?

I will begin by providing a high-level overview of our 2011 second quarter financial and operating results. And then Joe O’Leary will then discuss our financial results for the quarter in more detail, and in addition he will provide us summary of our investment and financing plans for 2011. And we will leave plenty of time for your questions at the end of course.
So turning to Slide 5, our second quarter 2011 consolidated diluted earnings per share adjusted were lower than for the same periods a year ago. Due to the seasonal nature of our energy businesses the second quarter is traditionally the weakest quarter during our financial reporting year, because of the temperate whether typical for the second quarter and lower natural gas and electric sales less favorable and offsetting factors that affect our business tend to have a greater impact in the second quarter then they would in any other quarter. So I will summarize the drivers that caused our earnings to decline this year versus last year.
On the plus side all of our natural gas service territories experienced colder weather this quarter and usage per customer excluding the impact of whether was up, the decoupling mechanism we have in place don’t cover all jurisdictions are customer classes so some of this increased usage was reflected in our quarterly results. In addition, there was an overall increase in margins in the retail markets that Integrys Energy services continues to focus on.
Offsetting these pluses were consolidated operating and maintenance expense increases, this - in public services maintenance expense was higher due to the timing of schedule plant outages, the cost for our outages are included in our revenue requirements but these costs are collected evenly over 12 months, while the actual expenses occur with the scheduled outages.
Natural gas distribution expenses were up Peoples Gas because certain cost related to the accelerated main replacement program are not included in the writer. And finally there was decrease in wholesale margins for Integrys Energy services due to the sale of the whole sale business in prior periods.
The key takeaway from today’s call is that we have narrowed our guidance for 2011 diluted earnings per share adjusted to a range of $3.30 and $3.50 and we are seeing some shifts among our reporting segments, we reduced our core earnings expectation for Integrys Energy services, although we still expect its core 2011 earnings to be more than twice what it contributed to consolidated earnings in 2010. And we have increased the earnings expectation for our natural gas utility segment. Joe will summarize the details of this in his formal remarks.
Other item I would note is the payment of our quarterly common stock divided on June 20 which marked its 71st consecutive year we have paid a dividend to our shareholder a tradition that we are proud to continue.
Slide 6, provides a brief overview of the second quarter achievements for our regulated utilities. For our regulated natural gas utility segment, our Accelerated Main Replacement program is off to a good start. As I previously mentioned we are seeing construction cost much lower than we originally budgeted, this gives us the opportunity to install more and new pipe for the same dollars, the program began in early April of this year and we are currently ramping up construction with an expected steady state rate of approximately 1 mile of new main installed per day here in Chicago.
At our regulated electric utility segment, we continued to maximize the performance of our generating plant and the interaction of those plants with the Midwest independent system operator market. Our power plants have been available when needed and we’ve been able to cycle in response to market dynamics such as on the weekends and at night when prices are lower, this operational flexibility helps to minimize our fuel and purchase power costs which provides savings for our customers.
The balance of slide 6 summarizes our current rate case activities in the various jurisdiction, at the moment we have five rate case proceedings in various stages. Additional details regarding our original filings and positions other regulators and interveners can be found in the appendix on slide 23 through 28.
Turning to slide 7, let me recap the accomplishments related to our non-regulated operations at Integrys Energy Services. Our volumes have increased by more than 6% quarter-over-quarter for retained retailed natural gas markets and retail electric volumes are essentially flat for the retained electric markets. Unit margins for both natural gas and electric increased quarter-over-quarter, there is good news regarding business retention which is holding above 95% so far this year. Dan Verbanac and his team have done a tremendous job from a transition and operational standpoint with our retail energy and marketing business.
With that said, the combination of market ways and changing market dynamics in some of the regions where we operate has resulted in growth taking longer than we originally expected. An example of one of these delays is in Illinois.
We anticipated that the regulatory framework to better facilitate retail access for small customer classes would be in place in 2010 rather than the first quarter of 2011. Consequently we do not begin offering Illinois residents electricity from Integrys Energy services until the second quarter of 2011 rather than early in the first quarter as we had originally planned.
There were so many challenges with growth initiatives that we’re implementing in other geographic markets. We’re continuing to enhance our product offerings in the markets where we operate and we’re adapting to the changing market dynamics which will help us meet our long-term growth objectives.
On a final note, the development of our solar projects is continuing according to plan. At this point our solar projects are not a meaningful contributor to our earnings, but we’re gaining experience on what we believe will eventually be a growing business as this technology continues to mature.
I’ll now turn the call over to Joe O’Leary

I will cover our financial results for the second quarter 2011 and review our guidance for 2011 diluted earnings per share adjusted.Beginning with slide 8, during the second quarter of 2011, in accordance with Generally Accepted Acco",1219,"Thank you, Charlie. I will cover our financial results for the second quarter 2011 and review our guidance for 2011 diluted earnings per share adjusted.
Beginning with slide 8, during the second quarter of 2011, in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP, we recognized diluted earnings per share of $0.37 for the quarter ended June 30th, 2011 compared with $1.02 for the same quarter in 2010.
This slide also sets forth the additions and subtractions we’ve made to arrive at diluted earnings per share adjusted for the second quarter of 2011. As this slide indicates our diluted earnings per share adjusted for the second quarter 2011 was $0.38 versus $0.48 in the same period in 2010.
I’ll gladly answer any questions you may have in our quarterly results during our question-and-answer session at the completion of our formal remarks. More information on the comparative second quarters of 2011 and 2010 adjusted earnings and diluted earnings per share adjusted is reported by segment on slide 33 and 34 in the appendix. You will also find the six month 2011 and 2010 comparative data for adjusted earnings and diluted earnings per share adjusted on slides 40 and 41 in the appendix.
On slide 9, we present the changes in adjusted earnings by segment for the second quarter of 2011 compared with the second quarter of 2010. As you can see the primary driver of the decreased earnings is our Regulated Electric Utility segment. And this was due to increased maintenance expense driven by the timing of scheduled plant outages and decreased margins which were driven by rate order difference at Wisconsin Public Service. Additional detail on the key variance drivers for each segment can be found in the appendix on slides 35 through 39.
Again, I will answer any questions you may have related to the key drivers during our question and answer session.
Slide 10 presents the changes in adjusted earnings by segment for the six months of 2011 compared with the same period in 2010. Similar to the second quarter, the primary driver of the decreased earnings for the six months is our Regulated Electric Utility Segment. This was primarily due to decreased margins which were driven by rate order difference at Wisconsin Public Service, increased maintenance expense due to the timing of scheduled plant outages and other expenses mainly related to increased interest on deferred compensation.
Moving to slide 11, we have provided an update on our capital expenditure plan for all our subsidiaries. The key drivers remain the same as we discussed in the past. That is environmental retrofits and hydroelectric plant upgrades mandated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for our Regulated Electric Utility Segment. The gas main replacement program for Peoples Gas and the renewable energy project investments predominantly solar for Integrys Energy Services.
There are some changes included in the schedule compared to what we presented to you during our last conference call. Wisconsin Public Services capital expenditures during the three year period were adjusted to reflect additional and biometal retrofit projects.
Integrys Energy services capital expenditures were also adjusted to remove the equity contributions which we will be making to Indu Solar for the three year period and we listed Indu Solar as a separate equity contribution item on the bottom of the chart.
Slide 12, sets forth our expected depreciation expense at the regulated utilities. This has not changed from what we presented in the first quarter of 2011. Slide 13 is a new slide for this quarterly call and it reflects our estimate of a projected rate base for all of our regulated utilities.
As we mentioned in our previous earnings conference call, due to the impact of bonus tax depreciation that is effective till 2013 as well as implementing a new tax strategy primarily related to Wisconsin Public Service our rate base is not projected to grow as it would have been in prior years without these tax advantage provisions in place.
Bonus tax depreciation and expensing of certain items that would otherwise be capitalized has the positive effect of increasing cash flow. It also increases accumulated deferred income taxes which is an offset to rate base.
We are making prudent use of the increased cash flow. For example, we are increasing funding to our employee benefit plans which will entirely reduce employee benefit expenses in the future as well as increased our rate base.
During the slide 14, what we summarized the slight changes to our financing plan for 2011, I will begin with our short-term credit facilities which we discussed in our last quarterly earnings conference call, the details are included in the first major and related sub bullets on this slide. With respect to our long-term debt financing we still planned to issue $50 million for Peoples Gas this year, new to this slide is the retention of approximately $30 million of Integrys Energy Groups junior subordinates notes in May of 2011 which was done to take advantage of the current low interest rate environment and reduce our overall interest expense.
As a reminder, the stock investment, dividend reinvestment and equity based compensation plans return to the use of open market purchases in May 2011. The intent of our financing plan is to provide adequate capital levels at reasonable costs and maintain our current credit ratings which are shown on slide 47 in the appendix of our slide doc.
Turning to slide 15, our guidance for 2011 diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis is between $3.30 and $3.50, this slide depicts diluted earnings per share by segment as well as the removable of special items to arrive at diluted earnings per share adjusted. As Charlie mentioned there is been some movement among the different segments.
The key changes is indicated on slide 16, included lower than expected growth wrap up in Integrys Energy Services that Charlie discussed earlier which brings our projected core earnings for this segment down by $0.10 per share on both the low end and the high-end of the range. Offsetting this are expected to gain at the regulated utilities. For the regulated natural gas utility segment we see improvements due to our cost control and operational excellence efforts as well as improved margins due to a combination of higher use per customer, higher average customer counts and improved economic conditions for certain customer classes in certain service territories.
For the regulated electric segment we see improvements due to anticipated operating and maintenance reductions for the remainder of the year, for holding company that other declined in the low end and the high end of the range is primarily related to the increased expense resulting from the tax law change at Michigan. However, you will see that we have added back the incremental $0.05 per share and arriving diluted earnings per share adjusted, because the write-off of the deferred income tax asset is an usual event, and this impact on earnings is not expected to continue in future years.
In summary, our 2011 guidance for diluted earnings per share adjusted has been revised to narrow the range. The range for our 2011 guidance for diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis now stands at $3.30 to $3.50.
Now I will turn the call back over to Charlie.

Before we taking your questions, I will highlight some of the points we made this morning. If you are following along please turn to Slide 17.
First, we continued the execution of our business plan to our operational excellence initiative our cost control efforts and the timely filing of rate cases. Our quarter-over-quarter performance is down for the reasons we explained earlier in this call. We have adjusted our guidance to reflect the performance of our various segments thus far this year and our expectations for the remainder of the year and we have narrowed the range.
Our 34% ownership in the American Transmission Company will continue to contribute to earnings. The American Transmission Company is also working to expand outside its traditional footprint, but at this point it is still too early to project the timing or the impact of such growth.
Regarding our non-regulated operations, the successful transition to a smaller retail focused and non-regulated energy services company is mostly behind us. The growth of this segment is not as strong as our earlier projections, but the segment continues to grow and we expect that it will continue to do so over the next few years and reach our expectations overtime.
Our portfolio of businesses helps us to meet our financial projections on a consolidated basis. Our portfolio includes 6 regulated utilities operating in four Midwest states our non-regulated operations operating throughout the northeast quadrant of the United States and our equity investment in ATC.
Our guidance for 2011, diluted earnings per share adjusted consolidated basis is $3.30 to $3.50, the payment of our June 20 quarterly common stock dividend marked the 71st consecutive year that we have paid a divided to our shareholders.
And finally we continue to expect to growth in diluted earnings per share adjusted of 46% on an average annualized basis due 2015 with 2011 as the base here.
We will now be happy to take your questions.

Before we begin, I will advise everyone that this call is being recorded and will be available for audio replay through February 27, 2012. 
I need to direct you to slides three of our presentation and to point out that this presentation contains forward-looking statements within the definition of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s Safe Harbor rules, including projective results for Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries.
Forward-looking statements contain factors that are beyond our ability to control and in many cases we cannot predict what factors would cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements. Except as maybe required by federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement contained in this presentation, whether the result of new information, future events or otherwise.
This slide is a condensed summary on forward-looking statements and you are encouraged to read and understand the more specific language that is contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q we filed last evening, the forward-looking statements section of yesterday news release and slide 49 in the appendix.
Slide four indicates that today’s presentation includes non-GAAP financial information related to diluted earnings per share adjusted and adjusted earnings or loss. We believe that these are useful financial measures for providing investors with additional insights into our operating performance, because they eliminate the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next. Please review the text of this slide for information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures.
I will now turn the call over to Charlie Schrock. Charlie.

I’ll begin by providing a high level overview of our 2011 third quarter financial results and some operational highlights. Joe O’Leary will then discuss our financial results for the quarter in more detail, in addition to providing a summary of our revised capital expenditures and financing plans for 2011. And as usual, we will conclude with a question-and-answer session.
Turning to slide five, the key takeaway from today’s call is that the business continues to perform in-line with expectations, allowing us to narrow our guidance for 2011 diluted earnings per share adjusted, to a range of $3.33 to $3.47. Diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis for the third quarter and year-to-date 2011 were higher than the comparable periods of 2010. Generally speaking, the primary drivers of the improvement for both, the three and nine month periods are reduced expenses across all of our segments and improved adjusted earnings at Integrys Energy Services. 
Slide six provides a brief operational update on our regulated utilities. I am pleased to report that the accelerated main replacement program for the city of Chicago is well underway. Working with our contractors and our employees, we have been able to staff up to meet the workload of this project. 
As with any major project of this kind, we’ve had to overcome numerous start-up issues. Through all of this, we are on track to spend the targeted amount for this year and we expect to have installed 165 miles of natural gas main by year-end. I congratulate the project team, our employees and our contractors for a successful first year of this project.
On September 30, 2011 the Illinois Appellate Court, First District, ruled that the Illinois Commerce Commission did not have the authority to approve the Infrastructure Cost Recovery Rider or Rider ICR for Peoples Gas. Rider ICR allows for the recovery of and return on the accelerated main replacement project costs in between rate cases. To be clear, cost recovery for the AMRP and traditional rate cases is not affected by the court decision. The court remanded the ICR portion of the 2009 Peoples Gas rate case back to the Illinois Commerce Commission, for further action in accordance with it’s decision. 
We are evaluating all of our options in response to this issue and expect to appeal the Appellate Court’s ruling to the Illinois Supreme Court. The financial impact of the Rider ICR decision for Peoples Gas is not significant in the near term. Peoples Gas will be able to retain collections done through Rider ICR through September 30. The anticipated billing for the remainder of the year are about $2 million pre tax, thus having only a minor impact on overall net income. 
Regardless of the outcome of our actions in response to the court’s ruling, we do not expect any near term change to our capital expenditure plans for the AAMRP. The dollars invested in 2011 and the dollars forecasted to be spent in 2012 are included in our projected forward-looking rate base in our current rate case. 
Additionally, since we did not enter into long-term purchase agreements with Power Holdings and Leucadia Coal Gas Plants, we are required to file a rate for Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas by August 1, 2012, for rates to be effective in mid 2013. As such, we expect that the capital expenditures for the AMRP will be included in our projected rate base for 2013 as well.
The Illinois rate case proceeding is continuing on schedule. The administrative law judges are scheduled to issue their proposed order later today. The parties will have the opportunity to provide exceptions to the proposed order over the next few weeks. In early December the judges will then issue a post exception draft order that will be sent to the commission for a full decision. 
The commission should take up the order in the first half of January, with final rates to go into effect in the second half of January 2012. The two largest issues remaining are return on equity and capital structure. 
For our regulated electric utility segment, we added the increased fuel and purchase power cost expected in 2012, related to the Environmental Protection Agencies Cross State Air Pollution Rules to our request in the Wisconsin public service limited re-opener rate case proceeding. 
We have proposed a way to mitigate the rate increase to our electric and natural gas customers in Wisconsin, by reflecting in this rate case the anticipated over collection of decoupling revenues received from electric customers in 2011 and eliminating the contributions to the Wisconsin natural gas and electric conservation program in excess of the required contribution. This reduced our requested rate increase from approximately $65 million to about $35 million for electric and results in a reduction of $7 million for natural gas. 
At the moment we have five rate case proceedings in progress in various stages throughout our jurisdictions. Additional details regarding our original filings and positions of the regulators and interveners can be found in the appendix on slides 22 through 27.
Turning to slide seven, I’ll provide you with an operational update on our non-regulated activities. For the retained markets of our retail energy marketing business, delivered sales volumes quarter-over-quarter were up for our electric business, but down for our natural gas business. The sales volume decline for the natural gas business was expected. 
Per unit margins improved within both the electric and natural gas businesses, primarily due to changes in pricing and customer mix that were implemented as part of our strategy change. Our customer retention rate for our commercial and industrial business is over 90% year-to-date and the total of contracted and delivered volumes for our retained markets are up in 2011 compared with 2010 for both natural gas and electric. 
Together with the reduced operating expenses, adjusted earnings are up substantially for the three and nine months periods in 2011 compared with the same periods a year ago. Demonstrating that our collective focus on customer mix, volumes, unit margins and cost control are successful at driving earnings growth at Integrys Energy Services. 
The progress with our solar projects is also continuing as planned and we established our entry into the compressed natural gas transportation fueling business with the acquisition of Trillium USA and Pinnacle CNG business in September. Capital commitments and the impact on our financial results for these energy related business are expected to be modest in 2011 and 2012, but we believe these additions to our company positions us for growth in the future.
I will now turn the call over to Joe O’Leary. Joe.

I’ll cover our financial results for the third quarter 2011 and review our guidance for 2011 diluted earnings per share adjusted. Beginning with slide eight, during the third quarter of 2011, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP, we recognize diluted earnings per share of $0.47 for the quarter ended September 30, 2011 compared with $0.26 for the same quarter in 2010. This slide also sets forth the additions and subtractions we have made to arrive the diluted earnings per share adjusted for the third quarter of 2011. 
Our diluted earnings per share adjusted for the third quarter 2011 was $0.43 versus $0.35 in the same period in 2010. More information on the comparative third quarters of 2011 and 2010 adjusted earnings and diluted earnings per share adjusted is reported by segment on slides 32 and 33 in the appendix. You will also find the nine month 2011 and 2010 comparative data for adjusted earnings and diluted earnings per share adjusted on slides 39 and 40 in the appendix. 
On slide nine, we present the changes and adjusted earnings by segment for the third quarter of 2011 compared with the third quarter of 2010. Additional detail on the key variance drives for each segment can be found in the appendix on slides 34 through 38. 
Slide 10 presents the changes and adjusted earnings by segment for the nine months of 2011 compared with the same period in 2010. Additional detail on the key variance drivers for each segment can be found in the appendix on sides 41 through 45. 
Moving to slide 11, we have provided an updated on our capital expenditure plans for what we presented in August for all of our entities, including compressed natural gas fueling stations for our newly formed Integrys Transportation fuel subsidiary. 
The increase for Wisconsin Public Service is due to a revision in the environmental retrofit projects at Colombia, now that we have received commission approval to move forward with them, as well as the timing for Weston three projects and other projects that are necessary due to recent environmental rule changes. For Peoples Gas the increases related to additional natural gas distribution projects in 2013, primarily related to our accelerated main replacement program. 
Slide 12 sets forth our expected deprecation expense at the Regulated Utilities. Slight modifications from what we presented in August were made for some of the entities listed on this slide, but the sum total of the modifications is largely immaterial over the three-year period for the utilities. 
Recall from a formal remarks during our last conference call that due to the accumulated differed income taxes resulting from bonus tax depreciation over the next few years, capital expenditures less depreciation is not a good proxy for rate based growth in the near term. Although our capital expenditures and estimated depreciation in 2011 through 2013 have changed modestly, the changes will not have a significant impact on our projected rate base through 2013 that we provided last August. We have replicated our projected rate base chart from our second quarter conference call and it appears in slide 46 in the appendix. 
Moving to slide 13, let me updated our financing plan for the 2011. We issued $50 million of Peoples Gas, 2.21% for its mortgage bonds on November 1, 2011. In addition to the $30 million of Integrys Energy Group’s 6.11% junior subordinated notes that we retired in May of this year, we also retired $150 million of Wisconsin Public Service’s 6.125% senior notes and $51 million of Peoples Gas tax-exempt auction rate securities in August, as well as $9.4 million of Upper Peninsula Powers, 9.32% first mortgage bonds earlier this month. 
We do not expect to issue any additional long-term debt during the remainder of 2011 and as mentioned in our last earnings conference call, we converted our stock investment dividend reinvestment and equity based compensation plans from the new issue shares to open market purchases of shares in May. The overall intent of our financing plan is to provide adequate capital levels at a reasonable cost and maintain our current credit rations, which are shown on slide 47 in the appendix of our slide deck. 
Turing to slide 14, our guidance for 2011 diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis has been narrowed to between $3.33 and $3.47. This slide depicts diluted earning per share by segment, as well as the removal of special items to arrive at diluted earnings per share adjusted. 
Slide 15 shows the changes by segment and you can see they are in three segments, Electric Transmission, Integrys Energy Services, and Holding Company and other. 
Now, I’ll turn the call back to Charley Schrock. Charley.

First, we continued the execution of our business plan through our operational excellence initiatives, our cost control efforts and the timely filing of rate cases. Our quarter and year-to-date performance improved over the same period as last year. 
Our 34% ownership in American Transmission Company will continue to contribute to earnings. The American Transmission Company is also working to expand outside its traditional footprint and is making progress on this effort, but at this point it is still too early to project the timing or the impact of such growth. 
For our non-regulated operations, the transition to a retailed focused non-regulated energy services company is progressing with growth in volumes and earnings within our retained markets. Our solar investments are progressing as planned and we have positioned ourselves for potential future growth with our recent entry into the compressed natural gas transportation fueling business. 
Our portfolio of businesses, which include regulated natural gas and electric utilities operating in Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan, non-regulated energy services operations in the North East quadrant of the Untied States and earnings from our equity investment and American Transmission Company, enables us to meet our financial objectives on a consolidated basis. 
In our guidance for 2011, diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis has narrowed to between $3.33 and $3.47. Finally, we expected growth in diluted earnings per share adjusted of 4% to 6% on an average annualized basis with 2012 as the base year through 2015.

Now, as far as - the first and fourth quarters are stronger for Integrys Energy Services, even though the electric business itself is pretty steady throughout the year. The gas business is significantly stronger in the first and fourth quarter and a good example of that in 2010, you can see that about half of our core earnings came in the fourth quarter for Integrys Energy Services.

Before we begin, I will advise everyone that this call is being recorded and will be available for audio replay through February 27, 2012. I need to direct you to slide 3 of our presentation and to point out that this presentation contains forward-looking statements within the definition of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s Safe Harbor rules, including projective results for Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries. Forward-looking statements contain factors that are beyond our ability to control and in many cases we cannot predict what factors would cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements. Except as maybe required by federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement contained in this presentation, whether the result of new information, future events or otherwise. This slide is a condensed summary on forward-looking statements and you are encouraged to read and understand the more specific language that is contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q we filed last evening, the forward-looking statements section of yesterday’s news release and slide 49 in the appendix. 
Slide 4 indicates that today’s presentation includes non-GAAP financial information related to diluted earnings per share adjusted and adjusted earnings or loss. We believe that these are useful financial measures for providing investors with additional insights into our operating performance, because they eliminate the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next. Please review the text of this slide for information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures. I will now turn the call over to Charlie Schrock. Charlie."

I’ll begin by providing a high level overview of our 2011 third quarter financial results and some operational highlights. Joe O’Leary will then discuss our financial results for the quarter in more detail, in addition to providing a summary of our revised capital expenditures and financing plans for 2011. And as usual, we will conclude with a question-and-answer session. 
Turning to slide 5, the key takeaway from today’s call is that the business continues to perform in-line with expectations, allowing us to narrow our guidance for 2011 diluted earnings per share adjusted, to a range of $3.33 to $3.47. Diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis for the third quarter and year-to-date 2011 were higher than the comparable periods in 2010. Generally speaking, the primary drivers of the improvement for both, the 3 and 9 month periods are reduced expenses across all of our segments and improved adjusted earnings at Integrys Energy Services. 
Slide 6 provides a brief operational update on our regulated utilities. I am pleased to report that the accelerated main replacement program for the city of Chicago is well underway. Working with our contractors and our employees, we have been able to staff up to meet the workload of this project. As with any major project of this kind, we’ve had to overcome numerous start-up issues. Through all of this, we are on track to spend the targeted amount for this year and we expect to have installed 165 miles of natural gas main by year-end. I congratulate the project team, our employees and our contractors for a successful first year of this project. 
On September 30, 2011 the Illinois Appellate Court, First District, ruled that the Illinois Commerce Commission did not have the authority to approve the Infrastructure Cost Recovery Rider or Rider ICR for Peoples Gas. Rider ICR allows for the recovery of and return on the accelerated main replacement project costs in between rate cases. To be clear, cost recovery for the AMRP and traditional rate cases is not affected by the court decision. The court remanded the ICR portion of the 2009 Peoples Gas rate case back to the Illinois Commerce Commission, for further action in accordance with it’s decision. We are evaluating all of our options in response to this issue and expect to appeal the Appellate Court’s ruling to the Illinois Supreme Court. The financial impact of the Rider ICR decision for Peoples Gas is not significant in the near term. Peoples Gas will be able to retain collections done through Rider ICR through September 30. The anticipated billings for the remainder of the year are about $2 million pre tax, thus having only a minor impact on overall net income. Regardless of the outcome of our actions in response to the court’s ruling, we do not expect any near term change to our capital expenditure plans for the AAMRP. The dollars invested in 2011 and the dollars forecasted to be spent in 2012 are included in our projected forward-looking rate base in our current rate case. Additionally, since we did not enter into long-term purchase agreements with Power Holdings and Leucadia Coal Gas Plants, we are required to file a rate case for Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas by August 1, 2012, for rates to be effective in mid 2013. As such, we expect that the capital expenditures for the AMRP will be included in our projected rate base for 2013 as well. The Illinois rate case proceeding is continuing on schedule. The administrative law judges are scheduled to issue their proposed order later today. The parties will have the opportunity to provide exceptions to the proposed order over the next few weeks. In early December the judges will then issue a post exception draft order that will be sent to the commission for a full decision. The commission should take up the order in the first half of January, with final rates to go into effect in the second half of January 2012. The two largest issues remaining are return on equity and capital structure. For our regulated electric utility segment, we added the increased fuel and purchase power cost expected in 2012, related to the Environmental Protection Agency’s Cross-State Air Pollution Rules to our request in the Wisconsin public service limited re-opener rate case proceeding. We have proposed a way to mitigate the rate increase to our electric and natural gas customers in Wisconsin, by reflecting in this rate case the anticipated over collection of decoupling revenues received from electric customers in 2011 and eliminating the contributions to the Wisconsin natural gas and electric conservation program in excess of the required contribution. This reduced our requested rate increase from approximately $65 million to about $35 million for electric and results in a rate reduction of $7 million for natural gas. At the moment we have five rate case proceedings in progress in various stages throughout our jurisdictions. Additional details regarding our original filings and positions of the regulators and interveners can be found in the appendix on slides 22 through 27.
Turning to slide 7, I’ll provide you with an operational update on our non-regulated activities. For the retained markets of our retail energy marketing business, delivered sales volumes quarter-over-quarter were up for our electric business, but down for our natural gas business. The sales volume decline for the natural gas business was expected. Per unit margins improved within both the electric and natural gas businesses, primarily due to changes in pricing and customer mix that were implemented as part of our strategy change. Our customer retention rate for our commercial and industrial business is over 90% year-to-date and the total of contracted and delivered volumes for our retained markets are up in 2011 compared with 2010 for both natural gas and electric. Together with the reduced operating expenses, adjusted earnings are up substantially for the 3 and 9 months periods in 2011 compared with the same periods a year ago. Demonstrating that our collective focus on customer mix, volumes, unit margins and cost control are successful at driving earnings growth at Integrys Energy Services. The progress with our solar projects is also continuing as planned and we established our entry into the compressed natural gas transportation fueling business with the acquisition of Trillium USA and Pinnacle CNG business in September. Capital commitments and the impact on our financial results for these energy related business are expected to be modest in 2011 and 2012, but we believe these additions to our company positions us for growth in the future.
I will now turn the call over to Joe O’Leary. Joe."

I’ll cover our financial results for the third quarter 2011 and review our guidance for 2011 diluted earnings per share adjusted. Beginning with slide 8, during the third quarter of 2011, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP, we recognize diluted earnings per share of $0.47 for the quarter ended September 30, 2011 compared with $0.26 for the same quarter in 2010. This slide also sets forth the additions and subtractions we have made to arrive at diluted earnings per share adjusted for the third quarter of 2011. Our diluted earnings per share adjusted for the third quarter 2011 was $0.43 versus $0.35 in the same period in 2010. More information on the comparative third quarters of 2011 and 2010 adjusted earnings and diluted earnings per share adjusted is reported by segment on slides 32 and 33 in the appendix. You will also find the 9 month 2011 and 2010 comparative data for adjusted earnings and diluted earnings per share adjusted on slides 39 and 40 in the appendix. 
On slide 9, we present the changes and adjusted earnings by segment for the third quarter of 2011 compared with the third quarter of 2010. Additional detail on the key variance drivers for each segment can be found in the appendix on slides 34 through 38. 
Slide 10 presents the changes and adjusted earnings by segment for the nine months of 2011 compared with the same period in 2010. Additional detail on the key variance drivers for each segment can be found in the appendix on sides 41 through 45. 
Moving to slide 11, we have provided an updated on our capital expenditure plans for what we presented in August for all of our entities, including compressed natural gas fueling stations for our newly formed Integrys Transportation fuel subsidiary. The increase for Wisconsin Public Service is due to a revision in the environmental retrofit projects at Colombia, now that we have received commission approval to move forward with them, as well as the timing for Weston 3 projects and other projects that are necessary due to recent environmental rule changes. For Peoples Gas the increases related to additional natural gas distribution projects in 2013, primarily related to our accelerated main replacement program. 
Slide 12 sets forth our expected deprecation expense at the Regulated Utilities. Slight modifications from what we presented in August were made for some of the entities listed on this slide, but the sum total of the modifications is largely immaterial over the 3-year period for the utilities. Recall from our formal remarks during our last conference call that due to the accumulated differed income taxes resulting from bonus tax depreciation over the next few years, capital expenditures less depreciation is not a good proxy for rate based growth in the near term. Although our capital expenditures and estimated depreciation in 2011 through 2013 have changed modestly, the changes will not have a significant impact on our projected rate base through 2013 that we provided last August. We have replicated our projected rate base chart from our second quarter conference call and it appears as slide 46 in the appendix. 
Moving to slide 13, let me update our financing plan for the 2011. We issued $50 million of Peoples Gas, 2.21% for its mortgage bonds on November 1, 2011. In addition to the $30 million of Integrys Energy Group’s 6.11% junior subordinated notes that we retired in May of this year, we also retired $150 million of Wisconsin Public Service’s 6.125% senior notes and $51 million of Peoples Gas tax-exempt auction rate securities in August, as well as $9.4 million of Upper Peninsula Power’s, 9.32% first mortgage bonds earlier this month. We do not expect to issue any additional long-term debt during the remainder of 2011 and as mentioned in our last earnings conference call, we converted our stock investment dividend reinvestment and equity based compensation plans from new issue shares to open market purchases of shares in May. The overall intent of our financing plan is to provide adequate capital levels at a reasonable cost and maintain our current credit ratings, which are shown on slide 47 in the appendix of our slide deck. 
Turing to slide 14, our guidance for 2011 diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis has been narrowed to between $3.33 and $3.47. This slide depicts diluted earnings per share by segment, as well as the removal of special items to arrive at diluted earnings per share adjusted. Slide 15 shows the changes by segment and you can see they are in three segments, Electric Transmission, Integrys Energy Services, and Holding Company and other. Now, I’ll turn the call back to Charlie Schrock. Charlie."

Before taking your questions, I’ll summarize the highlights of our call this morning. Please turn to slide 16. First, we continued the execution of our business plan through our operational excellence initiatives, our cost control efforts and the timely filing of rate cases. Our quarter and year-to-date performance improved over the same period as last year. Our 34% ownership in American Transmission Company will continue to contribute to earnings. The American Transmission Company is also working to expand outside its traditional footprint and is making progress on this effort, but at this point it is still too early to project the timing or the impact of such growth. For our non-regulated operations, the transition to a retail focused non-regulated energy services company is progressing with growth in volumes and earnings within our retained markets. Our solar investments are progressing as planned and we have positioned ourselves for potential future growth with our recent entry into the compressed natural gas transportation fueling business. Our portfolio of businesses, which include regulated natural gas and electric utilities operating in Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan, non-regulated energy services operations in the North East quadrant of the United States and earnings from our equity investment and American Transmission Company, enables us to meet our financial objectives on a consolidated basis. In our guidance for 2011, diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis has narrowed to between $3.33 and $3.47. Finally, we expect growth in diluted earnings per share adjusted of 4% to 6% on an average annualized basis with 2012 as the base year through 2015. We’ll now open the call for your questions."

Before we begin, I will advise everyone that this call is being recorded and will be available for audio replay through February 27, 2012. I need to direct you to slide 3 of our presentation and to point out that this presentation contains forward-looking statements within the definition of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s Safe Harbor rules, including projective results for Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries. Forward-looking statements contain factors that are beyond our ability to control and in many cases we cannot predict what factors would cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements. Except as maybe required by federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement contained in this presentation, whether the result of new information, future events or otherwise. This slide is a condensed summary on forward-looking statements and you are encouraged to read and understand the more specific language that is contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q we filed last evening, the forward-looking statements section of yesterday’s news release and slide 49 in the appendix. 
Slide 4 indicates that today’s presentation includes non-GAAP financial information related to diluted earnings per share adjusted and adjusted earnings or loss. We believe that these are useful financial measures for providing investors with additional insights into our operating performance, because they eliminate the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next. Please review the text of this slide for information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures. I will now turn the call over to Charlie Schrock. Charlie."

Joe O’Leary will then discuss our financial results for the quarter in more detail, in addition to providing a summary of our revised capital expenditures and financing plans for 2011. And as usual, we will conclude with a question-and-answer session. 
Turning to slide 5, the key takeaway from today’s call is that the business continues to perform in-line with expectations, allowing us to narrow our guidance for 2011 diluted earnings per share adjusted, to a range of $3.33 to $3.47. Diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis for the third quarter and year-to-date 2011 were higher than the comparable periods in 2010. Generally speaking, the primary drivers of the improvement for both, the 3 and 9 month periods are reduced expenses across all of our segments and improved adjusted earnings at Integrys Energy Services. 
Slide 6 provides a brief operational update on our regulated utilities. I am pleased to report that the accelerated main replacement program for the city of Chicago is well underway. Working with our contractors and our employees, we have been able to staff up to meet the workload of this project. As with any major project of this kind, we’ve had to overcome numerous start-up issues. Through all of this, we are on track to spend the targeted amount for this year and we expect to have installed 165 miles of natural gas main by year-end. I congratulate the project team, our employees and our contractors for a successful first year of this project. 
On September 30, 2011 the Illinois Appellate Court, First District, ruled that the Illinois Commerce Commission did not have the authority to approve the Infrastructure Cost Recovery Rider or Rider ICR for Peoples Gas. Rider ICR allows for the recovery of and return on the accelerated main replacement project costs in between rate cases. To be clear, cost recovery for the AMRP and traditional rate cases is not affected by the court decision. The court remanded the ICR portion of the 2009 Peoples Gas rate case back to the Illinois Commerce Commission, for further action in accordance with its decision. We are evaluating all of our options in response to this issue and expect to appeal the Appellate Court’s ruling to the Illinois Supreme Court. The financial impact of the Rider ICR decision for Peoples Gas is not significant in the near term. Peoples Gas will be able to retain collections done through Rider ICR through September 30. The anticipated billings for the remainder of the year are about $2 million pre tax, thus having only a minor impact on overall net income. Regardless of the outcome of our actions in response to the court’s ruling, we do not expect any near term change to our capital expenditure plans for the AAMRP. The dollars invested in 2011 and the dollars forecasted to be spent in 2012 are included in our projected forward-looking rate base in our current rate case. Additionally, since we did not enter into long-term purchase agreements with Power Holdings and Leucadia Coal Gas Plants, we are required to file a rate case for Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas by August 1, 2012, for rates to be effective in mid 2013. As such, we expect that the capital expenditures for the AMRP will be included in our projected rate base for 2013 as well. The Illinois rate case proceeding is continuing on schedule. The administrative law judges are scheduled to issue their proposed order later today. The parties will have the opportunity to provide exceptions to the proposed order over the next few weeks. In early December the judges will then issue a post exception draft order that will be sent to the commission for a full decision. The commission should take up the order in the first half of January, with final rates to go into effect in the second half of January 2012. The two largest issues remaining are return on equity and capital structure. For our regulated electric utility segment, we added the increased fuel and purchase power cost expected in 2012, related to the Environmental Protection Agency’s Cross-State Air Pollution Rules to our request in the Wisconsin public service limited re-opener rate case proceeding. We have proposed a way to mitigate the rate increase to our electric and natural gas customers in Wisconsin, by reflecting in this rate case the anticipated over collection of decoupling revenues received from electric customers in 2011 and eliminating the contributions to the Wisconsin natural gas and electric conservation program in excess of the required contribution. This reduced our requested rate increase from approximately $65 million to about $35 million for electric and results in a rate reduction of $7 million for natural gas. At the moment we have five rate case proceedings in progress in various stages throughout our jurisdictions. Additional details regarding our original filings and positions of the regulators and interveners can be found in the appendix on slides 22 through 27.
Turning to slide 7, I’ll provide you with an operational update on our non-regulated activities. For the retained markets of our retail energy marketing business, delivered sales volumes quarter-over-quarter were up for our electric business, but down for our natural gas business. The sales volume decline for the natural gas business was expected. Per unit margins improved within both the electric and natural gas businesses, primarily due to changes in pricing and customer mix that were implemented as part of our strategy change. Our customer retention rate for our commercial and industrial business is over 90% year-to-date and the total of contracted and delivered volumes for our retained markets are up in 2011 compared with 2010 for both natural gas and electric. Together with the reduced operating expenses, adjusted earnings are up substantially for the 3 and 9 months periods in 2011 compared with the same periods a year ago. Demonstrating that our collective focus on customer mix, volumes, unit margins and cost control are successful at driving earnings growth at Integrys Energy Services. The progress with our solar projects is also continuing as planned and we established our entry into the compressed natural gas transportation fueling business with the acquisition of Trillium USA and Pinnacle CNG business in September. Capital commitments and the impact on our financial results for these energy related business are expected to be modest in 2011 and 2012, but we believe these additions to our company positions us for growth in the future.
I will now turn the call over to Joe O’Leary. Joe."

The increase for Wisconsin Public Service is due to a revision in the environmental retrofit projects at Colombia, now that we have received commission approval to move forward with them, as well as the timing for Weston 3 projects and other projects that are necessary due to recent environmental rule changes. For Peoples Gas the increases related to additional natural gas distribution projects in 2013, primarily related to our accelerated main replacement program. 
Slide 12 sets forth our expected depreciation expense at the Regulated Utilities. Slight modifications from what we presented in August were made for some of the entities listed on this slide, but the sum total of the modifications is largely immaterial over the 3-year period for the utilities. Recall from our formal remarks during our last conference call that due to the accumulated differed income taxes resulting from bonus tax depreciation over the next few years, capital expenditures less depreciation is not a good proxy for rate based growth in the near term. Although our capital expenditures and estimated depreciation in 2011 through 2013 have changed modestly, the changes will not have a significant impact on our projected rate base through 2013 that we provided last August. We have replicated our projected rate base chart from our second quarter conference call and it appears as slide 46 in the appendix. 
Moving to Slide 13, let me update our financing plan for the 2011. We issued $50 million of Peoples Gas, 2.21% for its mortgage bonds on November 1, 2011. In addition to the $30 million of Integrys Energy Group’s 6.11% junior subordinated notes that we retired in May of this year, we also retired $150 million of Wisconsin Public Service’s 6.125% senior notes and $51 million of Peoples Gas tax-exempt auction rate securities in August, as well as $9.4 million of Upper Peninsula Power’s, 9.32% first mortgage bonds earlier this month. We do not expect to issue any additional long-term debt during the remainder of 2011 and as mentioned in our last earnings conference call, we converted our stock investment dividend reinvestment and equity based compensation plans from new issue shares to open market purchases of shares in May. The overall intent of our financing plan is to provide adequate capital levels at a reasonable cost and maintain our current credit ratings, which are shown on slide 47 in the appendix of our slide deck. 
Turing to Slide 14, our guidance for 2011 diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis has been narrowed to between $3.33 and $3.47. This slide depicts diluted earnings per share by segment, as well as the removal of special items to arrive at diluted earnings per share adjusted. Slide 15 shows the changes by segment and you can see they are in three segments, Electric Transmission, Integrys Energy Services, and Holding Company and other. Now, I’ll turn the call back to Charlie Schrock. Charlie."

Before taking your questions, I’ll summarize the highlights of our call this morning. Please turn to slide 16. First, we continued the execution of our business plan through our operational excellence initiatives, our cost control efforts and the timely filing of rate cases. Our quarter and year-to-date performance improved over the same period as last year. Our 34% ownership in American Transmission Company will continue to contribute to earnings. The American Transmission Company is also working to expand outside its traditional footprint and is making progress on this effort, but at this point it is still too early to project the timing or the impact of such growth. For our non-regulated operations, the transition to a retail focused non-regulated energy services company is progressing with growth in volumes and earnings within our retained markets. Our solar investments are progressing as planned and we have positioned ourselves for potential future growth with our recent entry into the compressed natural gas transportation fueling business. Our portfolio of businesses, which include regulated natural gas and electric utilities operating in Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan, non-regulated energy services operations in the North East quadrant of the United States and earnings from our equity investment and American Transmission Company, enables us to meet our financial objectives on a consolidated basis. In our guidance for 2011, diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis has narrowed to between $3.33 and $3.47. Finally, we expect growth in diluted earnings per share adjusted of 4% to 6% on an average annualized basis with 2012 as the base year through 2015. We’ll now open the call for your questions."
