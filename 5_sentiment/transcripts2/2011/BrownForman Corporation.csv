Today, we issued our fiscal 2011 third quarter earnings release, which included an updated guidance for the year. This morning, I'll focus my comments on three topics: First, I'll talk a bit about the continuation of our strong performance, then I'll address our recent announcement regarding the sale of Fetzer Vineyards, and then finally, I'll talk about our guidance for the fiscal year and how you should think about our fourth quarter. 
As you saw in our press release, both top and bottom line underlying growth trends accelerated during our third quarter on the solid performance of the prior six months. Let's review several important takeaways from our performance today. The first is that performance in our international markets remain strong, and accelerated somewhat during the nine-month period while our U.S. performance improved. Once again, the development of our business internationally continue to drive our growth, with underlying net sales growth of 7% for the nine-month period and improvement over our first half results, where our underlying net sales internationally grew 6%. International markets now account for 56% of our total reported net sales compared to 53% at the end of our last fiscal year. 
Our international growth remains broad-based, with strong gains in developed markets, including the U.K., Germany, France and Australia, as well as a number of our margin markets such as Mexico, Turkey, the Middle East and North Africa. We've also grown net sales in Brazil, reflecting the benefits of our route-to-market change made earlier in the fiscal year. 
Geographically, we are organized around five regions and duty free. For the quarter, both in terms of the company's total depletions as well as for Jack Daniel's depletions, we grew in every region. Year-to-date, Jack Daniel's also grew in every region, while in terms of the company's total depletions, all regions were up except North America, where the total portfolio experienced slight depletion decline. 
Looking specifically at the U.S. for a moment, we believe the overall spirits environment has been improving. Syndicated data show three-month trends at or better than 12-month trends. During the same three- and 12-month periods, trading up trends also improved. Using the 750 milliliter size as a guide, Brands and price segments above $20 per bottle outperformed the average. The $15 to $20 price range also grew but slower than the total market. Brands and the value price segment underperformed. 
Looking at the on-premise channel, January NABCA data would suggest that the on-premise segment continues to be somewhat erratic on a month-to-month basis. However, the 12-month trends appear to be flat. Overall, spirits appear to be growing about 2% to 3% in volume terms, while value is up around 3% to 4%. Vodka, rum and tequila had been the best performing categories in terms of case growth over the last 12 months. 
When looking at our own performance in the U.S., we have seen some improvements in the Nielsen data for Jack Daniel's while NABCA results have been mixed. During the quarter, U.S. underlying net sales improved when compared to our first half but remains soft. Our depletions in the U.S. outpace takeaway trends somewhat in the quarter as some retailer restocking and buy inspired price increases occurred. That said, even adjusting for these factors, Jack Daniel's grew during the quarter, and our overall depletion performance has improved. 
Let me comment a bit on the performance of the Jack Daniel's family of brands, where performance remains strong and led the company's growth. Year-to-date for the family, sales have grown 9% on a reported and constant currency basis, and we saw a nice growth across the family. We are working to continue the strong momentum of the brand's franchise, and as you read in this morning's press release, we are continuing to enhance the trademark to both market expansion of the current portfolio and through innovation. 
In terms of market expansion, we have been expanding ready-to-drink products, along with our higher-priced expressions, into a number of markets around the world. To further capture the consumer's interest in convenience, within the next few weeks, we expect to roll out Jack Daniel's-based RTDs in the U.S. And to take advantage of consumer's growing interest in flavor brown spirits, we expect to launch Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey next month. We believe both of these launches will build on the momentum of the parent brand, and while immaterial in terms of impact to our financial results this year, we are looking forward to the potential benefits these could play in our portfolio in the future. 
While we are very pleased with the performance of Jack Daniel's, one of our strategic aspirations over the next decade is to grow the rest of the portfolio at a faster rate than that of the Jack Daniel's family. Southern Comfort is critical to the success of this objective, and for the first nine months, the family's depletions continue to be down about 2% but this shows some improvement in the quarter when compared to the 3% decline for the first six months. 
While we remain disappointed with the performance of Southern Comfort, a number of our other brands have done particularly well, including el Jimador, New Mix, Herradura, Woodford Reserve's, Sonoma-Cutrer and Chambord. 
Looking at our gross profit performance, the growth rate was in line with our underlying net sales growth at 7% for the quarter and 4% for the nine-month period. Importantly, our cost of goods increased in line with sales. While we have seen some recent cost increases, they have been offset in large part due to our hedging of our foreign purchases, as well as the benefits from increased throughput at the Jack Daniel's distillery. 
For the quarter, our operating expenses on an underlying basis were up 7%, with advertising expenses up 5% and underlying SG&A up 8%. We continue to target our investments and adjust our mix of spending to areas that we believe best position the company for long-term growth. While we increased our advertising, we continue to invest in innovation and in our people, particularly as we build our selling capabilities related to our recent route-to-consumer changes. And as I mentioned earlier, we have two new Jack Daniel's line extensions planned for the U.S. market over the next few weeks. Additionally, as we mentioned in the earnings release, we have more innovation planned for other brands in our portfolio such as Finlandia and Southern Comfort. 
The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily related to the investments we've made in our route-to-market changes this year and the incremental pension expense that we noted in June and that we expect to see through the rest of this fiscal year. 
Now let me move on to the second topic, our recent announcement to sell Fetzer Vineyards to Viña Concha y Toro. As we announced, we have agreed to sell the Fetzer Winery, Following Facility and Vineyards, as well as and California-based wines and a facility in Paso Robles, California for a total of $238 million. As mentioned before, the sale does not include Sonoma-Cutrer or the company's long-term agency relationship with Korbel. 
Our decision to sell reflects our commitment to our strategic ambitions for the next decade, our evolving portfolio strategies and a continuation of our efforts to focus the time and resources of the company on what we believe are best opportunities for growth and shareholder return. We believe Fetzer Vineyard will be well within the Concha y Toro and we wish them well. The sale is expected to be completed in April of 2011. The effect of the gain on the sale on fiscal 2011 earnings is projected to be $0.20 to $0.30 per share. 
At this time, we are not providing guidance as to how the sale of these assets will affect fiscal 2012 earnings. We plan to talk about this in June within the context of our overall expectations for next year. To provide some context on size and what may be expected, in fiscal 2010, these brands contributed $156 million to net sales. Most of this business is in the United States. 
As part of the transition of this business, we have agreed to continue to represent the affected brands on an agency basis for up to nine months. In the U.S., we do not have a separate dedicated sales force associated with the Fetzer business. Rather than seeking significant savings in our operating costs, our intention is to refocus our U.S. sales force on higher margin, higher growth opportunities and fully support the innovation planned for the U.S. market. 
Moving to our final topic, fiscal 2011 guidance. We believe we are on track to deliver strong results for the year. We are raising and narrowing the range to $3.35 to $3.45 per share, excluding the gain expected from the sale of Fetzer. 
Let's talk a minute about foreign exchange and its impact on our earnings. We began our fiscal 2011 with exchange rates at the time were expected to negatively impact our earnings forecast by $0.15 per share. Rates have been fairly volatile throughout the year, and we expect they may remain so. With our hedged positions for the rest of the year, recent rates would now indicate that the foreign currency impact to our full year EPS outlook compared to our fiscal 2010 results is currently projected to be about a $0.04 benefit. Excluding foreign exchange, the increase in guidance is primarily related to our continued international success and strong performances of the Jack Daniel's Family of Brands as well as el Jimador. 
Let's talk for a minute about the implication of this guidance on our fourth quarter. We expect our fourth quarter to benefit from our continued year-to-date trends and underlying net sales. In addition, we expect to see easier comparables to a year ago due to SG&A expenses related to some compensation programs incurred in last year's fourth quarter that are not anticipated to recur this year. Because of this, on both the reported and an underlying operating income basis, we expect to show a significant growth rate for the fourth quarter. In determining our EPS guidance for the rest of the year, we have maintained our full year guidance for our underlying operating income at the mid-single-digit growth. With that, I will now turn the call over to Paul."

The results we reported this morning, in our view, are very strong, and year-to-date, the company is being led by Jack Daniel's Family's continued expansion around the world. For those of you who've been following",1190,"Thanks, Don, and good morning, everyone. The results we reported this morning, in our view, are very strong, and year-to-date, the company is being led by Jack Daniel's Family's continued expansion around the world. For those of you who've been following for some time, you'll notice this is not a new phenomenon. 
A particularly impressive statistic in our results that I feel is, at least, that caught my attention was the Jack Daniel's Family's constant currency sales rate, which advanced 9% year-to-date. This was led by Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey at 7% with the rest of the family was growing even faster, thereby lifting the overall growth rate to the 9%. We consider this through the first nine months of our year, one of our impressive performance statistics. 
As Don referenced, Brown-Forman sales growth outside the U.S. continues to be very broad-based, encompassing both developed and emerging markets. Countries such as Australia, France, Germany and the U.K. are all driving year-to-date underlying sales growth, but they're also that rate of growth is also being helped by Mexico, Brazil, Turkey and the Middle East and North Africa. 
I continue to be impressed by the geographic breadth of our company's growth today, both on an absolute and relative basis, and we also continue to believe that we have a large remaining opportunity for Jack Daniel's in the rest of our portfolio. 
The improving environment is certainly one contributing factor to the kind of advances that we're seeing at Jack Daniel's do we feel the quality and quantity of the comprehensive investment we place behind the Jack Daniel's family. This, of course, includes, we calculated the 5% increase in advertising and promotion investment, which would cover traditional areas such as promotion, sponsorships and advertising. But as importantly, we consider the aggregate investment level to be much higher when we take into account investments behind packaging, pricing, very importantly, the top-of-mind awareness and mixability message generated from the brand at RTDs, and of course, the people we invest behind who make all of this happen. 
We believe this more comprehensive view of brand building investment has helped Brown-Forman to elevate its underlying growth in gross profit from a 1% rate last fiscal year to 4% year-to-date in fiscal year '11. We believe we still have lots of work to do across the portfolio, most notably on Southern Comfort and our popular price whiskeys, but nonetheless, I'm really pleased with the year-to-date results, both quantitatively and qualitatively, and we continue to expect strong bottom line Q4 results, driven by a continuation of our top line growth and the expectation of favorable SG&A comparison, as a result, as Don said, we've raised our guidance again. 
I wanted to comment just a minute to Fetzer. Last week, we announced the sale of Fetzer in our hop based wines. Don referenced the rationale and all the details so I won't go into but I wanted to share a few other thoughts, if you'll permit me, there's a few passages from our internal announcement we sent to our employees last week that I thought I'd share with you, which basically references some of the Brown-Forman on behalf of these brands over the last couple of decades and read it to you. We've done some great work over the last 20 years on this wine brands, both in the market place and at the winery. When we acquired Fetzer Vineyards in 1992, the Fetzer brand was just over 1 million cases, with much of that derived from lower-priced white and red table wine expressions. Although it's been struggling a bit of late, the brand grew in our hands to over 2.6 million cases while also achieving a more premium price position. 
In the first half of our ownership of the brand, we significantly upgraded the wine grade production facilities and our production colleagues leveraged this to consistently make high quality wines. This, along with our attention to cost containment over the last many years, was critical to the profit growth that Brown-Forman enjoyed over the course of the last decade. Importantly, Fetzer provided an innovation platform for new brands such as Bonterra, Five Rivers and Little Black Dress. As a result of our work, these brands have grown to over 500,000 cases, with Bonterra and Little Black Dress adding excellent multiyear growth profile. 
Beyond their volumetric success in the marketplace, the brands became strategically symbolic to us and our many partners and stakeholders. For example, the wines produced in Hopland, most notably Bonterra and Fetzer, help advanced Brown-Forman's reputation as an environmentally-responsible and sustainable company. Because of this experience, we learned about more cyclical, agricultural-based production planning. Fetzer significantly advanced our understanding of selling in the grocery channel in the U.S. in the U.K. Additionally, Bonterra and Little Black Dress provided us all with the important relative to the brand differentiation and further, Little Black Dress exemplified our ability to build a brand that critically to important female consumer segment. 
While we'll ultimately cease our production of selling and marketing of the brand, the capabilities we developed while building them will remain with us, and I know we'll put this learning on the great use that. I wanted to share that with you because when you go forward with a disposition why you might sell the brands, we feel like we learned an incredible amount over the last two decades that will serve us very, very well. And I know people across Brown-Forman are very proud of the work that was accomplished on behalf of Fetzer over the last decades. For that work, we're estimating that the work over the years on behalf of the Fetzer in vineyard brands that we're selling will yield Brown-Forman shareholders the gain of between $0.20 and $0.30 per share so the real quantitative reward as well. Contrasting this expected gains against some of the news we've seen from the world of wine over the last many years, we are quite pleased with the outcome. 
So considering the quarter and year-to-date results and accomplishments as well as the announced Fetzer sale, I'd summarize our company's current position as follows: Our underlying top line and bottom line results are improving, and we estimate our year-to-date growth rates to be at or above the industry average. This is being driven by a broad scale international momentum and in recent months, we're starting to see improvement in the imported U.S. market. Led by Jack Daniel's, we believe our portfolio continues to evolve positively with recent acquisitions in line extensions performing well and positioning us for future growth. 
Our route-to-market continues to strengthen around the world, which we believe improves the prospects for Brown-Forman's full portfolio. Our balance sheet remains very healthy and continues to provide us great investment flexibility. The combination of our income statement growth and balance sheet strength is on improving and we estimate to be industry-leading return on invested capital. So as the global economy continues to gradually improve, we feel we're positioned well to take advantage of it. That concludes our prepared remarks this morning so I will open it up now to questions."

First, just in terms of the industry pricing environment, I think you've talked about maybe some of the retail inventory that was boosted as price increases were going into effect. So can you just quantify some of the price increases that have been announced so far? And then when you talk about the industry volume being up 2% to 4%, and then you've got I guess the dollar sales up 3% to 4%, it just still doesn't seem like there's a lot of price or mix improvement going on with the industry as a whole so just talk about how you think that, that will play out over the course of the next six to 12 months?"

In terms of what we're seeing as far as pricing goes, we've talked a lot about being very targeted and very specific on our price increases or how we're approaching pricing overall, and that continues to be true and so it's really very much on market-by-market, size-by-size. Look at the marketplace and where we have the opportunity to take some price increases we've been doing. There are, just as one example, there are a couple of markets in the United States that have taken price increases on a 175 size, which drove some buy-ins, I particularly in some of the large chain accounts, and that's a lot of what we saw in terms of the difference that we noted in the earnings release, in terms of what happened to Jack Daniel's in the U.S., in terms of our reported depletions versus kind of what we anticipate the real takeaway growth rate was around 2%."

And when you get to the three months however, it was 3.7 on volume so an improvement versus the 12-month and the dollars were 4.4. So it's 7/10 improvement. So you're starting to sell a little bit more price mix on top of slightly higher volumes in these last 90 days so we expect those would point to I think improvement in the United States on both fronts."

We definitely have been working on the innovation front. I think on the marketing communication side of it, we're continuing to try to find the right messaging at the right weight, so you'll go back, I think, some basic messaging and also really continuing to re-evaluate the marketing mix. And as we're sitting here preparing for FY '12, you can imagine the kinds of conversations we're having about how to get Southern Comfort going. I will say there continues to be a lot of competition in this flavored brown spirits arena and so I don't know how easy it will be but we clearly intend through innovation, investment and through alterations in our marketing communications to try to take another step forward on Southern Comfort. We're also being hampered a little bit by our performance of our popular priced whiskeys as well, the Canadian Mist, so when you look at volumetrically, they can pull the portfolio down as well because they're not performing up to really what we want them to be and they're clearly good-sized volumetric brands. So I think it's a combination of Southern Comfort and maybe examples I can give you about popular price spirits that are holding us back relative to the overall spirits market. But I will say the one thing we saw in the quarter that was a real, I feel, boost for a company like Brown-Forman which is whiskeys is the three-month dollar growth trend on bourbon was noticeably higher so over the basically the near in Brown-Forman's quarter, the November, December and January period, actually bourbon outgrew vodka, which is a rarity over these last many years. And so that's an impressive thing in terms of for a company such as us so we have to participate in that more fully is the way I would view that where the front spirits were not going near as much as vodka and some of the white spirits that was maybe an improvement over on that front over the holiday period."

And so history would suggest that you could expect to give back in the next quarters as a result of that, that they end up taking their inventory levels back to kind of a normal rate. So at this juncture, we're anticipating that, that might happen. Coming with the rest of your other question, channel, when we look at the on-premise versus the off-premise, the on-premise has been pretty much up and down throughout the whole fiscal year. There's certain months where you start to get hopeful that the on-premise is starting to turn around, and then they'll give us back over the next couple of months and it's been pretty much that way. When you step back and you look at over the course of the 12-month period, the trend at this juncture looks like it's about flat, which would be an improvement from where it was a year ago but certainly not getting back to the kind of robust growth that you're looking for.

I can't speak -- I haven't seen the global figures on that but if you were using the U.S. as a surrogate, wine actually, from a consumer takeaway standpoint, is by way ahead of spirits and both of them noticeably ahead of beer. Those are trends, which is of course, we saw from '97 through to about '07. There was a period where I think those leveled out but it looks like it's, for a variety of reasons, maybe continued back on that path where beers losing share beverage alcohol in the U.S."

So I don't really see any change in terms of how we think about acquisitions or how much we're looking for acquisitions. We have a couple of -- we will have hopefully a couple of million more dollars in our bank that we'd be able to use.

So there are a lot of factors you'll consider when thinking about local acquisitions.

So those are lifting the overall portfolio. And of course, they convert nicely, particularly the Super Premium whiskeys convert very nicely as it relates to upgrading from a portfolio mix within the Jack Daniel's in terms of helping the sales rate. And then you're also correct that the international markets are significantly outpacing the U.S. growth rates in order to produce the kind of growth we reported year-to-date. It's been really exciting and in some levels, even surprising year in terms of the volumetric growth that Jack Daniel's is seeing. We take note of the way that a lot of consumer price generally talk about places like Europe, and we're very enthused by the response we're getting to Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey. It also happens to be markets in Europe and other places around the world where our RTDs are doing fairly well. So we think a portfolio approach to this is really important. We think it's critical as well as been helpful to our particular efforts because of the efficiency that comes from having these branded ready-to-drinks in the marketplace.

But the breadth of growth that we've been experiencing is one of the main points we wanted to make from quarter-to-quarter, you'll call out various countries because they'll have a particularly good quarter. But when you stretch back over three to five years and look how broadly this Jack Daniel's is a accomplishing this growth, it really is sort of a an impressive statistic that's why we tend to want to call it out.

Today, we issued our fiscal 2011 third quarter earnings release, which included an updated guidance for the year. This morning, I'll focus my comments on three topics: First, I'll talk a bit about the continuation of our strong performance, then I'll address our recent announcement regarding the sale of Fetzer Vineyards and then finally, I'll talk about our updated guidance for the fiscal year and how you should think about our fourth quarter. 
As you saw in our press release, both top and bottom line underlying growth trends accelerated during our third quarter on the solid performance of the prior six months. Let's review several important takeaways from our performance today. The first is that performance in our international markets remain strong, and accelerated somewhat during the nine-month period while our U.S. performance improved. Once again, the development of our business internationally continue to drive our growth, with underlying net sales growth of 7% for the nine-month period and improvement over our first half results where our underlying net sales internationally grew 6%. International markets now account for 56% of our total reported net sales compared to 53% at the end of our last fiscal year. 
Our international growth remains broad-based, with strong gains in developed markets, including the U.K., Germany, France and Australia, as well as in a number of our emerging markets such as Mexico, Turkey, the Middle East and North Africa. We've also grown net sales in Brazil, reflecting the benefits of our route-to-market change made earlier in the fiscal year. 
Geographically, we are organized around five regions and Duty Free. For the quarter, both in terms of the company's total depletions as well as for Jack Daniel's depletions, we grew in every region. Year-to-date, Jack Daniel's also grew in every region, while in terms of the company's total depletions, all regions were up except North America, where the total portfolio experienced slight depletion declines. 
Looking specifically at the U.S. for a moment, we believe the overall spirits environment has been improving. Syndicated data show three-month trends at or better than 12-month trends. During the same three- and 12-month periods, trading up trends also improved. Using the 750 milliliter size as a guide, brands in Price segments above $20 per bottle outperformed the average. The $15 to $20 price range also grew but slower than the total market. Brands in the Value Price segment underperformed. 
Looking at the on-premise channel, January NABCA data would suggest that the On-Premise segment continue to be somewhat erratic on a month-to-month basis. However, the 12-month trends appear to be flat. Overall, spirits appear to be growing about 2% to 3% in volume terms, while value is up around 3% to 4%. Vodka, rum and tequila had been the best performing categories in terms of case growth over the last 12 months. 
When looking at our own performance in the U.S., we have seen some improvements in the Nielsen data for Jack Daniel's while NABCA results have been mixed. During the quarter, U.S. underlying net sales improved when compared to our first half but remains soft. Our depletions in the U.S. outpaced takeaway trends somewhat in the quarter, as some retailer restocking and buy ends prior to price increases occurred. That said, even adjusting for these factors, Jack Daniel's grew during the quarter and our overall depletion performance has improved. 
Let me comment a bit on the performance of the Jack Daniel's Family of Brands, where performance remains strong and led the company's growth. Year-to-date for the family, sales have grown 9% on a reported and constant currency basis, and we saw a nice growth across the family. We are working to continue the strong momentum of the brand's franchise, and as you read in this morning's press release, we are continuing to enhance the trademark to both market expansion of the current portfolio and through innovation. 
In terms of market expansion, we have been expanding ready-to-drink products, along with our higher-priced expressions, into a number of markets around the world. To further capture the consumer's interest in convenience, within the next few weeks, we expect to roll out Jack Daniel's spirit-based RTDs in the U.S. And to take advantage of consumer's growing interest in flavored Brown spirits, we expect to launch Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey next month. We believe both of these launches will build on the momentum of the parent brand. And while immaterial in terms of impact to our financial results this year, we are looking forward to the potential benefits these could play in our portfolio in the future. 
While we are very pleased with the performance of Jack Daniel's, one of our strategic aspirations over the next decade is to grow the rest of the portfolio at a faster rate than that of the Jack Daniel's family. Southern Comfort is critical to the success of this objective, and for their first nine months, the family's depletions continue to be down about 2% but this shows some improvement in the quarter when compared to the 3% decline for the first six months. 
While we remain disappointed with the performance of Southern Comfort, a number of our other brands have done particularly well, including el Jimador, New Mix, Herradura, Woodford Reserve, Sonoma-Cutrer and Chambord. 
Looking at our gross profit performance, the growth rate was in line with our underlying net sales growth at 7% for the quarter and 4% for the nine-month period. Importantly, our cost of goods increased in line with sales. While we have seen some recent cost increases, they have been offset in large part due to our hedging of our foreign purchases, as well as the benefits from increased throughput at the Jack Daniel's Distillery. 
For the quarter, our operating expenses on an underlying basis were up 7%, with advertising expenses up 5% and underlying SG&A up 8%. We continue to target our investments and adjust our mix of spending to areas that we believe best position the company for long-term growth. While we increased our advertising, we continue to invest in innovation and in our people, particularly as we build our selling capabilities related to our recent route-to-consumer changes. And as I mentioned earlier, we have two new Jack Daniel's line extensions planned for the U.S. market over the next few weeks. 
Additionally, as we mentioned in the earnings release, we have more innovation planned for other brands in our portfolio such as Finlandia and Southern Comfort. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily related to the investments we've made in our route-to-market changes this year and the incremental pension expense that we noted in June and that we expect to see through the rest of this fiscal year. 
Now let me move on to the second topic, our recent announcement to sell Fetzer Vineyards to Viña Concha y Toro. As we announced, we have agreed to sell the Fetzer winery, bottling facility and vineyards, as well as other Hopland, California-based wines and a facility in Paso Robles, California for a total of $238 million. As mentioned before, the sale does not include Sonoma-Cutrer or the company's long-term agency relationship with Korbel. 
Our decision to sell reflects our commitment to our strategic ambitions for the next decade, our evolving portfolio strategies and a continuation of our efforts to focus the time and resources of the company on what we believe are our best opportunities for growth and shareholder return. We believe Fetzer Vineyards will do well within the Concha y Toro business and we wish them well. The sale is expected to be completed in April of 2011. The effect of the gain on the sale on fiscal 2011 earnings is projected to be $0.20 to $0.30 per share. 
At this time, we are not providing guidance as to how the sale of these assets will affect fiscal 2012 earnings. We plan to talk about this in June within the context of our overall expectations for next year. To provide some context on size and what may be expected, in fiscal 2010, these brands contributed $156 million to net sales. Most of this business is in the United States. 
As part of the transition of this business, we have agreed to continue to represent the affected brands on an agency basis for up to nine months. In the U.S., we do not have a separate dedicated sales force associated with the Fetzer business. Rather than seeking significant savings in our operating costs, our intention is to refocus our U.S. sales force on higher margin, higher growth opportunities and fully support the innovation planned for the U.S. market. 
Moving to our final topic, fiscal 2011 guidance. We believe we are on track to deliver strong results for the year. We are raising and narrowing the range to $3.35 to $3.45 per share, excluding the gain expected from the sale of Fetzer. 
Let's talk a minute about foreign exchange and its impact on our earnings. We began our fiscal 2011 with exchange rates at the time were expected to negatively impact our earnings forecast by $0.15 per share. Rates have been fairly volatile throughout the year and we expect they may remain so. With our hedged positions for the rest of the year, recent rates would now indicate that the foreign currency impact to our full year EPS outlook compared to our fiscal 2010 results is currently projected to be about a $0.04 benefit. Excluding foreign exchange, the increase in guidance is primarily related to our continued international success and strong performances of the Jack Daniel's Family of Brands as well as el Jimador. 
Let's talk for a minute about the implication of this guidance on our fourth quarter. We expect our fourth quarter to benefit from our continued year-to-date trends and underlying net sales. In addition, we expect to see easier comparables to a year ago due to SG&A expenses related to some compensation programs incurred in last year's fourth quarter that are not anticipated to recur this year. Because of this, on both the reported and an underlying operating income basis, we expect to show a significant growth rate for the fourth quarter. In determining our EPS guidance for the rest of the year, we have maintained our full year guidance for our underlying operating income at the mid-single-digit growth. With that, I will now turn the call over to Paul."
256839,115508946,108789,"Brown-Forman Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Mar 08, 2011",2011-03-08,"Earnings Calls","Brown-Forman Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Don, and good morning, everyone. The results we reported this morning, in our view, were very strong. And year-to-date, the company is being led by Jack Daniel's family's continued expansion around the world. For those of you who've been following",1209,"Thanks, Don, and good morning, everyone. The results we reported this morning, in our view, were very strong. And year-to-date, the company is being led by Jack Daniel's family's continued expansion around the world. For those of you who've been following us for some time, you'll notice this is not a new phenomenon. 
A particularly impressive statistic in our results that I feel, at least that's caught my attention, was the Jack Daniel's family's constant currency sales rate which advanced 9% year-to-date. This was led by Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey at 7%, but the rest of the family was growing even faster, thereby lifting the overall growth rate to the 9%. We consider this to be, through the first nine months of our year, one of our impressive performance statistics. 
As Don referenced, Brown-Forman sales growth outside the U.S. continues to be very broad-based, encompassing both developed and emerging markets. Countries such as Australia, France, Germany and the U.K. are all driving the year-to-date underlying sales growth. But they also think that, that rate of growth is also being helped by Mexico, Brazil, Turkey and the Middle East and North Africa. 
I continue to be impressed by the geographic breadth of our company's growth today, both on an absolute and relative basis. And we also continue to believe that we have a large remaining opportunity for Jack Daniel's and the rest of our portfolio. 
The improving environment is certainly one contributing factor to the kind of advances that we're seeing on Jack Daniel's, but so do we feel the quality and quantity of the comprehensive investment we place behind the Jack Daniel's family. This of course includes a -- we calculated the 5% increase in advertising and promotion investment, which would cover traditional areas such as promotion and sponsorships and advertising. But as importantly, we consider the aggregate investment level to be much higher when we take into account investments behind packaging, pricing, very importantly, the top-of-mind awareness and mixability message generated from the branded RTDs, and of course, the people we invest behind who make all of this happen. 
We believe this more comprehensive view of brand building investment has helped Brown-Forman to elevate its underlying growth in gross profit from a 1% rate last fiscal year to 4% year-to-date in fiscal year '11. We believe we still have lots of work to do across the portfolio, most notably on Southern Comfort and our popular price whiskeys. But nonetheless, I'm really pleased with the year-to-date results both quantitatively and qualitatively. And we continue to expect strong bottom line Q4 results, driven by a continuation of our top line growth and the expectation of favorable SG&A comparisons. As a result, as Don said, we've raised our guidance again. 
I wanted to comment just a minute on Fetzer. Last week, we announced the sale of Fetzer in our Hopland-based wines. Don referenced the rationale and all the details so I won't go into that. But I wanted to share a few other thoughts and if you'll permit me, there's a few passages from our internal announcement we sent to our employees last week that I thought I'd share with you, which basically references some of the work Brown-Forman did on behalf of these brands over the last couple of decades and I'll just read it to you. 
We've done some great work over the last 20 years on these wine brands both in the market place and at the winery. When we acquired Fetzer Vineyards in 1992, the Fetzer brand was just over 1 million cases, with much of that derived from lower-priced white and red table wine expressions. Although it's been struggling a bit of late, the brand grew in our hands to over 2.6 million cases while also achieving a more premium price position. 
In the first half of our ownership of the brand, we significantly upgraded the winery and production facilities and our production colleagues leveraged this to consistently make high quality wines. This, along with our attention to cost containment over the last many years, was critical to the profit growth that Brown-Forman enjoyed over the course of the last decade. Importantly, Fetzer provided an innovation platform for new brands such as Bonterra, Five Rivers and Little Black Dress. As a result of our work, these brands have grown to over 500,000 cases, with Bonterra and Little Black Dress adding excellent multiyear growth profiles. 
Beyond their volumetric success in the marketplace, the brands became strategically symbolic to us and our many partners and stakeholders. For example, the wines produced in Hopland, most notably Bonterra and Fetzer, helped advance Brown-Forman's reputation as an environmentally responsible and sustainable company. Because of this experience, we learned about more cyclical, agricultural-based production planning. Fetzer significantly advanced our understanding of selling to the grocery channel in the U.S. and U.K. Additionally, Bonterra and Little Black Dress reminded us all of the importance of relevant branding differentiation. And further, Little Black Dress exemplified our ability to build a brand to the critically important Female Consumer segment. 
While we'll ultimately cease our production, selling and marketing of the brand, the capabilities we developed while building them will remain with us, and I know we'll put this learning to great use for the many growth initiatives that await us. I wanted to share that with you because when you go forward with a disposition why you might sell the brands, we feel like we learned an incredible amount over the last two decades that will serve us very, very well. And I know people across Brown-Forman are very proud of the work that was accomplished on behalf of Fetzer over those last two decades. For that work, we're estimating that the work over the years on behalf of the Fetzer Vineyard brand that we're selling will yield Brown-Forman shareholders a gain of between $0.20 and $0.30 per share, so the real quantitative reward as well. Contrasting this expected gains against some of the news we've seen from the world of wine over the last many years, we are quite pleased with the outcome. 
So considering the quarter and year-to-date results and accomplishments as well as the announced Fetzer sale, I'd summarize our company's current position as follows: Our underlying top line and bottom line results are improving, and we estimate our year-to-date growth rates to be at or above the industry average. This is being driven by a broad scale international momentum and in recent months, we're starting to see improvement in the imported U.S. market. Led by Jack Daniel's, we believe our portfolio continues to evolve positively with recent acquisitions and line extensions performing well and positioning us for future growth. 
Our route-to-market continues to strengthen around the world, which we believe improves the prospects for Brown-Forman's full portfolio. Our balance sheet remains very healthy and continues to provide us great investment flexibility. The combination of our income statement growth and balance sheet strength have been improving in what we estimate to be industry-leading return on invested capital. So as the global economy continues to gradually improve, we feel we're positioned well to take advantage of it. That concludes our prepared remarks this morning so I will open it up now to questions."

First, just in terms of the industry pricing environment, I think you've talked about maybe some of the retail inventory that was boosted as price increases were going into effect. So can you just quantify some of the price increases that have been announced so far? And then when you talk about the industry volume being up 2% to 4%, and then you've got I guess the dollar sales up 3% to 4%, it just still doesn't seem like there's a lot of price or mix improvement going on with the industry as a whole. So just talk about how you think that, that will play out over the course of the next six to 12 months?"

In terms of what we're seeing as far as pricing goes, we've talked a lot about being very targeted and very specific on our price increases or how we're approaching pricing overall and that continues to be true. And so it's really very much on market-by-market, size-by-size. Look at the marketplace and where we have the opportunity to take some price increases we've been doing. There are -- just as one example, there are a couple of markets in the United States that have taken price increases on a 175 size, which drove some buy-ins, particularly in some of the large chain accounts. And that's a lot of what we saw in terms of the difference that we noted in the earnings release, in terms of what happened to Jack Daniel's in the U.S. in terms of our reported depletions versus kind of what we anticipate the real takeaway growth rate was around 2%."

With the 12-month volumetrics for distilled spirits were plus 2.9 and the dollars were 3.2 so you had a subtle, maybe 3/10 improvement associated with price or mix. And when you get to the three months however, it was 3.7 on volume so an improvement versus the 12-month and the dollars were 4.4, so it's 7/10 improvement. So you're starting to see a little bit more price mix on top of slightly higher volumes in these last 90 days. So we expect those would point to I think improvement in the United States on both fronts."

We definitely have been working on the innovation front. I think on the marketing communication side of it, we're continuing to try to find the right messaging at the right weight. So you'll go back to the, I think, some basic messaging and also really continuing to re-evaluate the marketing mix. And as we're sitting here preparing for FY '12, you can imagine the kinds of conversations we're having about how to get Southern Comfort going. I will say there continues to be a lot of competition in this flavored brown spirits arena. And so I don't know how easy it will be but we clearly intend through innovation, investment and through alterations in our marketing communications to try to take another step forward on Southern Comfort. We're also being hampered a little bit by our performance of our popular priced whiskeys as well, the Canadian Mist early attempt. So when you look at it volumetrically, they can pull the portfolio down as well because they're not performing up to what we want them to be and they're clearly good-sized volumetric brands. So I think it's a combination of Southern Comfort and maybe examples I can give you in popular priced spirits that are holding us back relative to the overall spirits market. But I will say the one thing we saw in the quarter that was a real, I feel, boost for a company like Brown-Forman which is -- is whiskeys. The three-month dollar growth trend on bourbon was noticeably higher. So over the -- basically, the year-end Brown-Forman's quarter, the November, December and January period, exploit bourbon outgrew vodka, which is a rarity over these last many years. And so that's an impressive thing in terms of -- for a company such as us, so we just got to participate in that more fully is the way I would view that. But I think versus what we are seeing back last summer where the brown spirits were not growing near as much as vodka and some of the white spirits, that was maybe an improvement over on that front over the holiday period."

And when you to look at the retail buy-in for the quarter, it was primarily in the U.S. or a couple of other markets where we saw some buy-in, it was primarily in the U.S. And it was, as I mentioned before, pretty much all around some chained buy-in activities around price increases. And so history would suggest that you could expect to give back in the next quarter as a result of that, that they end up taking their inventory levels back to kind of a normal rate. So at this juncture, we're anticipating that, that might happen. Coming with the rest of your other question, channel. When we look at the on-premise versus the off-premise, the on-premise has been pretty much up and down throughout the whole fiscal year. There are certain months where you start to get hopeful that the on-premise is starting to turn around, and then they'll give us back over the next couple of months and it's been pretty much that way. When you step back and you look at it over the course of the 12-month period, the trend at this juncture looks like it's about flat, which would be an improvement from where it was a year ago but certainly not getting back to the kind of robust growth that you're looking for.

I can't speak -- I haven't seen the global figures on that. But if you were using the U.S. as a surrogate, wine actually, from a consumer takeaway standpoint, is by way ahead of spirits and both of them noticeably ahead of beer.

So there are a lot of factors you'll consider when thinking about local acquisitions.

Don will begin our call this morning with a few remarks about our performance, our recent announcement regarding Fetzer and our guidance. Paul will provide additional commentary.
As always, this morning's conference call contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Numerous risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in these statements. Many of the factors that will determine the future results are beyond the company's ability to control or predict. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, and the company undertakes no obligation to update any of these statements, whether due to new information, future events or otherwise.
This morning, we issued a press release containing our results for the fiscal 2011 third quarter. The results can be found on our website under the section titled Investor Relations. We have listed in the press release a number of the risks and factors that you should consider in conjunction with our forward-looking statements. Other significant risk factors are described in our Form 10-K, Form 8-K and Form 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
During this call, we also will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures and the reasons management believes they provide useful information to investors regarding the company's financial conditions and results of operations are contained in the press release.

Today, we issued our fiscal 2011 third quarter earnings release, which included an updated guidance for the year. This morning, I'll focus my comments on three topics: First, I'll talk a bit about the continuation of our strong performance, then I'll address our recent announcement regarding the sale of Fetzer Vineyards and then finally, I'll talk about our updated guidance for the fiscal year and how you should think about our fourth quarter. 
As you saw in our press release, both top and bottom line underlying growth trends accelerated during our third quarter on the solid performance of the prior six months. Let's review several important takeaways from our performance to date. The first is that performance in our international markets remained strong and accelerated somewhat during the nine-month period while our U.S. performance improved. Once again, the development of our business internationally continued to drive our growth, with underlying net sales growth of 7% for the nine-month period and improvement over our first half results where our underlying net sales internationally grew 6%. International markets now account for 56% of our total reported net sales compared to 53% at the end of our last fiscal year. 
Our international growth remains broad-based, with strong gains in developed markets, including the U.K., Germany, France and Australia, as well as in a number of emerging markets such as Mexico, Turkey, the Middle East and North Africa. We've also grown net sales in Brazil, reflecting the benefits of our route-to-market change made earlier in the fiscal year. 
Geographically, we are organized around five regions and Duty Free. For the quarter, both in terms of the company's total depletions as well as for Jack Daniel's depletions, we grew in every region. Year-to-date, Jack Daniel's also grew in every region, while in terms of the company's total depletions, all regions were up except North America, where the total portfolio experienced slight depletion declines. 
Looking specifically at the U.S. for a moment, we believe the overall spirits environment has been improving. Syndicated data show three-month trends at or better than 12-month trends. During the same three- and 12-month periods, trading up trends also improved. Using the 750 milliliter size as a guide, brands in price segments above $20 per bottle outperformed the average. The $15 to $20 price range also grew but slower than the total market. Brands in the Value Price segment underperformed. 
Looking at the on-premise channel, January NABCA data would suggest that the On-Premise segment continued to be somewhat erratic on a month-to-month basis. However, the 12-month trends appear to be flat. Overall, Spirits appear to be growing about 2% to 3% in volume terms, while Value is up around 3% to 4%. Vodka, rum and tequila have been the best performing categories in terms of case growth over the last 12 months. 
When looking at our own performance in the U.S., we have seen some improvement in the Nielsen data for Jack Daniel's while NABCA results have been mixed. During the quarter, U.S. underlying net sales improved when compared to our first half but remained soft. Our depletions in the U.S. outpaced takeaway trends somewhat in the quarter, as some retailer restocking and buy-ins prior to price increases occurred. That said, even adjusting for these factors, Jack Daniel's grew during the quarter and our overall depletion performance has improved. 
Let me comment a bit on the performance of the Jack Daniel's Family of Brands, where performance remains strong and led the company's growth. Year-to-date for the family, sales have grown 9% on a reported and constant currency basis, and we saw a nice growth across the family. We are working to continue the strong momentum of the brand's franchise, and as you read in this morning's press release, we are continuing to enhance the trademark to both market expansion of the current portfolio and through innovation. 
In terms of market expansion, we have been expanding ready-to-drink products, along with our higher-priced expressions, into a number of markets around the world. To further capture the consumer's interest in convenience, within the next few weeks, we expect to roll out Jack Daniel's spirit-based RTDs in the U.S. And to take advantage of consumers' growing interest in flavored brown spirits, we expect to launch Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey next month. We believe both of these launches will build on the momentum of the parent brand. And while immaterial in terms of impact to our financial results this year, we are looking forward to the potential benefits these could play in our portfolio in the future. 
While we are very pleased with the performance of Jack Daniel's, one of our strategic aspirations over the next decade is to grow the rest of the portfolio at a faster rate than that of the Jack Daniel's family. Southern Comfort is critical to the success of this objective, and for the first nine months, the family's depletions continue to be down about 2% but this shows some improvement in the quarter when compared to the 3% decline for the first six months. 
While we remain disappointed with the performance of Southern Comfort, a number of our other brands have done particularly well, including el Jimador, New Mix, Herradura, Woodford Reserve, Sonoma-Cutrer and Chambord. 
Looking at our gross profit performance, the growth rate was in line with our underlying net sales growth at 7% for the quarter and 4% for the nine-month period. Importantly, our cost of goods increased in line with sales. While we have seen some recent cost increases, they have been offset in large part due to our hedging of our foreign purchases, as well as the benefits from increased throughput at the Jack Daniel's Distillery. 
For the quarter, our operating expenses on an underlying basis were up 7%, with advertising expenses up 5% and underlying SG&A up 8%. We continue to target our investments and adjust our mix of spending to areas that we believe best position the company for long-term growth. While we increased our advertising, we continue to invest in innovation and in our people, particularly as we build our selling capabilities related to our recent route-to-consumer changes. As I mentioned earlier, we have two new Jack Daniel's line extensions planned for the U.S. market over the next few weeks. 
Additionally, as we mentioned in the earnings release, we have more innovation planned for other brands in our portfolio such as Finlandia and Southern Comfort. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily related to the investments we've made in our route-to-market changes this year and the incremental pension expense that we noted in June and that we expect to see through the rest of this fiscal year. 
Now let me move on to the second topic, our recent announcement to sell Fetzer Vineyards to Viña Concha y Toro. As we announced, we have agreed to sell the Fetzer winery, bottling facility and vineyards, as well as other Hopland, California-based wines and a facility in Paso Robles, California for a total of $238 million. As mentioned before, the sale does not include Sonoma-Cutrer or the company's long-term agency relationship with Korbel. 
Our decision to sell reflects our commitment to our strategic ambitions for the next decade, our evolving portfolio strategies and a continuation of our efforts to focus the time and resources of the company on what we believe are our best opportunities for growth and shareholder return. We believe Fetzer Vineyards will do well within the Concha y Toro business and we wish them well. The sale is expected to be completed in April of 2011. The effect of the gain on the sale on fiscal 2011 earnings is projected to be $0.20 to $0.30 per share. 
At this time, we are not providing guidance as to how the sale of these assets will affect fiscal 2012 earnings. We plan to talk about this in June within the context of our overall expectations for next year. To provide some context on size and what may be expected, in fiscal 2010, these brands contributed $156 million to net sales. Most of this business is in the United States. 
As part of the transition of this business, we have agreed to continue to represent the affected brands on an agency basis for up to nine months. In the U.S., we do not have a separate dedicated sales force associated with the Fetzer business. Rather than seeking significant savings in our operating costs, our intention is to refocus our U.S. sales force on higher margin, higher growth opportunities and fully support the innovation planned for the U.S. market. 
Moving to our final topic, fiscal 2011 guidance. We believe we are on track to deliver strong results for the year. We are raising and narrowing the range to $3.35 to $3.45 per share, excluding the gain expected from the sale of Fetzer. 
Let's talk a minute about foreign exchange and its impact on our earnings. We began our fiscal 2011 with exchange rates at the time were expected to negatively affect our earnings forecast by $0.15 per share. Rates have been fairly volatile throughout the year and we expect they may remain so. With our hedged positions for the rest of the year, recent rates would now indicate that the foreign currency impact to our full year EPS outlook compared to our fiscal 2010 results is currently projected to be about a $0.04 benefit. Excluding foreign exchange, the increase in guidance is primarily related to our continued international success and strong performances of the Jack Daniel's Family of Brands as well as el Jimador. 
Let's talk for a minute about the implication of this guidance on our fourth quarter. We expect our fourth quarter to benefit from our continued year-to-date trends and underlying net sales. In addition, we expect to see easier comparables to a year ago due to SG&A expenses related to some compensation programs incurred in last year's fourth quarter that are not anticipated to recur this year. Because of this, on both the reported and an underlying operating income basis, we expect to show a significant growth rate for the fourth quarter. In determining our EPS guidance for the rest of the year, we have maintained our full year guidance for our underlying operating income at the mid-single digit growth. With that, I will now turn the call over to Paul."

The results we reported this morning, in our view, were very strong. And year-to-date, the company is being led by Jack Daniel's family's continued expansion around the world. For those of you who've been following",1210,"Thanks, Don, and good morning, everyone. The results we reported this morning, in our view, were very strong. And year-to-date, the company is being led by Jack Daniel's family's continued expansion around the world. For those of you who've been following us for some time, you'll notice this is not a new phenomenon. 
A particularly impressive statistic in our results that I feel, at least that's caught my attention, was the Jack Daniel's family's constant currency sales rate which advanced 9% year-to-date. This was led by Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey at 7%, but the rest of the family was growing even faster, thereby lifting the overall growth rate to the 9%. We consider this to be, through the first nine months of our year, one of the more impressive performance statistics. 
As Don referenced, Brown-Forman sales growth outside the U.S. continues to be very broad-based, encompassing both developed and emerging markets. Countries such as Australia, France, Germany and the U.K. are all driving the year-to-date underlying sales growth. But they’re also -- that rate of growth is also being helped by Mexico, Brazil, Turkey and the Middle East and North Africa. 
I continue to be impressed by the geographic breadth of our company's growth today, both on an absolute and relative basis. And we also continue to believe that we have a large remaining opportunity for Jack Daniel's and the rest of our portfolio. 
The improving environment is certainly one contributing factor to the kind of advances that we're seeing on Jack Daniel's, but so too do we feel the quality and quantity of the comprehensive investment we placed behind the Jack Daniel's family. This of course includes a -- we calculated a 5% increase in advertising and promotion investment, which would cover traditional areas such as promotion and sponsorships and advertising. But as importantly, we consider the aggregate investment level to be much higher when we take into account investments behind packaging, pricing, very importantly, the top-of-mind awareness and mixability message generated from the branded RTDs, and of course, the people we invest behind who make all of this happen. 
We believe this more comprehensive view of brand building investment has helped Brown-Forman to elevate its underlying growth in gross profit from a 1% rate last fiscal year to 4% year-to-date in fiscal year '11. We believe we still have lots of work to do across the portfolio, most notably on Southern Comfort and our popular price whiskeys. But nonetheless, I'm really pleased with the year-to-date results both quantitatively and qualitatively. And we continue to expect strong bottom line Q4 results, driven by a continuation of our top line growth and the expectation of favorable SG&A comparisons. As a result, as Don said, we've raised our guidance again. 
I wanted to comment just a minute on Fetzer. Last week, we announced the sale of Fetzer and our Hopland-based wines. Don referenced the rationale and other details so I won't go into that. But I wanted to share a few other thoughts and if you'll permit me, there's a few passages from our internal announcement we sent to our employees last week that I thought I'd share with you, which basically references some of the work Brown-Forman did on behalf of these brands over the last couple of decades and I'll just read it to you. 
We've done some great work over the last 20 years on these wine brands both in the market place and at the winery. When we acquired Fetzer Vineyards in 1992, the Fetzer brand was just over 1 million cases, with much of that derived from lower-priced white and red table wine expressions. Although it's been struggling a bit of late, the brand grew in our hands to over 2.6 million cases while also achieving a more premium price position. 
In the first half of our ownership of the brand, we significantly upgraded the winery and production facilities and our production colleagues leveraged this to consistently make high quality wines. This, along with our attention to cost containment over the last many years, was critical to the profit growth that Brown-Forman enjoyed over the course of the last decade. Importantly, Fetzer provided an innovation platform for new brands such as Bonterra, Five Rivers and Little Black Dress. As a result of our work, these brands have grown to over 500,000 cases, with Bonterra and Little Black Dress adding excellent multiyear growth profiles. 
Beyond their volumetric success in the marketplace, the brands became strategically symbolic to us and our many partners and stakeholders. For example, the wines produced in Hopland, most notably Bonterra and Fetzer, helped advance Brown-Forman's reputation as an environmentally responsible and sustainable company. Because of this experience, we learned about more cyclical, agricultural-based production planning. Fetzer significantly advanced our understanding of selling to the grocery channel in the U.S. and U.K. Additionally, Bonterra and Little Black Dress reminded us all of the importance of relevant brand differentiation. And further, Little Black Dress exemplified our ability to build a brand to the critically important Female Consumer segment. 
While we'll ultimately cease our production, selling and marketing of the brands, the capabilities we developed while building them will remain with us, and I know we'll put this learning to great use on the many growth initiatives that await us. I wanted to share that with you because when you go forward with a disposition while you might sell the brands, we feel like we learned an incredible amount over the last two decades that will serve us very, very well. And I know people across Brown-Forman are very proud of the work that was accomplished on behalf of Fetzer over those last two decades. For that work, we're estimating that the work over the years on behalf of the Fetzer Vineyard brand that we're selling will yield Brown-Forman shareholders a gain of between $0.20 and $0.30 per share, so there’s a real quantitative reward as well. Contrasting this expected gain against some of the news we've seen from the world of wine over the last many years, we are quite pleased with the outcome. 
So considering the quarter and year-to-date results and accomplishments as well as the announced Fetzer sale, I'd summarize our company's current position as follows: Our underlying top line and bottom line results are improving, and we estimate our year-to-date growth rates to be at or above the industry average. This is being driven by a broad scale international momentum and in recent months, we're starting to see improvement in the important U.S. market. Led by Jack Daniel's, we believe our portfolio continues to evolve positively with recent acquisitions and line extensions performing well and positioning us for future growth. 
Our route-to-market continues to strengthen around the world, which we believe improves the prospects for Brown-Forman's full portfolio. Our balance sheet remains very healthy and continues to provide us great investment flexibility. The combination of our income statement growth and balance sheet strength yields an improving and what we estimate to be industry-leading return on invested capital. So as the global economy continues to gradually improve, we feel we're positioned well to take advantage of it. That concludes our prepared remarks this morning so I will open it up now to questions."

First, just in terms of the industry pricing environment, I think you've talked about maybe some of the retail inventory that was boosted as price increases were going into effect. So can you just quantify some of the price increases that have been announced so far? And then when you talk about the industry volume being up 2% to 4%, and then you've got I guess the dollar sales up 3% to 4%, it just still doesn't seem like there's a lot of price or mix improvement going on with the industry as a whole. So just talk about how you think that, that will play out over the course of the next six to 12 months?"

So that's what's driving the difference in terms -- at least what we've seen and what we're seeing in the syndicated data is fairly consistent there. In terms of what we're seeing as far as pricing goes, we've talked a lot about being very targeted and very specific on our price increases or how we're approaching pricing overall and that continues to be true. And so it's really very much on market-by-market, size-by-size. Look at the marketplace and where we have the opportunity to take some price increases we've been doing it. There are -- just as one example, there are a couple of markets in the United States that have taken price increases on the 175 size, which drove some buy-ins, particularly in some of the large chain accounts. And that's a lot of what we saw in terms of the difference that we noted in the earnings release, in terms of what happened to Jack Daniel's in the U.S., in terms of our reported depletions versus kind of what we anticipate the real takeaway growth rate was around 2%."

Where the 12-month volumetrics for distilled spirits were plus 2.9 and the dollars were 3.2 so you had a subtle, maybe 3/10 improvement associated with price or mix. And then when you get to the three months, however, it was 3.7 on volume so an improvement versus the 12-month and the dollars were 4.4, so a 7/10 improvement. So you're starting to see a little bit more price mix on top of slightly higher volumes in these last 90 days. So we expect those would point to I think improvement in the United States on both fronts."

We definitely have been working on the innovation front. I think on the marketing communication side of it, we're continuing to try to find the right messaging at the right weight. So you'll go back to the, I think, some just basic messaging and also really continuing to re-evaluate the marketing mix. And as we're sitting here preparing for FY '12, you can imagine the kinds of conversations we're having about how to get Southern Comfort going. I will say there continues to be a lot of competition in this flavored brown spirits arena. And so I don't know how easy it will be but we clearly intend through innovation, investment and through alterations in our marketing communications to try to take another step forward on Southern Comfort. We're also being hampered a little bit by our performance of our popular priced whiskeys as well, the Canadian Mist early attempt. So when you look at it volumetrically, they can pull the portfolio down as well because they're not performing up to where we want them to be and they're fairly good-sized volumetric brands. So I think it's a combination of Southern Comfort and maybe examples like I’m giving in popular priced spirits that are holding us back relative to the overall spirits market. But I will say the one thing we saw in the quarter that was a real, I feel, boost for a company like Brown-Forman which is -- is whiskey skewed is the three-month dollar growth trend on bourbon was noticeably higher. So over the -- basically, the mirroring Brown-Forman's quarter, the November, December and January period, actually bourbon outgrew vodka, which is a rarity over these last many years. And so that's an impressive thing in terms of -- for a company such as us, so we just got to participate in that more fully is the way I would view that. But I think versus what we were seeing back last summer where the brown spirits were not growing near as much as vodka and some of the white spirits, that was maybe an improvement on that front over the holiday period."

I can't speak -- I haven't seen the global figures on that. But if you were using the U.S. as a surrogate, wine actually, from a consumer takeaway standpoint, is slightly ahead of spirits and both of them noticeably ahead of beer. Those were trends, of course, we saw from '97 through to about '07. There was a period where I think those leveled out but it looks like it's, for a variety of reasons, maybe continued back on that path where beer’s losing share beverage alcohol in the U.S."

We have a couple of -- we will have hopefully a couple of million more dollars in our bank that we'd be able to use.

So there are a lot of factors you'll consider when thinking about local acquisitions.

But also, the super premium expressions, particularly Gentleman Jack over these last many years. So those are lifting the overall portfolio. And of course they convert nicely, particularly the super premium whiskeys convert very nicely as it relates to upgrading from a portfolio mix within the Jack Daniel's in terms of helping the sales rate. And then you're also correct that the international markets are significantly outpacing the U.S. growth rates in order to produce the kind of growth we're reporting year-to-date. It's been a really exciting and in some levels, even surprising year in terms of the volumetric growth that Jack Daniel's is seeing. We take note of the way that a lot of consumer products companies generally are talking about places like Europe, and we're very enthused by the response we're getting to Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey. It also happens to be markets in Europe and other places around the world where our RTDs are doing fairly well. So we think a portfolio approach to this is really important. We think it's critical, as well as been helpful to our particular efforts because of the efficiency that comes from having these branded ready-to-drinks in the marketplace.

But the breadth of growth that we've been experiencing is one of the main points we wanted to make. From quarter-to-quarter, you'll call out various countries because they'll have a particularly good quarter. But when you stretch this back over three to five years and look how broadly Jack Daniel's is accomplishing its growth, it really is sort of an impressive statistic.

This morning, we issued our fiscal 2011 earnings release that also included our current expectations for fiscal 2012. Fiscal 2011 was a record year for Brown-Forman with earnings per share at $3.90. Excluding the $0.26",2003,"Thanks, Ben. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we issued our fiscal 2011 earnings release that also included our current expectations for fiscal 2012. Fiscal 2011 was a record year for Brown-Forman with earnings per share at $3.90. Excluding the $0.26 gain on the sale of our Hopland-based wine business and certain one-time tax benefits, earnings per share was up 18% to $3.57. These results were supported by underlying net sales growth of 4%, an acceleration over fiscal '10  when we reported underlying net sales growth of 1%. 
For the first half of fiscal 2011, we had the underlying sales growth of 2%, and in the second half, that growth accelerated to 5%. As a result of various cost improvements and efficiencies gained, our underlying gross profit accelerated even more, growing 5% fiscal 2011 compared to 1% the previous year. 
Underlying operating income growth came in at 6%, similar to last year, as we increased investments in our route-to-consumer, as well as in brand investments, both in overseas markets, as well as in support of various brand innovations introduced in fiscal '11. 
Looking forward, we expect to build on our success and grow our underlying operating income and fiscal 2012 in the mid to high single-digits. We also expect our net sales trends to further accelerate as a result of additional portfolio and geographic expansion, innovation, investment in our brands and the improved focus driven by recent changes in our route-to-consumer  approach in various markets. 
Returning to fiscal '11, our performance led to a strong total shareholder return of 28%, 11% points higher than the S&P 500's total shareholder return of 17%. Our long-running theme at Brown-Forman continues to be a great long-term investment has not changed, and we believe that both our performance in fiscal 2011 and our expectations for fiscal 2012 continue to support that belief. 
Instead of recapping our results, which you read in our earnings results this morning, I'd like to take the next few minutes to discuss the recent trends and their interest in our thinking about fiscal '12, including the pricing and cost environment, innovation and trends in various regional operating environments. I'll also provide you some detail around how we think about our sensitivity to foreign exchange movements and our recent wine sales. 
So let me start with pricing and cost trends. Our fiscal 2011 was another difficult and challenging year for pricing. The opportunity to take prices up was not widespread. However, as I've mentioned on previous calls, discounting was not as prevalent this year. For the year, our price mix globally was up about 1%, but it was driven more by mix benefits. Looking forward, we anticipate a slightly improved pricing environment for fiscal '12, and we will continue to seek opportunities to increase prices when and where appropriate. 
Although pricing opportunities were few in fiscal 2011, we were able to grow our gross profit at a faster rate than our net sales. This is largely due to production efficiencies, resulting from greater consumer demand for our Jack Daniel's products. We also benefited from various cost reductions such as consolidating some bottling operations and renegotiating some copacking logistics contracts. Additionally, we decreased the use and costs of value-added packaging versus the prior year. Having said that, we expect the cost environment to be more difficult in fiscal 2012. Both grain and fuel prices have increased sharply this spring, reaching levels last seen in 2008. At these levels, we would expect that these higher costs, coupled with the challenging pricing environment, will put pressure on our ability to grow gross profit at the same rate of sales next year. 
Let me speak a bit about innovation as this has been taking on an increasingly more important role for our company. Similar to fiscal 2010, in fiscal 2011, we introduced many types of innovations, including new products, wine extensions, new packaging and new ways of communicating with consumers, including expanded use of social media just to name a few. 
Starting first with line extensions, brand extensions such as Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, Chambord Vodka, Southern Comfort Lime and Early Times 354 Bourbon were all introduced in fiscal 2011. We plan to build on these innovations in fiscal '12, particularly with Tennessee Honey. Tennessee Honey only started shipping at the very end of fiscal 2011, and will really be more of a fiscal 2012 launch. It is early in the launch, but results so far have been very encouraging. Anecdotally, we have seen a lot of excitement from both the trade and consumers alike. 
For the rollout, the advertising campaign employs both traditional advertising such as TV and new media such as Twitter.  In fact, according to our recent article in the New York Times, we were the first ever alcohol company, and Tennessee Honey was the first various brand to advertise on Twitter. The Twitter activity was coupled with targeted ads and video content on Facebook. Because this is a flavor extension off of Jack Daniel's and line priced with Black Label, we are expecting strong early pipeline fill, which may disproportionately benefit our first quarter sales trends. Having said that, we are also investing heavily to support its rollout so the benefits that we see at the net sales line in the first quarter may not fall to the operating income line. 
Returning again to our fiscal 2011 innovations, Jack Daniel's third based RTDs were extended into a number of new markets, following considerable expansion in 2010. The success of Jack Daniel's RTD products have significantly accelerated the growth of the Jack Daniel's trademark.  In fiscal 2011, global RTD depletions for Jack Daniel's grew nearly 17% over $5.5 million 9 leader cases, and were on important and fast growing profit source. In addition to offering convenience to loyal consumers, we believe the millions of brand in the hand consumer impression that RTDs provide serves a broader role in introducing consumers to the iconic Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey brand. 
In addition to building on fiscal 2011 introductions and line expansion of new products and line extensions such as Tennessee Honey and RTDs, we have a number of additional new product innovations for 2012 that we plan to launch for a number of our brands, both in the U.S., as well as overseas. Beyond new products and line extensions, there has been quite a bit of new packaging innovations brought to the consumer.  In fiscal 2011, new packaging was rolled out for Southern Comfort, Herradura, Chambord and Tuaca. We plan to continue introducing new packaging in fiscal 2012, and in fact, the introduction of refined packaging for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey and Finlandia is already underway.  Based on our consumer research, we expect these enhancements to strengthen the presentation of these brands in the marketplace. 
Moving on to what we see in various regional operating environments. The source of our earnings growth in fiscal 2011 was broad-based and came from both developed and emerging markets around the world. Starting with Western Europe, we saw a year-over-year gain and underlying the sales in market such as the U.K., Germany, France and Spain. We are particularly proud of our performance in Western Europe, as we took market share and grew the business in a region where most countries are seeing declines in total distilled spirits. In all of these markets, the Jack Daniel’s Family has been the primary driver of our growth, reinforcing our belief in the global potential of the trademark. While some of our competitors seem to be diverting efforts away from developed markets, particularly in Western Europe, we have continued to grow.  And while we continue to see economic headwinds in many of these markets, our Western Europe is a region we expect to see continued growth in fiscal '12. 
Our largest developed market, the United States, remain a challenge for us, as net sales declined slightly during the year. As noted earlier, we have seen some recent improvement in the pricing environment. Overall, we expect to gain share in the United States next year, mostly as a result of our innovation efforts and improvement in our brand trends. 
Our emerging markets business contribute significantly to the company's underlying net sales growth, providing 40% of our incremental underlying net sales growth for the year. Growth in the emerging markets was broad-based and came from a number of different countries, but Mexico and Turkey, being our 2 largest contributors. We believe emerging markets will continue to be important for our long-term growth story as we work to capture the world of opportunity available to our brands. 
Looking at the business overall, we are pleased with the breadth in our global growth that we experienced in fiscal '11, and expect to see this broad-based growth continue and accelerate in fiscal '12. We anticipate that all of our regions, including the United States will grow next year, and in most cases, accelerate the growth rates. 
Foreign exchange rates continue to play a large role in our year-to-date reported results, particularly at the significant volatility over the past few years. Fiscal 2011  began with expectations of tremendous foreign exchange headwinds and ended with meaningful benefits. 
Looking to fiscal 2012 in our guidance, at this time, we estimate that the impact will be immaterial. As you think about how changes in foreign exchange rates could affect our fiscal 2012 EPS, given our current hedge positions, a 10% weaker U.S. dollar would benefit EPS by approximately $0.20., while a 10% stronger U.S. dollar would do the reverse. The goal of our foreign exchange hedging policy is to reduce volatility to our earnings and cash flows, and remain the rolling 24 months hedge approach in which we hedged 50% of the exposure in our major currencies over the first 12-month period, and 20% of that exposure over the next 12-month period. Currently, approximately 40% of our total exposure is hedged one-year out. 
Let's move on, speak to the recent sale of our Hopland-based wine business. We anticipate that the overall impact for the sale for fiscal '12 will be to dilute our earnings per share by $0.16, reflecting the absence of their contribution to our brand profit and including our expectations from transition services income. The sale of these wine brands was a result of the strategic decision to reposition the portfolio and focus the organization on brands where we believe we have the greatest potential for long-term growth and returns. 
In addition to a accelerating growth in our spirit brands, another example of where we plan to refocus our efforts is in support of the innovation work we are doing, particularly in 2012 with the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey. One more thing to note about the sale of our Hopland-based wine business, environmental stewardship has always been a hallmark for Brown-Forman. But Fetzer for Bonterra, it was an integral part of their brand stories and part of the fabric of everything they did. To honor that legacy which began with the Fetzer family and was advanced in their Brown-Forman's ownership, we used $2 million to establish the Brown-Forman Environmental Sustainability Foundation to provide funds to nonprofit organizations for future sustainability projects. 
In closing, in fiscal 2011, we improved our already strong financial position by delivering another year of record results. Our net sales and gross profit trends improved over the prior year, and we expect to continue to improve those trends for fiscal 2012 through continued innovation, market expansion, brand development, reproject underlying operating income to grow in the mid to high single-digits for the coming year. As we look at fiscal '12 and beyond, long-term, we are confident that we can capitalize on substantial growth opportunities that exist, and as the global economy continues to improve and consumer trends become increasingly more favorable, those growth opportunities will increase serving to further our goal of building the company forever. 
At this point, let me turn the call over to Paul for some thoughts on our growth other than just fiscal 2012."

Woodford Reserve and Sonoma-Cutrer continue to perform very well and the tequila and Chambord trademarks had a strong year. In my view, their best year under Brown-Forman ownership, fueled in part by important packaging changes. 
While we're still working to improve the performance of our U.S. and global Southern Comfort businesses, I'm generally pleased with the breath of our geographic and portfolio growth. Our improved underlying P&L metrics in F'11 are trending toward the profile of our underlying P&L metrics of fiscal year '08, the year just before the global financial crisis and resulting recession. This caused us to reflect on the last 3 fiscal years since FY '08 to see how the company has performed and progressed. So I thought I might touch on this both financially and strategically. 
Financially, we estimate that our underlying operating income growth of about 5% over the last 3 years was in the top-tier of the industry. At the same time, we believe that Brown-Forman's return on invested capital which progressed over the period from 17% to 20% was very consistently at the top of the industry. We believe this is a testament to the organic growth possibilities for our brands and company, the brand building capabilities of our people and the company's ability to smartly contain costs at the time when we believe the conditions demanded it. 
From a brand perspective, it's no surprise that during this period we were led by the continued strength of the Jack Daniel's trademark globally. The majority of the trademark incremental sales growth came from Jack Daniel's Black Label, but we also saw very important contributions from both Jack Daniel's RTDs and Gentleman Jack over the period. Beyond the Jack Daniel's trademarks, Finlandia, the tequilas brands, led by Eddie McGauran Herradura and our developing brands of Woodford Reserve, Chambord and Sonoma-Cutrer, all showed growth in underlying net sales for the period. These brands and others remain important to the company's long-term growth and ambitions. 
Shifting to a geographic view of this, the company was strongly led by our International business, with developed markets, Australia, France, Germany and the United Kingdom leading the way, but accompanied by emerging geographies such as Mexico and Turkey. From smaller basis, other emerging markets also contributed to underlying sales growth in South East Asia, Thailand, Singapore and Indonesia, India, Latin America, we saw Chile and Argentina grow, the Middle East, North Africa and the CIS also made nice contributions. It really is pleasing to see that these markets which are so important to our long-term future are also contributing nicely to the company today. 
We are pleased that everyone of our geographic regions grew their underlying operating income over the 3 years. Now given the breadth of our business today and considering the economic difficulties, there's so many countries and regions have experienced over the last 36 months. We are really proud of our employees worldwide for delivering bottom-line growth so broadly. 
Shifting to our use of cash. Over the period, we made excellent use of the strong cash flows generated by our business. From fiscal year '9 tru 11, our business generated almost $1.7 billion from operations and we added another $265 million from the sale of wine assets. So here's how we used these almost $2 billion in cash. 
We first invested behind capital projects and working capital to the tune of $246 million, we reduced net debt by $695 million and the remaining $1 billion was returned to shareholders via ordinary dividend of $524 million, a special dividend of $145 million and share repurchases of $333 million. So in total, we returned 51% of our cash over the 3 years to shareholders by using 36% to reduced net debt and 13% of fund our businesses capital requirements. At a time when access to capital was restricted like no other in recent history, Brown-Forman's cash flow is as strong as ever, and we believe we put them to excellent use on the Biafra shareholders. 
During this challenging 3 years, this generation and use of cash, combined with our underlying growth and operating income and strong ROIC and able Brown-Forman shareholders to enjoy a 13% total shareholder return. This return compares quite favorably to the S&P 500's 2% total return over the same challenging period. 
In addition to these key financial metrics for the period, we also made very meaningful strategic progress to the company over the last 3 years. First of all, the changes in economic conditions propelled us to reevaluate and ultimately reaffirm our strategic direction, while adding important new dimensions and emissions. With enduring growth and superior returns being critical aspects of our ongoing strategy, we look again at the portfolio and chose to sell most of our wine brands for a solid gain. We believe this will enable us to focus on higher value added efforts against both existing and new brands. 
An additional element of our portfolio strategy is to strengthen, and in most cases, broaden the portfolio brands we are taking into key markets. Not too long ago, a major barrier to this ambition was our limited influence over the route-to-consumer, particularly in international markets. Over the last decade, we've made steady progress in improving our influence over end markets sales and marketing activities in key countries around the world. In the last 3 years on additional strategic steps on this front. 
In some cases, this was more dramatic as in Germany and Brazil. In other cases, it was more subtle as in the U.S., Canada, Turkey, the Netherlands and in several countries throughout Eastern Europe including Russia. In all cases, it required strategic investment, patience and new forms of partnering both internally and externally. 
In addition to our portfolio and route-to-consumer, I'm proud of the organizational capabilities we developed and demonstrated over this last 3 years. This include an improved ability to innovate around both existing and new brand expressions, a better harnessing of today's new media alternatives, giving us better access to consumers and the ability to adjust our messaging based on their feedback. A more comprehensive consideration of what our 2 investment is behind our brands going beyond simply the AMP line of the income statement, an improved understanding of our brand build equity by being part of the consumer social interaction with other consumers, a stronger cost containment and efficiency mindset, a more proactive approach in the arena of corporate social responsibility, and lastly, a much better practice of diversity inclusion. I believe these enhanced capabilities were important contributors to our success over the last 3 years.  
And in closing, I'm pleased with the company's progress, both financial and strategic, as we bring F'11 to a close. As important, I believe this progress has positioned Brown-Forman for continued strong growth and return in fiscal year '12 and beyond. Thanks for your time this morning and now we'll open it up to questions."

I think the one-time impact, I mean, it's always from sort of week-to-week and month-to-month transitions you make with transitioning from old package to new package, but we don't anticipate there being anything more dramatic than any other normal packaging change we made. You've got to remember, we do this globally skew-by-skew, and it gets phased in over, to be honest, several months. So I wouldn't anticipate anything there.  And I think that package changes, as we do it with all of our portfolio, we just try to keep them as current and appropriate for the marketplace as the times demand.  And of course, with Jack Daniel's, we look at that much more closer than we would other brands because of the power of its primary presentation, its package, but there's no there is few things in the press about it was refined actually interesting and in some ways helpful, too. We consider what we've done with the Jack Daniel's package to be similar to prior packaging evolutions, very evolutionary in nature, honoring a lot of the old time look and feel of the brand. But also, making it sure that's working really, really well in the marketplace. And a couple of aspects of it that I personally like is I think it has helped the brand present itself in countries around the world as a more global package. A lot of the early work on Jack Daniel's course was designed for its home market, the U.S.  And so as we've gone around and made changes over the last 10, 15, 20 years, we've made some changes to it that has made it either appealing or just a little bit more relevant in some of the international markets. So again, that's an evolutionary story. I actually think it's important too for us to continue to look at all aspects of the Jack Daniel's packaging because it gets copied so much. I mean, it's just such a powerful package and shape and presentation in a lot of whiskey brands, look particularly to Jack Daniel's particularly the follow it. And so my personal view is were going to regularly sort of make sure Jack Daniel's is looking as unique and different and as contemporary as it needs to be, while of course honoring all of the old-time and iconic look and feel of it."

But if given the choice today just almost routinely taking prices up without consideration for what the consumption impact is, particularly if you can't, if you're not growing those volumes, I mean, I would reference to some of the recent statistics study closely, but I would observe that the beer segment in the United States has been more aggressive and price is really coming I think at the expense of some of the losing some of their occasions.  And if I look at the overall growth in the United States market, for example, in terms of spirits relative to beer, the spirits categories already enjoyed I think a premium position relative than many of the beer segments.  And when I think about some of us being different between on-premise and off-premise, just taking the prices up at levels like you might have seen in '05, '06, '07, I just don't know to be realistic to expect that we can get that to date or if that's a good choice for many of our brands. in some essences, we haven't taken prices up more aggressively because there may be repositioning, we've been taken some pricing on some brands down because of repositioning.

We continue to be hedged around 55%, 57% on our commodities. But we won't be as protected next year as we were this last year.

And in essence, what we're doing with this is asking our people to look at this as an investment in the U.S. operation to go implement against the sort of key priorities, which I mean, I would list a few of them are to of course get our most significant brands businesses in the United States performing at our expectation. And in many instances that includes above the market growth, and that starts with Jack Daniel's and Southern Comfort. But then also goes to many of the new ideas that we've been bringing into the United States, a lot of these then to be line expansions. But the sale of these brands enable the people to redirect their attention to getting these brands established in the market place and having an impact.  And we've done this before at various times that we call it route-to-consumer  strategic investments where you have a lag time often between the investments you make and the results they produced.

But I expect us to starting with this fiscal year to start to recoup some of that loss profitability, and then in future years to surpass it. That was the idea of this strategically.  And it also add, and we've been pretty consistent about this with the sale of those brand. It wasn't that they weren't profitable for Brown-Forman, it's just that they returned challenged which is one of the big topics that has consistently been reinforced about our line business.  And in addition, it was whether or not they were growing. It's one thing for them to have a base of profitability, those things, which direction it was heading.

It's not like it's new that we weren't really competing with other divisions and didn't really pay much attention to them. The only thing I would've observed over the last 12 months really is Fortune's probably putting as much as any competitor on downward pricing pressure in the United States, and you can see that in their price mix pretty strongly. Actually I think it's pretty good that our brands, particularly the Jack Daniel's, continues to hold up pretty well despite that. In other areas where we have direct competition with them, it has been more impactful, maybe I would say the Canadian business. But then thinking about them as a competitor worldwide, post any type of restructuring for them, I mean, like I said, we consider them to be one of the many competitors we've got very directly around the world.  We're used to competing with them. I mean, the way I would think about it is we've -- when I study the performance of, say, the example of Jack Daniel's relative to Jim Beam in terms of overall performance over the last, say, 10 or 15 years, the ultimate result, I think, speaks from themselves. So we've got a lot of work to do to make sure that we continue that.

This morning, we issued our fiscal 2011 earnings release that also included our current expectations for fiscal 2012. Fiscal 2011 was a record year for Brown-Forman with earnings per share at $3.90. Excluding the $0.26",2005,"Thanks, Ben. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we issued our fiscal 2011 earnings release that also included our current expectations for fiscal 2012. Fiscal 2011 was a record year for Brown-Forman with earnings per share at $3.90. Excluding the $0.26 gain on the sale of our Hopland-based Wine business and certain one-time tax benefits, earnings per share was up 18% to $3.57. These results were supported by underlying net sales growth of 4%, an acceleration over fiscal 2010  when we reported underlying net sales growth of 1%. 
For the first half of fiscal 2011, we had underlying sales growth of 2%, and in the second half, that growth accelerated to 5%. As a result of various cost improvements and efficiencies gained, our underlying gross profit accelerated even more, growing 5% fiscal 2011 compared to 1% the previous year. 
Underlying operating income growth came in at 6%, similar to last year, as we increased investments in our route-to-consumer, as well as in brand investments, both in overseas markets, as well as in support of various brand innovations introduced in fiscal '11. 
Looking forward, we expect to build on our success and grow our underlying operating income in fiscal 2012 in the mid- to high-single digits. We also expect our net sales trends to further accelerate as a result of additional portfolio and geographic expansion, innovation, investment in our brands and the improved focus driven by recent changes in our route-to-consumer approach in various markets. 
Returning to fiscal '11, our performance led to a strong total shareholder return of 28%, 11% points higher than the S&P 500's total shareholder return of 17%. Our long-running theme at Brown-Forman continues to be a great long-term investment has not changed, and we believe that both our performance in fiscal 2011 and our expectations for fiscal 2012 continue to support that belief. 
Instead of recapping our results, which you read in our earnings release this morning, I'd like to take the next few minutes to discuss some recent trends and their influence in our thinking about fiscal '12, including the pricing and cost environment, innovation and trends in various regional operating environments. I'll also provide you some detail around how we think about our sensitivity to foreign exchange movements and our recent wine sales. 
So let me start with pricing and cost trends. Our fiscal 2011 was another difficult and challenging year for pricing. The opportunity to take prices up was not widespread. However, as I've mentioned on previous calls, discounting was not as prevalent this year. For the year, our price mix globally was up about 1%, but it was driven more by mix benefits. Looking forward, we anticipate a slightly improved pricing environment for fiscal '12, and we will continue to seek opportunities to increase prices when and where appropriate. 
Although pricing opportunities were few in fiscal 2011, we were able to grow our gross profit at a faster rate than our net sales. This is largely due to production efficiencies, resulting from greater consumer demand for our Jack Daniel's products. We also benefited from various cost reductions such as consolidating some bottling operations and renegotiating some co-packing logistics contracts. 
Additionally, we decreased the use and costs of value-added packaging versus the prior year. Having said that, we expect the cost environment to be more difficult in fiscal 2012. Both grain and fuel prices have increased sharply this spring, reaching levels last seen in 2008. At these levels, we would expect that these higher costs, coupled with the challenging pricing environment, will put pressure on our ability to grow gross profit at the same rate of sales next year. 
Let me speak a bit about innovation as this has been taking on an increasingly more important role for our company. Similar to fiscal 2010, in fiscal 2011, we introduced many types of innovations, including new products, wine extensions, new packaging and new ways of communicating with consumers, including expanded use of social media just to name a few. 
Starting first with line extensions, brand extensions such as Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, Chambord Vodka, Southern Comfort Lime and Early Times 354 Bourbon were all introduced in fiscal 2011. We plan to build on these innovations in fiscal '12, particularly with Tennessee Honey. Tennessee Honey only started shipping at the very end of fiscal 2011, and will really be more of a fiscal 2012 launch. It is early in the launch, but results so far have been very encouraging. Anecdotally, we have seen a lot of excitement from both the trade and consumers alike. 
For the rollout, the advertising campaign employs both traditional advertising, such as TV and new media such as Twitter.  In fact, according to our recent article in the New York Times, we were the first beverage alcohol company, and Tennessee Honey was the first spirits brand to advertise on Twitter. The Twitter activity was coupled with targeted ads and video content on Facebook. Because this is a flavor extension off of Jack Daniel's and line priced with Black Label, we are expecting strong early pipeline fill, which may disproportionately benefit our first quarter sales trends. Having said that, we are also investing heavily to support its rollout so the benefits that we see at the net sales line in the first quarter may not fully fall to the operating income line. 
Returning again to our fiscal 2011 innovations, Jack Daniel's third based RTDs were extended into a number of new markets, following considerable expansion in 2010. The success of Jack Daniel's RTD products has significantly accelerated the growth of the Jack Daniel's trademark. In fiscal 2011, global RTD depletions for Jack Daniel's grew nearly 17% over 5.5 million 9-liter cases, and were an important and fast growing profit source. In addition to offering convenience to loyal consumers, we believe the millions of brand in the hand consumer impression that RTDs provide serves a broader role in introducing consumers to the iconic Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey brand. 
In addition to building on fiscal 2011 introductions and expansion of new products and line extensions, such as Tennessee Honey and RTDs, we have a number of additional new product innovations for 2012 that we plan to launch for a number of our brands, both in the U.S., as well as overseas. Beyond new products and line extensions, there has been quite a bit of new packaging innovations brought to the consumer. In fiscal 2011, new packaging was rolled out for Southern Comfort, Herradura, Chambord and Tuaca. We plan to continue introducing new packaging in fiscal 2012, and in fact, the introduction of refined packaging for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey and Finlandia is already underway.  Based on our consumer research, we expect these enhancements to strengthen the presentation of these brands in the marketplace. 
Moving on to what we see in various regional operating environments. The source of our earnings growth in fiscal 2011 was broad-based and came from both developed and emerging markets around the world. Starting with Western Europe, we saw a year-over-year gains and underlying net sales in markets such as the U.K., Germany, France and Spain. We are particularly proud of our performance in Western Europe, as we took market share and grew the business in a region where most countries are seeing declines in total distilled spirits. In all of these markets, the Jack Daniel’s family has been the primary driver of our growth, reinforcing our belief in the global potential of the trademark. While some of our competitors seem to be diverting efforts away from developed markets, particularly in Western Europe, we have continued to grow.  And while we continue to see economic headwinds in many of these markets, the Western Europe is a region we expect to see continued growth in fiscal '12. 
Our largest developed market, the United States, remain a challenge for us, as net sales declined slightly during the year. As noted earlier, we have seen some recent improvement in the pricing environment. Overall, we expect to gain share in the United States next year, mostly as a result of our innovation efforts and improvement in our brand trends. 
Our emerging Markets business contribute significantly to the company's underlying net sales growth, providing 40% of our incremental underlying net sales growth for the year. Growth in the emerging markets was broad-based and came from a number of different countries, with Mexico and Turkey being our 2 largest contributors. We believe emerging markets will continue to be important for our long-term growth story as we work to capture the world of opportunity available to our brands. 
Looking at the business overall, we are pleased with the breadth in our global growth that we experienced in fiscal '11, and expect to see this broad-based growth continue and accelerate in fiscal '12. We anticipate that all of our regions, including United States will grow next year, and in most cases, accelerate the growth rates. 
Foreign exchange rates continue to play a large role in our year-to-date reported results, particularly with their significant volatility over the past few years. Fiscal 2011 began with expectations of tremendous foreign exchange headwinds and ended with meaningful benefits. 
Looking to fiscal 2012 in our guidance, at this time, we estimate that the year-over-year impact will be immaterial. As you think about how changes in foreign exchange rates could affect our fiscal 2012 EPS, given our current hedge positions, a 10% weaker U.S. dollar would benefit EPS by approximately $0.20, while a 10% stronger U.S. dollar would do the reverse. The goal of our foreign exchange hedging policy is to reduce volatility to our earnings and cash flows, and remain at rolling 24 months hedge approach in which we hedged 50% of the exposure in our major currencies over the first 12-month period, and 20% of that exposure over the next 12-month period. Currently, approximately 40% of our total exposure is hedged one-year out. 
Let's move on, speak to the recent sale of our Hopland-based Wine business. We anticipate that the overall impact for the sale for fiscal '12 will be to dilute our earnings per share by $0.16, reflecting the absence of their contribution to our brand profit and including our expectations from transition services income. The sale of these wine brands was a result of the strategic decision to reposition the portfolio and focus the organization on brands, where we believe we have the greatest potential for long-term growth and returns. 
In addition to excelling growth in our spirit brand, another example of where we plan to refocus our efforts is in support of the innovation work we are doing, particularly in 2012 with the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey. One more thing to note about the sale of our Hopland-based Wine business: Environmental stewardship has always been a hallmark for Brown-Forman, but for Fetzer and Bonterra, it was an integral part of their brand stories and part of the fabric of everything they did. To honor that legacy, which began with the Fetzer family and was advanced in the Brown-Forman's ownership, we used $2 million to establish the Brown-Forman Environmental Sustainability Foundation to provide funds to nonprofit organizations for future sustainability projects. 
In closing, in fiscal 2011, we improved our already strong financial position by delivering another year of record results. Our net sales and gross profit trends improved over the prior year, and we expect to continue to improve those trends for fiscal 2012 through continued innovation, market expansion, brand development, we project underlying operating income to grow in the mid- to high-single digits for the coming year. As we look at fiscal '12 and beyond, long term, we are confident that we can capitalize on the substantial global growth opportunities that exist, and as the global economy continues to improve and consumer trends become increasingly more favorable, those growth opportunities will increase, serving to further our goal of building the company forever. 
At this point, let me turn the call over to Paul for some thoughts on our growth other than just fiscal 2012."

I was very pleased with the F'11 financial results we reported this morning.

I was very pleased with the F'11 financial results we reported this morning. I would highlight the acceleration of our underlying sales growth rate from 1% last fiscal year to 4% in F'11, the significant production cost efficiencies we realized, our solid 6% growth in underlying operating income, our 20% return on invested capital and that excludes the gain on the sale of the Hopland assets and a total shareholder return of 28%, added up to a very strong financial year for Brown-Forman and our shareholders. 
Within the business, the broad-based performance of the Jack Daniel's trademark drove the company, most notably in the second half of the year when we saw the company's underlying net sales growth accelerate over the first half. Woodford Reserve and Sonoma-Cutrer continue to perform very well and the Tequila and Chambord trademarks had a strong year. In my view, their best year under Brown-Forman ownership, fueled in part by important packaging changes. 
While we're still working to improve the performance of our U.S. and global Southern Comfort businesses, I'm generally pleased with the breadth of our geographic and portfolio growth. Our improved underlying P&L metrics in F'11 are trending toward the profile of our underlying P&L metrics of fiscal year '08, the year just before the global financial crisis and resulting recession. This caused us to reflect on the last 3 fiscal years since FY '08 to see how the company has performed and progressed. So I thought I might touch on this both financially and strategically. 
Financially, we estimate that our underlying operating income growth of about 5% over the last 3 years was in the top-tier of the industry. At the same time, we believe that Brown-Forman's return on invested capital which progressed over the period from 17% to 20% was very consistently at the top of the industry. We believe this is the testament to the organic growth possibilities for our brands and company, the brand building capabilities of our people and the company's ability to smartly contain costs at a time when we believe the conditions demanded it. 
From a brand perspective, it's no surprise that during this period we were led by the continued strength of the Jack Daniel's trademark globally. The majority of the trademark incremental sales growth came from Jack Daniel's Black Label, but we also saw very important contributions from both Jack Daniel's RTDs and Gentleman Jack over the period. Beyond the Jack Daniel's trademarks, Finlandia, the Tequilas brands, led by el Jimador and Herradura and our developing brands of Woodford Reserve, Chambord and Sonoma-Cutrer, all showed growth in underlying net sales over the period. These brands and others remain important to the company's long-term growth ambition. 
Shifting to a geographic view of this, the company was strongly led by our International business, with developed markets, Australia, France, Germany and the United Kingdom leading the way, but accompanied by emerging geographies such as Mexico and Turkey. From smaller basis, other emerging markets also contributed to underlying net sales growth, out in South East Asia, Thailand, Singapore and Indonesia, India, Latin America, we saw Chile and Argentina grow, the Middle East, North Africa and the CIS also made nice contributions. It really is pleasing to see that these markets, which are so important to our long-term future are also contributing nicely to the company today. 
We are pleased that every one of our geographic regions grew their underlying operating income over the 3 years. Now given the breadth of our business today and considering the economic difficulties, that so many countries and regions have experienced over the last 36 months, we are really proud of our employees worldwide for delivering bottom line growth so broadly. 
Shifting to our use of cash. Over the period, we made excellent use of the strong cash flows generated by our business. From fiscal year '09 through '11, our business generated almost $1.7 billion from operations and we added another $265 million from the sale of wine assets. So here's how we used these almost $2 billion in cash. 
We first invested behind capital projects and working capital to the tune of $246 million, we reduced net debt by $695 million and the remaining $1 billion was returned to shareholders via ordinary dividend of $524 million, a special dividend of $145 million and share repurchases of $333 million. So in total, we returned 51% of our cash over the 3 years to shareholders by using 36% to reduce net debt and 13% to fund our businesses capital requirements. At a time when access to capital was restricted like none other in recent history, Brown-Forman's cash flow is as strong as ever, and we believe we put them to excellent use on behalf of shareholders. 
During this challenging 3 years, this generation and use of cash, combined with our underlying growth and operating income and strong ROIC enabled Brown-Forman shareholders to enjoy a 13% total shareholder return. This return compares quite favorably to the S&P 500's 2% total return over the same challenging period. 
In addition to these key financial metrics for the period, we also made very meaningful strategic progress at the company over the last 3 years. First of all, the changes in economic conditions propelled us to re-evaluate and ultimately reaffirm our strategic direction, while adding important new dimensions and ambitions. With enduring growth and superior returns being critical aspects of our ongoing strategy, we look again at the portfolio and chose to sell most of our wine brands for a solid gain. We believe this will enable us to focus on higher value added efforts against both existing and new brands. 
An additional element of our portfolio strategy is to strengthen, and in most cases, broaden the portfolio brands we are taking into key markets. Not too long ago, a major barrier to this ambition was our limited influence over the route-to-consumer, particularly in international markets. Over the last decade, we've made steady progress in improving our influence over end markets sales and marketing activities in key countries around the world, in the last 3 years saw additional strategic steps on this front. 
In some cases, this was more dramatic as in Germany and Brazil. In other cases, it was more subtle as in the U.S., Canada, Turkey, the Netherlands and in several countries throughout Eastern Europe, including Russia. In all cases, it required strategic investment, patience and new forms of partnering both internally and externally. 
In addition to our portfolio and route-to-consumer progress, I'm proud of the organizational capabilities we developed and demonstrated over this last 3 years. This include an improved ability to innovate around both existing and new brand expressions, a better harnessing of today's newer media alternatives, giving us better access to consumers and the ability to adjust our messaging based on their feedback. A more comprehensive consideration of what our true investment is behind our brands going beyond simply the A&P line of the income statement, an improved understanding of how our brand build equity by being part of the consumer social interaction with other consumers, a stronger cost containment and efficiency mindset, a more proactive approach in the arena of corporate social responsibility, and lastly, a much better practice of diversity inclusion. I believe these enhanced capabilities were important contributors to our success over the last 3 years.  
And in closing, I'm pleased with the company's progress, both financial and strategic, as we bring F'11 to a close. As important, I believe this progress has positioned Brown-Forman for continued strong growth and return in fiscal year '12 and beyond. Thanks for your time this morning and now we'll open it up to questions."

I think the one-time impact, I mean, it's always from sort of week-to-week and month-to-month transitions you make with transitioning from old package to new package, but we don't anticipate there being anything more dramatic than any other normal packaging change we make. You've got to remember, we do this, it's globally skew-by-skew, and it gets phased in over, to be honest, several months. So I wouldn't anticipate anything there.  And I think that package changes, as we do with all of our portfolio, we're just trying to keep them as current and appropriate for the marketplace as the times demand.  And of course, with Jack Daniel's, we look at that much more closely than we would other brands because of the power of its primary presentation, its package, but there's no actually -- a few things in the press about it we found actually interesting and in some ways helpful, too. We consider what we've done with the Jack Daniel's package to be similar to prior packaging evolutions, very evolutionary in nature, honoring a lot of the old time look and feel of the brand. But also just making sure it's working really, really well in the marketplace. And a couple of the aspects of it that I personally like is I think it has helped the brand present itself in countries around the world as a more global package. A lot of the early work on Jack Daniel's course was designed for its home market to the U.S.  And so as we've gone around and made changes over the last 10, 15, 20 years, we've made some changes to it that has made it either appealing or just a little bit more relevant in some of the international markets. So again, that's an evolutionary story. I actually think it's important, too, for us to continue to look at all aspects of the Jack Daniel's packaging because it gets copied so much. I mean, it's just such a powerful package and shape and presentation in a lot of whiskey brands look to Jack Daniel's particularly to follow it. And so my personal view is we're going to regularly sort of make sure Jack Daniel's is looking as unique and different and as contemporary as it needs to be, while of course honoring all of the old-time and iconic look and feel of it."

And if I look at the overall growth in the United States market, for example, in terms of spirits relative to Beer, the Spirits categories already enjoyed I think a premium position relative to many of the Beer segments.  And when I think about some of this being different between on-premise and off-premise, just taking the prices up at levels like you might have seen in '05, '06, '07, I just don't know that it'd be realistic to expect that we can get that today or if that's a good choice for many of our brands. In some instances, we haven't taken prices up more aggressively because there may be repositioning, we've been taking some prices on some brands down because of repositioning.

I think the way we think about it and I think we said some of this back when we actually announced the sale, but as we head into a new fiscal year and plan for it, it's really, we've been over many of these quarterly calls, we've talked about some of the performance and difficulties we've had in the United States and our desire to try to improve performance there.  And in essence, what we're doing with this is asking our people to look at this as an investment in the U.S. operation to go implement against the sort of key priorities, which I mean, I would list a few of them are to, of course, get our most significant brands businesses in the United States performing at our expectation. And in many instances that includes above the market growth, and that starts with Jack Daniel's and Southern Comfort. But then also goes to many of the new ideas that we've been bringing into the United States, a lot of these tend to be line extensions. But the sale of these brands enables the people to redirect their attention to getting these brands established in the market place and having an impact. And we've done this before at various times that we call it route-to-consumer strategic investments where you have a lag time often between the investments you make and the results they produce.

But I expect us to -- starting with this fiscal year to start to recoup some of that loss profitability, and then in future years to surpass it. That was the idea of this strategically.  And it also add that -- and we've been pretty consistent about this with the sale of those brand. It wasn't that they weren't profitable for Brown-Forman, it's just that they were returned challenged, is one of the big topics that has consistently been reinforced about our Wine business and in addition, it was whether or not they were growing. It's one thing for them to have a base of profitability, those things, which direction is it heading. So we felt that the business that we sold, it had some challenges in terms of growth but it helps to have challenges in terms of returns and we thought it was the right decision for the company.

You're always, of course, looking to see what else is happening with your competition out there. And for a variety of different reasons, many of the brands that are direct competitors to some of our key brands in the different competitors, actually, in different years have put pressure on prices downward.  And so that makes it, in some cases, more difficult to take the price up.

We look at it not only from a Tennessee Honey perspective, we will also look at it from a Jack Daniel's Family of Brands. So how it might impact the overall growth of the Jack Daniel's trademark.

It's not like it's new that we weren't really competing with their other divisions and didn't really pay much attention to them. So the only thing I would've observed over the last 12 months really is Fortune's probably putting as much as any competitor on downward pricing pressure in the United States, and you can see it in their price mix pretty strongly. Actually I think it's pretty good that our brands, particularly Jack Daniel's, continues to hold up pretty well despite that. In other areas where we have direct competition with them, it has been more impactful, maybe I would say the Canadian business. But thinking about them as a competitor worldwide, post any type of restructuring for them, I mean, like I said, we consider them to be one of the many competitors we've got very directly around the world.  We're used to competing with them. I mean, the way I would think about it is we've -- when I study the performance of, say, the example of Jack Daniel's relative to Jim Beam in terms of overall performance over the last, say, 10 or 15 years, the ultimate result, I think, speaks from themselves. So we've got a lot of work to do to make sure that we continue that. But in any event, I think we'll just wait and monitor like a lot of folks in the world are as to what their changing status might be."

This morning, we issued our fiscal 2011 earnings release that also included our current expectations for fiscal 2012. Fiscal 2011 was a record year for Brown-Forman, with earnings per share at $3.90. Excluding the $0.2",2005,"Thanks, Ben. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we issued our fiscal 2011 earnings release that also included our current expectations for fiscal 2012. Fiscal 2011 was a record year for Brown-Forman, with earnings per share at $3.90. Excluding the $0.26 gain on the sale of our Hopland-based Wine business and certain one-time tax benefits, earnings per share was up 18% to $3.57. These results were supported by underlying net sales growth of 4%, an acceleration over fiscal 2010, when we reported underlying net sales growth of 1%. 
For the first half of fiscal 2011, we had underlying sales growth of 2%, and in the second half, that growth accelerated to 5%. As a result of various cost improvements and efficiencies gained, our underlying gross profit accelerated even more, growing 5% fiscal 2011 compared to 1% the previous year. 
Underlying operating income growth came in at 6%, similar to last year, as we increased investments in our route-to-consumer as well as in brand investments, both in overseas markets as well as in support of various brand innovations introduced in fiscal '11. 
Looking forward, we expect to build on our success and grow our underlying operating income in fiscal 2012 in the mid- to high-single-digits. We also expect our net sales trends to further accelerate as a result of additional portfolio and geographic expansion, innovation, investment in our brands and the improved focus driven by recent changes in our route-to-consumer approach in various markets. 
Returning to fiscal '11, our performance led to a strong total shareholder return of 28%, 11 percentage points higher than the S&P 500's total shareholder return of 17%. Our long-running theme that Brown-Forman continues to be a great long-term investment has not changed, and we believe that both our performance in fiscal 2011 and our expectations for fiscal 2012 continue to support that belief. 
Instead of recapping our results, which you read in our earnings release this morning, I'd like to take the next few minutes to discuss some recent trends and their influence on our thinking about fiscal '12, including the pricing and cost environment, innovation and trends in various regional operating environments. I'll also provide you some detail around how we think about our sensitivity to foreign exchange movements and our recent wine sale. 
So let me start with pricing and cost trends. Our fiscal 2011 was another difficult and challenging year for pricing. The opportunity to take prices up was not widespread. However, as I've mentioned on previous calls, discounting was not as prevalent this year. For the year, our price mix globally was up about 1%, but it was driven more by mix benefits. Looking forward, we anticipate a slightly improved pricing environment for fiscal '12, and we will continue to seek opportunities to increase prices when and where appropriate. 
Although pricing opportunities were few in fiscal 2011, we were able to grow our gross profit at a faster rate than our net sales. This is largely due to production efficiencies resulting from greater consumer demand for our Jack Daniel's products. We also benefited from various cost reductions such as consolidating some bottling operations and renegotiating some co-packing logistics contracts. 
Additionally, we decreased the use and costs of value-added packaging versus the prior year. Having said that, we expect the cost environment to be more difficult in fiscal 2012. Both grain and fuel prices have increased sharply this spring, reaching levels last seen in 2008. At these levels, we would expect that these higher costs coupled with the challenging pricing environment will put pressure on our ability to grow gross profit at the same rate of sales next year. 
Let me speak a bit about innovation, as it has been taking on an increasingly more important role for our company. Similar to fiscal 2010, in fiscal 2011, we introduced many types of innovations, including new products, wine extensions, new packaging and new ways of communicating with consumers, including expanded use of social media, just to name a few. 
Starting first with line extensions.  Brand extensions such as Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, Chambord Vodka, Southern Comfort Lime and Early Times 354 Bourbon were all introduced in fiscal 2011. We plan to build on these innovations in fiscal '12, particularly with Tennessee Honey. Tennessee Honey only started shipping at the very end of fiscal 2011 and will really be more of a fiscal 2012 launch. It is early in the launch, but results so far have been very encouraging. Anecdotally, we have seen a lot of excitement from both the trade and consumers alike. 
For the rollout, the advertising campaign employs both traditional advertising, such as TV, and new media, such as Twitter.  In fact, according to a recent article in the New York Times, we were the first beverage alcohol company and Tennessee Honey was the first spirits brand to advertise on Twitter. The Twitter activity was coupled with targeted ads and video content on Facebook. Because this is a flavor extension off of Jack Daniel's and line priced with Black Label, we are expecting strong early pipeline fill, which may disproportionately benefit our first quarter sales trends. Having said that, we are also investing heavily to support its rollout, so the benefits that we see at the net sales line in the first quarter may not fully fall to the operating income line. 
Returning again to our fiscal 2011 innovations, Jack Daniel's third based RTDs were extended into a number of new markets, following considerable expansion in 2010. The success of Jack Daniel's RTD products has significantly accelerated the growth of the Jack Daniel's trademark. In fiscal 2011, global RTD depletions for Jack Daniel's grew nearly 17%, to over 5.5 million 9-liter cases, and were an important and fast-growing profit source. In addition to offering convenience to loyal consumers, we believe the millions of ""brand in the hand"" consumer impressions that RTDs provide serves a broader role in introducing consumers to the iconic Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey brand. 
In addition to building on fiscal 2011 introductions and expansion of new products and line extensions, such as Tennessee Honey and RTDs, we have a number of additional new product innovations for 2012 that we plan to launch for a number of our brands, both in the U.S. as well as overseas. Beyond new products and line extensions, there has been quite a bit of new packaging innovations brought to the consumer. In fiscal 2011, new packaging was rolled out for Southern Comfort, Herradura, Chambord and Tuaca. We plan to continue introducing new packaging in fiscal 2012, and, in fact, the introduction of refined packaging for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey and Finlandia is already under way.  Based on our consumer research, we expect these enhancements to strengthen the presentation of these brands in the marketplace. 
Moving on to what we see in various regional operating environments. The source of our earnings growth in fiscal 2011 was broad-based and came from both developed and emerging markets around the world. Starting with Western Europe, we saw year-over-year gains in underlying net sales in markets such as the U.K., Germany, France and Spain. We are particularly proud of our performance in Western Europe as we took market share and grew the business in a region where most countries are seeing declines in total distilled spirits. In all of these markets, the Jack Daniel’s family has been the primary driver of our growth, reinforcing our belief in the global potential of the trademark. While some of our competitors seem to be diverting efforts away from developed markets, particularly in Western Europe, we have continued to grow.  And while we continue to see economic headwinds in many of these markets, the Western Europe is a region we expect to see continued growth in fiscal '12. 
Our largest developed market, the United States, remained a challenge for us, as net sales declined slightly during the year. As noted earlier, we have seen some recent improvement in the pricing environment. Overall, we expect to gain share in the United States next year, mostly as a result of our innovation efforts and improvement in our brand trends. 
Our emerging Markets business contributes significantly to the company's underlying net sales growth, providing 40% of our incremental underlying net sales growth for the year. Growth in the emerging markets was broad-based and came from a number of different countries, with Mexico and Turkey being our 2 largest contributors. We believe emerging markets will continue to be important for our long-term growth story as we work to capture the world of opportunity available to our brands. 
Looking at the business overall, we are pleased with the breadth in our global growth that we experienced in fiscal '11 and expect to see this broad-based growth continue and accelerate in fiscal '12. We anticipate that all of our regions, including the United States, will grow next year and, in most cases, accelerate the growth rates. 
Foreign exchange rates continued to play a large role in our year-to-date reported results, particularly with their significant volatility over the past few years. Fiscal 2011 began with expectations of tremendous foreign exchange headwinds and ended with meaningful benefits. 
Looking to fiscal 2012 in our guidance, at this time, we estimate that the year-over-year impact will be immaterial. As you think about how changes in foreign exchange rates could affect our fiscal 2012 EPS, given our current hedge positions, a 10% weaker U.S. dollar would benefit EPS by approximately $0.20, while a 10% stronger U.S. dollar would do the reverse. The goal of our foreign exchange hedging policy is to reduce volatility to our earnings and cash flows and remains a rolling 24-months hedge approach in which we hedge 50% of the exposure in our major currencies over the first 12-month period, and 20% of that exposure over the next 12-month period. Currently, approximately 40% of our total exposure is hedged one year out. 
Let's move on, speak to the recent sale of our Hopland-based Wine business. We anticipate that the overall impact for the sale for fiscal '12 will be to dilute our earnings per share by $0.16, reflecting the absence of their contribution to our brand profit and including our expectations from transition services income. The sale of these wine brands was a result of the strategic decision to reposition the portfolio and focus the organization on brands where we believe we have the greatest potential for long-term growth and returns. 
In addition to excelling growth in our spirit brands, another example of where we plan to refocus our efforts is in support of the innovation work we are doing, particularly in 2012 with the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey. One more thing to note about the sale of our Hopland-based Wine business: environmental stewardship has always been a hallmark for Brown-Forman, but for Fetzer and Bonterra, it was an integral part of their brand stories and part of the fabric of everything they did. To honor that legacy, which began with the Fetzer family and was advanced in the Brown-Forman's ownership, we used $2 million to establish the Brown-Forman Environmental Sustainability Foundation to provide funds to nonprofit organizations for future sustainability projects. 
In closing, in fiscal 2011, we improved our already strong financial position by delivering another year of record results. Our net sales and gross profit trends improved over the prior year, and we expect to continue to improve those trends for fiscal 2012 through continued innovation, market expansion, brand development, we project underlying operating income to grow in the mid- to high-single-digits for the coming year. As we look at fiscal '12 and beyond, long term, we are confident that we can capitalize on the substantial global growth opportunities that exist, and as the global economy continues to improve and consumer trends become increasingly more favorable, those growth opportunities will increase, serving to further our goal of building the company forever. 
At this point, let me turn the call over to Paul for some thoughts on our growth other than just fiscal 2012."

I was very pleased with the F '11 financial results we reported this morning. I would highlight the acceleration of our underlying sales growth rate from 1% last fiscal year to 4% in F '11; the significant production cost efficiencies we realized; our solid 6% growth in underlying operating income; our 20% return on invested capital, and that excludes the gain on the sale of the Hopland assets and a total shareholder return of 28% added up to a very strong financial year for Brown-Forman and our shareholders. 
Within the business, the broad-based performance of the Jack Daniel's trademark drove the company, most notably in the second half of the year when we saw the company's underlying net sales growth accelerate over the first half. Woodford Reserve and Sonoma-Cutrer continue to perform very well, and the Tequila and Chambord trademarks had a strong year, in my view, their best year, under Brown-Forman ownership, fueled in part by important packaging changes. 
While we're still working to improve the performance of our U.S. and global Southern Comfort businesses, I'm generally pleased with the breadth of our geographic and portfolio growth. Our improved underlying P&L metrics in F '11 are trending toward the profile of our underlying P&L metrics of fiscal year '08, the year just before the global financial crisis and resulting recession. This caused us to reflect on the last 3 fiscal years since FY '08 to see how the company has performed and progressed. So I thought I might touch on this, both financially and strategically. 
Financially, we estimate that our underlying operating income growth of about 5% over the last 3 years was in the top tier of the industry. At the same time, we believe that Brown-Forman's return on invested capital, which progressed over the period from 17% to 20%, was very consistently at the top of the industry. We believe this is a testament to the organic growth possibilities for our brands and company, the brand-building capabilities of our people and the company's ability to smartly contain costs at a time when we believe the conditions demanded it. 
From a brand perspective, it's no surprise that during this period we were led by the continued strength of the Jack Daniel's trademark globally. The majority of the trademark incremental sales growth came from Jack Daniel's Black Label, but we also saw very important contributions from both Jack Daniel's RTDs and Gentleman Jack over the period. Beyond the Jack Daniel's trademarks, Finlandia, the Tequilas brands, led by el Jimador and Herradura and our developing brands of Woodford Reserve, Chambord and Sonoma-Cutrer, all showed growth in underlying net sales over the period. These brands and others remain important to the company's long-term growth ambitions. 
Shifting to a geographic view of this, the company was strongly led by our International business, with developed markets, Australia, France, Germany and the United Kingdom, leading the way, but accompanied by emerging geographies such as Mexico and Turkey. From smaller bases, other emerging markets also contributed to underlying net sales growth.  Out in Southeast Asia, Thailand, Singapore and Indonesia, India, Latin America, we saw Chile and Argentina grow, the Middle East, North Africa and the CIS also made nice contributions. It really is pleasing to see that these markets, which are so important to our long-term future, are also contributing nicely to the company today. 
We are pleased that every one of our geographic regions grew their underlying operating income over the 3 years. Now given the breadth of our business today and considering the economic difficulties that so many countries and regions have experienced over the last 36 months, we are really proud of our employees worldwide for delivering bottom-line growth so broadly. 
Shifting to our use of cash. Over the period, we made excellent use of the strong cash flows generated by our business. From fiscal year '09 through '11, our business generated almost $1.7 billion from operations, and we added another $265 million from the sale of wine assets. So here's how we used this almost $2 billion in cash. 
We first invested behind capital projects and working capital to the tune of $246 million, we reduced net debt by $695 million and the remaining $1 billion was returned to shareholders via ordinary dividends of $524 million, a special dividend of $145 million and share repurchases of $333 million. So in total, we returned 51% of our cash over the 3 years to shareholders by using 36% to reduce net debt and 13% to fund our businesses' capital requirements. At a time when access to capital was restricted like none other in recent history, Brown-Forman's cash flows are as strong as ever, and we believe we put them to excellent use on behalf of shareholders. 
During these challenging 3 years, this generation and use of cash combined with our underlying growth and operating income and strong ROIC enabled Brown-Forman shareholders to enjoy a 13% total shareholder return. This return compares quite favorably to the S&P 500's 2% total return over the same challenging period. 
In addition to these key financial metrics for the period, we also made very meaningful strategic progress at the company over the last 3 years. First of all, the changes in economic conditions propelled us to reevaluate and ultimately reaffirm our strategic direction while adding important new dimensions and additions. With enduring growth and superior returns being critical aspects of our ongoing strategy, we look again at the portfolio and chose to sell most of our wine brands for a solid gain. We believe this will enable us to focus on higher value-added efforts against both existing and new brands. 
An additional element of our portfolio strategy is to strengthen and, in most cases, broaden the portfolio brands we are taking into key markets. Not too long ago, a major barrier to this ambition was our limited influence over the route to consumer, particularly in international markets. Over the last decade, we've made steady progress in improving our influence over end markets sales and marketing activities in key countries around the world, and the last 3 years saw additional strategic steps on this front. 
In some cases, this was more dramatic, as in Germany and Brazil. In other cases, it was more subtle, as in the U.S., Canada, Turkey, the Netherlands and in several countries throughout Eastern Europe including Russia. In all cases, it required strategic investment, patience and new forms of partnering, both internally and externally. 
In addition to our portfolio and route-to-consumer progress, I'm proud of the organizational capabilities we developed and demonstrated over these last 3 years. These include an improved ability to innovate around both existing and new brand expressions; a better harnessing of today's newer media alternatives, giving us better access to consumers and the ability to adjust our messaging based on their feedback; a more comprehensive consideration of what our true investment is behind our brands, going beyond simply the A&P line of the income statement; an improved understanding of how our brands build equity by being part of the consumer social interaction with other consumers; a stronger cost containment and efficiency mindset; a more proactive approach in the arena of corporate social responsibility and, lastly, a much better practice of diversity inclusion. I believe these enhanced capabilities were important contributors to our success over the last 3 years.  
And in closing, I'm pleased with the company's progress, both financial and strategic, as we bring F '11 to a close. As important, I believe this progress has positioned Brown-Forman for continued strong growth and returns in fiscal year '12 and beyond. Thanks for your time this morning, and now we'll open it up to questions."

I think the one-time impact, I mean, there's always from sort of week-to-week and month-to-month transitions you make with transitioning from old package to new package, but we don't anticipate there being anything more dramatic than any other normal packaging change we make. You've got to remember, we do this, it's globally SKU by SKU, and it gets phased in over, to be honest, several months. So I wouldn't anticipate anything there.  And I think that package changes, as we do with all of our portfolio, we're just trying to keep them as current and appropriate for the marketplace as the times demand.  And of course, with Jack Daniel's, we look at that much more closely than we would other brands, because of the power of its primary presentation, its packaging, but there's no actually -- a few things in the press about it we found actually interesting and, in some ways, helpful, too. We consider what we've done with the Jack Daniel's package to be similar to prior packaging evolutions, very evolutionary in nature, honoring a lot of the old-time look and feel of the brand. But also just making sure it's working really, really well in the marketplace. And a couple of the aspects of it that I personally like is I think it has helped the brand present itself in countries around the world as a more global package. A lot of the early work on Jack Daniel's of course was designed for its home market, to the U.S.  And so as we've gone around and made changes over the last 10, 15, 20 years, we've made some changes to it that have made it either appealing or just a little bit more relevant in some of the international markets. So again, that's an evolutionary story. I actually think it's important, too, for us to continue to look at all aspects of the Jack Daniel's packaging, because it gets copied so much. I mean, it's just such a powerful package and shape and presentation, and a lot of whiskey brands look to Jack Daniel's particularly to follow it. And so my personal view is we're going to regularly sort of make sure Jack Daniel's is looking as unique and different and as contemporary as it needs to be while, of course, honoring all of the old-time and iconic look and feel of it."

And if I look at the overall growth in the United States market, for example, in terms of spirits relative to Beer, the Spirits categories already enjoy, I think, a premium position relative to many of the Beer segments.  And when I think about some of this being different between on-premise and off-premise, just taking the prices up at levels like you might have seen in '05, '06, '07, I just don't know that it'd be realistic to expect that we can get that today or that it's a good choice for many of our brands. In some instances, we have been taking prices up more aggressively because there may be repositioning, we've been taking some prices on some brands down because of repositioning.

On the cost side, we were fairly well protected in fiscal 2011 with the hedging that we had. We continue to have hedging on the commodity part of the cost component. We continue to be hedged around 55%, 57% on our commodities. But we won't be as protected next year as what we were this last year. And so that's where we're seeing or expecting to see the largest part of our cost increases.

I think the way we think about it, and I think we said some of this back when we actually announced the sale, but as we head into a new fiscal year and plan for it, it's really -- we've been over many of these quarterly calls, we've talked about some of the performance and difficulties we've had in the United States and our desire to try to improve performance there.  And in essence, what we're doing with this is asking our people to look at this as an investment in the U.S. operation to go implement against the sort of key priorities, which, I mean, I would list a few of them are to, of course, get our most significant brand businesses in the United States performing at our expectation, and in many instances, that includes above the market growth, and that starts with Jack Daniel's and Southern Comfort. But then also goes to many of the new ideas that we've been bringing into the United States, but a lot of these tend to be line extensions. But the sale of these brands enables the people to redirect their attention to getting these brands established in the marketplace and having an impact. And we've done this before at various times that we call them route-to-consumer strategic investments, where you have a lag time often between the investments you make and the results they produce. I mean, I think it's absolutely subject to question about people if they don't -- aren't working in the business every single day, and this happens to be one of those years where it's apparent that the lost brand profit of the Hopland-based brands aren't -- we've just made it visible to you in our financials. But I expect us to, starting with this fiscal year, start to recoup some of that loss profitability and then in future years to surpass it. That was the idea of this strategically.  And I'd also add that -- and we've been pretty consistent about this with the sale of those brands. It wasn't that they weren't profitable for Brown-Forman.  It's just that they were return-challenged, is one of the big topics that has consistently been reinforced about our Wine business, and in addition, it was whether or not they were growing. It's one thing for them to have a base of profitability, those things, which direction is it heading. So we felt that the business that we sold, it had some challenges in terms of growth but it also had challenges in terms of returns, and we thought it was the right decision for the company.

You're always, of course, looking to see what else is happening with your competition out there. And for a variety of different reasons, many of the brands that are direct competitors to some of our key brands and different competitors, actually, in different years, have put pressure on prices downward.  And so that makes it, in some cases, more difficult to take the price up.

We'll look at it not only from a Tennessee Honey perspective, we will also look at it from a Jack Daniel's Family of Brands, so how it might impact the overall growth of the Jack Daniel's trademark.  And I think, increasingly, we'll look at it across a corporate portfolio that packages Tennessee Honey alongside Southern Comfort and any other things that Brown-Forman brings into that segment.

It's not like it's new that we weren't really competing with their other divisions and didn't really pay much attention to them. So the only thing I would've observed over the last 12 months, really, is Fortune's probably putting as much as any competitor on downward pricing pressure in the United States, and you can see it in their price mix pretty strongly. Actually, I think it's pretty good that our brands, particularly Jack Daniel's, continues to hold up pretty well despite that. In other areas where we have direct competition with them, it has been more impactful, maybe, like, say, in the Canadian business. But thinking about them as a competitor worldwide post any type of restructuring for them, I mean, like I said, we consider them to be one of many competitors we've got very directly around the world.  We're used to competing with them. I mean, the way I would think about it is we've -- when I study the performance of, say, the example of Jack Daniel's relative to Jim Beam in terms of overall performance over the last, say, 10 or 15 years, the ultimate results, I think, speak for themselves. And so we've got a lot of work to do to make sure that we continue that.

This morning, we issued our fiscal 2011 earnings release that also included our current expectations for fiscal 2012. Fiscal 2011 was a record year for Brown-Forman, with earnings per share at $3.90. Excluding the $0.2",2005,"Thanks, Ben. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we issued our fiscal 2011 earnings release that also included our current expectations for fiscal 2012. Fiscal 2011 was a record year for Brown-Forman, with earnings per share at $3.90. Excluding the $0.26 gain on the sale of our Hopland-based Wine business and certain one-time tax benefits, earnings per share was up 18% to $3.57. These results were supported by underlying net sales growth of 4%, an acceleration over fiscal 2010, when we reported underlying net sales growth of 1%. 
For the first half of fiscal 2011, we had underlying sales growth of 2%, and in the second half, that growth accelerated to 5%. As a result of various cost improvements and efficiencies gained, our underlying gross profit accelerated even more, growing 5% fiscal 2011 compared to 1% the previous year. 
Underlying operating income growth came in at 6%, similar to last year, as we increased investments in our route-to-consumer as well as in brand investments, both in overseas markets as well as in support of various brand innovations introduced in fiscal '11. 
Looking forward, we expect to build on our success and grow our underlying operating income in fiscal 2012 in the mid- to high-single-digits. We also expect our net sales trends to further accelerate as a result of additional portfolio and geographic expansion, innovation, investment in our brands and the improved focus driven by recent changes in our route-to-consumer approach in various markets. 
Returning to fiscal '11, our performance led to a strong total shareholder return of 28%, 11 percentage points higher than the S&P 500's total shareholder return of 17%. Our long-running theme that Brown-Forman continues to be a great long-term investment has not changed, and we believe that both our performance in fiscal 2011 and our expectations for fiscal 2012 continue to support that belief. 
Instead of recapping our results, which you read in our earnings release this morning, I'd like to take the next few minutes to discuss some recent trends and their influence on our thinking about fiscal '12, including the pricing and cost environment, innovation and trends in various regional operating environments. I'll also provide you some detail around how we think about our sensitivity to foreign exchange movements and our recent wine sale. 
So let me start with pricing and cost trends. Our fiscal 2011 was another difficult and challenging year for pricing. The opportunity to take prices up was not widespread. However, as I've mentioned on previous calls, discounting was not as prevalent this year. For the year, our price mix globally was up about 1%, but it was driven more by mix benefits. Looking forward, we anticipate a slightly improved pricing environment for fiscal '12, and we will continue to seek opportunities to increase prices when and where appropriate. 
Although pricing opportunities were few in fiscal 2011, we were able to grow our gross profit at a faster rate than our net sales. This is largely due to production efficiencies resulting from greater consumer demand for our Jack Daniel's products. We also benefited from various cost reductions such as consolidating some bottling operations and renegotiating some co-packing logistics contracts. 
Additionally, we decreased the use and costs of value-added packaging versus the prior year. Having said that, we expect the cost environment to be more difficult in fiscal 2012. Both grain and fuel prices have increased sharply this spring, reaching levels last seen in 2008. At these levels, we would expect that these higher costs coupled with the challenging pricing environment will put pressure on our ability to grow gross profit at the same rate of sales next year. 
Let me speak a bit about innovation, as it has been taking on an increasingly more important role for our company. Similar to fiscal 2010, in fiscal 2011, we introduced many types of innovations, including new products, wine extensions, new packaging and new ways of communicating with consumers, including expanded use of social media, just to name a few. 
Starting first with line extensions.  Brand extensions such as Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, Chambord Vodka, Southern Comfort Lime and Early Times 354 Bourbon were all introduced in fiscal 2011. We plan to build on these innovations in fiscal '12, particularly with Tennessee Honey. Tennessee Honey only started shipping at the very end of fiscal 2011 and will really be more of a fiscal 2012 launch. It is early in the launch, but results so far have been very encouraging. Anecdotally, we have seen a lot of excitement from both the trade and consumers alike. 
For the rollout, the advertising campaign employs both traditional advertising, such as TV, and new media, such as Twitter.  In fact, according to a recent article in the New York Times, we were the first beverage alcohol company and Tennessee Honey was the first spirits brand to advertise on Twitter. The Twitter activity was coupled with targeted ads and video content on Facebook. Because this is a flavor extension off of Jack Daniel's and line priced with Black Label, we are expecting strong early pipeline fill, which may disproportionately benefit our first quarter sales trends. Having said that, we are also investing heavily to support its rollout, so the benefits that we see at the net sales line in the first quarter may not fully fall to the operating income line. 
Returning again to our fiscal 2011 innovations, Jack Daniel's third based RTDs were extended into a number of new markets, following considerable expansion in 2010. The success of Jack Daniel's RTD products has significantly accelerated the growth of the Jack Daniel's trademark. In fiscal 2011, global RTD depletions for Jack Daniel's grew nearly 17%, to over 5.5 million 9-liter cases, and were an important and fast-growing profit source. In addition to offering convenience to loyal consumers, we believe the millions of ""brand in the hand"" consumer impressions that RTDs provide serves a broader role in introducing consumers to the iconic Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey brand. 
In addition to building on fiscal 2011 introductions and expansion of new products and line extensions, such as Tennessee Honey and RTDs, we have a number of additional new product innovations for 2012 that we plan to launch for a number of our brands, both in the U.S. as well as overseas. Beyond new products and line extensions, there has been quite a bit of new packaging innovations brought to the consumer. In fiscal 2011, new packaging was rolled out for Southern Comfort, Herradura, Chambord and Tuaca. We plan to continue introducing new packaging in fiscal 2012, and, in fact, the introduction of refined packaging for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey and Finlandia is already under way.  Based on our consumer research, we expect these enhancements to strengthen the presentation of these brands in the marketplace. 
Moving on to what we see in various regional operating environments. The source of our earnings growth in fiscal 2011 was broad-based and came from both developed and emerging markets around the world. Starting with Western Europe, we saw year-over-year gains in underlying net sales in markets such as the U.K., Germany, France and Spain. We are particularly proud of our performance in Western Europe as we took market share and grew the business in a region where most countries are seeing declines in total distilled spirits. In all of these markets, the Jack Daniel’s family has been the primary driver of our growth, reinforcing our belief in the global potential of the trademark. While some of our competitors seem to be diverting efforts away from developed markets, particularly in Western Europe, we have continued to grow.  And while we continue to see economic headwinds in many of these markets, the Western Europe is a region we expect to see continued growth in fiscal '12. 
Our largest developed market, the United States, remained a challenge for us, as net sales declined slightly during the year. As noted earlier, we have seen some recent improvement in the pricing environment. Overall, we expect to gain share in the United States next year, mostly as a result of our innovation efforts and improvement in our brand trends. 
Our emerging Markets business contributes significantly to the company's underlying net sales growth, providing 40% of our incremental underlying net sales growth for the year. Growth in the emerging markets was broad-based and came from a number of different countries, with Mexico and Turkey being our 2 largest contributors. We believe emerging markets will continue to be important for our long-term growth story as we work to capture the world of opportunity available to our brands. 
Looking at the business overall, we are pleased with the breadth in our global growth that we experienced in fiscal '11 and expect to see this broad-based growth continue and accelerate in fiscal '12. We anticipate that all of our regions, including the United States, will grow next year and, in most cases, accelerate the growth rates. 
Foreign exchange rates continued to play a large role in our year-to-date reported results, particularly with their significant volatility over the past few years. Fiscal 2011 began with expectations of tremendous foreign exchange headwinds and ended with meaningful benefits. 
Looking to fiscal 2012 in our guidance, at this time, we estimate that the year-over-year impact will be immaterial. As you think about how changes in foreign exchange rates could affect our fiscal 2012 EPS, given our current hedge positions, a 10% weaker U.S. dollar would benefit EPS by approximately $0.20, while a 10% stronger U.S. dollar would do the reverse. The goal of our foreign exchange hedging policy is to reduce volatility to our earnings and cash flows and remains a rolling 24-months hedge approach in which we hedge 50% of the exposure in our major currencies over the first 12-month period, and 20% of that exposure over the next 12-month period. Currently, approximately 40% of our total exposure is hedged one year out. 
Let's move on, speak to the recent sale of our Hopland-based Wine business. We anticipate that the overall impact for the sale for fiscal '12 will be to dilute our earnings per share by $0.16, reflecting the absence of their contribution to our brand profit and including our expectations from transition services income. The sale of these wine brands was a result of the strategic decision to reposition the portfolio and focus the organization on brands where we believe we have the greatest potential for long-term growth and returns. 
In addition to excelling growth in our spirit brands, another example of where we plan to refocus our efforts is in support of the innovation work we are doing, particularly in 2012 with the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey. One more thing to note about the sale of our Hopland-based Wine business: environmental stewardship has always been a hallmark for Brown-Forman, but for Fetzer and Bonterra, it was an integral part of their brand stories and part of the fabric of everything they did. To honor that legacy, which began with the Fetzer family and was advanced in the Brown-Forman's ownership, we used $2 million to establish the Brown-Forman Environmental Sustainability Foundation to provide funds to nonprofit organizations for future sustainability projects. 
In closing, in fiscal 2011, we improved our already strong financial position by delivering another year of record results. Our net sales and gross profit trends improved over the prior year, and we expect to continue to improve those trends for fiscal 2012 through continued innovation, market expansion, brand development, we project underlying operating income to grow in the mid- to high-single-digits for the coming year. As we look at fiscal '12 and beyond, long term, we are confident that we can capitalize on the substantial global growth opportunities that exist, and as the global economy continues to improve and consumer trends become increasingly more favorable, those growth opportunities will increase, serving to further our goal of building the company forever. 
At this point, let me turn the call over to Paul for some thoughts on our growth other than just fiscal 2012."

I would highlight the acceleration of our underlying sales growth rate from 1% last fiscal year to 4% in F '11; the significant production cost efficiencies we realized; our solid 6% growth in underlying operating income; our 20% return on invested capital, and that excludes the gain on the sale of the Hopland assets and a total shareholder return of 28% added up to a very strong financial year for Brown-Forman and our shareholders. 
Within the business, the broad-based performance of the Jack Daniel's trademark drove the company, most notably in the second half of the year when we saw the company's underlying net sales growth accelerate over the first half. Woodford Reserve and Sonoma-Cutrer continue to perform very well, and the Tequila and Chambord trademarks had a strong year, in my view, their best year, under Brown-Forman ownership, fueled in part by important packaging changes. 
While we're still working to improve the performance of our U.S. and global Southern Comfort businesses, I'm generally pleased with the breadth of our geographic and portfolio growth. Our improved underlying P&L metrics in F '11 are trending toward the profile of our underlying P&L metrics of fiscal year '08, the year just before the global financial crisis and resulting recession. This caused us to reflect on the last 3 fiscal years since FY '08 to see how the company has performed and progressed. So I thought I might touch on this, both financially and strategically. 
Financially, we estimate that our underlying operating income growth of about 5% over the last 3 years was in the top tier of the industry. At the same time, we believe that Brown-Forman's return on invested capital, which progressed over the period from 17% to 20%, was very consistently at the top of the industry. We believe this is a testament to the organic growth possibilities for our brands and company, the brand-building capabilities of our people and the company's ability to smartly contain costs at a time when we believe the conditions demanded it. 
From a brand perspective, it's no surprise that during this period we were led by the continued strength of the Jack Daniel's trademark globally. The majority of the trademark incremental sales growth came from Jack Daniel's Black Label, but we also saw very important contributions from both Jack Daniel's RTDs and Gentleman Jack over the period. Beyond the Jack Daniel's trademarks, Finlandia, the Tequilas brands, led by el Jimador and Herradura and our developing brands of Woodford Reserve, Chambord and Sonoma-Cutrer, all showed growth in underlying net sales over the period. These brands and others remain important to the company's long-term growth ambitions. 
Shifting to a geographic view of this, the company was strongly led by our International business, with developed markets, Australia, France, Germany and the United Kingdom, leading the way, but accompanied by emerging geographies such as Mexico and Turkey. From smaller bases, other emerging markets also contributed to underlying net sales growth.  Out in Southeast Asia, Thailand, Singapore and Indonesia, India, Latin America, we saw Chile and Argentina grow, the Middle East, North Africa and the CIS also made nice contributions. It really is pleasing to see that these markets, which are so important to our long-term future, are also contributing nicely to the company today. 
We are pleased that every one of our geographic regions grew their underlying operating income over the 3 years. Now given the breadth of our business today and considering the economic difficulties that so many countries and regions have experienced over the last 36 months, we are really proud of our employees worldwide for delivering bottom-line growth so broadly. 
Shifting to our use of cash. Over the period, we made excellent use of the strong cash flows generated by our business. From fiscal year '09 through '11, our business generated almost $1.7 billion from operations, and we added another $265 million from the sale of wine assets. So here's how we used this almost $2 billion in cash. 
We first invested behind capital projects and working capital to the tune of $246 million, we reduced net debt by $695 million and the remaining $1 billion was returned to shareholders via ordinary dividends of $524 million, a special dividend of $145 million and share repurchases of $333 million. So in total, we returned 51% of our cash over the 3 years to shareholders by using 36% to reduce net debt and 13% to fund our businesses' capital requirements. At a time when access to capital was restricted like none other in recent history, Brown-Forman's cash flows are as strong as ever, and we believe we put them to excellent use on behalf of shareholders. 
During these challenging 3 years, this generation and use of cash combined with our underlying growth and operating income and strong ROIC enabled Brown-Forman shareholders to enjoy a 13% total shareholder return. This return compares quite favorably to the S&P 500's 2% total return over the same challenging period. 
In addition to these key financial metrics for the period, we also made very meaningful strategic progress at the company over the last 3 years. First of all, the changes in economic conditions propelled us to reevaluate and ultimately reaffirm our strategic direction while adding important new dimensions and additions. With enduring growth and superior returns being critical aspects of our ongoing strategy, we look again at the portfolio and chose to sell most of our wine brands for a solid gain. We believe this will enable us to focus on higher value-added efforts against both existing and new brands. 
An additional element of our portfolio strategy is to strengthen and, in most cases, broaden the portfolio brands we are taking into key markets. Not too long ago, a major barrier to this ambition was our limited influence over the route to consumer, particularly in international markets. Over the last decade, we've made steady progress in improving our influence over end markets sales and marketing activities in key countries around the world, and the last 3 years saw additional strategic steps on this front. 
In some cases, this was more dramatic, as in Germany and Brazil. In other cases, it was more subtle, as in the U.S., Canada, Turkey, the Netherlands and in several countries throughout Eastern Europe including Russia. In all cases, it required strategic investment, patience and new forms of partnering, both internally and externally. 
In addition to our portfolio and route-to-consumer progress, I'm proud of the organizational capabilities we developed and demonstrated over these last 3 years. These include an improved ability to innovate around both existing and new brand expressions; a better harnessing of today's newer media alternatives, giving us better access to consumers and the ability to adjust our messaging based on their feedback; a more comprehensive consideration of what our true investment is behind our brands, going beyond simply the A&P line of the income statement; an improved understanding of how our brands build equity by being part of the consumer social interaction with other consumers; a stronger cost containment and efficiency mindset; a more proactive approach in the arena of corporate social responsibility and, lastly, a much better practice of diversity inclusion. I believe these enhanced capabilities were important contributors to our success over the last 3 years.  
And in closing, I'm pleased with the company's progress, both financial and strategic, as we bring F '11 to a close. As important, I believe this progress has positioned Brown-Forman for continued strong growth and returns in fiscal year '12 and beyond. Thanks for your time this morning, and now we'll open it up to questions."

I think the one-time impact, I mean, there's always from sort of week-to-week and month-to-month transitions you make with transitioning from old package to new package, but we don't anticipate there being anything more dramatic than any other normal packaging change we make. You've got to remember, we do this, it's globally SKU by SKU, and it gets phased in over, to be honest, several months. So I wouldn't anticipate anything there.  And I think that package changes, as we do with all of our portfolio, we're just trying to keep them as current and appropriate for the marketplace as the times demand.  And of course, with Jack Daniel's, we look at that much more closely than we would other brands, because of the power of its primary presentation, its packaging, but there's no actually -- a few things in the press about it we found actually interesting and, in some ways, helpful, too. We consider what we've done with the Jack Daniel's package to be similar to prior packaging evolutions, very evolutionary in nature, honoring a lot of the old-time look and feel of the brand. But also just making sure it's working really, really well in the marketplace. And a couple of the aspects of it that I personally like is I think it has helped the brand present itself in countries around the world as a more global package. A lot of the early work on Jack Daniel's of course was designed for its home market, to the U.S.  And so as we've gone around and made changes over the last 10, 15, 20 years, we've made some changes to it that have made it either appealing or just a little bit more relevant in some of the international markets. So again, that's an evolutionary story. I actually think it's important, too, for us to continue to look at all aspects of the Jack Daniel's packaging, because it gets copied so much. I mean, it's just such a powerful package and shape and presentation, and a lot of whiskey brands look to Jack Daniel's particularly to follow it. And so my personal view is we're going to regularly sort of make sure Jack Daniel's is looking as unique and different and as contemporary as it needs to be while, of course, honoring all of the old-time and iconic look and feel of it."

And if I look at the overall growth in the United States market, for example, in terms of spirits relative to Beer, the Spirits categories already enjoy, I think, a premium position relative to many of the Beer segments.  And when I think about some of this being different between on-premise and off-premise, just taking the prices up at levels like you might have seen in '05, '06, '07, I just don't know that it'd be realistic to expect that we can get that today or that it's a good choice for many of our brands. In some instances, we have been taking prices up more aggressively because there may be repositioning, we've been taking some prices on some brands down because of repositioning.

On the cost side, we were fairly well protected in fiscal 2011 with the hedging that we had. We continue to have hedging on the commodity part of the cost component. We continue to be hedged around 55%, 57% on our commodities. But we won't be as protected next year as what we were this last year.

I think the way we think about it, and I think we said some of this back when we actually announced the sale, but as we head into a new fiscal year and plan for it, it's really -- we've been over many of these quarterly calls, we've talked about some of the performance and difficulties we've had in the United States and our desire to try to improve performance there.  And in essence, what we're doing with this is asking our people to look at this as an investment in the U.S. operation to go implement against the sort of key priorities, which, I mean, I would list a few of them are to, of course, get our most significant brand businesses in the United States performing at our expectation, and in many instances, that includes above the market growth, and that starts with Jack Daniel's and Southern Comfort. But then also goes to many of the new ideas that we've been bringing into the United States, but a lot of these tend to be line extensions. But the sale of these brands enables the people to redirect their attention to getting these brands established in the marketplace and having an impact. And we've done this before at various times that we call them route-to-consumer strategic investments, where you have a lag time often between the investments you make and the results they produce. I mean, I think it's absolutely subject to question about people if they don't -- aren't working in the business every single day, and this happens to be one of those years where it's apparent that the lost brand profit of the Hopland-based brands aren't -- we've just made it visible to you in our financials. But I expect us to, starting with this fiscal year, start to recoup some of that loss profitability and then in future years to surpass it. That was the idea of this strategically.  And I'd also add that -- and we've been pretty consistent about this with the sale of those brands. It wasn't that they weren't profitable for Brown-Forman.  It's just that they were return-challenged, is one of the big topics that has consistently been reinforced about our Wine business, and in addition, it was whether or not they were growing. It's one thing for them to have a base of profitability, those things, which direction is it heading. So we felt that the business that we sold, it had some challenges in terms of growth but it also had challenges in terms of returns, and we thought it was the right decision for the company.

You're always, of course, looking to see what else is happening with your competition out there. And for a variety of different reasons, many of the brands that are direct competitors to some of our key brands and different competitors, actually, in different years, have put pressure on prices downward.  And so that makes it, in some cases, more difficult to take the price up.

We'll look at it not only from a Tennessee Honey perspective, we will also look at it from a Jack Daniel's Family of Brands, so how it might impact the overall growth of the Jack Daniel's trademark.  And I think, increasingly, we'll look at it across a corporate portfolio that packages Tennessee Honey alongside Southern Comfort and any other things that Brown-Forman brings into that segment.

It's not like it's new that we weren't really competing with their other divisions and didn't really pay much attention to them. So the only thing I would've observed over the last 12 months, really, is Fortune's probably putting as much as any competitor on downward pricing pressure in the United States, and you can see it in their price mix pretty strongly. Actually, I think it's pretty good that our brands, particularly Jack Daniel's, continues to hold up pretty well despite that. In other areas where we have direct competition with them, it has been more impactful, maybe, like, say, in the Canadian business. But thinking about them as a competitor worldwide post any type of restructuring for them, I mean, like I said, we consider them to be one of many competitors we've got very directly around the world.  We're used to competing with them. I mean, the way I would think about it is we've -- when I study the performance of, say, the example of Jack Daniel's relative to Jim Beam in terms of overall performance over the last, say, 10 or 15 years, the ultimate results, I think, speak for themselves. And so we've got a lot of work to do to make sure that we continue that. But in any event, I think we'll just wait and monitor, like a lot of folks in the world are, as to what their changing status might be."

We have listed in the press release a number of the risk factors you should consider in conjunction with our forward-looking statements. Other significant risk factors are described in our Form 10-K, Form 8-K and Form 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

256839,115508968,164501,"Brown-Forman Corporation, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 31, 2011",2011-08-31,"Earnings Calls","Brown-Forman Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Ben. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we issued our fiscal 2012 first quarter earnings release and reaffirmed our expectations for the fiscal year. In many ways, this is a continuation of the improving performance story we've been seeing over",1313,"Thanks, Ben. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we issued our fiscal 2012 first quarter earnings release and reaffirmed our expectations for the fiscal year. In many ways, this is a continuation of the improving performance story we've been seeing over the last year or so. With this first quarter, we believe there are 4 key takeaways. 
First, we believe the year is off to a good start, particularly as it relates to our net sales and operating income performance. Overall, we are about where we expected to be on an underlying basis although the mix is a bit different. Once again, our geographic diversification played an important role in our results. Our international sales grew quite well with underlying sales up 8%. Our underlying U.S. sales growth was similar at 7%. Together, they netted to a 7% organic growth rate, a notable improvement over our fiscal 2011 full year trend of 4%. 
For operating income, our 7% underlying growth improved compared to the fiscal 2011 growth of 6%. So in total, we continue to be pleased with this direction in our trends. 
A second key takeaway is that our growth continues to be fairly broad-based, especially geographically as well as from innovation. I'll expand on this more in a moment. 
A third takeaway is that although foreign exchange rates improved reported results for our first quarter when compared to the prior year, they are still relatively in line with the rates we used for the fiscal 2012 guidance that we provided in June. Therefore, our position within the guidance range has not shifted much due to changes in foreign exchange rates. 
The last key takeaway relates to our guidance. Incorporating my previous comments on foreign exchange and considering that the quarter's performance was generally in line with expectations and given how early we are in the fiscal year, we confirmed our full year guidance of $3.45 to $3.85 per share. We also kept unchanged our underlying operating income guidance of mid- to high single digits. 
Let me spend a few minutes talking about our sales performance, starting with our international markets. Germany continued its strong growth where we believe we are benefiting from the route to consumer change made last year when we began directly selling to the trade in this important market. 
We also believe this particular quarter benefited some from a buy-in, in advance of an August 1 price increase. Sales in Russia were also up as we cycle against weak comparisons in the prior-year period where the business was slowed in advance of some route to consumer changes there. Brazil showed strong net sales growth due to higher realized price due to our route to consumer change last year, which enabled us to capture the margin we previously paid to our outside distributor. France, the U.K. and Turkey all continued to have strong underlying trends. And if you look at our emerging markets altogether, they grew at a double-digit rate. 
We experienced net sales declines during the quarter in Poland due largely to a slowing premium vodka category. Spain continued to show weakness with soft consumer takeaway trends related to the difficult economic conditions. And also, we saw a modest sales declines in Australia, which we believe is largely a result of competitive pricing activity in the market. 
Moving onto our portfolio. Our performance was led by the strong growth of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey internationally where the brands saw solid gains with Turkey, Germany and France among the strongest growers. The brand also returned to growth in the United States, where we believe we have the opportunity to further improve the brand's trends. 
Jack Daniel's RTDs performed very well for the quarter due to gains in Germany and Mexico, as well as geographic expansion of various expressions in the U.S., Poland, South Africa and Japan. 
Let me spend a little time talking about Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey. As you all know, the brand was launched in the U.S. in late March. It is off to what we believe is a great start and the results, so far, are encouraging with excellent initial reception from both the trade and consumers. This brand is playing in an exciting and emerging category within the U.S. spirits business. 
Internally, we've debated what we should actually call it, the flavored whiskey category, the flavored brown spirits category. But what we do agree on is that thus far, it has been exciting for the Jack Daniel's trademark and for the U.S. business. According to the latest Nielsen trends, in its first 4 months of sales, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey was larger than the 4 month's sales for Evan Williams Honey, Wild Turkey American Honey and Red Stag combined. 
Nielsen data also reveals that Tennessee Honey is driving most of the growth of the Jack Daniel's trademark in the U.S. To illustrate, last year in the first quarter, the Jack Daniel's Family Nielsen takeaway for net sales was a minus 1%. Using the same Nielsen source for this year's first quarter, the Family was up over 10%. All expressions, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, Gentlemen Jack and Single Barrel are all growing and have all shown an acceleration in Nielsen's versus last year's first quarter so we are encouraged by the impact the Tennessee Honey is having on the rest of the Jack Daniel's family. 
To date, we have seen no signs of significant cannibalization, and we believe that the brand has provided a nice halo for the rest of the Jack Daniel's portfolio. We also believe that the brand is attracting new consumers and new occasions into the franchise. 
Let me also provide a little more color on the strength of Jack Daniel's global performance in the quarter. The Family of Brands net sales were up double digits on an underlying basis. Some of this acceleration and growth is a result of expanding our RTD offerings, our continued geographic expansion and the initial success of Honey. Some of this performance was specific to the quarter. For example, we did experience some retail inventory builds in advance of certain price increases. There were some markets such as Russia with soft comps, and we believe we are towards the end of the initial distribution push and trial phase of Honey. Thus, over the balance of the year, we do expect some moderating trends and give back around the world for the trademark. All of these factors have been considered in our guidance. 
Looking at other aspects of our portfolio, performance was mixed as gains for several brands, including Chambord Vodka, Herradura, Sonoma-Cutrer and Woodford Reserve were offset by declines in some brands including Southern Comfort, Korbel and el Jimador. As with Jack Daniel's, we are using innovation as one of the key initiatives to reverse the trends of some of the softer performers. For example, we are particularly pleased with Herradura. Last fiscal year, we introduced a new package, and performance in both the U.S. and Mexico has accelerated with the first quarter's net sales growing at double digits. 
For Southern Comfort, we continue to see good growth for its lime-flavored extension, and we are about to launch a pepper version in the U.S. in a partnership with Tabasco, another iconic Louisiana brand.  In addition, we are introducing lime and RTD extensions into new overseas markets, and we have other plans for the future, both in terms of flavor expansions as well as additional geographic development. 
So in summary, we are off to a good start, our international growth continues with an 8% underlying first quarter performance, the Jack Daniel's Family of Brands performance has accelerated, and based on its first quarter performance and recognizing how early we are in the fiscal year, we are reiterating our guidance of $3.45 to $3.85 per share for the year. 
So with that, let me open the call for any questions."

But we think there's a lot of the A&P spending, and it's on a percentage change for the first quarter, which is not likely to repeat itself through the course of the fiscal year.

You see a little bit of a mixed bag kind of in the middle. I mean, they're all growing nicely at this juncture. On-premise seems to be now growing kind of at a 1% rate on a 12-month basis when you look at NABCA. So it's an improvement. It's probably not as healthy as what we would like you to see but it's certainly better than what we were seeing over the course of the past 2 to 3 years. And so that's all very encouraging. There is a lot of obvious uncertainty out there from the standpoint of what a lot of the things are happening in the economy today are going to translate to down the road. And we do keep our eye on consumer confidence levels, and they bounce around quite a bit, and they've a taken a bit of a dip here more recently. And so there still continues to be concern on the horizon. We hope that it can be sustainable.

It's been slow to come back, I think, I mean, because it's been a few years here that it's been soft. And that has -- that might have an impact as well on sustained recovery. All the indicators Don talked about, I think, have an influence on that. The other thing that I think is in this U.S. market is the surge of just new ideas and innovation that have come to the market. And on some level, you have to look at the numbers closely. You wonder if that is adding to the market, in fact, growing the market in addition to just swapping share out between brand trademarks. And so a lot of the reports over the last several quarters have shown that new products and innovation as a percentage of the total growth have been rising so I think innovation can play a role in it. And of course, you always worry then, does the market gets stuffed with innovative products. But I do believe in the last couple of years, it's adding to the growth and it's because consumers have an interest in it."

That's why in our schedules, we provided on a nonliter and an equivalent basis so there's adjustment factors we make around the world for case profitability and actual size of the business is. So we're looking at that regularly. I mean, we try, because anytime, depending upon the line extension, you're always sensitive to whether or not you're going to be cannibalizing. So in your efforts to formulation or putting the product out in the market, you wanted to be either where it's neutral or at best, or you would predict where it's premium line extensions, you want to be favorable to the extent that somebody trades in occasion from the parent.

I mean, for us, I mean, I would have to comment on us.

So we were actually in some ways playing catch up to where a couple of our competitors were in front of us. So we're really pleased that we've, so far, got some initial good reaction to, what I'll call just interest in varied drinking occasions, flavors are playing a big role in that, and the consumers and trade would seem kind of interested in this area. So that's why talk a little bit about that. I think I find most encouraging about what we're seeing from Tennessee Honey, that's why we've actually had a hard time defining one specific segment for it, is that it's really tapping to a range of ways that the consumer's using it. Meaning it's basically being consumed both straight and mixed. Who is using it? We're  a wide variety of demographic interest in the band. Even where, it's about off and on-premise so far that we're seeing. And I think it'll be interesting to see is the most comment. One thing that's been encouraging to us is we introduced a whiskey-based product in the warm weather months of the U.S., and it'll be interesting to see, normally people would spew whiskey-based products towards the cool weather months. It's almost having some success in some ways people might stereotype it it's being seasonal. This is a counter-seasonal introduction and it's done pretty well. So far, it's showing great range, which means it might be tapping to a lot of different occasions and a lot of different consumer segments, and we'll just have to see what goes. But it's challenge where's that segment? But it's clearly one of the new things in the last 2 years in the U.S. that is creating some excitement, not just for us but for other companies as well."

Last night, I met with a couple of New York, who have historically been French wine snobs. And they described to me their quest to find yet the mixed, small branch bourbon out of Williams, Brooklyn or up the Hudson. So they also, for some reason, not only would taste bourbon but they also are now seeing rye whiskey's praises. I would have guessed neither of these trends 3 years ago.

And at times, we have a Masters collection that is added to that, that is tapped into expressions such as rye and even -- there would be offshoot of the base would for brands that are basically these artisan expression. We've had some of that. We've done with Forrester. There, I think for a whiskey company, you have to stay alert to these possibilities. And it's one that we've been looking at from a variety of different angles. But we've also -- we have taken note of both the right growth in key markets around the U.S. and also the creation of some of these micro distilleries. So we'll always continue to look at that area, even for the most difficult economic times, stay pretty strong. That's real alter premium and superpremium.

256839,115508968,164568,"Brown-Forman Corporation, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 31, 2011",2011-08-31,"Earnings Calls","Brown-Forman Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Ben. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we issued our fiscal 2012 first quarter earnings release and reaffirmed our expectations for the fiscal year. In many ways, this is a continuation of the improving performance story we've been seeing over",1311,"Thanks, Ben. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we issued our fiscal 2012 first quarter earnings release and reaffirmed our expectations for the fiscal year. In many ways, this is a continuation of the improving performance story we've been seeing over the last year or so. With this first quarter, we believe there are 4 key takeaways. 
First, we believe the year is off to a good start, particularly as it relates to our net sales and operating income performance. Overall, we are about where we expected to be on an underlying basis, although the mix is a bit different. Once again, our geographic diversification played an important role in our results. Our international sales grew quite well with underlying sales up 8%. Our underlying U.S. sales growth was similar at 7%. Together, they netted to a 7% organic growth rate, a notable improvement over our fiscal 2011 full year trend of 4%. 
For operating income, our 7% underlying growth improved compared to the fiscal 2011 growth of 6%. So in total, we continue to be pleased with this direction in our trends. 
A second key takeaway is that our growth continues to be fairly broad-based, especially geographically as well as from innovation. I'll expand on this more in a moment. 
A third takeaway is that although foreign exchange rates improved reported results for our first quarter when compared to the prior year, they are still relatively in line with the rates we used for the fiscal 2012 guidance that we provided in June. Therefore, our position within the guidance range has not shifted much due to changes in foreign exchange rates. 
The last key takeaway relates to our guidance. Incorporating my previous comments on foreign exchange, and considering that the quarter's performance was generally in line with expectations and given how early we are in the fiscal year, we confirmed our full year guidance of $3.45 to $3.85 per share. We also kept unchanged our underlying operating income guidance of mid- to high single digits. 
Let me spend a few minutes talking about our sales performance. Starting with our international markets, Germany continued its strong growth where we believe we are benefiting from the route to consumer change made last year when we began directly selling to the trade in this important market. 
We also believe this particular quarter benefited some from our buy-in, in advance of an August 1 price increase. Sales in Russia were also up as we cycle against weak comparisons in the prior-year period where the business was slowed in advance of some route to consumer changes there. Brazil showed strong net sales growth due to higher realized price due to our route consumer change last year, which enables us to capture the margin we previously paid to our outside distributor. France, the U.K. and Turkey all continued to have strong underlying trends. And if you look at our emerging markets altogether, they grew at a double-digit rate. 
We experienced net sales declines during the quarter in Poland due largely to a slowing premium vodka category. Spain continued to show weakness with soft consumer takeaway trends related to the difficult economic conditions. And also, we saw a modest sales declines in Australia, which we believe is largely a result of competitive pricing activity in the market. 
Moving onto our portfolio. Our performance was led by the strong growth of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey internationally where the brand saw solid gains with Turkey, Germany and France, among the strongest growers. The brand also returned to growth in the United States, where we believe we have the opportunity to further improve the brand's trends. 
Jack Daniel's RTDs performed very well for the quarter due to gains in Germany and Mexico, as well as geographic expansion of various expressions in the U.S., Poland, South Africa and Japan. 
Let me spend a little time talking about Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey. As you all know, the brand was launched in the U.S. in late March. It is off to what we believe is a great start and the results, so far, are encouraging with excellent initial reception from both the trade and consumers. This brand is playing in an exciting and emerging category within the U.S. spirits business. 
Internally, we've debated what we should actually call it, the flavored whiskey category, the flavored brown spirits category. But what we do agree on is that, thus far, it has been exciting for the Jack Daniel's trademark, and for the U.S. business. According to the latest Nielsen trends, in its first 4 months of sales, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey was larger than the 4 month's sales for Evan Williams Honey, Wild Turkey American Honey and Red Stag combined. 
Nielsen data also reveals that Tennessee Honey is driving most of the growth of the Jack Daniel's trademark in the U.S. To illustrate, last year in the first quarter, the Jack Daniel's Family Nielsen takeaway for net sales was a minus 1%. Using the same Nielsen source for this year's first quarter, the Family was up over 10%. All expressions, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, Gentlemen Jack and Single Barrel are all growing and have all shown acceleration in Nielsen's versus last year's first quarter. So we are encouraged by the impact the Tennessee Honey is having on the rest of the Jack Daniel's family. 
To date, we have seen no signs of significant cannibalization, and we believe that the brand has provided a nice halo for the rest of the Jack Daniel's portfolio. We also believe that the brand is attracting new consumers and new occasions into the franchise. 
Let me also provide a little more color on the strength of Jack Daniel's global performance in the quarter. The Family of Brands net sales were up double digits on an underlying basis. Some of this acceleration and growth is the result of expanding our RTD offerings, our continued geographic expansion and the initial success of Honey. Some of this performance was specific to the quarter. For example, we did experience some retail inventory builds in advance of certain price increases. There were some markets such as Russia with soft comps, and we believe we are towards the end of the initial distribution push and trial phase of Honey. Thus, over the balance of the year, we do expect some moderating trends and give back around the world for the trademark. All of these factors have been considered in our guidance. 
Looking at other aspects of our portfolio, performance was mixed as gains for several brands, including Chambord Vodka, Herradura, Sonoma-Cutrer and Woodford Reserve were offset by declines in some brands including Southern Comfort, Korbel and el Jimador. As with Jack Daniel's, we are using innovation as one of the key initiatives to reverse the trends of some of the softer performers. For example, we are particularly pleased with Herradura. Last fiscal year, we introduced a new package, and performance in both the U.S. and Mexico has accelerated with the first quarter's net sales growing at double digits. 
For Southern Comfort, we continue to see good growth for its lime-flavor extension, and we are about to launch a pepper version in the U.S. in a partnership with Tabasco, another iconic Louisiana brand.  In addition, we are introducing lime and RTD extensions into new overseas markets, and we have other plans for the future, both in terms of flavor expansions as well as additional geographic development. 
So in summary, we are off to a good start, our international growth continues with an 8% underlying first quarter performance, the Jack Daniel's Family of Brands performance has accelerated, and based on its first quarter performance and recognizing how early we are in the fiscal year, we are reiterating our guidance of $3.45 to $3.85 per share for the year. 
So with that, let me open the call for any questions."

You see a little bit of a mixed bag, kind of in the middle. I mean, they're all growing nicely at this juncture. On-premise seems to be now growing, kind of at a 1% rate on a 12-month basis when you look at NABCA, so it's an improvement. It's probably not as healthy as what we would like you to see, but it's certainly better than what we were seeing over the course of the past 2 to 3 years. And so that's all very encouraging. There is a lot of obvious uncertainty out there from the standpoint of what a lot of the things are happening in the economy today are going to translate to down the road. And we do keep our eye on consumer confidence levels, and they bounce around quite a bit, and they've a taken a bit of a dip here more recently. And so there still continues to be concern on the horizon. We hope it can be sustainable. We're obviously coming into the important holiday period here, and so we'll keep our eyes closely focused on that. But we're encouraged by what we've seen up to this point in time."

It's been slow to come back, I think, I mean, because it's been a few years here that it's been soft. And that has -- that might have an impact as well on sustained recovery. All the indicators Don talked about, I think, have an influence on that. The other thing that I think is in this U.S. market is the surge of just new ideas and innovation that have come to the market. And on some level, you have to look at the numbers closely. You wonder if that is adding to the market, in fact, growing the market in addition to just swapping share out between brand trademarks. And so a lot of the reports over the last several quarters have shown that new products and innovation as a percentage of the total growth have been rising so I think innovation can play a role in it. And of course, you always worry then, is that do you get over -- does the market gets stuffed with innovative products. But I do believe in the last couple of years, it's adding to the growth, and it's because consumers have an interest in it."

But that is a really competitive particularly RTD market. So I think part of the impact there is just reaction to the price increases that we were taking back to the spring. And as always, with a particularly competitive marketplace like the Australian RTD, you look at that and see what you can you to do your best balancing in pricing volume, we do that in every market everywhere. But it was -- it had a softer quarter as a result of that."

There's a couple of different influences, and I know I don't want to sound like a copout but it really varies, expression by expression. And it will be dependent a little bit on pricing, somewhat on formulation too. Oftentimes, some of the innovation can be at lower proof levels than the parent trademark, and that has to do with of course impact on gross profit. When you move into where a lot of the RTD innovation has been, of course, you've got, I mean, really different sort of price volume relationship there, and you have to look at it a couple of different ways. That's why in our schedules, we provided on a nonliter and an equivalent basis, so there's adjustment factors we make around the world for case profitability and actually what size of the business is. So we're looking at that regularly. I mean, we try, because anytime, depending upon the line this year, you're always sensitive to whether or not you're going to be cannibalizing. So in your efforts to formulation or putting the product out in the market, you wanted to be either where it's neutral or at best for, or you would predict where it's premium line extensions, you want to be favorable to the extent that somebody trades in occasion from the parent. So we look at that awfully close. But I would say it varies depending upon the trademark and whether it's a full strength or in RTD."

I mean, for us, I mean, I would have to comment on us.

So we were actually in some ways playing catch up to where a couple of our competitors were up in front of us. And we're really pleased that we've, so far, got some initial good reaction to this, what I'll call just as interest in varied drinking occasions, flavors are playing a big role in that, and the consumers trade both seem kind of interested in this area. So that's why we talk a little bit about it. I think I find most encouraging about what we're seeing from Tennessee Honey, that's why we've actually had a hard time defining one specific segment for it, is that it's really tapping into a range of ways that the consumer's using it. Meaning, basically being consumed both straight and mixed. Who is using it? We're getting a wide variety of demographic interest in the brand. Even where, it's about off and on-premise so far that we've seen. And I think it'll be interesting to see is the most common. One thing that's been encouraging to us is that we introduced a whiskey-based product in the warm weather months of the U.S., and it'll be interesting to see, normally people would spew whiskey-based products toward the cold weather months. It's almost having some success in some ways, and people might stereotype it as being seasonal. This is a counter-seasonal introduction, and it's done pretty well. So far, it's showing great range, which means it may be tapping into a lot of different occasions and a lot of different consumer segments, and we'll just have to see what goes. But to make the challenge and say where's that segment? But it's clearly one of the new things in the last 2 years in the U.S. that are creating some excitement, not just for us but for other companies as well."

Last night, I met with a couple in New York, who have historically been French wine snobs. And they described to me their quest to find yet the mixed, small batch bourbon out of Williamsburg, Brooklyn or up the Hudson. So they also, for some reason, not only would taste bourbon, but also they are now saying rye whiskey's praises. I would have guessed neither of these trends 3 years ago. And I wonder whether within Brown-Forman, you have any portfolio items that you can sort of use to reposition to address this quest or also just your views in general about the pressures may be felt by that crest and artisanal and spirits category that seems to grow?"

I would mention earlier, the super premium and ultra-premium expressions are causing a lot -- I didn't segment it down to what I think you're calling the artisanal or the micro-distiller, there's a lot of action in that area all over the country. And I actually like to think that Woodford Reserve at Brown-Forman was the original, and It's doing very, very well for the company both here in the U.S. and in selected international market. And at times, we have a Masters collection that is added to that, that is tapped into the expression such as rye and other -- even  there would be offshoots of the base would for brand that are basically these are artisanal expressions. And so, we've had some of that. We've done it at times with Ford Forrester. There, I think for a whiskey company, you have to stay alert to these possibilities. And it's one that we've been looking at from a variety of different angles. But we've also -- we have taken note of both the rye growth in key markets around the U.S. and also the creation of some of these micro distilleries. Some will always continue to look at that area, even through the most difficult economic times, stay pretty strong. That's real ultrapremiums and superpremium. Of course, you always have to make those products well in advance of their time in the market. So that's always one of the factors for the aged products. But it's a pretty exciting area."

This morning, we issued our fiscal 2012 first quarter earnings release and reaffirmed our expectations for the fiscal year. In many ways, this is a continuation of the improving performance story we've been seeing over the last year or so. With this first quarter, we believe there are 4 key takeaways. 
First, we believe the year is off to a good start, particularly as it relates to our net sales and operating income performance. Overall, we are about where we expected to be on an underlying basis, although the mix is a bit different. Once again, our geographic diversification played an important role in our results. Our international sales grew quite well with underlying sales up 8%. Our underlying U.S. sales growth was similar at 7%. Together, they netted to a 7% organic growth rate, a notable improvement over our fiscal 2011 full year trend of 4%. 
For operating income, our 7% underlying growth improved compared to the fiscal 2011 growth of 6%. So in total, we continue to be pleased with this direction in our trends. 
A second key takeaway is that our growth continues to be fairly broad-based, especially geographically as well as from innovation. I'll expand on this more in a moment. 
A third takeaway is that although foreign exchange rates improved reported results for our first quarter when compared to the prior year, they are still relatively in line with the rates we used for the fiscal 2012 guidance that we provided in June. Therefore, our position within the guidance range has not shifted much due to changes in foreign exchange rates. 
The last key takeaway relates to our guidance. Incorporating my previous comments on foreign exchange, and considering that the quarter's performance was generally in line with expectations and given how early we are in the fiscal year, we confirmed our full year guidance of $3.45 to $3.85 per share. We also kept unchanged our underlying operating income guidance of mid- to high-single digits. 
Let me spend a few minutes talking about our sales performance. Starting with our international markets, Germany continued its strong growth where we believe we are benefiting from the route to consumer change made last year when we began directly selling to the trade in this important market. 
We also believe this particular quarter benefited some from a buy-in, in advance of an August 1 price increase. Sales in Russia were also up as we cycle against weak comparisons in the prior-year period where the business was slowed in advance of some route to consumer changes there. Brazil showed strong net sales growth due to higher realized price due to our route to consumer change last year, which enables us to capture the margin we previously paid to our outside distributor. France, the U.K. and Turkey all continued to have strong underlying trends. And if you look at our emerging markets altogether, they grew at a double-digit rate. 
We experienced net sales declines during the quarter in Poland due largely to a slowing premium vodka category. Spain continued to show weakness with soft consumer takeaway trends related to the difficult economic conditions. And also, we saw modest sales declines in Australia, which we believe is largely a result of competitive pricing activity in the market. 
Moving on to our portfolio. Our performance was led by the strong growth of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey internationally where the brand saw solid gains with Turkey, Germany and France among the strongest growers. The brand also returned to growth in the United States, where we believe we have the opportunity to further improve the brand's trends. 
Jack Daniel's RTDs performed very well for the quarter due to gains in Germany and Mexico, as well as geographic expansion of various expressions in the U.S., Poland, South Africa and Japan. 
Let me spend a little time talking about Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey. As you all know, the brand was launched in the U.S. in late March. It is off to what we believe is a great start and the results, so far, are encouraging with excellent initial reception from both the trade and consumers. This brand is playing in an exciting and emerging category within the U.S. spirits business. 
Internally, we've debated what we should actually call it, the flavored whiskey category, the flavored brown spirits category. But what we do agree on is that, thus far, it has been exciting for the Jack Daniel's trademark, and for the U.S. business. According to the latest Nielsen trends, in its first 4 months of sales, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey was larger than the 4-month sales for Evan Williams Honey, Wild Turkey American Honey and Red Stag combined. 
Nielsen data also reveals that Tennessee Honey is driving most of the growth of the Jack Daniel's trademark in the U.S. To illustrate, last year in the first quarter, the Jack Daniel's Family Nielsen takeaway for net sales was a minus 1%. Using the same Nielsen source for this year's first quarter, the Family was up over 10%. All expressions, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, Gentlemen Jack and Single Barrel are all growing and have all shown acceleration in Nielsen's versus last year's first quarter. So we are encouraged by the impact the Tennessee Honey is having on the rest of the Jack Daniel's family. 
To date, we have seen no signs of significant cannibalization, and we believe that the brand has provided a nice halo for the rest of the Jack Daniel's portfolio. We also believe that the brand is attracting new consumers and new occasions into the franchise. 
Let me also provide a little more color on the strength of Jack Daniel's global performance in the quarter. The Family of Brands net sales were up double digits on an underlying basis. Some of this acceleration and growth is the result of expanding our RTD offerings, our continued geographic expansion and the initial success of Honey. Some of this performance was specific to the quarter. For example, we did experience some retail inventory builds in advance of certain price increases. There were some markets such as Russia with soft comps, and we believe we are towards the end of the initial distribution push and trial phase of Honey. Thus, over the balance of the year, we do expect some moderating trends and giveback around the world for the trademark. All of these factors have been considered in our guidance. 
Looking at other aspects of our portfolio, performance was mixed as gains for several brands, including Chambord Vodka, Herradura, Sonoma-Cutrer and Woodford Reserve were offset by declines in some brands including Southern Comfort, Korbel and el Jimador. As with Jack Daniel's, we are using innovation as one of the key initiatives to reverse the trends of some of the softer performers. For example, we are particularly pleased with Herradura. Last fiscal year, we introduced a new package, and performance in both the U.S. and Mexico has accelerated with the first quarter's net sales growing at double digits. 
For Southern Comfort, we continue to see good growth for its lime-flavor extension, and we are about to launch a pepper version in the U.S. in a partnership with Tabasco, another iconic Louisiana brand. In addition, we are introducing lime and RTD extensions into new overseas markets, and we have other plans for the future, both in terms of flavor expansions as well as additional geographic development. 
So in summary, we are off to a good start, our international growth continues with an 8% underlying first quarter performance, the Jack Daniel's Family of Brands performance has accelerated, and based on its first quarter performance and recognizing how early we are in the fiscal year, we are reiterating our guidance of $3.45 to $3.85 per share for the year. 
So with that, let me open the call for any questions."

On-premise seems to be now growing, kind of at a 1% rate on a 12-month basis when you look at NABCA, so it's an improvement. It's probably not as healthy as what we would like you to see, but it's certainly better than what we were seeing over the course of the past 2 to 3 years. And so that's all very encouraging. There is a lot of obvious uncertainty out there from the standpoint of what a lot of the things are happening in the economy today are going to translate to down the road. And we do keep our eye on consumer confidence levels, and they bounce around quite a bit, and they've taken a bit of a dip here more recently.

It's been slow to come back, I think, I mean, because it's been a few years here that it's been soft. And that has -- that might have an impact as well on sustained recovery. All the indicators Don talked about, I think, have an influence on that. The other thing that I think is in this U.S. market is the surge of just new ideas and innovation that have come to the market. And on some level, you have to look at the numbers closely, you wonder if that is adding to the market, in fact, growing the market in addition to just swapping share out between brand trademarks. And so a lot of the reports over the last several quarters have shown that new products and innovation as a percentage of the total growth have been rising so I think innovation can play a role in it. And of course, you always worry then, is that do you get over -- does the market get stuffed with innovative products.

When you move into where a lot of the RTD innovation has been, of course, you've got a, I mean, really different sort of price volume relationship there, and you have to look at it a couple of different ways. That's why in our schedules, we’ve provided on a nonliter and an equivalent basis, so there's adjustment factors we make around the world for per case profitability and actual what the size of the business is. So we're looking at that regularly. I mean, we try, because anytime, depending upon the line [indiscernible], you're always sensitive to whether or not you're going to be cannibalizing. So in your efforts to formulation or putting the product out in the market, you want it to be either where it's neutral or at best for you, particularly with these premium line extensions, you want it to be favorable to the extent that somebody trades an occasion from the parent.

I mean, for us, I mean, I’d have to comment on us. I mean, I think part of this, is we are participating in something that U.S. segment or the U.S. distilled spirits industry had been seeing prior to us. So we were actually, in my view, in some ways playing catch-up to where a couple of our competitors were out in front of us. And we're really pleased that we've, so far, got some initial good reaction to this, what I'll call just interest in varied drinking occasions, and flavors are playing a big role in that, and the consumer and trade both seem kind of interested in this area. So that's why we’ve talked a little bit about it. And the thing that I find most encouraging about what we're seeing from Tennessee Honey, it’s why we've actually had a hard time defining one specific segment for it, is that it's really tapping into a range of ways that the consumer's using it. Meaning, it’s basically being consumed both straight and mixed. Who is using it? We're getting a wide variety of demographic interest in the brand. Even where, it's both on and off premise so far that we've seen. And I think it'll be interesting to see as the months go, I mean one thing that's been encouraging to us is that we introduced a whiskey-based product in the warm weather months of the U.S., and it'll be interesting to see, normally people would skew whiskey-based products toward the cold weather months. So it's almost having some success in some ways, and people might have stereotyped it as being seasonal, this is a counter-seasonal introduction, and it's done pretty well. So far, it's showing great range, which means it may be tapping into a lot of different occasions and a lot of different consumer segments, and we'll just have to see where it goes. But it makes it a challenge to say, “Well, what is this segment?” But it's clearly one of the new things in the last 2 years in the U.S. that is creating some excitement, not just for us but for other companies as well."

Last night, I met with a couple in New York, who have historically been French wine snobs. And they described to me their quest to find yet the next small batch bourbon out of Williamsburg, Brooklyn or up the Hudson. So they also, for some reason, not only would taste bourbon, but also they are now singing rye whiskey's praises. I would have guessed neither of these trends 3 years ago. And I wonder whether within Brown-Forman, you have any portfolio items that you can sort of use to reposition to address this quest or also just your views in general about the pressures maybe felt by that crest and artisanal spirits category that seems to grow?"

I was mentioning earlier, the super premium and ultra-premium expressions are causing a lot -- I didn't segment it down to what I think you're calling the artisanal or the micro-distiller, there's a lot of action in that area all over the country. And I actually like to think that Woodford Reserve at Brown-Forman was the original, and it's doing very, very well for the company both here in the U.S. and in selected international markets. And at times, we have a Masters collection that is added to that, that has tapped into the expression such as rye and other more -- even that would be offshoots of the base Woodford brand that are basically these artisanal expressions. And so, we've had some of that. We've done it at times with Old Forester. There, I think for a whiskey company, you have to stay alert to these possibilities. And it's one that we've been looking at from a variety of different angles. But we've also -- we have taken note of both the rye growth in key markets around the U.S. and also the creation of some of these micro distilleries. So it’s something we’ll always continue to look at. That area, even through the most difficult economic times, stayed pretty strong. That's real ultrapremiums and superpremium. Of course, you always have to make those products well in advance of their time in the market. So that's always one of the factors for the aged products. But it's a pretty exciting area."

256839,139665271,200039,"Brown-Forman Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Dec 08, 2011",2011-12-08,"Earnings Calls","Brown-Forman Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I hope you've all seen the results we announced this morning. I thought I would start my comments acknowledging a particularly nice milestone for Brown-Forman. Our reported net sales for the quarter topped $1 billion,",2004,"Thanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I hope you've all seen the results we announced this morning. I thought I would start my comments acknowledging a particularly nice milestone for Brown-Forman. Our reported net sales for the quarter topped $1 billion, the first time in Brown-Forman's history. In addition to that milestone, let me summarize what we believe are the key takeaways for our first half results.
First, both underlying sales growth and underlying operating income growth accelerated during the first half of the fiscal year; second, our strong sales growth was driven by a number of factors, including higher volumes, strong growth for the Jack Daniel's Family of Brands, nice results from various marketing and product innovations such as line extensions, packaging improvements and marketing communications, continuation of our robust international growth story and nice trading up to our superpremium price brands; and third, favorable foreign exchange trends reversed during the second quarter. And looking forward, current exchange rates are significantly affecting our rest of the year outlook. In fact, while we expect continuing strong underlying performance in the second half, slightly stronger than when we set our earnings guidance for the fiscal year back in June, we have adjusted our full year outlook due to the current exchange rates.
So let me start with more color on our top line growth and dealt further into the 10% underlying net sales growth for the quarter. Let's start with the powerful Jack Daniel's trademark and dive a little deeper. On a constant currency basis, net sales for the Jack Daniel's family grew 16% and all of the trademark's various expressions posted healthy growth. Particularly worth mentioning is the progress with Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey in United States. This expression of Jack Daniel's launched in March continued as strong momentum in the quarter. Looking at the Nielsen data through November 12, on a rolling 3-month basis, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey is clearly the leader among the recent flavored whiskeys, outselling all of the entries such as Red Stag and American Honey on a value basis almost 2 to 1. Importantly, Tennessee Honey also seemed to be expanding the Jack Daniel's franchise in a number of ways. Similarly, with what we've seen before when launching Jack Daniel's RTDs in various markets, Honey seem to have had a bit of a Halo effect on Tennessee Whiskey in United States as takeaway trends for our largest expression continue to improve.
In addition, not only have we seen an expansion for Jack Daniel's into new drinking occasions, we've also seen new consumers come into the franchise. So we are encouraged by the excitement of Tennessee Honey is generating for the Jack trademark in our largest market.
Let me turn now and talk some more about our international story. Geographically, we continue to make broad-based progress. In our first 6 months, 26 of our top 30 markets grew constant currency net sales and over half of them grew at double-digit rates. Overall, underlying sales internationally grew double digits, led by the Jack Daniel's family. Let me cite a few of our international success stories, particularly where we made some recent route-to-consumer changes last year.
First, if you add up all of the various emerging markets for the first half, we had some impressive growth with underlying sales up about 20%. Highlighting a few of these markets where we made route-to-consumer changes, Brazil, Russia and turkey all grew underlying net sales in the very high double digits. While we change our route-to-consumer in Mexico a few years ago, underlying net sales there grew over 20%. Recall, with the Casa Herradura in 2007, we also gained the Mexican distribution company where we ultimately moved our existing Brown-Forman portfolio. Casa Herradura also had a leading in Mexico's RTD business with its mix product line. Basically, el Jimador conveniently prepackaged as margaritas, Palomas and with [indiscernible]. Not only has the new mix line continue to grow in Mexico where we've also introduced it into the United States and in addition, using this RTD capability, we were able to launch Jack Daniel's RTDs into Mexico over 2 years ago which sold over 300,000 cases in its first year. We continue to grow at very solid double-digit rates in the first half of this fiscal year. As part of our innovations initiatives, we've also used this opportunity to introduce a new Finlandia product, Finlandia Frost, a product that was developed specifically for the Mexican market.
Turning to some developed countries. In spite of Europe's challenges, the U.K. have solid underlying net sales growth in the high-single digits. France was up strong double digits and in Germany, where we also made a change in distribution about a year ago, underlying net sales were also up double digits.
While perhaps not one of our key highlights, let me speak for a moment about one of our most important brands, Southern Comfort. SoCo continue to be challenged with underlying net sales, down 7% for the first half. It is under intense competition, particularly in the on-premise and is particularly challenged in the U.S. with a keen interest by consumers in the relatively new flavored whiskey a new flavored whiskey phenomenon, along with their continued interest in flavored vodkas and spiced rums.
We have continue to pursue a number of initiatives to reinvigorate this brand. For example, SoCo line was launched to reintroduce the brand to in the shot shoot occasion and sparked increased trials with SoCo's target demographic. As a follow-on, we just launched SoCo Fiery Pepper in the U.S. in October. We are also investing in the consumer communication strategy that includes digital and TV advertising that started in the U.S. in mid-October to create additional brand awareness. A number of similar initiatives are taking place in these key countries outside the United States.
Let me move on to some highlights from the rest of our results and then speak to our guidance. Our reported gross margin for the first 6 months declined one percentage point versus last year to 49.7%. As I'm sure you recall, we sold the Hopland-based wine business last fiscal year. However, we still have an agency relationship for selling essentially all of these wine brands that under our agreement with [indiscernible] continues through the end of December. This agency arrangements delivers a substantially lower gross margin to us than a year ago when we own the brands. This accounts for 0.7 points of the decline. Adjusting for the Hopland-based brands, our gross margin declined 3/10 of a point for the first 6 months. This remainder of the decline in gross margin reflects higher input cost and excise taxes in an environment where at least up to now, it has been difficult to take pricing. 
In terms of pricing, we believe the environment may have improved somewhat following the downturn a couple of years ago. It appears the promotional pricing activity seems to have abated somewhat. We always try to look for that sweet spot between volume growth and pricing growth and given the recent robust volume metric growth we've seen for Jack Daniel's globally, we expect to be looking more closely at potential price increases for that trademark over the next 6 to 12 months.
Looking at operating expenses for the first half, we intentionally frontloaded our AMP investments in order to support the launch of various brand line extensions including Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and Jack Daniel's RTDs in Japan. SG&A spending for the first half increased partially from the [indiscernible] consumer investment we made in several markets last year, which won't being cycling against comparable numbers until second half of this year. Additionally, we have made some further investments in our infrastructure and people in various markets around the world [indiscernible] in support of present and future growth.
Turning now to taxes. The effective tax rate for the first half was 34.1% and was up about one point versus last year, primarily because of discreet items arising during the period. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the 33% to 33.5% range for the full fiscal year. As we mentioned in the earnings release, the share repurchase program expired at the end of November. During the program, we used $234 million of cash flow to buy 3.4 million shares at an average price of just over $69 a share compared to our recent price of about $80 per share. This program was in addition to the aggregate $513 million worth of shares we purchased in our prior 3 share repurchase programs, which had an average cost of just under $52 per share. 
As we look forward to the second half, we expect to see similar growth in our underlying sales as we saw in the first half. However, on a reported basis, in addition to the negative impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, we do not expect the same level of pipeline fill from new product introductions. We also saw a pretty good build in trade inventories through October in advance of a number of activities including some anticipated price increases in several markets, the timing of some promotional activities and in a few markets, in advance of some announced excise tax increases, all of which we expect will rebalance in the second half of the year. 
For the rest of the year, we expect our underlying ENP spend to continue to grow year-over-year, but at a more modest rate as we moderate spending on new brand extensions. We expect underlying SG&A to continue at similar rates for the remainder of the year. So overall, we expect our full year underlying operating income to grow in the high-single digits. 
As we move into the second half, I'd just like to remind everyone that in addition to the strong U.S. dollar, assuming the rates today hold for the balance of the year, our reported numbers will be particularly affected by the absence of both the profits associated with the Hopland wines, as well as the gain on the sale of that business in last year's fourth quarter. The Hopland wines provided full year earnings per share of $0.17 to $0.18 last year and we also recognized $0.26 per share from the gain on that sale. 
Turning to some uses of cash. We anticipate capital expenditures to come in between $65 million and $75 million, reflecting continuing expansion of our production facilities to meet the growing demand of our Jack Daniel's franchise. Further, we raised our quarterly dividend by 9.4% and expect that to annualized to about $200 million use of cash flow over the next 12 months.
So looking at our guidance. For the full year, we are adjusting our EPS outlook to a range of $3.45 to $3.70. This range reflects continued high single-digit underlying operating income growth, but also continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. So let me spend a minute on foreign exchange. In June, we had originally forecasted that earnings would be positively impacted by foreign exchange by a few cents. But as the year has unfolded, the U.S. dollar has strengthened and we are now forecasting a $0.10 to $0.11 decline in earnings year-on-year due to FX. This is included in our updated guidance. 
Looking at it further, going forward for the rest of the year and considering our hedged positions, we estimate that at the current rates were to strengthen 10%, our EPS would decline by about $0.06. Conversely, if the current rates were to weaken by 10%, our EPS would increase by about the same. 
So in summary, we are pleased by the acceleration of our underlying sales and operating income during the first half. We acknowledge that the continued volatility in exchange rates and our cautious surrounding the fragile global economy, particularly in the Eurozone. However, we anticipate that our underlying trends will continue for the balance of the fiscal year and we remain confident in our long-term top line growth prospects.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Paul."

While we've incorporated into our guidance this morning the expectations of some unf",793,"Thanks, Don. Let me add just a few supplementary comments to what Don's already said. And first, I want to say that we're just very pleased with these first half results. While we've incorporated into our guidance this morning the expectations of some unfavorable FX in the second half, the company's underlying growth rates of net sales and operating income, which are both in the high-single digits are a nice acceleration over both last year and the last 3 years. We find this really encouraging. These strong organic growth results, combined with the company's healthy ROIC and balance sheet positions us well, we believe, for both the second half of this fiscal year and the years that follow it. Reinforcing something Don mentioned, we are improving Southern Comfort's performance. It remains the top priority for the company. And in the year ahead, we'll be giving heightened attention to pricing opportunities for our brands around the world. We believe that our efforts on both of these fronts have the potential to strengthen the company even further. 
Something we've been discussing for some time now is the importance of quality new ideas to our company's organic growth story. An examples of these ideas abound to Brown-Forman today. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, the lime and pepper expressions from Southern Comfort, Chambord Vodka and our forthcoming lang of Little Black Dress vodkas are nice examples of recent portfolio innovation. The acceleration we've seen in Herradura tequila sale is being driven in part by a significant redesign of the brand's primary package and this represents packaging innovation. 
Our current holiday advertising for Jack Daniel's showing our Lynchburg Tennessee community gathering for the lighting of a Christmas tree made of our whiskey barrels, is a wonderfully creative advertising idea. We refer to this as an example of marketing communications innovation. 
And finally, our performance in markets such as Germany, Brazil, Russia and Mexico are partially attributable to a variety of route-to-market ideas being implemented by our employees in those markets and this represents a form of marketplace innovation. 
Our ability to generate and successfully implement new ideas such as these is an increasingly important and exciting aspect of our work today at Brown-Forman. 
And finally, I'd like to highlight important category trend in our and the industry's largest distilled spirits market in the United States. Referencing the Nielsen data ended November 12, the 12-month growth rate of distilled spirits measured in dollar sales has accelerated from 1.8%, one year ago to 3.4% today. This alone is good news, but even more encouraging for Brown-Forman is that the total whiskey category, encompassing all whiskeys including bourbon, Canadian, Scotch, Irish has accelerated even faster, advancing from a 1.1% rate a year ago to a 5.4% rate today. 
The fact that the growth rate in whiskey has outpaced distilled spirits by a full 2 percentage points over the last year is the departure from the basic trend observed over the last several decades, where whiskey has consistently lagged the performance of distilled spirits as a whole. Even more exciting for our company is the fact that bourbon and American whiskey, the largest U.S. subsegment of total whiskey and the one in which Brown-Forman has the strongest position has accelerated from 1.8% a year ago to 6.5% today. This momentum is attributable to both general and specific factors, where generally we believe that bourbon is benefiting from the consumers' growing desire with brands with authenticity, heritage existing quantity. And more specifically, the categories accelerating due to explosive growth of flavored whiskeys, led in Mac last 6 months by Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey as well as excellent growth of the super and ultra premium price segments through our Gentlemen Jack, Woodford Reserve and Jack Daniel's Single Barrel combine to give Brown-Forman a strong position. 
While we still have a lot of room to improve the U.S. business, these favorable category trends and our ability to participate in them are contributing factors to Brown-Forman in the most recent 3 moths Neilson period is growing its share of the U.S. spirits market for the first time in several years. This really does make an exciting time to be in American whiskey in America and the same is increasingly true in countries throughout the world. We expect to continue to be a big part of that excitement. 
In closing, let me thank my colleagues across our global beverage business. We are able to report these strong first half results only because of the collective efforts of our people and regional and brand management, marketing, sales, finance, production, IT, legal, HR and corporate services.  My congratulations and thanks to each and everyone of you. 
That concludes our prepared remarks for the morning, and we're now open for questions."

I think as we look across just as we have with Southern Comfort more recently, which in the last 2 years or so, has introduced a couple of flavors into the Southern Comfort trademark into the U.S. and started to expand some of those into other countries. We'll be looking at all of our whiskey trademarks to see where they can best participate and what is the sort of exciting and growing new segment. But expect us to be more thoughtful I think on the Jack Daniel's side. We're going to take it sort of a step at a time, which meant really being sort of month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter."

And then in total, the overall whiskey category relative to distilled spirits is couple of points ahead from the last 12 months is a real shift versus what I would have all experienced over the last 10 or 20 or even 30 years. I mean, the shift from whiskey to what [indiscernible] refers as white goods, in some, ways, started in the 50s and back then there was very little vodka sold in the U.S. So there's been amazing story in vodka in the U.S. as one of the big contributing factors to this and vodka continues to grow, too. So it's a great time for the U.S. spirts market generally, but some of those comments I made about just the acceleration in the whiskey category, maybe attributable, I think, post the 2008 and 2009  periods. Some of the mind shifts of consumers towards products that had that real heritage and authenticity and in some ways additional values. We were seeing, I think Ben mentioned on his call before, micro distilleries and real interest in the craft of whiskey out there. And so I think that's a contributing factor, but no doubt on the shorter-term, these flavored whiskeys have added really interest to the category, both directly and to Halo effect."

Once we go beyond looking at what the business requirements are, then the dividend is something that's very important to us and this is the time of the year that we look at that and in November, we announced the dividend increase. And then from that point going forward, we certainly look at acquisitions as a key component of looking for ways to create shareholder value and to find opportunities that might be out there particularly brands that might do well in our hands. And to the extent that we can find those kinds of things that create shareholder value, we'll certainly look at acquisitions.

We've been dealing with a lot of these individual country-by-country excise tax increases and for the last 2 or 3 years. And you generally see similar patterns where you see the buying upfront at both at a consumer and a trade level and then it takes a while but eventually, it kind of sticks and things level out and get more back to normal. There's nothing that we've seen that would indicate that you wouldn't see some of those normal patterns in these situations. On the U.S. side, at the federal level, every time that Washington is looking for ways to increase their revenues, there's always the concern that federal excise taxes can be on the table. We've been pretty effective at keeping it at bay. One of the things that we have learned as an industry is that it's not only the impact of spirits or the alcohol beverages when we historically have seen these federal excise tax increases, there's a much broader impact. So hospitality industry overall whether you're looking at waiters or bartenders or a whole host of various labor factions that get impacted. And so we've been really pretty effective at building a much broader base of constituents around these issues including the hotels and the restaurants and what have you to make sure that as these issues come up, people really recognize the full impact that these tax increases could have, not just in terms as it relates to the price of the beverages but the impact that it has on the overall economy. And I think the effectiveness of that has really proven out given that there really hasn't been any major excise tax increase in quite some time. And so we'll continue to work that and to do what we can to keep excise tax at bay the best we can."

We actually in many markets we call alliance markets where we're partnered up with Bocardi and many instances, Remi have a dedicated division to the portfolio that would include those 3 companies. And so there are a wide variety of dedicated efforts that you can observe, not only at the distributor  level, but also within the supplier sales ranks that people I think find effective. So as it relates to how it may be showing up in our results -- I mean, any impact from that, I mean, you probably heard my comments earlier, in the last 12 months, we've gained share, the U.S. spirits segment for the first time in a while. So it wouldn't be apparent in that statistics. And I think the other thing too is typically when you get that dedication, you then to have the kind of scale and volumetric volumes in general to be able to demand at them. Our observation remains about the U.S. market today, which is that it's really not the large high-volume and biggest players that are winning right now in the U.S. distilled spirits market. It's probably more the entrepreneurial smaller companies that are winning with innovation and more entrepreneurial flair if you just look at the numbers. So I mean, the company-by-company, a lot of the growth is coming out of may be more nimble and fast moving and innovative competitors and it's one of the things that certainly caught our attention over the last few years."

And so that's a great lessen that we've learned and so we think our lab is a real asset in this to help us to create when we go to a flavor to create the right formula so that is appealing as we wanted to be."

Don will begin our call this morning and will provide some color on results for our second quarter and first half, recent trends and some thoughts on guidance. Paul will provide a few high-level strategic remarks, and then we will open the call for questions.
This morning's conference call contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Numerous risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in these statements. Many of the factors that will determine future results are beyond the company's ability to control or predict. You should not place any undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, and the company undertakes no obligation to update any of these statements, whether due to new information, future events or otherwise.
This morning, we issued a press release containing our results for the fiscal 2012 second quarter. This release can be found on our website under the section titled Investor Relations.
In the press release, we have listed a number of the risk factors that you should consider in conjunction with our forward-looking statements. Other significant risk factors are described in our Form 10-K, Form 8-K and Form 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
During this call, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures and the reason management believes they provide useful information to investors regarding the company's financial conditions and results of operations are contained in the press release.

256839,139665271,200111,"Brown-Forman Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Dec 08, 2011",2011-12-08,"Earnings Calls","Brown-Forman Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I hope you've all seen the results we announced this morning. I thought I would start my comments acknowledging a particularly nice milestone for Brown-Forman. Our reported net sales for the quarter topped $1 billion,",2010,"Thanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I hope you've all seen the results we announced this morning. I thought I would start my comments acknowledging a particularly nice milestone for Brown-Forman. Our reported net sales for the quarter topped $1 billion, the first time in Brown-Forman's history. In addition to that milestone, let me summarize what we believe are the key takeaways for our first half results.
First, both underlying sales growth and underlying operating income growth accelerated during the first half of the fiscal year. Second, our strong sales growth was driven by a number of factors, including higher volumes; strong growth for the Jack Daniel's Family of Brands; nice results from various marketing and product innovations, such as line extensions, packaging improvements and marketing communications; a continuation of our robust international growth story; and nice trading up to our super-premium priced brands. And third, favorable foreign exchange trends reversed during the second quarter. And looking forward, current exchange rates are significantly affecting our rest-of-the-year outlook. In fact, while we expect continuing strong underlying performance in the second half, slightly stronger than when we set our earnings guidance for the fiscal year back in June, we have adjusted our full-year outlook due to the current exchange rates.
So let me start with more color on our top line growth and delve further into the 10% underlying net sales growth for the quarter. Let's start with the powerful Jack Daniel's trademark and dive a little deeper. On a constant currency basis, net sales for the Jack Daniel's family grew 16%, and all of the trademark's various expressions posted healthy growth. Particularly worth mentioning is the progress with Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey in the United States. This expression of Jack Daniel's launched in March continued to have strong momentum in the quarter. Looking at the Nielsen data through November 12, on a rolling 3-month basis, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey is clearly the leader among the recent flavored whiskeys, outselling all of the entries such as Red Stag and American Honey on a value basis almost 2 to 1. Importantly, Tennessee Honey also seemed to be expanding the Jack Daniel's franchise in a number of ways. Similarly, with what we've seen before when launching Jack Daniel's RTDs in various markets, Honey seemed to have had a bit of a halo effect on Tennessee Whiskey in the United States as takeaway trends for our largest expression continue to improve. In addition, not only have we seen an expansion for Jack Daniel's into new drinking occasions, but we've also seen new consumers coming into the franchise. So we are encouraged by the excitement that Tennessee Honey is generating for the Jack trademark in our largest market.
Let me turn now and talk some more about our international story. Geographically, we continue to make broad-based progress. In our first 6 months, 26 of our top 30 markets grew constant currency net sales, and over half of them grew at double-digit rates. Overall, underlying sales internationally grew double digits, led by the Jack Daniel's family. Let me cite a few of our international success stories, particularly where we made some recent route-to-consumer changes last year.
First, if you add up all of the various emerging markets for the first half, we had some impressive growth with underlying sales up about 20%. Highlighting a few of these markets where we made route-to-consumer changes, Brazil, Russia and Turkey all grew underlying net sales in very high double digits. While we changed our route-to-consumer in Mexico a few years ago, underlying net sales there grew over 20%. Recall with the Casa Herradura acquisition in 2007, we also gained a Mexican distribution company where we ultimately moved our existing Brown-Forman portfolio. Casa Herradura also had a leading position in Mexico's RTD business with this new mix product line. Basically, el Jimador conveniently prepackaged as margaritas, palomas and with sangrita. Not only has the new mix line continue to grow in Mexico, but we've also introduced it into the United States. And in addition, using this RTD capability, we were able to launch Jack Daniel's RTDs into Mexico over 2 years ago, which sold over 300,000 cases in its first year and continue to grow at very strong double-digit rates in the first half of this fiscal year. As part of our innovation initiatives, we've also used this opportunity to introduce a new Finlandia product, Finlandia Frost, a product that was developed specifically for the Mexican market.
Turning to some developed countries. In spite of Europe's challenges, the U.K. have solid underlying net sales growth in the high single digits. France was up strong double digits, and in Germany, where we also made a change in distribution about a year ago, underlying net sales were also up double digits.
While perhaps not one of our key highlights, let me speak for a moment about one of our most important brands, Southern Comfort. SoCo continue to be challenged with underlying net sales down 7% for the first half. It is under intense competition, particularly in the on-premise and is particularly challenged in the U.S. with a keen interest by consumers in the relatively new flavored whiskey phenomena -- a new flavored whiskey phenomena, along with their continued interest in flavored vodkas and spiced rums.
We have continued to pursue a number of initiatives to reinvigorate this brand. For example, SoCo Lime was launched to reintroduce the brand in the shot-shooter occasion and sparked increased trial with SoCo's target demographic. As a follow-on, we just launched SoCo Fiery Pepper in the U.S. in October. We are also investing in the consumer communication strategy that includes digital and TV advertising that started in the U.S. in mid-October to create additional brand awareness. A number of similar initiatives are taking place in these key countries outside the United States.
Let me move on to some highlights from the rest of our results and then speak to our guidance. Our reported gross margin for the first 6 months declined 1 percentage point versus last year to 49.7%. As I'm sure you recall, we sold the Hopland-based wine business last fiscal year. However, we still have an agency relationship for selling essentially all of these wine brands that, under our agreement with Concha y Toro, continues through the end of December. This agency arrangement delivers a substantially lower gross margin to us than a year ago when we own the brands. This accounts for 0.7 points of the decline. Adjusting for the Hopland-based brands, our gross margin declined 3/10 of a point for the first 6 months. This remainder of the decline in gross margin reflects higher input cost and excise taxes in an environment where at least up to now it has been difficult to take pricing. 
In terms of pricing, we believe the environment may have improved somewhat, following the downturn a couple of years ago. It appears the promotional pricing activity seems to have abated somewhat. We always try to look for that sweet spot between volume growth and pricing growth, and given the recent robust volumetric growth we've seen for Jack Daniel's globally, we expect to be looking more closely at potential price increases for that trademark over the next 6 to 12 months.
Looking at operating expenses for the first half, we intentionally frontloaded our A&P investments in order to support the launch of various brand line extensions, including Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and Jack Daniel's RTDs in Japan. SG&A spending for the first half increased partially from the consumer investments we made in several markets last year, which won't begin cycling against comparable numbers until the second half of this year. Additionally, we have made some further investments in our infrastructure and people in various markets around the world to fuel and support our projected future growth.
Turning now to taxes. The effective tax rate for the first half was 34.1%, and was up about 1 point versus last year, primarily because of discrete items arising during the period. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the 33% to 33.5% range for the full fiscal year. As we mentioned in the earnings release, our share repurchase program expired at the end of November. During the program, we used $234 million of cash flow to buy 3.4 million shares at an average price of just over $69 a share compared to our recent price of about $80 per share. This program was in addition to the aggregate $513 million worth of shares we purchased in our prior 3 share repurchase programs, which had an average cost of just under $52 per share. 
As we look forward to the second half, we expect to see similar growth in our underlying sales as we saw in the first half. However, on a reported basis, in addition to the negative impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, we do not expect the same level of pipeline fill from new product introductions. We also saw a pretty good build in trade inventories through October in advance of a number of activities, including some anticipated price increases in several markets, the timing of some promotional activities, and in a few markets, in advance of some announced excise tax increases, all of which we expect will rebalance in the second half of our year. 
For the rest of the year, we expect our underlying A&P spend to continue to grow year-over-year but at a more modest rate as we moderate spending on new brand extensions. We expect underlying SG&A to continue at similar rates for the remainder of the year. So overall, we expect our full year underlying operating income to grow in the high single digits. 
As we move into the second half, I'd just like to remind everyone that in addition to the stronger U.S. dollar, assuming the rates today hold for the balance of the year, our reported numbers will be particularly affected by the absence of both the profits associated with the Hopland wines, as well as the gain on the sale of that business in last year's fourth quarter. The Hopland wines provided full year earnings per share of $0.17 to $0.18 last year, and we also recognized $0.26 per share from the gain on that sale. 
Turning to some uses of cash. We anticipate capital expenditures to come in between $65 million and $75 million, reflecting continuing expansion of our production facilities to meet the growing demand of our Jack Daniel's franchise. Further, we raised our quarterly dividend by 9.4% and expect that to annualize to about $200 million use of cash flow over the next 12 months.
So looking at our guidance, for the full year, we are adjusting our EPS outlook to a range of $3.45 to $3.70. This range reflects continued high single digit underlying operating income growth, but also continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. So let me spend a minute on foreign exchange. In June, we had originally forecasted that earnings would be positively impacted by foreign exchange by a few cents. But as the year has unfolded, the U.S. dollar has strengthened, and we are now forecasting a $0.10 to $0.11 decline in earnings year-on-year due to FX. This is included in our updated guidance. 
Looking at it further, going forward for the rest of the year and considering our hedge positions, we estimate that if the current rates were to strengthen 10%, our EPS would decline by about $0.06. Conversely, if the current rates were to weaken by 10%, our EPS would increase by about the same. 
So in summary, we are pleased by the acceleration of our underlying sales and operating income during the first half. We acknowledge the continued volatility in exchange rates and are cautious surrounding the fragile global economy, particularly in the eurozone. However, we anticipate that our underlying trends will continue for the balance of the fiscal year and we remain confident in our long-term top line growth prospects.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Paul."

While we've incorporated into our guidance this morning the expectations of some unf",804,"Thanks, Don. Let me add just a few supplementary comments to what Don's already said. And first, I want to say that we're just very pleased with these first half results. While we've incorporated into our guidance this morning the expectations of some unfavorable FX in the second half, the company's underlying growth rates of net sales and operating income, which are both in the high single digits, are a nice acceleration over both last year and the last 3 years so we find this really encouraging. These strong organic growth results combined with the company's healthy ROIC and balance sheet position us well, we believe, for both the second half of this fiscal year and the years that follow it. Reinforcing something Don mentioned, we'll continue to work on improving Southern Comfort's performance. It remains the top priority for the company. And in the year ahead, we'll be giving heightened attention to pricing opportunities for our brands around the world. We believe that our efforts on both of these fronts have the potential to strengthen the company even further. 
Something we've been discussing for some time now is the importance of quality new ideas to our company's organic growth story. And examples of these ideas abound to help Brown-Forman today. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, the Lime and Pepper expressions from Southern Comfort, Chambord Vodka and our forthcoming launch of Little Black Dress vodkas are a nice example of recent portfolio innovation. The acceleration we've seen in Herradura Tequila sales is being driven in part by a significant redesign of the brand's primary package, and this represents packaging innovation. Our current holiday advertising for Jack Daniel's, showing our Lynchburg Tennessee community gathering for the lighting of a Christmas tree made of our whiskey barrels, is a wonderfully creative advertising idea, and we refer to this as an example of marketing communications innovation. And finally, our performance in markets such as Germany, Brazil, Russia and Mexico are partially attributable to a variety of route-to-market ideas being implemented by our employees in those markets, and this represents a form of marketplace innovation. Our ability to generate and successfully implement new ideas such as these is an increasingly important and exciting aspect of our work today at Brown-Forman. 
And finally, I'd like to highlight an important category trend in our and the industry's largest distilled spirits market in the United States. Referencing the Nielsen data ended November 12, the 12-month growth rate of distilled spirits measured in dollar sales has accelerated from 1.8% one year ago to 3.4% today. This alone is good news, but even more encouraging for Brown-Forman is that the total whiskey category, encompassing all whiskeys including bourbon, Canadian, Scotch, Irish has accelerated even faster, advancing from a 1.1% rate a year ago to a 5.4% rate today. 
The fact that the growth rate in whiskey has outpaced distilled spirits by full 2 percentage points over the last year is the departure from the basic trend observed over the last several decades, where whiskey has consistently lagged the performance of distilled spirits as a whole. Even more exciting for our company is the fact that bourbon and American whiskey, the largest U.S. subsegment of total whiskey and the one in which Brown-Forman has the strongest position, has accelerated from 1.8% a year ago to 6.5% today. This momentum is attributable to both general and specific factors. More generally, we believe bourbon is benefiting from the consumers' growing desire for brands with authenticity, heritage and distinctive quality. And more specifically, the category is accelerating due to the explosive growth of flavored whiskeys led in the last 6 months by Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, as well as the excellent growth of the super and ultra-premium priced segments where our Gentlemen Jack, Woodford Reserve and Jack Daniel's Single Barrel combine to give Brown-Forman a strong position. 
While we still have a lot of room to improve our U.S. business, these favorable category trends and our ability to participate in them are contributing factors to why Brown-Forman in the most recent 3-months Nielsen period is growing its share of the U.S. spirits market for the first time in several years. This really does make it an exciting time to be in American whiskey in America, and the same is increasingly true in countries throughout the world. We expect to continue to be a big part of that excitement. 
In closing, let me thank my colleagues across our global beverage business. We are able to report these strong first half results only because of the collective efforts of our people and regional and brand management, marketing, sales, finance, production, IT, legal, HR and corporate services.

As you would imagine, we are really thoughtful and I would say on the cautious side as it relates to extensions on the Jack Daniel's trademarks. So right now, I mean, we really are very focused on the Tennessee Honey expansion within the United States. I think there's still a lot of even distribution and particularly development in the on-premise there, and so we want to make the most of that opportunity. I think as we look across just as we have with Southern Comfort more recently, which in the last 2 years or so, has introduced a couple of flavors into the Southern Comfort trademark into the U.S., and we started to expand some of those into other countries. We'll be looking at all of our whiskey trademarks to see where they can best participate and what is the sort of exciting and growing new segment. But expect us to be more thoughtful, I think, on the Jack Daniel's side. We're going to take it sort of a step at a time, which really means sort of month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter."

I don't have the specific percentage points, and a lot of it depend on how you look at it and when you started that analysis, of course. But I mean, I can definitely talk about directionally that in the time I've been in this industry in the Brown-Forman, I just say there had been, I'm sure, some short-term periods where there have been a burst of activity that was positive for the various aspects to the whiskey category. But I haven't observed over a sort of a 12-month period and as comprehensively as it's influencing every category of whiskey the kind of momentum that has --that we've observed over this last 12 months where each category of within whiskey has accelerated. And then in total, the overall whiskey category relative to distilled spirits is a couple of points ahead on the last 12 months is a real shift versus what I -- we would have all experienced over the last 10 or 20, or even 30 years. I mean, the shifting from whiskey to what I would refer as white goods, I mean, in some ways started in the '50s. And back then, there was very little vodka sold in the U.S. And so that had been amazing story in vodka in the U.S. as one of the big contributing factors to this, but -- and vodka continues to grow, too. So it's a great time for the U.S. spirts market generally. But some of those comments I made about just the acceleration in the whiskey category maybe attributable, I think, maybe post the 2008 and 2009 periods. Some of the mindshifts of consumers toward products that have that real heritage and authenticities in some ways traditional values. We were seeing, I think, Ben mentioned on his call before, micro distilleries and real interest in the craft of whiskey out there. And so I think that's a contributing factor. But no doubt on the shorter-term, these flavored whiskeys have added real interest to the category, both directly and through halo effect."

But I mean, I'd say looking at data, the one thing we'd say is -- I think, say, comfortably, is that versus -- certainly versus 2 years ago, the more recent 12 months, you would see I think an important improvement in the overall on-premise trends versus the year ago, maybe a stabilization to slight uptick in these 12 months versus the prior 12. We've said it before. Nothing that we've seen that would indicate that it's booming back. It's -- I think, it's more incremental and it probably varies by region of the country. I mean, some of the anecdotal stuff we've started to hear in the last few months is that the major metro markets, the on-premise restaurants are starting to be more crowded, and the bars, therefore, are more crowded. And that's a more anecdotal comment. We don't have any data to support it. And then we would look at the same public data you all would relate it to, things like the casual dining chains and the like. So I mean, I wouldn't say that -- I would definitely wouldn't say it had any downturn recently, more say that it's sort of sluggish still, but maybe slightly improving might be a comment about the U.S."

I mean, I think the main thing is that the rate of growth will continue to be above last year that we consider to be an appropriate rate. It's just that as this normal -- when you have a pretty significant launch, particularly like we have at Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, you really want to -- as you're building the distribution rather quickly, you want to build the awareness. And that, in fact, was -- it was what we can attribute a lot of the incremental spending in the first half, too. And it's just that you don't need to continue that initial awareness boost at the same rate. So that's one of the big shifts from first half to second half. And as it relates to where in the P&L those investments reside, I think it's -- in the last few years, I mean, we made pretty significant investments and changes to almost all our packages. I mean, I'd have to go through and think the ones we almost -- that we didn't make changes to. And after you do that, I mean, it's not like you would have a desire to change your package every year. So I mean, that period had a concentrated investment there for many, many quarters where we would have been hitting the cost of sales line, some promotional packaging and special packing increases. And I think appropriately, we've shifted more into the A&P line as the recovery has been more apparent, and we had more opportunity there than we did in the packaging arena."

I would say that at this point in time, as we sit here looking forward, we've talked quite a bit about uses of cash and how we think about the various uses, and I would say that we're pretty much in the same position. I mean, we're -- our first goal is to use our cash to invest behind the business. We will be investing a little bit more in the capital expenditure area than what we've historically done just because of some capacity needs. Once we go beyond looking at what the business requirements are, then the dividend is something that's very important to us, and this is the time of the year that we look at that. And in November, we announced the dividend increase. And then from that point going forward, we certainly look at acquisitions as the key component of looking for ways to create shareholder value and to find opportunities that might be out there, particularly brands that might do well in our hands. And to the extent that we can find those kinds of things that create shareholder value, we'll certainly look at acquisitions. If we don't feel that those opportunities are necessarily immediately out there, then we do look at other ways so we can get the cash back to shareholders, and the share repurchase is one of the key ways that we've used that in the past."

So that duty hike in France was one of the reasons why we actually saw some trade load in the second quarter where we expect that to kind of rebalance by the end of the fiscal year. There, as you probably know, there's a hike coming in the U.K. There's a couple that have been announced in Russia coming forward. We've been dealing with a lot of these individual country-by-country excise tax increases for the last 2 or 3 years. And you generally see similar patterns where you see the buy-in upfront at both at a consumer and a trade level. And then it takes a while, but eventually, it kind of sticks and things level out and get more back to normal. There's nothing that we've seen that would indicate that you wouldn't see some of those normal patterns in these situations. On the U.S. side, at the federal level, every time that Washington is looking for ways to increase their revenues, there's always the concern that federal excise taxes can be on the table. We've been pretty effective at keeping it at bay. One of the things that we have learned as an industry is that it's not only the impact to spirits or to alcohol beverages when we have these, when we see -- when we historically have seen these federal excise tax increases, there's a much broader impact to hospitality industry overall, whether you're looking at waiters or bartenders or a whole host of various labor factions that get impacted. And so we've been really pretty effective at building a much broader base of constituents around these issues. Including the hotels and the restaurants and what-have-you to make sure that as these issues come up, people really recognize the full impact that these tax increases could have, not just in terms as it relates to the price of the beverages but the impact that it has on the overall economy. And I think the effectiveness of that has really proven out, given that there really hasn't been any major excise tax increase in quite some time. And so, we'll continue to work that and to do what we can to keep excise taxes at bay the best we can."

So it would have -- it wouldn't be apparent in that statistic. And I think, the other thing too, is typically when you get that dedication, you tend to have the kind of scale and volumetric -- volumes in general to be able to demand at them. Our observation remains about the U.S. market today, which is that it's really not the large and high volume and biggest players they're winning right now in the U.S. distilled spirits market. It's probably more the entrepreneurial smaller companies that are winning with innovation and more entrepreneurial flair if you just look at the numbers. It's a -- I mean, company-by-company, a lot of the growth is coming out of maybe more nimble and fast-moving and innovative competitors, and it's one of the things that certainly caught our attention over the last few years."

Don will begin our call this morning and will provide some color on results for our second quarter and first half, recent trends and some thoughts on guidance. Paul will provide a few high-level strategic remarks, and then we will open the call for questions.
This morning's conference call contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Numerous risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in these statements. Many of the factors that will determine future results are beyond the company's ability to control or predict. You should not place any undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, and the company undertakes no obligation to update any of these statements, whether due to new information, future events or otherwise.
This morning, we issued a press release containing our results for the fiscal 2012 second quarter. This release can be found on our website under the section titled Investor Relations.
In the press release, we have listed a number of the risk factors that you should consider in conjunction with our forward-looking statements. Other significant risk factors are described in our Form 10-K, Form 8-K and Form 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
During this call, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures and the reason management believes they provide useful information to investors regarding the company's financial conditions and results of operations are contained in the press release.
And with that out of the way, I will turn the call over to Don."

I hope you've all seen the results we announced this morning. I thought I would start my comments acknowledging a particularly nice milestone for Brown-Forman. Our reported net sales for the quarter topped $1 billion,",2010,"Thanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I hope you've all seen the results we announced this morning. I thought I would start my comments acknowledging a particularly nice milestone for Brown-Forman. Our reported net sales for the quarter topped $1 billion, the first time in Brown-Forman's history. In addition to that milestone, let me summarize what we believe are the key takeaways for our first half results.
First, both underlying sales growth and underlying operating income growth accelerated during the first half of the fiscal year. Second, our strong sales growth was driven by a number of factors, including higher volumes; strong growth for the Jack Daniel's Family of Brands; nice results from various marketing and product innovations, such as line extensions, packaging improvements and marketing communications; a continuation of our robust international growth story; and nice trading up to our super-premium priced brands. And third, favorable foreign exchange trends reversed during the second quarter. And looking forward, current exchange rates are significantly affecting our rest-of-the-year outlook. In fact, while we expect continuing strong underlying performance in the second half, slightly stronger than when we set our earnings guidance for the fiscal year back in June, we have adjusted our full-year outlook due to the current exchange rates.
So let me start with more color on our top line growth and delve further into the 10% underlying net sales growth for the quarter. Let's start with the powerful Jack Daniel's trademark and dive a little deeper. On a constant currency basis, net sales for the Jack Daniel's family grew 16%, and all of the trademark's various expressions posted healthy growth. Particularly worth mentioning is the progress with Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey in the United States. This expression of Jack Daniel's launched in March continued to have strong momentum in the quarter. Looking at the Nielsen data through November 12, on a rolling 3-month basis, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey is clearly the leader among the recent flavored whiskeys, outselling all of the entries such as Red Stag and American Honey on a value basis almost 2 to 1. Importantly, Tennessee Honey also seemed to be expanding the Jack Daniel's franchise in a number of ways. Similarly, with what we've seen before when launching Jack Daniel's RTDs in various markets, Honey seemed to have had a bit of a halo effect on Tennessee Whiskey in the United States as takeaway trends for our largest expression continued to improve. In addition, not only have we seen an expansion for Jack Daniel's into new drinking occasions, but we've also seen new consumers coming into the franchise. So we are encouraged by the excitement that Tennessee Honey is generating for the Jack trademark in our largest market.
Let me turn now and talk some more about our international story. Geographically, we continue to make broad-based progress. In our first 6 months, 26 of our top 30 markets grew constant currency net sales, and over half of them grew at double-digit rates. Overall, underlying sales internationally grew double digits, led by the Jack Daniel's family. Let me cite a few of our international success stories, particularly where we made some recent route-to-consumer changes last year.
First, if you add up all of the various emerging markets for the first half, we had some impressive growth with underlying sales up about 20%. Highlighting a few of these markets where we made route-to-consumer changes, Brazil, Russia and Turkey all grew underlying net sales in very high double digits. While we changed our route-to-consumer in Mexico a few years ago, underlying net sales there grew over 20%. Recall with the Casa Herradura acquisition in 2007, we also gained a Mexican distribution company where we ultimately moved our existing Brown-Forman portfolio. Casa Herradura also had a leading position in Mexico's RTD business with this new mix product line. Basically, el Jimador conveniently prepackaged as margaritas, palomas and with sangrita. Not only has the new mix line continue to grow in Mexico, but we've also introduced it into the United States. And in addition, using this RTD capability, we were able to launch Jack Daniel's RTDs into Mexico over 2 years ago, which sold over 300,000 cases in its first year and continue to grow at very strong double-digit rates in the first half of this fiscal year. As part of our innovation initiatives, we've also used this opportunity to introduce a new Finlandia product, Finlandia Frost, a product that was developed specifically for the Mexican market.
Turning to some developed countries. In spite of Europe's challenges, the U.K. have solid underlying net sales growth in the high single digits. France was up strong double digits, and in Germany, where we also made a change in distribution about a year ago, underlying net sales were also up double digits.
While perhaps not one of our key highlights, let me speak for a moment about one of our most important brands, Southern Comfort. SoCo continue to be challenged with underlying net sales down 7% for the first half. It is under intense competition, particularly in the on-premise and is particularly challenged in the U.S. with a keen interest by consumers in the relatively new flavored whiskey phenomena -- a new flavored whiskey phenomena, along with their continued interest in flavored vodkas and spiced rums.
We have continued to pursue a number of initiatives to reinvigorate this brand. For example, SoCo Lime was launched to reintroduce the brand in the shot-shooter occasion and sparked increased trial with SoCo's target demographic. As a follow-on, we just launched SoCo Fiery Pepper in the U.S. in October. We are also investing in the consumer communication strategy that includes digital and TV advertising that started in the U.S. in mid-October to create additional brand awareness. A number of similar initiatives are taking place in these key countries outside the United States.
Let me move on to some highlights from the rest of our results and then speak to our guidance. Our reported gross margin for the first 6 months declined one percentage point versus last year to 49.7%. As I'm sure you recall, we sold the Hopland-based wine business last fiscal year. However, we still have an agency relationship for selling essentially all of these wine brands that, under our agreement with Concha y Toro, continues through the end of December. This agency arrangement delivers a substantially lower gross margin to us than a year ago when we own the brands. This accounts for 0.7 points of the decline. Adjusting for the Hopland-based brands, our gross margin declined 3/10 of a point for the first 6 months. This remainder of the decline in gross margin reflects higher input cost and excise taxes in an environment where at least up to now it has been difficult to take pricing. 
In terms of pricing, we believe the environment may have improved somewhat, following the downturn a couple of years ago. It appears the promotional pricing activity seems to have abated somewhat. We always try to look for that sweet spot between volume growth and pricing growth, and given the recent robust volumetric growth we've seen for Jack Daniel's globally, we expect to be looking more closely at potential price increases for that trademark over the next 6 to 12 months.
Looking at operating expenses for the first half, we intentionally frontloaded our A&P investments in order to support the launch of various brand line extensions, including Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and Jack Daniel's RTDs in Japan. SG&A spending for the first half increased partially from the (indiscernible) consumer investments we made in several markets last year, which won't begin cycling against comparable numbers until the second half of this year. Additionally, we made some further investments in our infrastructure and people in various markets around the world to fuel and support our projected future growth.
Turning now to taxes. The effective tax rate for the first half was 34.1%, and was up about one point versus last year, primarily because of discrete items arising during the period. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the 33% to 33.5% range for the full fiscal year. As we mentioned in the earnings release, our share repurchase program expired at the end of November. During the program, we used $234 million of cash flow to buy 3.4 million shares at an average price of just over $69 a share compared to our recent price of about $80 per share. This program was in addition to the aggregate $513 million worth of shares we purchased in our prior 3 share repurchase programs, which had an average cost of just under $52 per share. 
As we look forward to the second half, we expect to see similar growth in our underlying sales as we saw in the first half. However, on a reported basis, in addition to the negative impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, we do not expect the same level of pipeline fill from new product introductions. We also saw a pretty good build in trade inventories through October in advance of a number of activities, including some anticipated price increases in several markets, the timing of some promotional activities, and in a few markets, in advance of some announced excise tax increases, all of which we expect will rebalance in the second half of our year. 
For the rest of the year, we expect our underlying A&P spend to continue to grow year-over-year but at a more modest rate as we moderate spending on new brand extensions. We expect underlying SG&A to continue at similar rates for the remainder of the year. So overall, we expect our full year underlying operating income to grow in the high single digits. 
As we move into the second half, I'd just like to remind everyone that in addition to the stronger U.S. dollar, assuming the rates today hold for the balance of the year, our reported numbers will be particularly affected by the absence of both the profits associated with the Hopland wines, as well as the gain on the sale of that business in last year's fourth quarter. The Hopland wines provided full year earnings per share of $0.17 to $0.18 last year, and we also recognized $0.26 per share from the gain on that sale. 
Turning to some uses of cash. We anticipate capital expenditures to come in between $65 million and $75 million, reflecting continuing expansion of our production facilities to meet the growing demand of our Jack Daniel's franchise. Further, we raised our quarterly dividend by 9.4% and expect that to annualize to about $200 million use of cash flow over the next 12 months.
So looking at our guidance, for the full year, we are adjusting our EPS outlook to a range of $3.45 to $3.70. This range reflects continued high single digit underlying operating income growth, but also continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. So let me spend a minute on foreign exchange. In June, we had originally forecasted that earnings would be positively impacted by foreign exchange by a few cents. But as the year has unfolded, the U.S. dollar has strengthened, and we are now forecasting a $0.10 to $0.11 decline in earnings year-on-year due to FX. This is included in our updated guidance. 
Looking at it further, going forward for the rest of the year and considering our hedge positions, we estimate that if the current rates were to strengthen 10%, our EPS would decline by about $0.06. Conversely, if the current rates were to weaken by 10%, our EPS would increase by about the same. 
So in summary, we are pleased by the acceleration of our underlying sales and operating income during the first half. We acknowledge the continued volatility in exchange rates and are cautious surrounding the fragile global economy, particularly in the eurozone. However, we anticipate that our underlying trends will continue for the balance of the fiscal year and we remain confident in our long-term top line growth prospects.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Paul."

While we've incorporated into our guidance this morning the expectations of some unf",804,"Thanks, Don. Let me add just a few supplementary comments to what Don's already said. And first, I want to say that we're just very pleased with these first half results. While we've incorporated into our guidance this morning the expectations of some unfavorable FX in the second half, the company's underlying growth rates of net sales and operating income, which are both in the high single digits, are a nice acceleration over both last year and the last 3 years so we find this really encouraging. These strong organic growth results combined with the company's healthy ROIC and balance sheet position us well, we believe, for both the second half of this fiscal year and the years that follow it. Reinforcing something Don mentioned, we'll continue to work on improving Southern Comfort's performance. It remains the top priority for the company. And in the year ahead, we'll be giving heightened attention to pricing opportunities for our brands around the world. We believe that our efforts on both of these fronts have the potential to strengthen the company even further. 
Something we've been discussing for some time now is the importance of quality new ideas to our company's organic growth story. And examples of these ideas abound to help Brown-Forman today. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, the Lime and Pepper expressions from Southern Comfort, Chambord Vodka and our forthcoming launch of Little Black Dress vodkas are a nice example of recent portfolio innovation. The acceleration we've seen in Herradura Tequila sales is being driven in part by a significant redesign of the brand's primary package, and this represents packaging innovation. Our current holiday advertising for Jack Daniel's, showing our Lynchburg Tennessee community gathering for the lighting of a Christmas tree made of our whiskey barrels, is a wonderfully creative advertising idea, and we refer to this as an example of marketing communications innovation. And finally, our performance in markets such as Germany, Brazil, Russia and Mexico are partially attributable to a variety of route-to-market ideas being implemented by our employees in those markets, and this represents a form of marketplace innovation. Our ability to generate and successfully implement new ideas such as these is an increasingly important and exciting aspect of our work today at Brown-Forman. 
And finally, I'd like to highlight an important category trend in our and the industry's largest distilled spirits market in the United States. Referencing the Nielsen data ended November 12, the 12-month growth rate of distilled spirits measured in dollar sales has accelerated from 1.8% one year ago to 3.4% today. This alone is good news, but even more encouraging for Brown-Forman is that the total whiskey category, encompassing all whiskeys including bourbon, Canadian, Scotch, Irish has accelerated even faster, advancing from a 1.1% rate a year ago to a 5.4% rate today. 
The fact that the growth rate in whiskey has outpaced distilled spirits by full 2 percentage points over the last year is the departure from the basic trend observed over the last several decades, where whiskey has consistently lagged the performance of distilled spirits as a whole. Even more exciting for our company is the fact that bourbon and American whiskey, the largest U.S. subsegment of total whiskey and the one in which Brown-Forman has the strongest position, has accelerated from 1.8% a year ago to 6.5% today. This momentum is attributable to both general and specific factors. More generally, we believe bourbon is benefiting from the consumers' growing desire for brands with authenticity, heritage and distinctive quality. And more specifically, the category is accelerating due to the explosive growth of flavored whiskeys led in the last 6 months by Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, as well as the excellent growth of the super and ultra-premium priced segments where our Gentlemen Jack, Woodford Reserve and Jack Daniel's Single Barrel combine to give Brown-Forman a strong position. 
While we still have a lot of room to improve our U.S. business, these favorable category trends and our ability to participate in them are contributing factors to why Brown-Forman in the most recent 3-months Nielsen period is growing its share of the U.S. spirits market for the first time in several years. This really does make it an exciting time to be in American whiskey in America, and the same is increasingly true in countries throughout the world. We expect to continue to be a big part of that excitement. 
In closing, let me thank my colleagues across our global beverage business. We are able to report these strong first half results only because of the collective efforts of our people and regional and brand management, marketing, sales, finance, production, IT, legal, HR and corporate services.  My congratulations and thanks to each and everyone of you. 
That concludes our prepared remarks for the morning, and we're now open for questions."

But I haven't observed over a sort of a 12-month period and as comprehensively as it's influencing every category of whiskey the kind of momentum that has --that we've observed over this last 12 months where each category of within whiskey has accelerated. And then in total, the overall whiskey category relative to distilled spirits is a couple of points ahead on the last 12 months is a real shift versus what I -- we would have all experienced over the last 10 or 20, or even 30 years. I mean, the shifting from whiskey to what I would refer as white goods, I mean, in some ways started in the '50s. And back then, there was very little vodka sold in the U.S. And so that had been amazing story in vodka in the U.S. as one of the big contributing factors to this, but -- and vodka continues to grow, too. So it's a great time for the U.S. spirts market generally. But some of those comments I made about just the acceleration in the whiskey category maybe attributable, I think, maybe post the 2008 and 2009 periods. Some of the mindshifts of consumers toward products that have that real heritage and authenticities in some ways traditional values. We were seeing, I think, Ben mentioned on his call before, micro distilleries and real interest in the craft of whiskey out there. And so I think that's a contributing factor. But no doubt on the shorter-term, these flavored whiskeys have added real interest to the category, both directly and through halo effect."

And that, in fact, was -- it was what we can attribute a lot of the incremental spending in the first half, too. And it's just that you don't need to continue that initial awareness boost at the same rate. So that's one of the big shifts from first half to second half. And as it relates to where in the P&L those investments reside, I think it's -- in the last few years, I mean, we made pretty significant investments and changes to almost all our packages. I mean, I'd have to go through and think the ones we almost -- that we didn't make changes to. And after you do that, I mean, it's not like you would have a desire to change your package every year. So I mean, that period had a concentrated investment there for many, many quarters where we would have been hitting the cost of sales line, some promotional packaging and special packing increases. And I think appropriately, we've shifted more into the A&P line as the recovery has been more apparent, and we had more opportunity there than we did in the packaging arena."

We will be investing a little bit more in the capital expenditure area than what we've historically done just because of some capacity needs. Once we go beyond looking at what the business requirements are, then the dividend is something that's very important to us, and this is the time of the year that we look at that. And in November, we announced the dividend increase. And then from that point going forward, we certainly look at acquisitions as the key component of looking for ways to create shareholder value and to find opportunities that might be out there, particularly brands that might do well in our hands. And to the extent that we can find those kinds of things that create shareholder value, we'll certainly look at acquisitions. If we don't feel that those opportunities are necessarily immediately out there, then we do look at other ways so we can get the cash back to shareholders, and the share repurchase is one of the key ways that we've used that in the past."

So that duty hike in France was one of the reasons why we actually saw some trade load in the second quarter where we expect that to kind of rebalance by the end of the fiscal year. There, as you probably know, there's a hike coming in the U.K. There's a couple that have been announced in Russia coming forward. We've been dealing with a lot of these individual country-by-country excise tax increases for the last 2 or 3 years. And you generally see similar patterns where you see the buy-in upfront at both at a consumer and a trade level. And then it takes a while, but eventually, it kind of sticks and things level out and get more back to normal. There's nothing that we've seen that would indicate that you wouldn't see some of those normal patterns in these situations. On the U.S. side, at the federal level, every time that Washington is looking for ways to increase their revenues, there's always the concern that federal excise taxes can be on the table. We've been pretty effective at keeping it at bay. One of the things that we have learned as an industry is that it's not only the impact to spirits or to alcohol beverages when we have these, when we see -- when we historically have seen these federal excise tax increases, there's a much broader impact to hospitality industry overall, whether you're looking at waiters or bartenders or a whole host of various labor factions that get impacted. And so we've been really pretty effective at building a much broader base of constituents around these issues. Including the hotels and the restaurants and what-have-you to make sure that as these issues come up, people really recognize the full impact that these tax increases could have, not just in terms as it relates to the price of the beverages but the impact that it has on the overall economy. And I think the effectiveness of that has really proven out, given that there really hasn't been any major excise tax increase in quite some time. And so, we'll continue to work that and to do what we can to keep excise taxes at bay the best we can."

So it would have -- it wouldn't be apparent in that statistic. And I think, the other thing too, is typically when you get that dedication, you tend to have the kind of scale and volumetric -- volumes in general to be able to demand at them. Our observation remains about the U.S. market today, which is that it's really not the large and high volume and biggest players that are winning right now in the U.S. distilled spirits market. It's probably more the entrepreneurial smaller companies that are winning with innovation and more entrepreneurial flair if you just look at the numbers.

Don will begin our call this morning and will provide some color on results for our second quarter and first half, recent trends and some thoughts on guidance. Paul will provide a few high-level strategic remarks, and then we will open the call for questions.
This morning's conference call contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Numerous risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in these statements. Many of the factors that will determine future results are beyond the company's ability to control or predict. You should not place any undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, and the company undertakes no obligation to update any of these statements, whether due to new information, future events or otherwise.
This morning, we issued a press release containing our results for the fiscal 2012 second quarter. This release can be found on our website under the section titled Investor Relations.
In the press release, we have listed a number of the risk factors that you should consider in conjunction with our forward-looking statements. Other significant risk factors are described in our Form 10-K, Form 8-K and Form 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
During this call, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures and the reason management believes they provide useful information to investors regarding the company's financial conditions and results of operations are contained in the press release.

256839,139665271,200940,"Brown-Forman Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Dec 08, 2011",2011-12-08,"Earnings Calls","Brown-Forman Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I hope you've all seen the results we announced this morning. I thought I would start my comments acknowledging a particularly nice milestone for Brown-Forman. Our reported net sales for the quarter topped $1 billion,",2010,"Thanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I hope you've all seen the results we announced this morning. I thought I would start my comments acknowledging a particularly nice milestone for Brown-Forman. Our reported net sales for the quarter topped $1 billion, the first time in Brown-Forman's history. In addition to that milestone, let me summarize what we believe are the key takeaways for our first half results.
First, both underlying sales growth and underlying operating income growth accelerated during the first half of the fiscal year. Second, our strong sales growth was driven by a number of factors, including higher volumes; strong growth for the Jack Daniel's Family of Brands; nice results from various marketing and product innovations, such as line extensions, packaging improvements and marketing communications; a continuation of our robust international growth story; and nice trading up to our super-premium priced brands. And third, favorable foreign exchange trends reversed during the second quarter. And looking forward, current exchange rates are significantly affecting our rest-of-the-year outlook. In fact, while we expect continuing strong underlying performance in the second half, slightly stronger than when we set our earnings guidance for the fiscal year back in June, we have adjusted our full-year outlook due to the current exchange rates.
So let me start with more color on our top line growth and delve further into the 10% underlying net sales growth for the quarter. Let's start with the powerful Jack Daniel's trademark and dive a little deeper. On a constant currency basis, net sales for the Jack Daniel's family grew 16%, and all of the trademark's various expressions posted healthy growth. Particularly worth mentioning is the progress with Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey in the United States. This expression of Jack Daniel's launched in March continued to have strong momentum in the quarter. Looking at the Nielsen data through November 12, on a rolling 3-month basis, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey is clearly the leader among the recent flavored whiskeys, outselling all of the entries such as Red Stag and American Honey on a value basis almost 2 to 1. Importantly, Tennessee Honey also seemed to be expanding the Jack Daniel's franchise in a number of ways. Similarly, with what we've seen before when launching Jack Daniel's RTDs in various markets, Honey seemed to have had a bit of a halo effect on Tennessee Whiskey in the United States as takeaway trends for our largest expression continued to improve. In addition, not only have we seen an expansion for Jack Daniel's into new drinking occasions, but we've also seen new consumers coming into the franchise. So we are encouraged by the excitement that Tennessee Honey is generating for the Jack trademark in our largest market.
Let me turn now and talk some more about our international story. Geographically, we continue to make broad-based progress. In our first 6 months, 26 of our top 30 markets grew constant currency net sales, and over half of them grew at double-digit rates. Overall, underlying sales internationally grew double digits, led by the Jack Daniel's family. Let me cite a few of our international success stories, particularly where we made some recent route-to-consumer changes last year.
First, if you add up all of the various emerging markets for the first half, we had some impressive growth with underlying sales up about 20%. Highlighting a few of these markets where we made route-to-consumer changes, Brazil, Russia and Turkey all grew underlying net sales in very high double digits. While we changed our route-to-consumer in Mexico a few years ago, underlying net sales there grew over 20%. Recall with the Casa Herradura acquisition in 2007, we also gained a Mexican distribution company where we ultimately moved our existing Brown-Forman portfolio. Casa Herradura also had a leading position in Mexico's RTD business with this new mix product line. Basically, el Jimador conveniently prepackaged as margaritas, palomas and with sangrita. Not only has the new mix line continue to grow in Mexico, but we've also introduced it into the United States. And in addition, using this RTD capability, we were able to launch Jack Daniel's RTDs into Mexico over 2 years ago, which sold over 300,000 cases in its first year and continue to grow at very strong double-digit rates in the first half of this fiscal year. As part of our innovation initiatives, we've also used this opportunity to introduce a new Finlandia product, Finlandia Frost, a product that was developed specifically for the Mexican market.
Turning to some developed countries. In spite of Europe's challenges, the U.K. have solid underlying net sales growth in the high single digits. France was up strong double digits, and in Germany, where we also made a change in distribution about a year ago, underlying net sales were also up double digits.
While perhaps not one of our key highlights, let me speak for a moment about one of our most important brands, Southern Comfort. SoCo continue to be challenged with underlying net sales down 7% for the first half. It is under intense competition, particularly in the on-premise and is particularly challenged in the U.S. with a keen interest by consumers in the relatively new flavored whiskey phenomena -- a new flavored whiskey phenomena, along with their continued interest in flavored vodkas and spiced rums.
We have continued to pursue a number of initiatives to reinvigorate this brand. For example, SoCo Lime was launched to reintroduce the brand in the shot-shooter occasion and sparked increased trial with SoCo's target demographic. As a follow-on, we just launched SoCo Fiery Pepper in the U.S. in October. We are also investing in the consumer communication strategy that includes digital and TV advertising that started in the U.S. in mid-October to create additional brand awareness. A number of similar initiatives are taking place in these key countries outside the United States.
Let me move on to some highlights from the rest of our results and then speak to our guidance. Our reported gross margin for the first 6 months declined one percentage point versus last year to 49.7%. As I'm sure you recall, we sold the Hopland-based wine business last fiscal year. However, we still have an agency relationship for selling essentially all of these wine brands that, under our agreement with Concha y Toro, continues through the end of December. This agency arrangement delivers a substantially lower gross margin to us than a year ago when we own the brands. This accounts for 0.7 points of the decline. Adjusting for the Hopland-based brands, our gross margin declined 3/10 of a point for the first 6 months. This remainder of the decline in gross margin reflects higher input cost and excise taxes in an environment where at least up to now it has been difficult to take pricing. 
In terms of pricing, we believe the environment may have improved somewhat, following the downturn a couple of years ago. It appears the promotional pricing activity seems to have abated somewhat. We always try to look for that sweet spot between volume growth and pricing growth, and given the recent robust volumetric growth we've seen for Jack Daniel's globally, we expect to be looking more closely at potential price increases for that trademark over the next 6 to 12 months.
Looking at operating expenses for the first half, we intentionally frontloaded our A&P investments in order to support the launch of various brand line extensions, including Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and Jack Daniel's RTDs in Japan. SG&A spending for the first half increased partially from the [indiscernible] consumer investments we made in several markets last year, which won't begin cycling against comparable numbers until the second half of this year. Additionally, we made some further investments in our infrastructure and people in various markets around the world to fuel and support our projected future growth.
Turning now to taxes. The effective tax rate for the first half was 34.1%, and was up about one point versus last year, primarily because of discrete items arising during the period. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the 33% to 33.5% range for the full fiscal year. As we mentioned in the earnings release, our share repurchase program expired at the end of November. During the program, we used $234 million of cash flow to buy 3.4 million shares at an average price of just over $69 a share compared to our recent price of about $80 per share. This program was in addition to the aggregate $513 million worth of shares we purchased in our prior 3 share repurchase programs, which had an average cost of just under $52 per share. 
As we look forward to the second half, we expect to see similar growth in our underlying sales as we saw in the first half. However, on a reported basis, in addition to the negative impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, we do not expect the same level of pipeline fill from new product introductions. We also saw a pretty good build in trade inventories through October in advance of a number of activities, including some anticipated price increases in several markets, the timing of some promotional activities, and in a few markets, in advance of some announced excise tax increases, all of which we expect will rebalance in the second half of our year. 
For the rest of the year, we expect our underlying A&P spend to continue to grow year-over-year but at a more modest rate as we moderate spending on new brand extensions. We expect underlying SG&A to continue at similar rates for the remainder of the year. So overall, we expect our full year underlying operating income to grow in the high single digits. 
As we move into the second half, I'd just like to remind everyone that in addition to the stronger U.S. dollar, assuming the rates today hold for the balance of the year, our reported numbers will be particularly affected by the absence of both the profits associated with the Hopland wines, as well as the gain on the sale of that business in last year's fourth quarter. The Hopland wines provided full year earnings per share of $0.17 to $0.18 last year, and we also recognized $0.26 per share from the gain on that sale. 
Turning to some uses of cash. We anticipate capital expenditures to come in between $65 million and $75 million, reflecting continuing expansion of our production facilities to meet the growing demand of our Jack Daniel's franchise. Further, we raised our quarterly dividend by 9.4% and expect that to annualize to about $200 million use of cash flow over the next 12 months.
So looking at our guidance, for the full year, we are adjusting our EPS outlook to a range of $3.45 to $3.70. This range reflects continued high single digit underlying operating income growth, but also continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. So let me spend a minute on foreign exchange. In June, we had originally forecasted that earnings would be positively impacted by foreign exchange by a few cents. But as the year has unfolded, the U.S. dollar has strengthened, and we are now forecasting a $0.10 to $0.11 decline in earnings year-on-year due to FX. This is included in our updated guidance. 
Looking at it further, going forward for the rest of the year and considering our hedge positions, we estimate that if the current rates were to strengthen 10%, our EPS would decline by about $0.06. Conversely, if the current rates were to weaken by 10%, our EPS would increase by about the same. 
So in summary, we are pleased by the acceleration of our underlying sales and operating income during the first half. We acknowledge the continued volatility in exchange rates and are cautious surrounding the fragile global economy, particularly in the eurozone. However, we anticipate that our underlying trends will continue for the balance of the fiscal year and we remain confident in our long-term top line growth prospects.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Paul."

While we've incorporated into our guidance this morning the expectations of some unf",804,"Thanks, Don. Let me add just a few supplementary comments to what Don's already said. And first, I want to say that we're just very pleased with these first half results. While we've incorporated into our guidance this morning the expectations of some unfavorable FX in the second half, the company's underlying growth rates of net sales and operating income, which are both in the high single digits, are a nice acceleration over both last year and the last 3 years so we find this really encouraging. These strong organic growth results combined with the company's healthy ROIC and balance sheet position us well, we believe, for both the second half of this fiscal year and the years that follow it. Reinforcing something Don mentioned, we'll continue to work on improving Southern Comfort's performance. It remains the top priority for the company. And in the year ahead, we'll be giving heightened attention to pricing opportunities for our brands around the world. We believe that our efforts on both of these fronts have the potential to strengthen the company even further. 
Something we've been discussing for some time now is the importance of quality new ideas to our company's organic growth story. And examples of these ideas abound to help Brown-Forman today. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, the Lime and Pepper expressions from Southern Comfort, Chambord Vodka and our forthcoming launch of Little Black Dress vodkas are a nice example of recent portfolio innovation. The acceleration we've seen in Herradura Tequila sales is being driven in part by a significant redesign of the brand's primary package, and this represents packaging innovation. Our current holiday advertising for Jack Daniel's, showing our Lynchburg Tennessee community gathering for the lighting of a Christmas tree made of our whiskey barrels, is a wonderfully creative advertising idea, and we refer to this as an example of marketing communications innovation. And finally, our performance in markets such as Germany, Brazil, Russia and Mexico are partially attributable to a variety of route-to-market ideas being implemented by our employees in those markets, and this represents a form of marketplace innovation. Our ability to generate and successfully implement new ideas such as these is an increasingly important and exciting aspect of our work today at Brown-Forman. 
And finally, I'd like to highlight an important category trend in our and the industry's largest distilled spirits market in the United States. Referencing the Nielsen data ended November 12, the 12-month growth rate of distilled spirits measured in dollar sales has accelerated from 1.8% one year ago to 3.4% today. This alone is good news, but even more encouraging for Brown-Forman is that the total whiskey category, encompassing all whiskeys including bourbon, Canadian, Scotch, Irish has accelerated even faster, advancing from a 1.1% rate a year ago to a 5.4% rate today. 
The fact that the growth rate in whiskey has outpaced distilled spirits by full 2 percentage points over the last year is the departure from the basic trend observed over the last several decades, where whiskey has consistently lagged the performance of distilled spirits as a whole. Even more exciting for our company is the fact that bourbon and American whiskey, the largest U.S. subsegment of total whiskey and the one in which Brown-Forman has the strongest position, has accelerated from 1.8% a year ago to 6.5% today. This momentum is attributable to both general and specific factors. More generally, we believe bourbon is benefiting from the consumers' growing desire for brands with authenticity, heritage and distinctive quality. And more specifically, the category is accelerating due to the explosive growth of flavored whiskeys led in the last 6 months by Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, as well as the excellent growth of the super and ultra-premium priced segments where our Gentlemen Jack, Woodford Reserve and Jack Daniel's Single Barrel combine to give Brown-Forman a strong position. 
While we still have a lot of room to improve our U.S. business, these favorable category trends and our ability to participate in them are contributing factors to why Brown-Forman in the most recent 3-months Nielsen period is growing its share of the U.S. spirits market for the first time in several years. This really does make it an exciting time to be in American whiskey in America, and the same is increasingly true in countries throughout the world. We expect to continue to be a big part of that excitement. 
In closing, let me thank my colleagues across our global beverage business. We are able to report these strong first half results only because of the collective efforts of our people and regional and brand management, marketing, sales, finance, production, IT, legal, HR and corporate services.  My congratulations and thanks to each and everyone of you. 
That concludes our prepared remarks for the morning, and we're now open for questions."

We talked quite a bit in the past about looking at pricing at a very targeted way, and I think we're starting to see that there may be some opportunities for more broad-based price increases. As we look at this, I wouldn't anticipate seeing much in the way of any impact in the rest of this fiscal year, but it's certainly something that we'll be looking at over the second half to the extent we take those price increases, you'd be -- you should be able to see some impact on that next year."

I don't have the specific percentage points, and a lot of it depend on how you look at it and when you started that analysis, of course. But I mean, I can definitely talk about directionally that in the time I've been in this industry and at Brown-Forman, I just say there had been, I'm sure, some short-term periods where there have been a burst of activity that was positive for the various aspects of the whiskey category. But I haven't observed over a sort of a 12-month period and as comprehensively as it's influencing every category of whiskey the kind of momentum that has --that we've observed over this last 12 months where each category of within whiskey has accelerated. And then in total, the overall whiskey category relative to distilled spirits is a couple of points ahead on the last 12 months is a real shift versus what I -- we would have all experienced over the last 10 or 20, or even 30 years. I mean, the shifting from whiskey to what I would refer as white goods, I mean, in some ways started in the '50s. And back then, there was very little vodka sold in the U.S. And so that had been amazing story in vodka in the U.S. as one of the big contributing factors to this, but -- and vodka continues to grow, too. So it's a great time for the U.S. spirts market generally. But some of those comments I made about just the acceleration in the whiskey category maybe attributable, I think, maybe post the 2008 and 2009 periods. Some of the mindshifts of consumers toward products that have that real heritage and authenticities in some ways traditional values. We were seeing, I think, Ben mentioned on his call before, micro distilleries and real interest in the craft of whiskey out there. And so I think that's a contributing factor. But no doubt on the shorter-term, these flavored whiskeys have added real interest to the category, both directly and through halo effect."

We've said it before. Nothing that we've seen that would indicate that it's booming back. It's -- I think, it's more incremental and it probably varies by region of the country.

And that, in fact, was -- it was what we can attribute a lot of the incremental spending in the first half, too. And it's just that you don't need to continue that initial awareness boost at the same rate. So that's one of the big shifts from first half to second half. And as it relates to where in the P&L those investments reside, I think it's -- in the last few years, I mean, we made pretty significant investments and changes to almost all our packages. I mean, I'd have to go through and think the ones we almost -- that we didn't make changes to. And after you do that, I mean, it's not like you would have a desire to change your package every year. So I mean, that period had a concentrated investment there for many, many quarters where we would have been hitting the cost of sales line, some promotional packaging and special packing increases. And I think appropriately, we've shifted more into the A&P line as the recovery has been more apparent, and we had more opportunity there than we did in the packaging arena."

At this point in time, there aren't any other share buybacks that either we have announced or that have been approved by the Board. And if we were to do anything going forward, we would have to -- it would require Board approval. I would say that at this point in time, as we sit here looking forward, we've talked quite a bit about uses of cash and how we think about the various uses, and I would say that we're pretty much in the same position. I mean, we're -- our first goal is to use our cash to invest behind the business. We will be investing a little bit more in the capital expenditure area than what we've historically done just because of some capacity needs. Once we go beyond looking at what the business requirements are, then the dividend is something that's very important to us, and this is the time of the year that we look at that. And in November, we announced the dividend increase. And then from that point going forward, we certainly look at acquisitions as the key component of looking for ways to create shareholder value and to find opportunities that might be out there, particularly brands that might do well in our hands. And to the extent that we can find those kinds of things that create shareholder value, we'll certainly look at acquisitions. If we don't feel that those opportunities are necessarily immediately out there, then we do look at other ways so we can get the cash back to shareholders, and the share repurchase is one of the key ways that we've used that in the past."

So that duty hike in France was one of the reasons why we actually saw some trade load in the second quarter where we expect that to kind of rebalance by the end of the fiscal year. There, as you probably know, there's a hike coming in the U.K. There's a couple that have been announced in Russia coming forward. We've been dealing with a lot of these individual country-by-country excise tax increases for the last 2 or 3 years. And you generally see similar patterns where you see the buy-in upfront at both at a consumer and a trade level. And then it takes a while, but eventually, it kind of sticks and things level out and get more back to normal. There's nothing that we've seen that would indicate that you wouldn't see some of those normal patterns in these situations. On the U.S. side, at the federal level, every time that Washington is looking for ways to increase their revenues, there's always the concern that federal excise taxes can be on the table. We've been pretty effective at keeping it at bay. One of the things that we have learned as an industry is that it's not only the impact to spirits or to alcohol beverages when we have these, when we see -- when we historically have seen these federal excise tax increases, there's a much broader impact to hospitality industry overall, whether you're looking at waiters or bartenders or a whole host of various labor factions that get impacted. And so we've been really pretty effective at building a much broader base of constituents around these issues. Including the hotels and the restaurants and what-have-you to make sure that as these issues come up, people really recognize the full impact that these tax increases could have, not just in terms as it relates to the price of the beverages but the impact that it has on the overall economy. And I think the effectiveness of that has really proven out, given that there really hasn't been any major excise tax increase in quite some time. And so, we'll continue to work that and to do what we can to keep excise taxes at bay the best we can."

We actually, in many a markets, we call alliance markets, where we're partnered up with Bacardi and, in many instances, Remy have a dedicated division to the portfolio that would include those 3 companies. And so there are a wide variety of dedicated efforts that you can observe, not only at the distributor level but also within the supplier sales ranks that people, I think, find effective. And so as it relates to how it may be showing up in our results if it -- I mean, any impact from that, I mean, you probably heard my comments earlier, in the last 12 months, we've gained share, the U.S. spirits segment for the first time in a while. So it would have -- it wouldn't be apparent in that statistic. And I think, the other thing too, is typically when you get that dedication, you tend to have the kind of scale and volumetric -- volumes in general to be able to demand at them. Our observation remains about the U.S. market today, which is that it's really not the large and high volume and biggest players that are winning right now in the U.S. distilled spirits market. It's probably more the entrepreneurial smaller companies that are winning with innovation and more entrepreneurial flair if you just look at the numbers. It's a -- I mean, company-by-company, a lot of the growth is coming out of maybe more nimble and fast-moving and innovative competitors, and it's one of the things that certainly caught our attention over the last few years."

I mean, we found it in mixed drinks for a long time. And so this is a very welcomed trend that we're able to add -- the appropriate, they have to be -- I think the key thing here is not to think of them as flavor-of-the-month type extensions. I mean, they have to be really high-quality products. And the one thing we've learned about particularly the Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey is how the response has been to the product in the bottle. I mean, just an excellent product. And people finding all kinds of interesting ways to use it and consume it, enjoy it.

So -- but I mean, I've got to believe that for either reasons of they're price-driven or just, I think, this other large trend is that you've -- just the consumers' interest in variety as it relates to beverage alcohol.
