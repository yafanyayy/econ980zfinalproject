Welcome to our fourth quarter 2010 earnings call. As always, thank you for the interest in our company. 
Initially, I would mention that on our website, williams.com, you should be able to find a number of things. First, a few slides that we will be talking from this morning. Second, the data book that contains useful information we make available each quarter. And finally, three press releases. First, separation release that we issued last evening. Second, the reported fourth quarter results and third, our year end oil and gas reserves. Now the last two were issued this morning.
In a minute, Alan Armstrong, our President and CEO, will review a few slides we have this morning. Be aware though that as always, all of our business units heads are here and available to respond to questions after Alan's remarks. 
Here with me are Ralph Hill, Head of the E&P company, Roy Miller, who recently took over the range of the midstream company; and Phil Wright, who heads our gas pipelines.
Also, you certainly saw the notice that Phil will be taking another role in the company later this month and Randy Bernard is going to lead the gas pipelines and he is with us as well. Also, Don Chappel, the CFO is here as well.
As most of you are aware, yesterday, we announced our plan to separate our E&P business to a partial IPO and a subsequent spinoff of our remaining ownership interest. Alan will make brief remarks about this plan during his comments. But because of the security law restrictions, we will not be commenting further or take any questions of the E&P separation during this call.
I'll direct your attention to the press release that went out yesterday. At the beginning of the slide deck are the forward-looking statements on Slide #2 and #3. And the disclaimer on oil and gas reserves on Slide #4. Those are important and integral to the remarks, so please review those. 
Also included are various non-GAAP numbers that have been reconciled back to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those schedules are available in the presentation. With that, I'll turn it over to Alan."

Good morning, and I'll start here on Slide 5.
I'm certainly pleased to join us for our call this morning and to hear about our strong finish to 2010 and exciting future for Williams shareholders.
Our management and board over diligently over the last couple of months analyzing the best path to unlock shareholder value while maintaining growth platforms for the future.
As Travis mentioned, we will not be able to provide details of the transactions or forward-looking perspectives of the new E&P company. Despite this restriction, we have plenty of exciting information to share with you about WMBs 2010 performance and the growth drivers for the future.
I'm also pleased to inform you that we exceeded our earlier guidance range for earnings per share and we are raising guidance for 2011 and 2012. And with that, I'll move on to Slide 6. 
As we announced yesterday, our board has given us a green light to pursue the creation of a separate E&P company, starting with a partial IPO in the third quarter of 2011, and then a planned spinoff for the remaining interest of our shareholders in 2012.
WMB would use the IPO proceeds to pay down corporate debt and we would expect to maintain investment grade credit ratings at the WMB and WPZ. I would refer you to the press releases from the three credit rating agencies that rate our debt that came out shortly after our announcement yesterday if you'd like to know their perspectives in more detail.
This new structure enables WMB to initiate a high dividend strategy. We are announcing a 60% increase starting with quarterly payout in June of 2011, going from $0.0125 to $0.20 per quarter and we are targeting additional 10% to 15% increase in June of 2012.
Both of these actions are a direct response to hearing from our shareholders and gathering thoughts over the last, actually several years in terms of thinking about how we can increase shareholder value. So we are pleased to be reporting this to you this morning.
WMB and WPZ will be focused on meeting a robust demand for new infrastructure that helps our customers and our nation take advantage of North America's abundant natural resources. 
As you will see, we have lot of new infrastructure being built and plan to do just that.
Moving on to Slide 7. Our full-year financial results were boosted by a very strong fourth quarter. Our adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was up 60% over the same quarter in 2009. This drove our adjusted EPS from continuing operations for 2010 to a $1.28 per share, and that is 36% higher than our 2009 level of $0.94.
As you know, our full-year GAAP was heavily impacted by non-cash impairment charges in the third quarter and we had a significant cost related to the WPZ and WMZ merger and the related debt restructurings required for that transaction.
For the year, we are ending up at a GAAP loss of $1.1 billion. And on an adjusted basis, net income was $760 million, which was up 38% over the same number for 2009.
I won't spend much time here on the reserves since we provided some great graphics here in the next couple of slides that I'll explain the reserves with. 
And moving into Slide 8. You can see here starting with the left-hand side, you can see our year end 2009 reserves and you can see the various adjustments to get us to our 2010 U.S. reserves then we add in the international reserves from Apco. And then finally, you see the adjusted of total reserves as we look at what it would mean if we looked at a total of seven years of reserves to get to.
So our net proved reserves held strong with 107% reserve replacement ratio, but did not move up radically predominantly due to the new SEC five-year limit rule under which we reclassified about 250 Bcf of proved reserves to probable in the Piceance due to reducing the pace of drilling in the lower price environment and no longer being able to get to all previously amounts within five years.
This in no way means we can't and don't expect to get to those reserves, just reclassification under the SEC rules.
If you look at our net up additions and revisions, we added 528 Bcf through our drilling program in which we spent $984 million in the E&P development capital. So this equates to, in 2010, a funding cost of $1.86.
We ended the year at 4.3 Tcf of domestic proved. And adding additional international you can see it raises up to 4.5 Tcf.
We've also identified an additional 353 Bcf of reserves that could be classified as proved, if we were allowed to add two more years of development. In other words, seven years of development instead of being limited to five.
Under this alternative view of how we would've looked at things before the SEC five-year rule was imposed, our adjusted proved reserves would have grown to more than 4.8 Tcf.
Moving on to Slide 9. You can see a big move here on our 3P reserves. And moving from about 14.8 Tcfe to just under 16 Tcfe, and this was driven predominantly by our undeveloped leasehold, acquisitions in both the Marcellus Shale and the Bakken Oil Play. 
And our drilling programs are now well diversified amongst some of the economically attractive plays in the country, including the Marcellus Shale, the Bakken Oil and the Piceance tight sands down the Williams way.
Moving on to 10. Here, as mentioned earlier, we had 60% increase in adjusted net income for the quarter. In addition, our teams worked tirelessly to close stunning amount of transactions in the quarter as listed here. 
We also saw our NGL production rebound tremendously in the fourth quarter after a difficult third quarter. And this represented a record for our WPZ operations. This was driven by the startup of our new Echo Springs plant, but was partially offset by the sell of our Cameron Meadows plant in the fourth quarter of 2009.
As you can see, the two large acquisitions done by WPZ are large fee-based bills, with little or no direct commodity exposure. As we've commented a lot in the past, we continue to try to take advantage when we see good fee-based opportunities to continue to steady the incomes of our WPZ investments.
The scale that we brought to WPZ through our restructuring in the first quarter of 2010 enabled us to perform these large transactions without straining our balance sheet. So we really were able to really prove the value of our WPZ transaction in a very large way in the fourth quarter of '10.
And speaking of that, moving on here to Slide 11, the Bakken acquisition is a great example of the fruits that our WPZ restructuring brought forth. The drop-down of the Piceance Gathering System that WPZ enabled this exciting $925 million acquisition. 
Nothing new on the slide, but we have now updated guidance to include it and other than the weather this time of the year in North Dakota, we are very pleased about our large entry in the Bakken and Three Forks Oil play in North Dakota. 
We closed the transaction on December 21 and we have a three rigs running there. And certainly, in the process of getting our teams assembled and getting a lot of the great experience that we have around the organization zeroed in on the opportunities in the Bakken.
Moving on to Slide 12. A lot of exciting things going on here in the Marcellus, and almost too much to mention. But I'll take a stab at it here. Our trends gas pipeline group announced recently that it executed agreements with three shippers that fully subscribed in Northeast Supply Link project on a long-term basis. These shippers included Hes, Anadarko and Williams Gas Marketing.
The Northeast Supply Link project is a proposed expansion of the Transco Pipeline System that will provide about 250,000 decaterms per day of incremental firm transportation capacity from Marcellus Shale supplies into Station 210 pulling point in New Jersey and even all the way into existing New York City delivery points.
Williams expects to submit its third application by the end of the year, and subject to court approval the budget will be placed into service in November 2013.
This is really exciting project for us because it shows the way our midstream business can work with the Gas Pipeline business. The largest customer commitment for this Transco project is coming from midstreams's 33-miles springo lateral interconnect that is to be completed now in July of 2011.
The midstream efforts in both the Northeast Pennsylvania and Southwest Pennsylvania are expected to enable the gathering of 2 Bcf/d in 2013 and 2.75 Bcf/d in 2015. So we're very excited to see the way things are growing there in both the midstream area, the gaspipe area and as well, the E&P area. 
The notes on the E&P, we continue to see improving well results. Our Clearfield County, Alder Runwells are online at 2 million to 4 million cubic feet per day each. And we are in the process of completing a 3D seismic acquisition for Susquehanna and Westmoreland Counties and the center in Clearford County shoots will begin very quickly.
Progress towards building out the permit inventory adding staff and vendors and contractors continue there as well.
Moving on to Slide 13. Here we show our commodity price assumptions that support our earnings guidance. The big shift was moving NYMEX Natural Gas midpoint down to $4.25 from $5 from 2011, and raising the midpoint for our WTI crude oil up to $87.50 from $80.
The gas is in line with the current ford strip and the crude oil is slightly conservative to the strip, as you all are probably aware. And 2012, our NYMEX Gas was lower to $5 from $5.40. And WTI Oil is going up from $82 to $89 in 2012. So those are just the changes that we made from the previous guidance.  And as well, the WTI there remains conservative to the strip.
Of course, the NGL margin moves up with these new assumptions despite embedding a much more conservative NGL to crude relationship that we saw in 2010. The actual NGL to crude relationship came in at 55% in 2010. And our midpoint here for 2011 is 53%, and you can see it rising up to 54% for 2012.
Our belief, and if you follow the logic here, our belief is that the NGL to crude relationships move inversely to crude to gas ratio. So as we're seeing a higher crude to gas ration in 2011, we're suggesting that we should see a slip in the NGL to crude ratio. Despite that, we continue to show very strong margins here in 2011.
Moving onto Slide 14. That commodity assumptions then reflect a nice lift in our guidance as well along with the Bakken acquisition. Our earnings per share reflects some tightening of the ranges in '11 and '12. And our midpoint is being raised from $1.25 to $1.40 for 2011. And to $1.75 to $1.50 in 2012.
This segment profit also is tightened. We're also tightening the range for 2011 and a slight increase in the range in 2012. The segment profit as you would see has moved up by a little over 7% in 2011 and about 10% for 2012.
The drivers of course for these earnings raising in segment profit going up are acquisitions that were made in the fourth quarter and higher NGL margins that are being partially offset by lower natural gas prices.
And you also would note, that if you dig into the detail here, you'll note that our 2011 and 2012 CapEx are raising. Part of that is carryover from 2010 to '11, as well as increased growth opportunities in the WPZ Laurel Mountain and the Piceance growth as well. So quite a bit of the capital coming there that will continue to fuel our growth.
Moving on to Slide 15. Impressive adjusted segment profit growth here from '10 to '12 of 35%. This segment profit growth is made up of 31% in the other category and 79% in E&P and a 26% increase in WPZ. 
In fact, our other categories are getting so big it's just about to earn its ripes and get a real name. So you'll see notes of that in our 10-K release as well. But really, very nice segment profit growth across the board for all three units here.
Moving on to Slide 16. Talking about we have here $4 billion in growth capital in '11 and '12 to spend. So that's just the growth side CapEx. And we have many more projects as you'll see here in the next few slides among beyond the guidance period. And many speculative projects that we have not built in the guidance yet. Of course, our track record demonstrates our ability to grow even faster than our guidance and we continue our able to add on projects to the back-end our CapEx for guidance.
Moving on to Slide 17. Much of the continued spending in guidance is growing our fee-based business here. As you can see, within midstream and the Marcellus and we continue to see a big opportunity, albeit more speculative, in the deepwater services, as well as you can see there on the left, you see with the Gulf Coast GNP gets larger as a percentage of the overall mix.
So a lot of great opportunity out there, tremendous demand for midstream infrastructure, particularly in the upstream sector and we're excited about beginning to help service the pet chem side at well as a lot of changes are coming forward in the pet chem side that demand some infrastructure changes as well and we're well positioned to help up without.
Moving on to Slide 18. Our opportunities in Canada and Domestic Olefins continue to impress. A relative low cost natural gas resources are creating great opportunities for the North American pet chem space. And we are very excited to be a part of it. 
We are able to utilize our knowledge and access to the light and NGLs, both here in the U.S. and Canada. And very well positioned because we have $500 million of international cash at the end of the year that is sitting available to invest. So we're not going to have to raise any financing to fuel some very substantial growth in Canada. And you can see there the projects listed on here, the Boreal NGL pipeline, which is the right in the midst of construction, reminds you that construction pipelines in Canada, in that part of the country, really does require winter construction on the Northern and because the ground is to be frozen and we are right in the midst of construction there.
The ethane recovery project, we continue to be excited about that and that will add to our current services up there that will add our ability to extract ethane and ethylene from those resources up there. And then, of course, we remain very confident in our ability to again the other upgrade processesing benefit and we've conclude here in the guidance as well.
Moving on to the gas pipelines there. You can see here, really the key message here is that there's about $1.3 billion of inventory for growth projects, but the real key message is that most of this $1.3 billion majority comes on either in late 2012 or even beyond the guidance period, most of it even beyond the guidance period. So despite nice increase that we've got in our guidance, we've got a very nice group of projects here that will fuel our growth beyond the guidance period.
Moving on here to Slide 20 and in closing here. In the current, we exceeded our EPS guidance. We plan to take dramatic steps to unlock shareholder value. Our unmatched infrastructure and development talents provide a sound basis for an increasing flow of dividends to our shareholders.
And in the forecast, we have a very visible growth supporting a 37% growth in guidance from 2010 to 2012. And in the future, a very strong case for continued growth beyond the guidance period.
Over the long haul, we have a track record of doing is what's right for our shareholders in poise and the environment. And we are very excited to continue to track record and we have a great future ahead of us that we're all excited about being a part of.
And with that, I'll turn it over to you for questions."

As it reflects, I think we said in the initial press release back then, it was within the next -- by 2013 or so, I thought we would be 25% oil revenue. So it's clearly the increase is one of our production growth is going up quite a bit in the next couple of years because of the new asset and that's a reflection of the capital and also a reflection of the difference in mix we'll have from almost all gas to more about 25% coming from the oil and liquids side."

And so but I would tell you that could go on for quite some time.

In the U.S., much smaller piece of that, obviously.

What that means to our Gulfstar product, I think, is very positive. We do have discussions going on right now with opportunities to deploy that. Again, we don't have anything to announce yet. But we are optimistic and I would say looking forward, there's a significant backlog of opportunities we see on the horizon that we think are going to come into the marketplace over the next, say, 18 months, as people get back to work in the Gulf.

And the production guidance in 2011 doesn't seem to show much decline on the gas expectation.

Alan will make brief remarks about this plan during his comments. But because of security law restrictions, we will not be commenting further or taking any questions on the E&P separation during this call. I will direct your attention to the press release that went out yesterday.

Good morning, and I'll start here on Slide 5.I'm certainly pleased to join us for our call this morning and to hear about our strong finish to 2010 and an exciting future for Williams shareholders.Our management and board have worked diligently",2797,"Great. Good morning, and I'll start here on Slide 5.
I'm certainly pleased to join us for our call this morning and to hear about our strong finish to 2010 and an exciting future for Williams shareholders.
Our management and board have worked diligently over the last couple of months analyzing the best path to unlock shareholder value while maintaining growth platforms for the future.
As Travis mentioned, we will not be able to provide details of the transactions or forward-looking perspectives of the new E&P company. Despite this restriction, we have plenty of exciting information to share with you about WMB's 2010 performance and the growth drivers for the future.
I'm also pleased to inform you that we exceeded our earlier guidance range for earnings per share, and we are raising guidance for 2011 and 2012.
And with that, I'll move on to Slide 6. As we announced yesterday, our board has given us a green light to pursue the creation of a separate E&P company, starting with a partial IPO in the third quarter of 2011, and then a planned spinoff for the remaining interest to our shareholders in 2012.
WMB would use the IPO proceeds to pay down corporate debt, and we would expect to maintain investment grade credit ratings at the WMB and WPZ. I would refer you to the press releases from the three credit rating agencies that rate our debt that came out shortly after our announcement yesterday if you'd like to know their perspectives in more detail.
This new structure enables WMB to initiate a high dividend strategy. We are announcing a 60% increase, starting with quarterly payout in June of 2011, going from $0.0125 to $0.20 per quarter, and we are targeting an additional 10% to 15% increase in June of 2012.
Both of these actions are a direct response to hearing from our shareholders and gathering thoughts over the last, actually, several years in terms of thinking about how we can increase shareholder value. So we're pleased to be reporting this to you this morning.
WMB and WPZ will be focused on meeting robust demand for new infrastructure that helps our customers and our nation take advantage of North America's abundant natural resources. As you will see, we have lot of new infrastructure being built and plan to do just that.
Moving on to Slide 7. Our full year financial results were boosted by a very strong fourth quarter. Our adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was up 60% over the same quarter in 2009. This drove our adjusted EPS from continuing operations for 2010 to a $1.28 per share, and that is 36% higher than our 2009 level of $0.94.
As you know, our full year GAAP was heavily impacted by non-cash impairment charges in the third quarter, and we had a significant cost related to the WPZ and WMZ merger and the related debt restructurings required for that transaction.
For the year, we are ending up at a GAAP loss of $1.1 billion. And on an adjusted basis, net income was $760 million, which was up 38% over the same number for 2009.
I won't spend much time here on the reserves since we provide some great graphics here on the next couple of slides that I'll explain the reserves with. 
And moving into Slide 8. You can see here starting with the left-hand side, you can see our year-end 2009 reserves, and you can see the various adjustments to get us to our 2010 U.S. reserves, then we add in the international reserves from Apco. And then finally, you see the adjusted total reserves as we look at what it would mean if we looked at a total of seven years of reserves to get to.
So our net proved reserves held strong with 107% reserve replacement ratio, but did not move up radically, predominantly, due to the new SEC five-year limit rule under which we reclassified about 250 Bcf of proved reserves to probable in the Piceance due to reducing the pace of drilling in a lower-price environment and no longer being able to get to all previously amounts within the five years.
This in no way means we can't or don't expect to get to those reserves, just reclassification under the SEC rules.
If you look at our net additions and revisions, we added 528 Bcf through our drilling program in which we spent $984 million in the E&P development capital. So this equates to, in 2010, a finding cost of $1.86.
We ended the year at 4.3 Tcf of domestic proved. And adding additional international you can see raises at to 4.5 Tcf. We've also identified an additional 353 Bcf of reserves that could be classified as proved, if we were allowed to add two more years of development. In other words, seven years of development instead of being limited to five.
Under this alternative view of how we would've looked at things before the SEC five-year rule was imposed, our adjusted proved reserves would have grown to more than 4.8 Tcf.
Moving on to Slide 9. You can see a big move here on our 3P reserves. And moving from about 14.8 Tcf to just under 16 Tcf, and this was driven predominantly by our undeveloped leasehold, acquisitions in both the Marcellus Shale and the Bakken Oil Play. 
And our drilling programs are now well-diversified among some of the most economically attractive plays in the country, including the Marcellus Shale, the Bakken Oil and the Piceance tight sands done the Williams' way.
Moving on to 10. Here, as mentioned earlier, we had a 60% increase in adjusted net income for the quarter. In addition, our teams worked tirelessly to close stunning amount of transactions in the quarter as listed here. 
We also saw our NGL production rebound tremendously in the fourth quarter after a difficult third quarter. And this represented a record for our WPZ operations. This was driven by the startup of our new Echo Springs plant, but was partially offset by the sell of our Cameron Meadows plant in the fourth quarter of 2009.
As you can see, the two large acquisitions done by WPZ are large fee-based deals, with little or no direct commodity exposure. And as we've commented a lot in the past, we continue to try to take advantage when we see good fee-based opportunities to continue to steady the incomes of our WPZ investments.
The scale that we brought to WPZ through our restructuring in the first quarter of 2010 enabled us to perform these large transactions without straining our balance sheet. So we really were able to really prove the value of our WPZ transaction in a very large way in the fourth quarter of '10.
And speaking of that, moving on here to Slide 11, the Bakken acquisition is a great example of the fruits that our WPZ restructuring brought forth. The drop-down of the Piceance gathering system that WPZ enabled this exciting $925 million acquisition. 
Nothing new on the slide, but we have now updated guidance to include it. And other than the weather this time of the year in North Dakota, we are very pleased about our large entry in the Bakken and Three Forks oil play in North Dakota. 
We closed the transaction on December 21 and we have three rigs running there. And certainly, in the process of getting our teams assembled and getting a lot of the great experience that we have around the organization zeroed in on the opportunities in the Bakken.
Moving on to Slide 12. A lot of exciting things going on here in the Marcellus, and almost too much to mention. But I'll take a stab at it here. Our Transco [Transcontinental] Gas Pipeline group announced recently that it executed agreements with three shippers that fully subscribed in Northeast Supply Link project on a long-term basis. These shippers included Hess, Anadarko and Williams Gas Marketing.
The Northeast Supply Link project is a proposed expansion of the Transco Pipeline System that will provide about 250,000 dekatherms per day of incremental firm transportation capacity from Marcellus Shale supplies into Station 210 Polling Point in New Jersey and even all the way into existing New York City delivery points.
Williams expects to submit its first application by the end of the year, and subject to perk [perquisites] approval, the budget will be placed in the service in November 2013. This is really exciting project for us because it shows the way our Midstream business can work with the Gas Pipeline business. The largest customer commitment for this Transco project is coming from Midstreams's 33-mile Springville lateral interconnect, that is to be completed now in July of 2011.
The midstream efforts in both Northeast Pennsylvania and Southwest Pennsylvania are expected to enable the gathering of 2 Bcf per day in 2013 and 2.75 Bcf per day in 2015. So we're very excited to see the way things are growing there in both the midstream area, the gas pipe area and as well, the E&P area. 
Notes on the E&P, we continue to see improving well results. Our Clearfield County, Alder Run wells are on line at 2 million to 4 million cubic feet per day each. And we are in the process of completing a 3D seismic acquisition for Susquehanna and Westmoreland Counties and the center in Clearfield County shoot will begin very quickly. Progress towards building out the permit inventory, adding staff and vendors and contractors continue there as well.
Moving on to Slide 13. Here we show our commodity price assumptions that support our earnings guidance. The big shift was moving NYMEX natural gas midpoint down to $4.25 from $5 for 2011, and raising the midpoint for our WTI crude oil up to $87.50 from $80.
The gas is in line with the current forward strip and the crude oil is slightly conservative to the strip, as you all are probably aware. In 2012, our NYMEX gas was lowered to $5 from $5.40. And WTI oil is going up from $82 to $89 in 2012. So those are just the changes that we've made from the previous guidance. And as well, the WTI there remains conservative to the strip.
Of course, the NGL margin moves up with these new assumptions despite embedding a much more conservative NGL to crude relationship than we saw in 2010. The actual NGL to crude relationship came in at 55% in 2010. And our midpoint here for 2011 is 53%, and you can see rising up to 54% for 2012.
Our belief, and if you follow the logic here, our belief is that the NGL to crude relationships move inversely to crude to gas ratio. So as we're seeing a higher crude to gas ratio in 2011, we're suggesting that we should see a slip in the NGL to crude ratio. Despite that, we continue to show very strong margins here in 2011.
Moving onto Slide 14. That commodity assumptions then reflect a nice lift in our guidance as well along with the Bakken acquisition. Our earnings per share reflects some tightening of the ranges in '11 and '12. And our midpoint is being raised from $1.25 to $1.40 for 2011. And to $1.75 from $1.50 in 2012.
The segment profit also has tightened. We're also tightening the range for 2011 and a slight increase in the range in 2012. The segment profit as you'd see has moved up by a little over 7% in 2011 and about 10% for 2012.
The drivers of course for these earnings raising in segment profit going up are acquisitions that were made in the fourth quarter and higher NGL margins that are being partially offset by lower natural gas prices.
And you also would note, if you dig into the detail here, you'll note that our 2011 and 2012 CapEx are raising. Part of that is carryover from 2010 to '11, as well as increased growth opportunities in the WPZ Laurel Mountain and the Piceance growth as well. So quite a bit of new capital coming there that will continue to fuel our growth.
Moving on to Slide 15. Impressive adjusted segment profit growth here from '10 to '12 of 35%. This segment profit growth is made up of 31% in the Other category and 79% in E&P and a 26% increase in WPZ. In fact, our Other category is getting so big, it's just about to earn its stripes and get a real name. So you'll see notes of that in our 10-K release as well. But really, very nice segment profit growth across the board for all three units here.
Moving on to Slide 16. Talking about we have here $4 billion in growth capital in '11 and '12 to spend. So that's just the growth side CapEx. And we have many more projects as you'll see here in the next few slides beyond the guidance period. And many speculative projects that we have not built in the guidance yet. Of course, our track record demonstrates our ability to grow even faster than our guidance, and we continue our able to add on projects to the back-end of our CapEx for guidance.
Moving on to Slide 17. Much of the continued spending in guidance is growing our fee-based business here. As you can see, within Midstream, in the Marcellus, and we continue to see a big opportunity, albeit more speculative, in the deepwater services as well. As you can see there on the left, you see where the Gulf Coast G&P gets larger as a percentage of the overall mix.
So a lot of great opportunity out there, tremendous demand for midstream infrastructure, particularly in the upstream sector, and we're excited about beginning to help service the pet chem side as well as a lot of changes are coming forward in the pet chem side that are going to demand some infrastructure changes as well, and we're well-positioned to help up with that.
Moving on to Slide 18. Our opportunities in Canada and domestic olefins continue to impress. A relative low cost natural gas resources are creating great opportunities for the North American pet chem space. And we are very excited to be a part of it. 
We are able to utilize our knowledge and access to the light and NGLs, both here in the U.S. and Canada. And very well-positioned because we have $500 million of international cash at the end of the year that is sitting available to invest. So we're not going to have to raise any financing to fuel some very substantial growth in Canada. And you can see there the projects listed on here, the Boreal NGL pipeline, which is the right in the midst of construction, reminds you that construction pipelines in Canada, in that part of the country, really does require winter construction on the Northern and because the ground is to be frozen, and we are right in the midst of construction there.
The ethane recovery project, we continue to be excited about that and that will add to our current services up there that will add our ability to extract ethane and ethylene from those resources up there. And then, of course, we remain very confident in our ability to again the other upgrade processing benefit, and we've conclude here in the guidance as well.
Move on to the gas pipelines there. You can see here, really, the key message here is that there's about $1.3 billion of inventory for growth project, but the real key message is that most of this $1.3 billion majority comes on either in late 2012 or even beyond the guidance period, most of it even beyond the guidance period. So despite nice increase that we've got in our guidance, we've got a very nice group of projects here that will fuel our growth beyond the guidance period.
Moving on here to Slide 20 and in closing here. In the current, we exceeded our EPS guidance. We plan to take dramatic steps to unlock shareholder value. Our unmatched infrastructure and development talents provide a sound basis for an increasing flow of dividends to our shareholders.
And in the forecast, we have very visible growth supporting a 37% growth in guidance from 2010 to '12. And in the future, a very strong case for continued growth beyond the guidance period.
Over the long haul, we have a track record of doing what is right for our shareholders, employees and the environment. And we are very excited to continue to track-record, and we have a great future ahead of us that we're all excited about being a part of.
And with that, I'll turn it over to for questions."

The ability to optimize around those oil sands up there and those gas reserves could go on for quite some time, and we're extremely well positioned up there.

But then we take that into Williams and that's the primary driver of the corporate dividend. And I think you can also see from, if run through the calculations, especially X E&P, we get to a coverage ratio at Williams as well. I don't think we're prepared to speak to a coverage ratio, but we do have some coverage there and the good news is here in 2010, we're putting some of that money back in the E&P to grow the Bakken production.

Beyond that, we expect to have some debt capacity and likely, in Canadian denominated debt, for the next phase of growth out there. And if we look at our credit metrics over the next several years, we should have some more debt capacity, particularly up on those Canadian assets. What that really remains in is the U.S. olefins business and that's a fairly modestly sized business today, perhaps, some expansions.

First, separation release that we issued last evening. Second, the reported fourth quarter results. And third, our year-end oil and gas reserves. Now, the last two were issued this morning.
In a minute, Alan Armstrong, our President and CEO, will review the few slides we have this morning. Be aware though that as always, all of our business units heads are here and are available to respond to questions after Alan's remarks.
Here with me are Ralph Hill, who heads the E&P company; Rory Miller, who recently took over the reins of the midstream company; and Phil Wright, who heads our Gas Pipelines.
Also, you certainly saw the notice that Phil will be taking another role in the company later this month and Randy Bernard is going to lead the Gas Pipelines and he's with us as well. Also, Don Chappel, the CFO is here as well.
As most of you are aware, yesterday, we announced our plan to separate our E&P business to a partial IPO and a subsequent spinoff of our remaining ownership interest. Alan will make brief remarks about this plan during his comments. But because of security law restrictions, we will not be commenting further or taking any questions on the E&P separation during this call. I will direct your attention to the press release that went out yesterday.
At the beginning of the slide deck are the forward-looking statements on Slide Number 2 and Number 3. And the disclaimer on oil and gas reserves on Slide Number 4. Those are important and integral to the remarks, so please review those.
Also included are various non-GAAP numbers that have been reconciled back to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those schedules are available and follow the presentation.
With that, I'll turn it over to Alan."

Good morning, and I'll start here on Slide 5.
I'm certainly pleased you have joined us for our call this morning and to hear about a strong finish to 2010 and an exciting future for Williams shareholders.
Our management and board have worked diligently over the last couple of months analyzing the best path to unlock shareholder value while maintaining growth platforms for the future.
As Travis mentioned, we will not be able to provide details of the transactions or forward-looking perspectives of the new E&P company. Despite this restriction, we have plenty of exciting information to share with you about WMB's 2010 performance and the growth drivers for the future.
I'm also pleased to inform you that we exceeded our earlier guidance range for earnings per share, and we are raising guidance for 2011 and 2012.
And with that, I'll move on to Slide 6. As we announced yesterday, our board has given us the green light to pursue the creation of a separate E&P company, starting with a partial IPO in the third quarter of 2011, and then a planned spinoff for the remaining interest to our shareholders in 2012.
WMB would use the IPO proceeds to pay down corporate debt, and we would expect to maintain investment-grade credit ratings at the WMB and WPZ. I would refer you to the press releases from the three credit rating agencies that rate our debt that came out shortly after our announcement yesterday if you'd like to know their perspectives in more detail.
This new structure enables WMB to initiate a high dividend strategy. We are announcing a 60% increase, starting with quarterly payout in June of 2011, going from $0.0125 to $0.20 per quarter, and we are targeting an additional 10% to 15% increase in June of 2012.
Both of these actions are a direct response to hearing from our shareholders and gathering thoughts over the last, actually, several years in terms of thinking about how we can increase shareholder value. So we're pleased to be reporting this to you this morning.
WMB and WPZ will be focused on meeting robust demand for new infrastructure that helps our customers and our nation take advantage of North America's abundant natural resources. As you will see, we have lot of new infrastructure being built and plan to do just that.
Moving on to Slide 7. Our full year financial results were boosted by a very strong fourth quarter. Our adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was up 60% over the same quarter in 2009. This drove our adjusted EPS from continuing operations for 2010 to $1.28 per share, and that is 36% higher than our 2009 level of $0.94.
As you know, our full year GAAP was heavily impacted by non-cash impairment charges in the third quarter, and we had significant cost related to the WPZ and WMZ merger and the related debt restructurings required for that transaction.
For the year, we are ending up at a GAAP loss of $1.1 billion. And on an adjusted basis, net income was $760 million, which was up 38% over the same number for 2009.
I won't spend much time here on the reserves since we provide some great graphics here on the next couple of slides that I'll explain the reserves with.
And moving into Slide 8. You can see here starting with the left-hand side, you can see our year-end 2009 reserves, and you can see the various adjustments that get us to our 2010 U.S. reserves, then we add in the international reserves from Apco. And then finally, you see the adjusted total reserves as we look at what it would mean if we looked at a total of seven years of reserves to get to.
So our net proved reserves held strong with 107% reserve replacement ratio, but did not move up radically, predominantly due to the new SEC five-year limit rule under which we reclassified about 250 Bcf of proved reserves to probable in the Piceance due to reducing the pace of drilling in a lower-price environment and no longer being able to get to all previously amounts within the five years.
This in no way means we can't or don't expect to get to those reserves, just reclassification under the SEC rules.
If you look at our net other additions and revisions, we added 528 Bcf through our drilling program in which we spent $984 million in the E&P development capital. So this equates to, in 2010, a finding cost of $1.86.
We ended the year at 4.3 Tcf of domestic proved. And adding additional international you can see raises that to 4.5 Tcf. We've also identified an additional 353 Bcf of reserves that could be classified as proved, if we were allowed to add two more years of development. In other words, seven years of development instead of being limited to five.
Under this alternative view of how we would've looked at things before the SEC five-year rule was imposed, our adjusted proved reserves would have grown to more than 4.8 Tcf.
Moving on to Slide 9. You can see a big move here on our 3P reserves. And moving from about 14.8 Tcf to just under 16 Tcf, and this was driven predominantly by our undeveloped leasehold, acquisitions in both the Marcellus Shale and the Bakken Oil Play.
And our drilling programs are now well-diversified among some of the most economically attractive plays in the country, including the Marcellus Shale, the Bakken Oil and the Piceance tight sands done the Williams' way.
Moving on to 10. Here, as mentioned earlier, we had a 60% increase in adjusted net income for the quarter. In addition, our teams worked tirelessly to close a stunning amount of transactions in the quarter as listed here.
We also saw our NGL production rebound tremendously in the fourth quarter after a difficult third quarter. And this represented a record for our WPZ operations. This was driven by the startup of our new Echo Springs plant, but was partially offset by the sell of our Cameron Meadows plant in the fourth quarter of 2009.
As you can see, the two large acquisitions done by WPZ are large fee-based deals, with little or no direct commodity exposure. And as we've commented a lot in the past, we continue to try to take advantage when we see good fee-based opportunities to continue to steady the incomes of our WPZ investments.
The scale that we brought to WPZ through our restructuring in the first quarter of 2010 enabled us to perform these large transactions without straining our balance sheet. So we really were able to really prove the value of our WPZ transaction in a very large way in the fourth quarter of '10.
And speaking of that, moving on here to Slide 11, the Bakken acquisition is a great example of the fruits that our WPZ restructuring brought forth. The drop-down of the Piceance gathering system that WPZ enabled this exciting $925 million acquisition.
Nothing new on the slide, but we have now updated guidance to include it. And other than the weather this time [ph] of the year in North Dakota, we are very pleased about our large entry in the Bakken and Three Forks oil play in North Dakota.
We closed the transaction on December 21, and we have three rigs running there. And certainly, in the process of getting our teams assembled and getting a lot of the great experience that we have around the organization zeroed in on the opportunities in the Bakken.
Moving on to Slide 12. A lot of exciting things going on here in the Marcellus, and almost too much to mention. But I'll take a stab at it here. Our Transco [Transcontinental] Gas Pipeline group announced recently that it executed agreements with three shippers that fully subscribed in Northeast Supply Link project on a long-term basis. These shippers included Hess, Anadarko and Williams Gas Marketing.
The Northeast Supply Link project is a proposed expansion of the Transco Pipeline System that will provide about 250,000 dekatherms per day of incremental firm transportation capacity from Marcellus Shale supplies into Station 210 pooling point in New Jersey and even all the way into existing New York City delivery points.
Williams expects to submit its first application by the end of the year, and subject to perk [perquisites] approval, the budget will be placed in the service in November 2013. This is a really exciting project for us because it shows the way our Midstream business can work with the Gas Pipeline business. The largest customer commitment for this Transco project is coming from Midstream’s 33-mile Springville lateral interconnect, that is to be completed now in July of 2011.
The midstream efforts in both Northeast Pennsylvania and Southwest Pennsylvania are expected to enable the gathering of 2 Bcf per day in 2013 and 2.75 Bcf per day in 2015. So we're very excited to see the way things are growing there in both the midstream area, the gas pipe area and as well, the E&P area.
Notes on the E&P, we continue to see improving well results. Our Clearfield County, Alder Run wells are on line at 2 million to 4 million cubic feet per day each. And we are in the process of completing a 3D seismic acquisition for Susquehanna and Westmoreland counties and the center in Clearfield County shoot will begin very quickly. Progress towards building out the permit inventory, adding staff and vendors and contractors continue there as well.
Moving on to Slide 13. Here we show our commodity price assumptions that support our earnings guidance. The big shift was moving NYMEX natural gas midpoint down to $4.25 from $5 for 2011, and raising the midpoint for our WTI crude oil up to $87.50 from $80.
The gas is in line with the current forward strip and the crude oil is slightly conservative to the strip, as you all are probably aware. In 2012, our NYMEX gas was lowered to $5 from $5.40. And WTI oil is going up from $82 to $89 in 2012. So those are just the changes that we've made from the previous guidance. And as well, the WTI there remains conservative to the strip.
Of course, the NGL margin moves up with these new assumptions despite embedding a much more conservative NGL to crude relationship than we saw in 2010. The actual NGL to crude relationship came in at 55% in 2010. And our midpoint here for 2011 is 53%, and you can see rising up to 54% for 2012.
Our belief, and if you follow the logic here, our belief is that the NGL to crude relationships move inversely to crude to gas ratio. So as we're seeing a higher crude to gas ratio in 2011, we're suggesting that we should see a slip in the NGL to crude ratio. Despite that, we continue to show very strong margins here in 2011.
Moving onto Slide 14. That commodity assumptions then reflect a nice lift in our guidance as well along with the Bakken acquisition. Our earnings per share reflect some tightening of the ranges in '11 and '12. And our midpoint is being raised from $1.25 to $1.40 for 2011 and to $1.75 from $1.50 in 2012.
The segment profit also has tightened. We're also tightening the range for 2011 and a slight increase in the range in ‘12. The segment profit as you'll see has moved up by a little over 7% in 2011 and about 10% for 2012.
The drivers of course for these earnings raising in segment profit going up are acquisitions that were made in the fourth quarter and higher NGL margins that are being partially offset by lower natural gas prices.
And you also would note, if you dig into the detail here, you'll note that our 2011 and 2012 CapEx are raising. Part of that is carryover from 2010 to '11, as well as increased growth opportunities in the WPZ Laurel Mountain and the Piceance growth as well. So quite a bit of new capital coming there that will continue to fuel our growth.
Moving on to Slide 15. Impressive adjusted segment profit growth here from '10 to '12 of 35%. This segment profit growth is made up of 31% in the Other category and 79% in E&P and a 26% increase in WPZ. In fact, our Other category is getting so big, it's just about to earn its stripes and get a real name. So you'll see notes of that in our 10-K release as well. But really, very nice segment profit growth across the board for all three units here.
Moving on to Slide 16. Talking about we have here $4 billion in growth capital in '11 and '12 to spend. So that's just the growth side CapEx. And we have many more projects as you'll see here in the next few slides beyond the guidance period and many speculative projects that we have not built in the guidance yet. Of course, our track record demonstrates our ability to grow even faster than our guidance, and we continue and are able to add on projects to the back-end of our CapEx for guidance.
Moving on to Slide 17. Much of the continued spending in guidance is growing our fee-based business here. As you can see, within Midstream, in the Marcellus, and we continue to see a big opportunity, albeit more speculative, in the deepwater services as well. As you can see there on the left, you see where the Gulf Coast G&P gets larger as a percentage of the overall mix.
So a lot of great opportunity out there, tremendous demand for midstream infrastructure, particularly in the upstream sector, and we're excited about beginning to help service the pet chem side as well as a lot of changes are coming forward in the pet chem side that are going to demand some infrastructure changes as well. And we're well-positioned to help out with that.
Moving on to Slide 18. Our opportunities in Canada and domestic olefins continue to impress. A relative low cost natural gas resources are creating great opportunities for the North American pet chem space. And we are very excited to be a part of it.
We are able to utilize our knowledge and access to the light and NGLs, both here in the U.S. and Canada. And very well-positioned because we have $500 million of international cash at the end of the year that is sitting available to invest. So we're not going to have to raise any financing to fuel some very substantial growth in Canada. And you can see there the projects listed on here, the Boreal NGL pipeline, which is the right in the midst of construction, reminds you that construction pipelines in Canada, in that part of the country, really does require winter construction on the Northern end because the ground is to be frozen, and we are right in the midst of construction there.
The ethane recovery project, we continue to be excited about that, and that will add to our current services up there that will add our ability to extract ethane and ethylene from those resources up there. And then, of course, we remain very confident in our ability to gain the other upgrader processing benefit, and we've conclude here in the guidance as well.
Moving on to the gas pipeline there. You can see here, really, the key message here is that there's about $1.3 billion of inventory for growth project, but the real key message is that most of this $1.3 billion majority comes on either in late 2012 or even beyond the guidance period, most of it even beyond the guidance period. So despite a nice increase that we've got in our guidance, we've got a very nice group of projects here that will fuel our growth beyond the guidance period.
Moving on here to Slide 20 and in closing here. In the current, we exceeded our EPS guidance. We plan to take dramatic steps to unlock shareholder value. Our unmatched infrastructure and development talents provide a sound basis for an increasing flow of dividends to our shareholders.
And in the forecast, we have very visible growth supporting a 37% growth in guidance from 2010 to '12. And in the future, a very strong case for continued growth beyond the guidance period.

I think we said in the initial press release back then, it was within the next -- by 2013 or so, I thought we'd thought it to be like 25% oil revenue.

And so as we have continued below natural gas prices here, we continue to have a lot of opportunity in that regard. And we are very excited about that space. I would just say that we are also seeing a lot of interest by the pet chem space in moving upstream as well. And so there may be a way to reduce risk to our portfolio and lead people that are more in the business of ethylene-derivative business. And the exports of those products doing their expertise. And us doing the upstream in perhaps in a way that partners with those parties and reduces our risk.

Also yesterday using a few Slides had, some commentary about the results, our increased guidance and our growth opportunities that audio commentary or the slides are available on the website and because of that review yesterday, we will not be reviewing the slides again this morning. So on our website, Williams.com, you should be able a number of things that were posted yesterday afternoon. First earnings presentation with the audio commentary by Alan. Second, the data book that contains the usual information available every quarter. Third, the press release of the first quarter results. Fourth, our analyst package. And finally, a podcast of Alan's remarks yesterday. 
Also for your information. The first quarter 10-Q will be filed today. Because we reviewed these items yesterday, I expect the call today will be very brief and we'll get very quick with your questions. In a minute, Alan Armstrong, President and CEO will make some general comments, after which, we'll open the line for questions. 
Be aware, as always, all of our business heads are here and available to respond your questions after Alan's remarks. Here with me are Ralph Hill, who heads up the E&P company; Rory Miller, who oversees the Midstream Company; and Randy Bernard, who heads up the gas pipeline. Also, Don Chappel, the CFO is here as well. As most of you are aware, last Friday, we announced that our wholly owned subsidiary, WPX Energy, Inc., filed a registration statement related to the proposed IPO that's common stock has a security law restriction we will not be commenting at all on WPA Energy Inc. today. 
There are forward-looking statements on Slide 2 and 3 and disclaimer on oil and gas reserves on Slide 4, at yesterday's presentation. Those are also included in the data book. They're important and integral to the company and you should review those.

I'll just very briefly capture the highlights and key notes on what was put out as the recording yesterday and in the slide material. First of all, we're very excited to tell you we're raising guidance,",1115,"Good morning and thanks for joining us this morning. I'll just very briefly capture the highlights and key notes on what was put out as the recording yesterday and in the slide material. First of all, we're very excited to tell you we're raising guidance, and this is based on both higher crude price expectations. We are now at $95 midpoint for '11 and '12 crude. And of course, that's still well below the hoard market and current pricing for crude. And current NGL margins, of course, are being lifted on that. And in fact, current NGL margins are actually just beyond the high end of range of what we have posted right now. 
Also, we have greater confidence on timing and performance on a number of new projects that are going to add to the balance in 2011. So we are raising guidance for both '11 and '12 and you can see the details of that now at a -- our midpoint for '11 is now $1.55 per share on an adjusted earnings basis. 
In the current quarter, we had mixed results to combine and produce a very solid quarter. Our gas gathering and production volumes were negatively impacted by severe winter weather primarily in the Rockies and the Bakken. With Bakken receiving near record snowfalls. And of course, low natural gas prices also growed (sic) [grew] low quarter-over-quarter results in E&P. 
However, our midstream Canada and Olefins segment came through and posted a record quarter to help to mitigate the weakness in the gas prices. And our Gas Pipe segment also came through with a strong quarter. 
As we look into the second quarter, we are very excited about how our volumes have rebounded and conditions are currently very good for tremendous earnings results for the balance of 2011. Looking to the balance of the year, we now expect our midpoint, as I stated earlier, EPS to be $1.55 and we're going to get some of the key factors that we expect to drive this even better performance for the balance of the year. 
First of all, our operating volumes have really rebounded in all of our areas. We expect about balance of the year to be much better as the fruits of our labor in both the Marcellus and the Bakken begin to take hold both on E&P side and in the Marcellus on the WPZ Midstream side. Also, we had some major maintenance to get through in the first quarter at our big opal plant, which is the largest single contributor to our NGL equity volumes. 
Secondly, new projects that we are expecting -- first of all, Perdido Northbay project will be a powerful contributor to earnings in the last half of the year and not so really dependent on permitting out there as much as some continued topside work that Shell is doing on their big platform that feeds both our oil gathering, our gas gathering and our Marcum processing plant. That and of all of those facilities serving the Deep Water Gulf of Mexico. So we're really looking forward to seeing those volumes start to ramp up and we have confidence in that happening for the balance of the year. 
Also, our Transco Pipeline just recently placed into service 2 new projects that will combine to generate over $30 million in additional profits for the balance of the year. And then finally the Marcellus, which is really infrastructure constraint on many fronts right now, will benefit from a lot of work that E&P did in getting a lot of small gathering systems in the field to certain new production in those areas as well as the laser pipeline which in our very own Springville lateral, which we expect to begin in the third quarter. So a lot of things going on in the Marcellus, on the infrastructure front, some of which will directly impact our production and, of course, others that will drive earnings at the WPZ level. 
Third on margins. We anticipate continued strong unit NGL margins and olefins margins. Our current forecast in margins for NGLs are really below what we're currently experiencing and if you've noticed, we've really seen a nice shift up in ethane and as saying as well as the heavier products continue to provide really record level margins. 
However, we also know that things can change pretty fast in this arena so we are raising our oil prices to $95 and we are holding back on our NGL crude ratio assumptions below what we're currently experiencing. 
On the olefins margin side, we continue to expect robust margins on this on the back of high crude oil because the rest of the world is really dependent on olefin products that are produced from crude oil, of course, and we continue to see growing demand for olefin derivative products outside the U.S. So we're really -- in the past, the U.S. techia [ph] market was fairly dependent on the U.S. economy and it's really offshore right now in terms of what we're depending on. 
We, of course, cannot say much at all about the spin off of our E&P segment, to be known WPX Energy. I can tell you that the recent S-1 filing is spot on with what we told you to expect in the last earnings call. I can also speak to the positive impact that we expect to see at WMB. WMB is going to be one of the top interviewed infrastructure companies in the nation and it is going to be better-positioned than any that I'm aware of in delivering reliable growing dividends. 
It will be investment grade and it will have the power of the increasing distribution rights of the Williams Partners GP and this is going to allow for continued growth and free cash flows, and providing those of you available for dividends without dilution our financing expenses at the WMB level. 
For the clear and transparent growth that WPZ should provide confidence regarding our continued ability to grow that distribution at we already declared a 60% increase for the WMB June dividend, and are targeting 10% to 15% increase in dividend for the June 2012 WMB dividend. And of course these targets were set before the latest increase in guidance at both PZ and MB. 
So overall, are very excited about the amount of value we expect to generate in the foreseeable future for our WMB shareholders and we really are sitting at the right place, at the right time, with the right assets, the right experience and a great financial position to rapidly expand our business' earnings power. And with that, we'll turn this over for questions."

I think the question was around the -- what we expect in terms of the increase for demand in the Pet Chem space and recognizing the new announcements from Dow and Chevron, Philips and some of the new announced Formosas and the new announcements on the pet chem side. 
We are -- and I think another question around what we would do with guidance -- first of all of the ethane side, I think we're pleased to see the big pet chems continuing to see the same opportunity we see in terms of being able to export ethylene derivative products and having a very low-cost feedstock here in the U.S. to continue to provide that. And so I think it's really going to be a matter of timing in terms of when those facilities, come up versus when the ethane shows up. But I will tell you that it is going to take a lot of the ethane projects and ethane supplies aren't going to show up tomorrow either. There's a lot of infrastructure required to get that ethane in place as well. So I think it's going to be a matter of how those things show up. 
But on balance, it looks pretty good from our advantage points in terms of the demand picking up with the available supply. And I would tell you that there's also going to be a lot of interim small projects. We announced our own small project there and we had guys running and spending $18 million and got small 3,000 to 5,000-barrel a day increase in ethane demand there. And there's going to be a lot of those kind of projects continue to come out and what used to be referred to as refinery tree. We're going to see be in the pet chem space as well because the margins are absolutely there and so I think those short-term kind of increases that people can squeeze out of their facilities, they're going to be doing. So I think -- hopefully that answer your question. I apologize, we couldn't quite hear it on this one."

I will tell you that I was kind of put them into 4 different baskets up there. And if you look at our slides, I think it's Slide 18 in our package, you'll see there we've got some of the segment profit, first year segment profit, of those projects versus the capital shown there and you'll see for an instance in the first quarter our optimization projects like our BB splitter, and you'll see there that's about a 3x cash flow kind of project. We invested $52 million in our ranges, $15 million to $20 million in segment profits for the first year there. 
And so those kind of projects will be very high returns like that. The Boreal pipeline, you'll see, is quite a bit lower return and part of that is just because we were building for capacity for the future and all you see there is just the first-year volumes before the additional projects come on. But I would expect those kinds of projects to be in the low teens kind of returns to those pipeline projects. And then upgrader projects where we are actually going in and building a new upgraders will be a matter of negotiation but driven by very high propylene margins so there's quite a bit of opportunity there for us to capture it and really balls down how much share with the upgrader and we're in very good competitive position their and that we got the pipeline now and the red water. Those will probably be in the high teens returns. 
And then the ethane recovery project that we did with Nova, not going to comment on that in terms of returns, but you can see what we expect for first-year profit on that versus the capital investment on that and you see that's about a little lower 5 multiple in terms of what we're getting from that project.

These are big projects and complicated and things don't move real briskly on that front but we're confident in ultimately -- the liquids being lifted from those streams, it really doesn't make any sense at all not to because it produces higher emissions in the air, which is obviously a critical issue as well as a tremendous amount of value being burnt there as that gas today is being consumed in boilers. So there's a real big opportunity to get that and then your question that just boils down to who gets it extracts it. 
So I have great confidence in that yellow being captured. And I would just tell you, I think we are very well-positioned to capture that and negotiations are ongoing on both fronts. I would tell you the CNRL negotiations are ahead of the Sin Crude [ph] negotiations. That about as much as I can share with you on that at this point."

That's actually a wet dream as far as we're calling those projects. I think there was an announcement that came out last week from Gulf Marine and mentioned they'd entered into an agreement with us to build a sparkle [ph] in the Gulf of Mexico and that is correct. We have a letter of agreement signed with a couple of producers in the Gulf. We are not in the liberty right now to reveal who those players are but that is in place. The letter of agreement includes a reimbursement provision so we can start spending money today along the timelines on major construction contracts, contracts in anticipation of definitive agreements. 
We're looking at probably a third quarter signing of those definitive agreements. That is moving ahead. That will be our first GulfStar project. I think we mentioned in the last call, the connection pipeline, those are around $1 billion a piece and this particular project, we're looking at bringing in JV Partners so thinking all the guidance numbers that we're giving capital is about half of that number. 
That project is been in the works for a long time. We've been able to get much of the engineering, much of the design work and much of the critical thinking done on that product, done ahead of time. So we're not parallel-pathing a lot of engineering and construction at the same time. We think that's going to reduce a lot of construction risk on that project and we're very excited about that. In terms of more details on the counterparties, that's probably going to be more of a third quarter type of announcement."

In between those 2 things, there's also going to be expansions to existing facilities that will be rather significant and I think the current margin environment and the confidence in crude to gas right now is going to continue to have people investing in that space as well. And so I think it's rare that we have on the ethane and ethylene side, ethylene cracking, it's rare that we see the 2 things build at the same time. But because the margins in this environment, the margins are so strong in both spaces, I think we'll continue to see the ethanes supplies build and I think we'll continue to see the ethane cracking capabilities build as well.

that are obviously, very concerned about long-term supply and I think the effort that I think is the smart decision for the industry to look to look to the total pie between gas and crude and that comes back to gas polyethylene or other ethylene derivatives. And to figure out how they can assure themselves a portion of that margin that allows them to invest in infrastructure going forward that's got more stable in earnings behind it, rather than a winner and a loser accross that chain but figuring out how that margin will be shared in a way that allows both parties to invest going forward in a very adequate return that exists out there. 
And I hope, I certainly think, that the current margin environment in both those sectors doesn't lead to arrogance that will cause people to forget the past. And certainly, the folks we're talking to, anyway, and are interested in working with, I don't think that's the case."

As you no doubt know, we released our results yesterday after the market closed. Also yesterday, Alan, using a few slides, had some commentary about the results, our increased guidance and our growth opportunities. That audio commentaries and slides are available on the website, and because of that review yesterday, we'll not be reviewing the slides again this morning. So on our website, williams.com, you should be able to find a number of things that were posted yesterday afternoon. The first, the earnings presentation with the audio commentary by Alan. Second, the data book that contains the usual information made available every quarter. Third, the press release of the first quarter results. Fourth, our analyst package. And finally, a podcast of Alan's remarks yesterday. 
Also for your information. The first quarter 10-Q will be filed today. Because we reviewed these items yesterday, I expect the call today will be very brief and we'll get very quickly with your questions. In a minute, Alan Armstrong, our President and CEO will make some general comments, after which, we'll open the lines for questions. 
Be aware, as always, all of our business heads are here and available to respond to your questions after Alan's remarks. Here with me are Ralph Hill, who heads up the E&P Company; Rory Miller, who oversees the Midstream Company; and Randy Bernard, who heads up the gas pipeline. Also, Don Chappel, the CFO is here as well. 
As most of you are aware, last Friday, we announced that our wholly owned subsidiary, WPX Energy, Inc., filed a registration statement related to the proposed IPO of its common stock. It has a security law restriction, we will not be commenting at all on WPX Energy Inc. today. 
There are forward-looking statements on Slide 2 and 3 and disclaimer on oil and gas reserves on Slide 4, at yesterday's presentation. Those are also included in the data book. They're important and integral to the company and you should review those. 
Also, there are non-GAAP numbers included in these various presentations. Those have all been reconciled back to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and their reconciliation schedules are also available. So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan."

Good morning and thanks for joining us this morning. I'll just very briefly capture the highlights and key notes on what was put out as in recording yesterday and in the slide material. First of all, we're very excited to tell you we're raising gui",1131,"Great. Good morning and thanks for joining us this morning. I'll just very briefly capture the highlights and key notes on what was put out as in recording yesterday and in the slide material. First of all, we're very excited to tell you we're raising guidance, and this is based on both higher crude price expectations. We are now at $95 midpoint for '11 and '12 crude. And of course, that's still well below the hoard market and current pricing for crude. And current NGL margins, of course, are being lifted on that. And in fact, current NGL margins are actually just beyond the high end of range of what we have posted right now. 
Also, we have greater confidence on timing and performance on a number of new projects that are going to add to the balance in 2011. So we are raising guidance for both '11 and '12 and you can see the details of that now at a -- our midpoint for '11 is now $1.55 per share on an adjusted earnings basis. 
In the current quarter, we had mixed results to combine and produce a very solid quarter. Our gas gathering and production volumes were negatively impacted by severe winter weather primarily in the Rockies and the Bakken. With the Bakken receiving near record snowfalls. And of course, low natural gas prices also grow low quarter-over-quarter results in E&P. 
However, our Midstream Canada and Olefins segment came through and posted a record quarter that help to mitigate the weakness in the gas prices. And our Gas Pipe segment also came through with a strong quarter. 
As we look into the second quarter, we are very excited about how our volumes have rebounded and conditions are currently very good for tremendous earnings results for the balance of 2011. Looking to the balance of the year, we now expect our midpoint, as I stated earlier, EPS to be $1.55 and we're going to hit now just some of the key factors that we expect to drive this even better performance for the balance of the year. 
First of all, our operating volumes have really rebounded in all of our areas. We expect the balance of the year to be much better as the fruits of our labor in both the Marcellus and the Bakken begin to take hold both on E&P side and in the Marcellus on the WPZ Midstream side. Also, we had some major maintenance to get through in the first quarter at our big opal plant, which is the largest single contributor to our NGL equity volumes. 
Secondly, a new projects that we are expecting -- first of all, Perdido Norte project really will be a powerful contributor to earnings in the last half of the year and not so really dependent on permitting out there as much as some continued topside work that Shell is doing on their big platform that feeds both our oil gathering, our gas gathering and our Marcum [ph] processing plant. That -- and of all those facilities serving the Western Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. So we're really looking forward to seeing those volumes start to ramp up and we have confidence in that happening for the balance of the year. 
Also, our Transco Pipeline just recently placed into service 2 new projects that will combine to generate over $30 million in additional profits for the balance of the year. And then finally the Marcellus, which is really infrastructure constraint on many fronts right now, will benefit from a lot of work that E&P did in getting a lot of small gathering systems in the field to certain new production in those areas as well as the laser pipeline which -- and our very own Springville lateral, which we expect to begin in the third quarter. So a lot of things going on in the Marcellus, on the infrastructure front, some of which will directly impact our production and, of course, others that will drive earnings at the WPZ level. 
Third on margins. We anticipate continued strong unit NGL margins and olefins margins. Our current forecast in margins for NGLs are really below what we are currently experiencing and if you've noticed, we've really seen a nice shift up in ethane and as well as the heavier products continue to provide really record level margins. 
However, we also know that things can change pretty fast in this arena so we are only raising our oil prices on to the $95 and we are holding back on our NGL crude ratio assumptions below what we're currently experiencing. 
On the olefins margin side, we continue to expect robust margins on this on the back of high crude oil because the rest of the world is really dependent on olefin products that are produced from crude oil, of course, and we continue to see growing demand for olefin derivative products outside the U.S. So we're really -- in the past, the U.S. techia [ph] market was fairly dependent on the U.S. economy and it's really moved offshore right now in terms of what we're depending on. 
We, of course, cannot say much at all about the spin off of our E&P segment, to be known as WPX Energy. I can tell you that the recent S-1 filing is spot on with what we told you to expect in the last earnings call. I can also speak to the positive impact that we expect to see at WMB. WMB is going to be one of the top interviewed infrastructure companies in the nation and it is going to be better-positioned than any that I'm aware of in delivering reliable growing dividends. 
It will be investment grade and it will have the power of the increasing incentive distribution rights of the Williams Partners GP and this is going to allow for continued growth and free cash flows, and providing those of you available for dividends without dilution or financing expenses at the WMB level. 
So the clear and transparent growth that WPZ should provide confidence regarding our continued ability to grow distributions at the PZ level and we have already declared a 60% increase for the WMB June dividend, and are targeting a 10% to 15% increase in dividend for the June 2012 WMB dividend. And of course these targets were set before the latest increase in guidance at both PZ and MB. 
So overall, we're very excited about the amount of value we expect to generate in the foreseeable future for our WMB shareholders and we really are sitting at the right place, at the right time, with the right assets, the right experience and a great financial position to rapidly expand our business' earnings power. And with that, we'll turn this over for questions."

And I'm trying to figure out with respect to guys wherein you guys are trying to get a larger market share. Is that something where their interests should help where there's more opportunity maybe to find someone with an offtake or are you finding more sort of direct competition as overall ethylene expansion perhaps, ramps?"

I think the question was around the -- what we expect in terms of the increase for demand in the Pet Chem space and recognizing the new announcements from Dow and Chevron, Philips and some of the new announced Formosa, some of the new announcements on the pet chem side.  We are -- and I think another question around what we would do with the guys -- first of all on the ethane side, I think that we're pleased to see the big pet chems continuing to see the same opportunity we see in terms of being able to export ethylene derivative products and having a very low-cost feedstock here in the U.S. to continue to provide that. And so I think it's really going to be a matter of timing in terms of when those facilities, come up versus when the ethane shows up. But I will tell you that it is going to take a lot of the ethane projects and ethane supplies aren't going to show up tomorrow either. There's a lot of infrastructure required to get that ethane in place as well. So I think it's going to be a matter of how those things show up. 
But on balance, it looks pretty good from our vantage points in terms of the demand picking up with the available supply. And I would tell you that there's also going to be a lot of interim small projects. We announced our own small project there and we had guys were running, we've spent $18 million and got a small I think a 3,000 to 5,000-barrel a day increase in ethane demand there. And there's going to be a lot of those kind of projects that continue to come out and what used to be referred to as refinery tree. We're going to see be in the pet chem space as well because the margins are absolutely there and so I think those short-term kind of increases that people can squeeze out of their facilities, they're going to be doing. So I think -- hopefully that answered your question. I apologize, we couldn't quite hear it on this end."

I will tell you that I was kind of put them into maybe 4 different baskets of opportunities up there. And if you look at our slides, I think it's Slide 18 in our package, you'll see there we've got some of the segment profit, first year segment profit of those projects versus the capital shown there and you'll see, for instance, the first category I would put is on optimization projects like our BB splitter, and you'll see there that's about a 3x cash flow kind of project. We invested $52 million in our ranges, $15 million to $20 million in segment profits for the first year there.  And so those kind of projects will be very high returns like that. The Boreal pipeline, you'll see, is quite a bit lower return and part of that is just because we were building for capacity for the future and all you see there is just the first-year volumes before these additional projects come on. But I would expect those kind of projects to be in the low teens kind of returns for those pipeline kind of projects. And then the upgrader projects where we're actually going in and building a new upgraders will be a matter of negotiation but driven by a very high propylene margins so there's quite a bit of opportunity there for us to capture and it really boils down to how much we share with the upgrader and we're in very good competitive position their and that we got the pipeline now and the fractionator, red water. But those will be probably in the high teens kind of returns.  And then the ethane recovery project that we did with Nova, not going to comment on that in terms where that return is, but you can see what we expect for our first-year profit on that versus the capital investment on that and you'll see that's about a little lower over of 5 multiples in terms of what we're getting from that project.

That yellow is -- basically represents the barrels from the existing upgraders as you picked up on, which is CNRL and sin crude. And we're pretty far along. These are big projects and complicated and things don't move real briskly on that front but we're confident in ultimately -- the liquids being lifted from those streams, it really doesn't make any sense at all not to because it produces higher emissions in the air, which is obviously a critical issue as well. There's a tremendous amount of value being burnt there as that gas today is being consumed in boilers. So there's a real big opportunity to get that and then the real question just boils down to who gets it and extracts it. 
So I have great confidence in that yellow being captured. And I would just tell you, I think we are very well-positioned to capture that and negotiations are ongoing on both fronts. I would tell you the CNRL negotiations are ahead of the sin crude negotiations. That's about as much as I can care to share with you on that at this point."

That's actually a wet dreams as far as that we're calling those projects.

We have a letter of agreement signed with a couple of producers in the Gulf. We are not in the liberty right now to reveal who those players are but that is in place. The letter of agreement includes a reimbursement provision so we can start spending money today along the timelines on major construction contracts, live contracts in anticipation of definitive agreements.  We're looking at probably a third quarter signing of those definitive agreements. So that is moving ahead. That will be our first GulfStar project. I think we mentioned in the last call, the connection pipeline, those are around $1 billion a piece and on this particular project, we're looking at bringing in JV partners so I'm thinking all the guidance numbers that we're giving, the capital is about half of that number. So that project is been in the works for a long time. We've been able to get much of the engineering, much of the design work and much of the critical thinking done on that product, done ahead of time. So that we're not parallel-pathing a lot of engineering and construction at the same time. So we think that's going to reduce a lot of the construction risk on that project and we're very excited about that. So in terms of more details, those on the counterparties, that's probably going to be more of a third quarter type of announcement."

And so I think we'll continue to see that and then I think those big projects in the 3 to 4-year timeframe, those big projects will start to kick in. Some of those projects that have been announced are very large scale projects and will take a long time. 
In between those 2 things, there's also going to be I think expansions to existing facilities that will be rather significant and I think the current margin environment and the confidence in crude to gas right now is going to continue to have people investing in that space as well. And so I think it's rare that we have on the ethane and ethylene side, ethylene cracking, it's rare that we see the 2 things build at the same time. But because the margins in this environment, the margins are so strong in both spaces, I think we'll continue to see the ethanes supplies build. I think we'll continue to see the ethane cracking capabilities build as well. Then may be a few rocky steps here and there but right now, the trajectory looks pretty good."

And so if I can just tell you folks that we continue to talk to and continue to work towards some structured arrangements like that, are obviously very concerned about long-term supply and I think the effort that I think is the smart decision for the industry to look at is to look to the total pie between gas and crude and that comes back to gas polyethylene or other ethylene derivatives. And to figure out how they can assure themselves a portion of that margin that allows them to invest in infrastructure going forward that's got more stable earnings behind it, rather than a winner and a loser across that chain but figuring out how that margin can be shared in a way that allows both parties to invest going forward in a very adequate return that exists out there.  And I hope, I certainly think, that the current margin environment in both those sectors doesn't lead to arrogance that will cause people to forget the past.

As you no doubt know, we released our results yesterday after the market closed. Also yesterday, Alan, using a few slides, had some commentary about the results, our increased guidance and our growth opportunities. That audio commentaries and slides are available on the website, and because of that review yesterday, we'll not be reviewing the slides again this morning. So on our website, williams.com, you should be able to find a number of things that were posted yesterday afternoon. First, the earnings presentation with the audio commentary by Alan. Second, the data book that contains the usual information we make available every quarter. Third, the press release of the first quarter results. Fourth, our analyst package. And finally, a pod cast of Alan's remarks yesterday. 
Also for your information, the first quarter 10-Q will be filed today. Because we reviewed these items yesterday, I expect the call today will be very brief and we'll get very quickly to your questions. In a minute, Alan Armstrong, our President and CEO, will make some general comments, after which we'll open the lines for questions. 
Be aware, as always, all of our business unit heads are here and available to respond to your questions after Alan's remarks. Here with me are Ralph Hill, who heads up the E&P Company; Rory Miller, who oversees the Midstream Company; and Randy Bernard, who heads up the gas pipeline. Also, Don Chappel, the CFO is here as well. 
As most of you are aware, last Friday we announced that our wholly owned subsidiary, WPX Energy, Inc., filed a registration statement related to the proposed IPO of its common stock. Because of security law restrictions, we will not be commenting at all on WPX Energy Inc. today. 
There are forward-looking statements on Slide 2 and 3 and disclaimer on oil and gas reserves on Slide 4 of yesterday's presentation. Those are also included in the data book. They're important and integral to the company and you should review those. 
Also, there are non-GAAP numbers included in these various presentations. Those have all been reconciled back to generally accepted accounting principles and their reconciliation schedules are also available. So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan."

Good morning and thanks for joining us this morning. I'll just very briefly capture the highlights and key notes on what was put out as a recording yesterday and is in the slide material. First of all, we're very excited to tell you we're raising g",1129,"Great. Good morning and thanks for joining us this morning. I'll just very briefly capture the highlights and key notes on what was put out as a recording yesterday and is in the slide material. First of all, we're very excited to tell you we're raising guidance, and this is based on both higher crude price expectations. We are now at $95 midpoint for '11 and '12 crude. And of course, that's still well below the hoard market and current pricing for crude. And current NGL margins, of course, are being lifted on that. And in fact, current NGL margins are actually just beyond the high end of range of what we have posted right now. 
Also, we have greater confidence on timing and performance on a number of new projects that are going to add to the balance in 2011. So we are raising guidance for both '11 and '12, and you can see the details of that. We're now at a -- our midpoint for '11 is now $1.55 per share on an adjusted earnings basis. 
In the current quarter, we had mixed results to combine and produce a very solid quarter. Our gas gathering production volumes were negatively impacted by severe winter weather, primarily in the Rockies and in the Bakken, with the Bakken receiving near record snowfalls. And of course, low natural gas prices also grows low quarter-over-quarter results in E&P. 
However, our Midstream Canada and Olefins segment came through and posted a record quarter that helped to mitigate the weakness in the gas prices. And our Gas Pipe segment also came through with a strong quarter. 
As we look into the second quarter, we are very excited about how our volumes have rebounded and conditions are currently very good for tremendous earnings results for the balance of 2011. Looking to the balance of the year, we now expect our midpoint, as I stated earlier, EPS to be $1.55. And we're going to hit now just some of the key factors that we expect to drive this even better performance for the balance of the year. 
First of all, our operating volumes have really rebounded in all of our areas. We expect the balance of the year to be much better as the fruits of our labor in both the Marcellus and the Bakken begin to take hold both on the E&P side and in the Marcellus on the WPZ Midstream side. Also, we had some major maintenance to get through in the first quarter at our big Opal Plant, which is the largest single contributor to our NGL equity volumes. 
Secondly, new projects that we are expecting. First of all, Perdido Norte project really will be a powerful contributor to earnings in the last half of the year and not so really dependent on permitting out there as much as some continued topside work that Shell is doing on their big platform that feeds both our oil gathering, our gas gathering and our Markham processing plant that -- and of all those facilities serving the Western Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. So we're really looking forward to seeing those volumes start to ramp up and we have confidence in that happening for the balance of the year. 
Also,our Transco Pipeline just recently placed into service 2 new projects that will combine to generate over $30 million in additional profits for the balance of the year. And then finally the Marcellus, which is really infrastructure constrained on many fronts right now, will benefit from a lot of work that E&P did in getting a lot of small gathering systems in the field to serve new production in those areas as well as the laser pipeline, which -- and our very own Springville lateral, which we expect to begin in the third quarter. So a lot of things going on in the Marcellus, on the infrastructure front, some of which will directly impact our production and, of course, others that will drive earnings at the WPZ level. 
Third, on margins. We anticipate continued strong unit NGL margins and olefins margins. Our current forecast in margins for NGLs are really below what we are currently experiencing, and if you've noticed, we've really seen a nice shift up in ethane and as well as the heavier products continue to provide really record level margins. 
However, we also know that things can change pretty fast in this arena, so we are only raising our oil prices assumption to $95 and, we are holding back on our NGL crude ratio assumptions below what we're currently experiencing. 
On the olefins margin side, we continue to expect robust margins on this on the back of high crude oil because the rest of the world is really dependent on olefin products that are produced from crude oil, of course, and we continue to see growing demand for olefin derivative products outside the U.S. So we're really -- in the past, the U.S. petchem market was fairly dependent on the U.S. economy, and it's really moved offshore right now in terms of what we're depending on. 
We, of course, cannot say much at all about the spin off of our E&P segment, to be known as WPX Energy. I can tell you that the recent S-1 filing is spot on with what we told you to expect at the last earnings call. I can also speak to the positive impact that we expect to see at WMB. WMB is going to be one of the top interviewed infrastructure companies in the nation, and it is going to be better-positioned than any that I'm aware of in delivering reliable growing dividends. 
It will be investment grade and it will have the power of the increasing incentive distribution rights of the Williams Partners GP, and this is going to allow for continued growth and free cash flows and providing -- those will be available for dividends without dilution or financing expenses at the WMB level. 
So the clear and transparent growth at WPZ should provide confidence regarding our continued ability to grow distributions at the PZ level, and we have already declared a 60% increase for the WMB June dividend, and are targeting a 10% to 15% increase in dividend for the June 2012 WMB dividend. And, of course, these targets were set before the latest increase in guidance at both PZ and MB. 
So overall, we're very excited about the amount of value we expect to generate in the foreseeable future for our WMB shareholders, and we really are sitting at the right place, at the right time, with the right assets, the right experience and a great financial position to rapidly expand our business' earnings power. And with that, we'll turn this over for questions."

I think the question was around the -- what we expect in terms of the increase for demand in the petchem space and recognizing the new announcements from Dow and Chevron, Philips and some of the new announced Formosa, some of the new announcements on the pet chem side.  We are -- and I think then another question around what we would do at Geismar. First of all, on the ethane side, I think that we're pleased to see the big petchems continuing to see the same opportunity we see in terms of being able to export ethylene derivative products and having a very low-cost feedstock here in the U.S. to continue to provide that. And so I think it's really going to be a matter of timing in terms of when those facilities come up versus when the ethane shows up. But I will tell you that it is going to take a lot of the ethane projects and ethane supplies aren't going to show up tomorrow either. There's a lot of infrastructure required to get that ethane in place as well. So I think it's going to be a matter of how those things show up. 
But on balance, it looks pretty good from our vantage point in terms of the demand picking up with the available supply. And I would tell you that there's also going to be a lot of interim small projects. We announced our own small project there that we had at Geismar. I think we spent $18 million and got a small, I think a 3,000 to 5,000-barrel a day increase in ethane demand there. And there's going to be a lot of those kind of projects that continue to come out and what used to be referred to as refinery tree. We're going to see in the petchem space as well because the margins are absolutely there, and so I think those short-term kind of increases that people can squeeze out of their facilities, they're going to be doing. So I think -- hopefully that answered your question. I apologize, we couldn't quite hear it on this end."

I will tell you that I would kind of put them into maybe 4 different baskets of opportunities up there. And if you'll look at our slides, I think it's Slide 18 in our package, you'll see there we've got some of the segment profit, first year segment profits of those projects versus the capital shown there. And you'll see, for instance, the first category I would put as an optimization project, like our BB splitter, and you'll see there that's about a 3x cash flow kind of project. We invested $52 million, and our range is $15 million to $20 million in segment profits for the first year there.  And so those kind of projects will be very high returns like that. The Boreal pipeline you'll see is quite a bit lower return, and part of that is just because we were building for capacity for the future, and all you see there is just the first-year volumes before these additional projects come on. But I would expect those kind of projects to be in the low teens kind of returns for those pipeline kind of projects. And then the upgrader projects, where we actually are going in and building new upgraders, will be a matter of negotiation but are driven by a very high propylene margins. So there's quite a bit of opportunity there for us to capture, and it really boils down to how much we share with the upgrader. And we're in very good competitive position there in that we've got the pipeline now and the fractionator there at Redwater. But those would be probably in the high teens kind of returns.  And then the ethane recovery project that we did with Nova, not going to comment on that in terms of where that return is, but you can see what we expect for our first-year profit on that versus the capital investment on that. And you'll see that's about a little  over a 5 multiple in terms of what we're getting from that project. So I think that gives you a pretty good range of our expectations in that area, and we're certainly anxious to get more of that business up there."

It really doesn't make any sense at all not to because it produces higher emissions in the air, which is obviously a critical issue as well. There's a tremendous amount of value being burnt there as that gas today is being consumed in boilers. So there's a real big opportunity to get that and then the real question just boils down to who gets it and extracts it. 
So I have great confidence in that yellow being captured. And I would just tell you, I think we are very well-positioned to capture that, and negotiations are ongoing on both fronts. I would tell you the CNRL negotiations are ahead of the Syncrude negotiations. That's about as much as I can care to share with you on that at this point."

That's actually a wet-tree spar that we're calling GulfStar project. I think there was an announcement that came out last week from Gulf Marine that mentioned they'd entered into an agreement with us to build a spar hole in the Gulf of Mexico, and that is correct. We have a letter of agreement signed with a couple of producers in the Gulf. We are not at liberty right now to reveal who those players are, but that is in place. The letter of agreement includes a reimbursement provision, so we can start spending money today on long lead-time items on major construction contracts and pipe contracts in anticipation of signing definitive agreements.  We're looking at probably a third quarter signing of those definitive agreements. So that is moving ahead. That would be our first GulfStar project. I think we mentioned the last call the connection pipeline, those are around $1 billion a piece. And on this particular project, we're looking at bringing in a JV partner, so I think in all the guidance numbers that we're giving, the capital is about half of that number. So that project has been in the works for a long time. We've been able to get much of the engineering, much of the design work and much of the critical thinking done on that product done ahead of time so that we're not parallel-pathing a lot of engineering and construction at the same time. So we think that's going to reduce a lot of the construction risk on that project, and we're very excited about that. So in terms of more details, though, as to the counterparties, that's probably going to be more of a third quarter type of announcement."

And I think we'll see that for the next couple of years. And again, as I mentioned, projects like our own at Geismar. And so I think we'll continue to see that, and then I think those big projects in the 3 to 4-year timeframe, those big projects will start to kick in. Some of those projects that have been announced are very large-scale projects and will take a long time. 
In between those 2 things, there's also going to be I think expansions to existing facilities that will be rather significant. And I think the current margin environment and the confidence in crude to gas right now is going to continue to have people investing in that space as well. And so I think it's rare that we have on the ethane and ethylene side, ethylene cracking, it's rare that we see the 2 things build at the same time. But because the margins in this environment, the margins are so strong in both spaces, I think we'll continue to see the ethane supplies build, and I think we'll continue to see the ethane cracking capabilities build as well.

And so, if I can just tell you folks that we continue to talk to and continue to work towards some structured arrangements like that are obviously very concerned about long-term supplies. And I think the effort that I think is the smart decision for the industry to look at is to look to the total pie between gas and crude, and that comes back to gas to polyethylene or other ethylene derivatives. And to figure out how they can assure themselves a portion of that margin that allows them to invest in infrastructure going forward that's got more stable earnings behind it, rather than a winner and a loser across that chain but figuring out how that margin can be shared in a way that allows both parties to invest going forward in a very adequate return that exists out there.  And I hope, I certainly think, that the current margin environment in both those sectors doesn't lead to arrogance that will cause people to forget the past.

That audio commentaries and slides are available on the website, and because of that review yesterday, we'll not be reviewing the slides again this morning. So on our website, williams.com, you should be able to find a number of things that were posted yesterday afternoon. First, the earnings presentation with the audio commentary by Alan. Second, the data book that contains the usual information we make available every quarter. Third, the press release of the first quarter results. Fourth, our analyst package. And finally, a pod cast of Alan's remarks yesterday. 
Also for your information, the first quarter 10-Q will be filed today. Because we reviewed these items yesterday, I expect the call today will be very brief and we'll get very quickly to your questions. In a minute, Alan Armstrong, our President and CEO, will make some general comments, after which we'll open the lines for questions. 
Be aware, as always, all of our business unit heads are here and available to respond to your questions after Alan's remarks. Here with me are Ralph Hill, who heads up the E&P Company; Rory Miller, who oversees the Midstream Company; and Randy Bernard, who heads up the gas pipeline. Also, Don Chappel, the CFO is here as well. 
As most of you are aware, last Friday we announced that our wholly owned subsidiary, WPX Energy, Inc., filed a registration statement related to the proposed IPO of its common stock. Because of security law restrictions, we will not be commenting at all on WPX Energy Inc. today. 
There are forward-looking statements on Slide 2 and 3 and disclaimer on oil and gas reserves on Slide 4 of yesterday's presentation. Those are also included in the data book. They're important and integral to the company and you should review those. 
Also, there are non-GAAP numbers included in these various presentations. Those have all been reconciled back to generally accepted accounting principles and their reconciliation schedules are also available. So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan."

Good morning and thanks for joining us this morning. I'll just very briefly capture the highlights and key notes on what was put out as a recording yesterday and is in the slide material. First of all, we're very excited to tell you we're raising g",1129,"Great. Good morning and thanks for joining us this morning. I'll just very briefly capture the highlights and key notes on what was put out as a recording yesterday and is in the slide material. First of all, we're very excited to tell you we're raising guidance, and this is based on both higher crude price expectations. We are now at $95 midpoint for '11 and '12 crude. And of course, that's still well below the hoard market and current pricing for crude. And current NGL margins, of course, are being lifted on that. And in fact, current NGL margins are actually just beyond the high end of range of what we have posted right now. 
Also, we have greater confidence on timing and performance on a number of new projects that are going to add to the balance in 2011. So we are raising guidance for both '11 and '12, and you can see the details of that. We're now at a -- our midpoint for '11 is now $1.55 per share on an adjusted earnings basis. 
In the current quarter, we had mixed results to combine and produce a very solid quarter. Our gas gathering production volumes were negatively impacted by severe winter weather, primarily in the Rockies and in the Bakken, with the Bakken receiving near record snowfalls. And of course, low natural gas prices also grows low quarter-over-quarter results in E&P. 
However, our Midstream Canada and Olefins segment came through and posted a record quarter that helped to mitigate the weakness in the gas prices. And our Gas Pipe segment also came through with a strong quarter. 
As we look into the second quarter, we are very excited about how our volumes have rebounded and conditions are currently very good for tremendous earnings results for the balance of 2011. Looking to the balance of the year, we now expect our midpoint, as I stated earlier, EPS to be $1.55. And we're going to hit now just some of the key factors that we expect to drive this even better performance for the balance of the year. 
First of all, our operating volumes have really rebounded in all of our areas. We expect the balance of the year to be much better as the fruits of our labor in both the Marcellus and the Bakken begin to take hold both on the E&P side and in the Marcellus on the WPZ Midstream side. Also, we had some major maintenance to get through in the first quarter at our big Opal Plant, which is the largest single contributor to our NGL equity volumes. 
Secondly, new projects that we are expecting. First of all, Perdido Norte project really will be a powerful contributor to earnings in the last half of the year and not so really dependent on permitting out there as much as some continued topside work that Shell is doing on their big platform that feeds both our oil gathering, our gas gathering and our Markham processing plant that -- and of all those facilities serving the Western Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. So we're really looking forward to seeing those volumes start to ramp up and we have confidence in that happening for the balance of the year. 
Also, our Transco Pipeline just recently placed into service 2 new projects that will combine to generate over $30 million in additional profits for the balance of the year. And then finally the Marcellus, which is really infrastructure constrained on many fronts right now, will benefit from a lot of work that E&P did in getting a lot of small gathering systems in the field to serve new production in those areas as well as the laser pipeline, which -- and our very own Springville lateral, which we expect to begin in the third quarter. So a lot of things going on in the Marcellus, on the infrastructure front, some of which will directly impact our production and, of course, others that will drive earnings at the WPZ level. 
Third, on margins. We anticipate continued strong unit NGL margins and olefins margins. Our current forecast in margins for NGLs are really below what we are currently experiencing, and if you've noticed, we've really seen a nice shift up in ethane and as well as the heavier products continue to provide really record level margins. 
However, we also know that things can change pretty fast in this arena, so we are only raising our oil prices assumption to $95 and, we are holding back on our NGL crude ratio assumptions below what we're currently experiencing. 
On the olefins margin side, we continue to expect robust margins on this on the back of high crude oil because the rest of the world is really dependent on olefin products that are produced from crude oil, of course, and we continue to see growing demand for olefin derivative products outside the U.S. So we're really -- in the past, the U.S. petchem market was fairly dependent on the U.S. economy, and it's really moved offshore right now in terms of what we're depending on. 
We, of course, cannot say much at all about the spinoff of our E&P segment, to be known as WPX Energy. I can tell you that the recent S-1 filing is spot on with what we told you to expect at the last earnings call. I can also speak to the positive impact that we expect to see at WMB. WMB is going to be one of the top interviewed infrastructure companies in the nation, and it is going to be better-positioned than any that I'm aware of in delivering reliable growing dividends. 
It will be investment grade and it will have the power of the increasing incentive distribution rights of the Williams Partners GP, and this is going to allow for continued growth and free cash flows and providing -- those will be available for dividends without dilution or financing expenses at the WMB level. 
So the clear and transparent growth at WPZ should provide confidence regarding our continued ability to grow distributions at the PZ level, and we have already declared a 60% increase for the WMB June dividend, and are targeting a 10% to 15% increase in dividend for the June 2012 WMB dividend. And, of course, these targets were set before the latest increase in guidance at both PZ and MB. 
So overall, we're very excited about the amount of value we expect to generate in the foreseeable future for our WMB shareholders, and we really are sitting at the right place, at the right time, with the right assets, the right experience and a great financial position to rapidly expand our business' earnings power. And with that, we'll turn this over for questions."

We are -- and I think then another question around what we would do at Geismar. First of all, on the ethane side, I think that we're pleased to see the big petchems continuing to see the same opportunity we see in terms of being able to export ethylene derivative products and having a very low-cost feedstock here in the U.S. to continue to provide that. And so I think it's really going to be a matter of timing in terms of when those facilities come up versus when the ethane shows up. But I will tell you that it is going to take a lot of the ethane projects and ethane supplies aren't going to show up tomorrow either. There's a lot of infrastructure required to get that ethane in place as well. So I think it's going to be a matter of how those things show up. 
But on balance, it looks pretty good from our vantage point in terms of the demand picking up with the available supply. And I would tell you that there's also going to be a lot of interim small projects. We announced our own small project there that we had at Geismar. I think we spent $18 million and got a small, I think a 3,000 to 5,000-barrel a day increase in ethane demand there. And there's going to be a lot of those kind of projects that continue to come out and what used to be referred to as refinery tree. We're going to see in the petchem space as well because the margins are absolutely there, and so I think those short-term kind of increases that people can squeeze out of their facilities, they're going to be doing. So I think -- hopefully that answered your question. I apologize, we couldn't quite hear it on this end."

And you'll see, for instance, the first category I would put as an optimization project, like our BB splitter, and you'll see there that's about a 3x cash flow kind of project. We invested $52 million, and our range is $15 million to $20 million in segment profits for the first year there.  And so those kind of projects will be very high returns like that. The Boreal pipeline you'll see is quite a bit lower return, and part of that is just because we were building for capacity for the future, and all you see there is just the first-year volumes before these additional projects come on.

So there's quite a bit of opportunity there for us to capture, and it really boils down to how much we share with the upgrader. And we're in very good competitive position there in that we've got the pipeline now and the fractionator there at Redwater. But those would be probably in the high teens kind of returns.  And then the ethane recovery project that we did with Nova, not going to comment on that in terms of where that return is, but you can see what we expect for our first-year profit on that versus the capital investment on that. And you'll see that's about a little  over a 5 multiple in terms of what we're getting from that project. So I think that gives you a pretty good range of our expectations in that area, and we're certainly anxious to get more of that business up there."

A lot of the upgrade in our guidance is related to very strong commodity price, and we certainly don't count on that when we set WPC distribution and count on that for our Williams' dividends. So we really look at a much lower price margin environment as we think about WPC distributions and the Williams' dividend. So that would really guide our thinking, but even at that level, I think the 10% to 15% that we provided for guidance in '12 and strong growth beyond is still, we believe, is a conservative view of what we can accomplish. So we'll continue to look at it. We certainly appreciate that our stock price will, in large part, be driven by our ability to pay an increase of dividend, and we'll remain very focused on that.

There's a tremendous amount of value being burnt there as that gas today is being consumed in boilers.

So I have great confidence in that yellow being captured. And I would just tell you, I think we are very well-positioned to capture that, and negotiations are ongoing on both fronts.

That's actually a wet-tree spar that we're calling GulfStar project. I think there was an announcement that came out last week from Gulf Marine that mentioned they'd entered into an agreement with us to build a spar hole in the Gulf of Mexico, and that is correct. We have a letter of agreement signed with a couple of producers in the Gulf. We are not at liberty right now to reveal who those players are, but that is in place. The letter of agreement includes a reimbursement provision, so we can start spending money today on long lead-time items on major construction contracts and pipe contracts in anticipation of signing definitive agreements.  We're looking at probably a third quarter signing of those definitive agreements. So that is moving ahead. That would be our first GulfStar project. I think we mentioned the last call the connection pipeline, those are around $1 billion a piece. And on this particular project, we're looking at bringing in a JV partner, so I think in all the guidance numbers that we're giving, the capital is about half of that number. So that project has been in the works for a long time. We've been able to get much of the engineering, much of the design work and much of the critical thinking done on that product done ahead of time so that we're not parallel-pathing a lot of engineering and construction at the same time.

And I think we'll see that for the next couple of years. And again, as I mentioned, projects like our own at Geismar. And so I think we'll continue to see that, and then I think those big projects in the 3 to 4-year timeframe, those big projects will start to kick in. Some of those projects that have been announced are very large-scale projects and will take a long time. 
In between those 2 things, there's also going to be I think expansions to existing facilities that will be rather significant. And I think the current margin environment and the confidence in crude to gas right now is going to continue to have people investing in that space as well. And so I think it's rare that we have on the ethane and ethylene side, ethylene cracking, it's rare that we see the 2 things build at the same time. But because the margins in this environment, the margins are so strong in both spaces, I think we'll continue to see the ethane supplies build, and I think we'll continue to see the ethane cracking capabilities build as well.

And I think the effort that I think is the smart decision for the industry to look at is to look to the total pie between gas and crude, and that comes back to gas to polyethylene or other ethylene derivatives. And to figure out how they can assure themselves a portion of that margin that allows them to invest in infrastructure going forward that's got more stable earnings behind it, rather than a winner and a loser across that chain but figuring out how that margin can be shared in a way that allows both parties to invest going forward in a very adequate return that exists out there.

We certainly did experience a great second quarter. Our adjusted earnings per share was up 39%. We are increasing our full year earnings outlook and based on the strength of the first and second quarter and all of our business segments contributed to the gains that we had in this period. 
While all our business segments are performing very well and growing according to plans, we also continue to work hard on restructurings at the corporate level to unlock value for our shareholders. As you're well aware, our WPX IPO, which I'll comment on in just a moment, continues to move ahead. And we are moving to a growing dividend company and expect that value to unlock significant shareholder value for WMB. Our WPZ Holdings and our Canadian midstream olefins give us a very clear line of sight to this sustainable growth for the WMB dividends for years to come. 
We continue to be very focused on maintaining our investment grade credit and maintaining a very conservative approach to managing our margins within our WPZ segment. And this gives us a very clear growth trajectory and also gives us a very clear backlog. We have a very clear backlog of the great projects and we're very excited about for our future. So we've got great situations. We sit here today and we also have great transparency about where our growth is coming. So we really continue to be very excited about how we're positioned today in these markets. 
And so, before taking your questions though, I do want to briefly address our previously announced proposal to acquire Southern Union Company. At this time, Williams continues to monitor the situation and we are evaluating all of our options.  We won't have any further comments today regarding Southern Union or the agreement they have with Energy Transfer. 
I also have a few brief comments about our planned IPO of WPX Energy. We are ready to go with the WPX Energy IPO so as soon as market conditions are corporate it, we will be prepared to launch that.  At this point, we still plan to get the IPO done in the third quarter and full spend no later than the first quarter of 2012. 
So as a reminder though, the purpose of our call today is to discuss our very strong financial and operational performance in the second quarter and our new higher guidance for 2011. We intend to keep today's call focused on those topics, and so I appreciate your cooperation on that.
We can now open the call for questions. Operator?"

And so, I don't think we're anywhere near that kind of ratio that we would get to that. We have seen situations where gas oil is at times pricing below ethane a little bit. But it's got a long ways to go. If people started getting on that, it would bring that price up pretty quickly as well. So I don't really see that in this, in the $80 price oil environments and $4 gas. That's still a 20 ratio which used to be something that we wouldn't even dream of. And so, I think we're a long ways from getting to a point where ethane is not the favorite feedstock."

The geography there is obviously not flat anywhere across the basin. There's a lot of farming, a lot of human interaction in almost every mile of pipe you build. And so the other thing I would add too around permitting is you have to deal with the townships there as well. So there's another level of permitting that you have to go through, which adds some complexity to it. The area in general has not seen the kind of activity that you're seeing now, ever. And so, there is a lot of change in the rules, if you will, that adds complexity as well. So it has been a challenge I think over the last 2 years. We certainly perfected our model around how to execute significantly. But nevertheless, things are moving more slowly than we would like. I think it's the same on the producer side as well. Everything is a little more challenging to do in Pennsylvania than it is, say, in the highlands of Wyoming. So it is a challenge, and we think we're making good progress on it. But nevertheless, there's some slippage. It's not any indication of the quality of wells or the success up there, which has been phenomenal so far, particularly up in the Northeast area, all of the performances exceeded what we had in our plans. So we're delighted with the quality of wells, but construction is the top spot. On Springville, we got all our major permits at hand that we need to get that pipeline built. We're under construction right now, we're clearing right away we've got the major we're going on the compressor stations. We have all of our permits in hand  for our major bores that we got to do, some waterways and some roads. So everything that's on a critical path right now, we have a permit in hand for.

But I do think that you'd have people checking and doublechecking it if we went into another recession like we were in before, there's no much doubt in my mind that, that would be the case. Whether there is ample frac-ing capacity to clear the fractionation capacity that's being built right now, I think it's a pretty complex question. Clearly, the NGL space is building up very rapidly. And there is going to have to be some cracking capacity built to consume that. And so I think it's a great question. I think it's a little early to call that, but given the very near-term events we're seeing."

Thank you all very much for joining us. Again, very excited about our second quarter. We continue to be very confident in the balance of '11 and '12 and beyond, given the transparency that we have to a lot of great projects that we think the fundamentals remain very sound on. And while we didn't hear too much question about the current NGL market today, we can tell you that we remain very confident in the margins as they exist today, partially because of how high the margin's got at the end of the second quarter and into the third quarter, how high they've been. We've got plenty of room for that to slip down and still be maintaining our guidance. So we really haven't seen the degradation in that market here in the last couple of days that you might be expecting. So we remain very confident about both the third quarter and through the balance of the year, and excited about the growth in our businesses and the way those are all executing. And very proud of the way this organization is executing on both running the business, and as well as doing things like preparing for the IPO of WPX Energy. So great efforts around here and great results to show for it. So again, thank you very much for joining us this morning."

We certainly did experience a great second quarter. Our adjusted earnings per share was up 39%. We are increasing our full year earnings outlook based on the strength of the first and second quarter, and all of our business segments contributed to the gains that we had in this period. 
While all our business segments are performing very well and growing according to plans, we also continue to work hard on restructurings at the corporate level to unlock value for our shareholders. As you're well aware, our WPX IPO, which I'll comment on in just a moment, continues to move ahead. And we are moving to a growing dividend company and expect that value to unlock significant shareholder value for WMB. Our WPZ Holdings and our Canadian midstream olefins give us a very clear line of sight to this sustainable growth for the WMB dividends for years to come. 
We continue to be very focused on maintaining our investment grade credit and maintaining a very conservative approach to managing our margins within our WPZ segment. And this gives us a very clear growth trajectory and also gives us a very clear backlog. We have a very clear backlog of the great projects and we're very excited about for our future. So we've got great situations. We sit here today and we also have great transparency about where our growth is coming from. So we really continue to be very excited about how we're positioned today in these markets. 
And so, before taking your questions though, I do want to briefly address our previously announced proposal to acquire Southern Union Company. But this time, Williams continues to closely monitor the situation and we are evaluating all of our options.  We won't have any further comments today regarding Southern Union or the agreement they have with Energy Transfer. 
I also have a few brief comments about our planned IPO of WPX Energy. We are ready to go with the WPX Energy IPO so as soon as market conditions are cooperative, we will be prepared to launch that.  At this point, we still plan to get the IPO done in the third quarter and full spin no later than the first quarter of 2012. 
So as a reminder though, the purpose of our call today is to discuss our very strong financial and operational performance in the second quarter and our new higher guidance for 2011. We intend to keep today's call focused on those topics, and so I appreciate your cooperation on that.
We can now open the call for questions. Operator?"

The geography there is obviously not flat anywhere across the basin. There's a lot of farming, a lot of human interaction in almost every mile of pipe you build. And so the other thing I would add too around permitting is you have to deal with the townships there as well. So there's another level of permitting that you have to go through, which adds some complexity to it. The area in general has not seen the kind of activity that you're seeing now, ever. And so, there is a lot of change in the rules, if you will, that adds complexity as well. So it has been a challenge I think over the last 2 years. We certainly perfected our model around how to execute significantly. But nevertheless, things are moving more slowly than we would like. I think it's the same on the producer side as well. Everything is a little more challenging to do in Pennsylvania than it is, say, in the highlands of Wyoming. So it is a challenge, and we think we're making good progress on it. But nevertheless, there's some slippage. It's not any indication of the quality of wells or the success up there, which has been phenomenal so far, particularly up in the Northeast area, all of the performances exceeded what we had in our plans. So we're delighted with the quality of wells, but construction is the top spot. On Springville, we got all our major permits at hand that we need to get that pipeline built. We're under construction right now, we're clearing right away we've got the major we're going on the compressor stations. We have all of our permits in hand  for our major bores that we got to do, some waterways and some roads. So everything that's on a critical path right now, we have a permit in hand for. So that's moving nicely. We do have a couple of minor issues we're working out on the tie and point to Transco, and we're confident that going to be resolved shortly."

But I do think that you'd have people checking and doublechecking if we went into another recession like we were in before, there's no much doubt in my mind that, if that would be the case. Whether there is ample frac-ing capacity to clear the fractionation capacity that's being built right now, I think it's a pretty complex question. Clearly, the NGL space is building up very rapidly. And there is going to have to be some cracking capacity built to consume that. And so I think it's a great question.

We certainly did experience a great second quarter. Our adjusted earnings per share was up 39%. We are increasing our full year earnings outlook based on the strength of the first and second quarter, and all of our business segments contributed to the gains that we had in this period. 
While all our business segments are performing very well and growing according to plans, we also continue to work hard on restructurings at the corporate level to unlock value for our shareholders. As you're well aware, our WPX IPO, which I'll comment on in just a moment, continues to move ahead. And we are moving to a growing dividend company and expect that value to unlock significant shareholder value for WMB. Our WPZ Holdings and our Canadian midstream olefins give us a very clear line of sight to this sustainable growth for the WMB dividends for years to come. 
We continue to be very focused on maintaining our investment grade credit and maintaining a very conservative approach to managing our margins within our WPZ segment. And this gives us a very clear growth trajectory and also gives us a very clear backlog. We have a very clear backlog of the great projects and we're very excited about for our future. So we've got great situations. We sit here today and we also have great transparency about where our growth is coming from. So we really continue to be very excited about how we're positioned today in these markets. 
And so, before taking your questions though, I do want to briefly address our previously announced proposal to acquire Southern Union Company. But this time, Williams continues to closely monitor the situation and we are evaluating all of our options.  We won't have any further comments today regarding Southern Union or the agreement they have with Energy Transfer. 
I also have a few brief comments about our planned IPO of WPX Energy. We are ready to go with the WPX Energy IPO so as soon as market conditions are cooperative, we will be prepared to launch that.  At this point, we still plan to get the IPO done in the third quarter and full spin no later than the first quarter of 2012. 
So as a reminder though, the purpose of our call today is to discuss our very strong financial and operational performance in the second quarter and our new higher guidance for 2011. We intend to keep today's call focused on those topics, and so I appreciate your cooperation on that.

The geography there is obviously not flat anywhere across the basin. There's a lot of farming, a lot of human interaction in almost every mile of pipe you build. And so the other thing I would add too around permitting is you have to deal with the townships there as well. So there's another level of permitting that you have to go through, which adds some complexity to it. The area in general has not seen the kind of activity that they’re seeing now, ever. And so, there is a lot of change in the rules, if you will, that adds complexity as well. So it has been a challenge I think over the last 2 years. We certainly perfected our model around how to execute significantly. But nevertheless, things are moving more slowly than we would like. I think it's the same on the producer side as well. Everything is a little more challenging to do in Pennsylvania than it is, say, in the highlands of Wyoming. So it is a challenge, and we think we're making good progress on it. But nevertheless, there's some slippage. It's not any indication of the quality of wells or the success up there, which has been phenomenal so far, particularly up in the Northeast area, all of the performances exceeded what we had in our plans. So we're delighted with the quality of wells, but the construction is the top spot. On Springville, we got all our major permits at hand that we need to get that pipeline built. We're under construction right now. We're clearing right away. We've got the major work going on the compressor stations. We have all of our permits in hand for our major bores that we got to do, some waterways and some roads. So everything that's on a critical path right now, we have a permit in hand for it. So that's moving nicely. We do have a couple of minor issues we're working out on the tie and point to Transco, but we're confident that going to be resolved shortly."

I would just say, first of all, that the market that all of the new olefin capacity is being built for in North America is not focused in North American markets. It's focused at exports.

So I do think that obviously, a continued downturn in the economy would have some people backing up. As Rory said, we think we are first in the queue there, so to speak with our planned expansion. But I do think that you'd have people checking and double-checking if we went into another recession like we were in before. There's not much doubt in my mind that, that would be the case. Whether there is ample frac-ing capacity to clear the fractionation capacity that's being built right now, I think it's a pretty complex question. Clearly, the NGL space is building up very rapidly. And there is going to have to be some cracking capacity built to consume that. And so I think it's a great question.

Really across-the-board, the -- certainly the Bakken's kicking in for E&P. The Perdido Norte project really start to pick up volumes and help to fill up our markup facility and as well as our Echo Springs facility that's now just had its 1 year anniversary of the new train being built there. We actually hit a record in the corner of 41,000 barrels a day and are now operating a little over that. So you should expect to see more of this to come as these projects that we've been investing in continue to kick in. Finally, our business really is perfectly positioned to reap the benefits of this U.S. turning to natural gas. I think you're going to continue to hear more and more about that. Our infrastructure will be very well positioned to help arbitrage the tremendous spent between natural gas and oil-based products and as well is positioned there to provide services to get natural gas into the clinical markets and flight critical access. We're certainly starting to see a lot of strains on the infrastructure and some of the growing basins like the Marcellus where infrastructure has become critical to getting the production on.

So on our website, williams.com, you should be able to find a number of things that were posted yesterday afternoon. The earnings presentation with audio commentary and a podcast by Alan, the data book that contains our usual information we make available each quarter, the press release of our third quarter results, and our analyst package. Also for your information, the third quarter 10-Q has been filed as well. Because we had commentary yesterday, this morning's call will be fairly brief. I know there are a number of other companies hosting called this morning, so we'll go quickly to your questions so this call should be fairly short.
In a minute, Alan Armstrong, our President and CEO, will make some brief comments, after which, we'll open the lines for questions. Be aware, as always, all of our business units heads are here and are available to respond to questions after Alan's remarks. Here with me today are Ralph Hill, who heads E&P Company; Rory Miller, who oversees Midstream; and Randy Barnard who heads our Gas Pipelines. Also, Don Chappel, our CFO, is here and available.
On yesterday's presentation, there were forward-looking statements on Slide #2 and 3 and the disclaimer, oil and gas reserves on Slide #4. Those also included in our data book. Those are important and integral to the company, so you should review those. There are also non-GAAP numbers included in various presentations. Those have been reconciled back to generally accepted accounting principles. Those reconciliation skids are also available and follow all of our presentations.

First of all, a great quarter, solid performance, and significant growth in all of our segments. And certainly, we're excited that our continued better-than-expected cash flows in our infrastructure business have now provided us with the option to go directly to a spin without an IPO, if we don't see the markets because more stable and supportive of IPO.
In the quarter, certainly you started to see the benefit of a lot of our projects, that we've invested in the last couple of years, really starting to kick in. Really, across-the-board, the -- certainly, the Bakken's kicking in for E&P. The Perdido Norte project really start to pick up volumes and help to fill up our Markham facility, and as well, our Echo Springs facility that's now -- just had its 1-year anniversary of the new train being built there. We actually hit a record in the quarter of 41,000 barrels a day and are now operating a little over that. So you should expect to see more of this to come as these projects that we've been investing in continue to kick in. Finally, our business really is perfectly positioned to reap the benefits of this U.S. turning to natural gas. I think you're going to continue to hear more and more about that. Our infrastructure will be very well positioned to help arbitrage, the tremendous spread between natural gas and oil-based products, and as well, is positioned there to provide services to get natural gas into the critical markets and provide critical access. We're certainly starting to see a lot of strains on the infrastructure in some of the growing basins like the Marcellus, where infrastructure has become critical to getting the production on. So we're very excited about where we're positioned right now and excited to talk to, about -- to you, about the quarter. So with that, I'll turn it over for questions."

So while there are cost pressures, since we were so new to basin, we feel we've really started to overcome a lot of those, and as that model kicks in, we'll continue to driver our cost down. So there is a lot pressure up there, no doubt. But we feel, with our relationships with our vendors and our alliances with them, we'll be in good shape."

As you no doubt know, we released our results yesterday afternoon after the market closed. Also yesterday, Alan, using a few slides, had some commentary about our results, the new guidance and growth opportunities. That audio commentary and the slides are available on the website. So on our website, williams.com, you should be able to find a number of things that were posted yesterday afternoon. The earnings presentation with audio commentary and a podcast by Alan, the data book that contains our usual information we make available each quarter, the press release of our third quarter results and our analyst package. Also for your information, the third quarter 10-Q has been filed as well. Because we had commentary yesterday, this morning's call will be fairly brief. I know there are a number of other companies hosting called this morning, so we'll go quickly to your questions so this call should be fairly short.
In a minute Alan Armstrong, our President and CEO, will make some brief comments, after which we'll open the lines for questions. Be aware, as always, all of our business units heads are here and are available to respond to questions after Alan's remarks. Here with me today are Ralph Hill, who heads E&P Company; Rory Miller, who oversees Midstream; and Randy Barnard who heads our Gas Pipelines. Also, Don Chappel, our CFO, is here and available.
On yesterday's presentation, there were forward-looking statements on Slide #2 and #3 and the disclaimer, oil and gas reserves on Slide #4. Those also included in our data book. Those are important and integral to the company, so you should review those. There are also non-GAAP numbers included in various presentations. Those have been reconciled back to generally accepted accounting principles. Those reconciliation skids are also available and follow all of our presentations. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan."

First of all a great quarter, solid performance and significant growth in all of our segments. And certainly, we're excited that our continued better-than-expected cash flows in our infrastructure business have now provided us with the option to go directly to a spin without an IPO, if we don't see the markets become more stable and supportive of IPO.
In the quarter, certainly you started to see the benefit of a lot of our projects that we've invested in the last couple of years really starting to kick in. Really across-the-board, the -- certainly, the Bakken's kicking in for E&P. The Perdido Norte project really starting to pick up volumes and help to fill up our Markham facility and as well, our Echo Springs facility that's now just had its 1-year anniversary of the new train being built there. We actually hit a record in the quarter of 41,000 barrels a day and are now operating a little over that. So you should expect to see more of this to come as these projects we've been investing in continue to kick in. Finally, our business really is perfectly positioned to reap the benefits of this U.S. turning to natural gas. I think you're going to continue to hear more and more about that. Our infrastructure will be very well positioned to help arbitrage, the tremendous spread between natural gas and oil-based products and as well, is positioned there to provide services to get natural gas into the critical markets and provide critical access. We're certainly starting to see a lot of strains on the infrastructure in some of the growing basins like the Marcellus, where infrastructure has become critical to getting the production on. So we're very excited about where we're positioned right now and excited to talk to about -- to you about the quarter. So with that, I'll turn it over for questions."

Welcome to our fourth quarter 2010 earnings call. As always, thank you for the interest in our company.
Initially, I would mention that on our website, www.williams.com, you should be able to find a number of things: First, the few slides that we will be talking from this morning; second, the data book that contains the usual information we make available each quarter; and finally, three press releases. First, separation release that we issued last evening. Second, the reported fourth quarter results. And third, our year-end oil and gas reserves. Now the last two were issued this morning.
In a minute, Alan Armstrong, our President and CEO, will review the few slides we have this morning. Be aware though that as always, all of our business units heads are here and are available to respond to questions after Alan's remarks.
Here with me are Ralph Hill, who heads the E&P company; Rory Miller, who recently took over the reins of the midstream company; and Phil Wright, who heads our Gas Pipelines.
Also, you certainly saw the notice that Phil will be taking another role in the company later this month and Randy Bernard is going to lead the Gas Pipelines and he's with us as well. Also, Don Chappel, the CFO is here as well.
As most of you are aware, yesterday, we announced our plan to separate our E&P business to a partial IPO and a subsequent spinoff of our remaining ownership interest. Alan will make brief remarks about this plan during his comments. But because of security law restrictions, we will not be commenting further or taking any questions on the E&P separation during this call. I will direct your attention to the press release that went out yesterday.
At the beginning of the slide deck are the forward-looking statements on Slide Number 2 and Number 3. And the disclaimer on oil and gas reserves on Slide Number 4. Those are important and integral to the remarks, so please review those.
Also included are various non-GAAP numbers that have been reconciled back to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those schedules are available and follow the presentation.
With that, I'll turn it over to Alan."

Good morning, and I'll start here on Slide 5.
I'm certainly pleased you have joined us for our call this morning and to hear about a strong finish to 2010 and an exciting future for Williams shareholders.
Our management and board have worked diligently over the last couple of months analyzing the best path to unlock shareholder value while maintaining growth platforms for the future.
As Travis mentioned, we will not be able to provide details of the transactions or forward-looking perspectives of the new E&P company. Despite this restriction, we have plenty of exciting information to share with you about WMB's 2010 performance and the growth drivers for the future.
I'm also pleased to inform you that we exceeded our earlier guidance range for earnings per share, and we are raising guidance for 2011 and 2012.
And with that, I'll move on to Slide 6. As we announced yesterday, our board has given us the green light to pursue the creation of a separate E&P company, starting with a partial IPO in the third quarter of 2011, and then a planned spinoff for the remaining interest to our shareholders in 2012.
WMB would use the IPO proceeds to pay down corporate debt, and we would expect to maintain investment-grade credit ratings at the WMB and WPZ. I would refer you to the press releases from the three credit rating agencies that rate our debt that came out shortly after our announcement yesterday if you'd like to know their perspectives in more detail.
This new structure enables WMB to initiate a high dividend strategy. We are announcing a 60% increase, starting with quarterly payout in June of 2011, going from $0.0125 to $0.20 per quarter, and we are targeting an additional 10% to 15% increase in June of 2012.
Both of these actions are a direct response to hearing from our shareholders and gathering thoughts over the last, actually, several years in terms of thinking about how we can increase shareholder value. So we're pleased to be reporting this to you this morning.
WMB and WPZ will be focused on meeting robust demand for new infrastructure that helps our customers and our nation take advantage of North America's abundant natural resources. As you will see, we have lot of new infrastructure being built and plan to do just that.
Moving on to Slide 7. Our full year financial results were boosted by a very strong fourth quarter. Our adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was up 60% over the same quarter in 2009. This drove our adjusted EPS from continuing operations for 2010 to $1.28 per share, and that is 36% higher than our 2009 level of $0.94.
As you know, our full year GAAP was heavily impacted by non-cash impairment charges in the third quarter, and we had significant cost related to the WPZ and WMZ merger and the related debt restructurings required for that transaction.
For the year, we are ending up at a GAAP loss of $1.1 billion. And on an adjusted basis, net income was $760 million, which was up 38% over the same number for 2009.
I won't spend much time here on the reserves since we provide some great graphics here on the next couple of slides that I'll explain the reserves with.
And moving into Slide 8. You can see here starting with the left-hand side, you can see our year-end 2009 reserves, and you can see the various adjustments that get us to our 2010 U.S. reserves, then we add in the international reserves from Apco. And then finally, you see the adjusted total reserves as we look at what it would mean if we looked at a total of seven years of reserves to get to.
So our net proved reserves held strong with 107% reserve replacement ratio, but did not move up radically, predominantly due to the new SEC five-year limit rule under which we reclassified about 250 Bcf of proved reserves to probable in the Piceance due to reducing the pace of drilling in a lower-price environment and no longer being able to get to all previously amounts within the five years.
This in no way means we can't or don't expect to get to those reserves, just reclassification under the SEC rules.
If you look at our net other additions and revisions, we added 528 Bcf through our drilling program in which we spent $984 million in the E&P development capital. So this equates to, in 2010, a finding cost of $1.86.
We ended the year at 4.3 Tcf of domestic proved. And adding additional international you can see raises that to 4.5 Tcf. We've also identified an additional 353 Bcf of reserves that could be classified as proved, if we were allowed to add two more years of development. In other words, seven years of development instead of being limited to five.
Under this alternative view of how we would've looked at things before the SEC five-year rule was imposed, our adjusted proved reserves would have grown to more than 4.8 Tcf.
Moving on to Slide 9. You can see a big move here on our 3P reserves. And moving from about 14.8 Tcf to just under 16 Tcf, and this was driven predominantly by our undeveloped leasehold, acquisitions in both the Marcellus Shale and the Bakken Oil Play.
And our drilling programs are now well-diversified among some of the most economically attractive plays in the country, including the Marcellus Shale, the Bakken Oil and the Piceance tight sands done the Williams' way.
Moving on to 10. Here, as mentioned earlier, we had a 60% increase in adjusted net income for the quarter. In addition, our teams worked tirelessly to close a stunning amount of transactions in the quarter as listed here.
We also saw our NGL production rebound tremendously in the fourth quarter after a difficult third quarter. And this represented a record for our WPZ operations. This was driven by the startup of our new Echo Springs plant but was partially offset by the sale of our Cameron Meadows plant in the fourth quarter of 2009.
As you can see, the two large acquisitions done by WPZ are large fee-based deals, with little or no direct commodity exposure. And as we've commented a lot in the past, we continue to try to take advantage when we see good fee-based opportunities to continue to steady the incomes of our WPZ investments.
The scale that we brought to WPZ through our restructuring in the first quarter of 2010 enabled us to perform these large transactions without straining our balance sheet. So we really were able to really prove the value of our WPZ transaction in a very large way in the fourth quarter of '10.
And speaking of that, moving on here to Slide 11, the Bakken acquisition is a great example of the fruits that our WPZ restructuring brought forth. The drop-down of the Piceance gathering system that WPZ enabled this exciting $925 million acquisition.
Nothing new on the slide, but we have now updated guidance to include it. And other than the weather this time [ph] of the year in North Dakota, we are very pleased about our large entry in the Bakken and Three Forks oil play in North Dakota.
We closed the transaction on December 21, and we have three rigs running there. And certainly, in the process of getting our teams assembled and getting a lot of the great experience that we have around the organization zeroed in on the opportunities in the Bakken.
Moving on to Slide 12. A lot of exciting things going on here in the Marcellus, and almost too much to mention. But I'll take a stab at it here. Our Transco [Transcontinental] Gas Pipeline group announced recently that it executed agreements with three shippers that fully subscribed in Northeast Supply Link project on a long-term basis. These shippers included Hess, Anadarko and Williams Gas Marketing.
The Northeast Supply Link project is a proposed expansion of the Transco Pipeline System that will provide about 250,000 dekatherms per day of incremental firm transportation capacity from Marcellus Shale supplies into Station 210 pooling point in New Jersey and even all the way into existing New York City delivery points.
Williams expects to submit its first application by the end of the year, and subject to perk [perquisites] approval, the budget will be placed in the service in November 2013. This is a really exciting project for us because it shows the way our Midstream business can work with the Gas Pipeline business. The largest customer commitment for this Transco project is coming from Midstream’s 33-mile Springville lateral interconnect, that is to be completed now in July of 2011.
The midstream efforts in both Northeast Pennsylvania and Southwest Pennsylvania are expected to enable the gathering of 2 Bcf per day in 2013 and 2.75 Bcf per day in 2015. So we're very excited to see the way things are growing there in both the midstream area, the gas pipe area and as well, the E&P area.
Notes on the E&P, we continue to see improving well results. Our Clearfield County, Alder Run wells are online at 2 million to 4 million cubic feet per day each. And we are in the process of completing a 3D seismic acquisition for Susquehanna and Westmoreland counties and the center in Clearfield County shoot will begin very quickly. Progress towards building out the permit inventory, adding staff and vendors and contractors continue there as well.
Moving on to Slide 13. Here we show our commodity price assumptions that support our earnings guidance. The big shift was moving NYMEX natural gas midpoint down to $4.25 from $5 for 2011, and raising the midpoint for our WTI crude oil up to $87.50 from $80.
The gas is in line with the current forward strip and the crude oil is slightly conservative to the strip, as you all are probably aware. In 2012, our NYMEX gas was lowered to $5 from $5.40. And WTI oil is going up from $82 to $89 in 2012. So those are just the changes that we've made from the previous guidance. And as well, the WTI there remains conservative to the strip.
Of course, the NGL margin moves up with these new assumptions despite embedding a much more conservative NGL to crude relationship than we saw in 2010. The actual NGL to crude relationship came in at 55% in 2010. And our midpoint here for 2011 is 53%, and you can see rising up to 54% for 2012.
Our belief, and if you follow the logic here, our belief is that the NGL to crude relationships move inversely to crude to gas ratio. So as we're seeing a higher crude to gas ratio in 2011, we're suggesting that we should see a slip in the NGL to crude ratio. Despite that, we continue to show very strong margins here in 2011.
Moving onto Slide 14. That commodity assumptions then reflect a nice lift in our guidance as well along with the Bakken acquisition. Our earnings per share reflect some tightening of the ranges in '11 and '12. And our midpoint is being raised from $1.25 to $1.40 for 2011 and to $1.75 from $1.50 in 2012.
The segment profit also has tightened. We're also tightening the range for 2011 and a slight increase in the range in ‘12. The segment profit as you'll see has moved up by a little over 7% in 2011 and about 10% for 2012.
The drivers of course for these earnings raising in segment profit going up are acquisitions that were made in the fourth quarter and higher NGL margins that are being partially offset by lower natural gas prices.
And you also would note, if you dig into the detail here, you'll note that our 2011 and 2012 CapEx are raising. Part of that is carryover from 2010 to '11, as well as increased growth opportunities in the WPZ Laurel Mountain and the Piceance growth as well. So quite a bit of new capital coming there that will continue to fuel our growth.
Moving on to Slide 15. Impressive adjusted segment profit growth here from '10 to '12 of 35%. This segment profit growth is made up of 31% in the Other category and 79% in E&P and a 26% increase in WPZ. In fact, our Other category is getting so big, it's just about to earn its stripes and get a real name. So you'll see notes of that in our 10-K release as well. But really, very nice segment profit growth across the board for all three units here.
Moving on to Slide 16. Talking about we have here $4 billion in growth capital in '11 and '12 to spend. So that's just the growth side CapEx. And we have many more projects as you'll see here in the next few slides beyond the guidance period and many speculative projects that we have not built in the guidance yet. Of course, our track record demonstrates our ability to grow even faster than our guidance, and we continue and are able to add on projects to the back-end of our CapEx for guidance.
Moving on to Slide 17. Much of the continued spending in guidance is growing our fee-based business here. As you can see, within Midstream, in the Marcellus, and we continue to see a big opportunity, albeit more speculative, in the deepwater services as well. As you can see there on the left, you see where the Gulf Coast G&P gets larger as a percentage of the overall mix.
So a lot of great opportunity out there, tremendous demand for midstream infrastructure, particularly in the upstream sector, and we're excited about beginning to help service the pet chem side as well as a lot of changes are coming forward in the pet chem side that are going to demand some infrastructure changes as well. And we're well-positioned to help out with that.
Moving on to Slide 18. Our opportunities in Canada and domestic olefins continue to impress. A relative low cost natural gas resources are creating great opportunities for the North American pet chem space. And we are very excited to be a part of it.
We are able to utilize our knowledge and access to the light and NGLs, both here in the U.S. and Canada. And very well-positioned because we have $500 million of international cash at the end of the year that is sitting available to invest. So we're not going to have to raise any financing to fuel some very substantial growth in Canada. And you can see there the projects listed on here, the Boreal NGL pipeline, which is the right in the midst of construction, reminds you that construction pipelines in Canada, in that part of the country, really does require winter construction on the Northern end because the ground is to be frozen, and we are right in the midst of construction there.
The ethane recovery project, we continue to be excited about that, and that will add to our current services up there that will add our ability to extract ethane and ethylene from those resources up there. And then, of course, we remain very confident in our ability to gain the other upgrader processing benefit, and we've conclude here in the guidance as well.
Moving on to the gas pipeline there. You can see here, really, the key message here is that there's about $1.3 billion of inventory for growth project, but the real key message is that most of this $1.3 billion majority comes on either in late 2012 or even beyond the guidance period, most of it even beyond the guidance period. So despite a nice increase that we've got in our guidance, we've got a very nice group of projects here that will fuel our growth beyond the guidance period.
Moving on here to Slide 20 and in closing here. In the current, we exceeded our EPS guidance. We plan to take dramatic steps to unlock shareholder value. Our unmatched infrastructure and development talents provide a sound basis for an increasing flow of dividends to our shareholders.
And in the forecast, we have very visible growth supporting a 37% growth in guidance from 2010 to '12. And in the future, a very strong case for continued growth beyond the guidance period.
Over the long haul, we have a track record of doing what is right for our shareholders, employees and the environment. And we are very excited to continue to track-record, and we have a great future ahead of us that we're all excited about being a part of.
And with that, I'll turn it over to for questions."

I think we said in the initial press release back then, it was within the next -- by 2013 or so, I thought we'd thought it to be like 25% oil revenue.

If you think about it in Canada, again we've got a nice nest egg there coming from our international cash flows. We've got a nice nest egg there to grow that business. And as we reported, we have $500 million of cash sitting there. And we continue to add very nice cash flows in addition to that in our Canadian business. And so we're pretty well positioned there. And of course, we don't have any debt against those specific cash flows up there. So there's a lot of ways to fund that Canadian growth without dipping in to the current WMB free cash flows. But I would tell you that, that could go on for quite some time. The ability to optimize around those oil sands up there and those gas reserves could go on for quite some time, and we're extremely well positioned up there. I think we're really at the tip of the iceberg in that business. In the U.S., much smaller piece of that, obviously. But we do see a lot of opportunities to help de-bottleneck the pet chem space, not just our own, but others in the U.S. But it certainly wouldn't be as dramatic given what we know right now as the Canadian opportunities."

We're starting to see signs of that. So I think throughout the course of 2011, we are going to see a substantial improvement in terms of producers being able to get back out and get active. What that means to our GulfStar product, I think, is very positive. We do have discussions going on right now with opportunities to deploy that. Again, we don't have anything to announce yet. But we are optimistic and I would say looking forward, there's a significant backlog of opportunities we see on the horizon that we think are going to come into the marketplace over the next, say, 18 months, as people get back to work in the Gulf. So we see that as an opportunity, probably, on kind of 100% basis, which may not be the way that we invest. We may bring on partners for that business, but that's a way to scale things up rather quickly. Most of those investments with the pipeline interconnections are around $1 billion of investment each.

But then we take that into Williams and that's the primary driver of the corporate dividend. And I think you can also see from, if you run through the calculations, especially X E&P, we get to a coverage ratio at Williams as well. I don't think we're prepared to speak to a coverage ratio, but we do have some coverage there. And the good news is here in 2010, we're putting some of that money back in the E&P to grow the Bakken production. So we're drilling a bit beyond our cash flows to get the Bakken started up.

When I spoke to demand, I wasn't speaking to really lack of demand on the pet chem side because as you know, ethylene derivative products like polyethylene are very advantaged here in the U.S. relative to the rest of the world that primarily uses naphtha to produce that product. And so as we have continued below natural gas prices here, we continue to have a lot of opportunity in that regard. And we are very excited about that space. I would just say that we are also seeing a lot of interest by the pet chem space in moving upstream as well. And so there may be a way to reduce risk to our portfolio and lead people that are more in the business of ethylene-derivative business. And the exports of those products doing their expertise. And us doing the upstream in perhaps in a way that partners with those parties and reduces our risk. So that's why the capital isn't real large in that space right now as there's perhaps some partnering opportunities that give us visibility all the way through the polyethylene, for instance, but doesn't require us to put up a tremendous amount of capital in that space."

I don't know if you'll answer the second one. But on the first one, it looks like, if I understood your answer to Carl's question and I'm doing the math right on Slide 11 with the how much you'll be spending on the Bakken, it looks like your CapEx for gas has not come down much, even though the gas strip is somewhat meaningfully lower than what was assumed in the third quarter guidance, which I think was $5 at that time. And the production guidance in 2011 doesn't seem to show much decline on the gas expectation. So the first question is, can you comment about your thinking and plans in terms of gassy CapEx investment relative to changes in commodity prices? And the second question is, whether as part of the broader family or on your own, I just wonder how much credit the street gives you for the 69% ownership in Apco and what you can do to kind of get that story out there?"

And going forward, obviously, as we get our hands more and more around the Bakken side of the world, to the extent we can build our inventory, permitting, get our staff out there, we will probably look to when the time is right to shift those resources from the gassy side to the oily side. So we have -- at November call, you might recall, we did drop about 10 rigs from what we had previously thought we would be doing on the gas side. So we've already taken a pretty big cut at that.
