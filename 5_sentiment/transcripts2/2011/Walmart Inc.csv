This is Carol Schumacher, Vice President of Investor Relations for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Thanks for joining us today for our earnings call to review both the fourth quarter and the full year of fiscal 2011.All information for this quarter",596,"Good morning. This is Carol Schumacher, Vice President of Investor Relations for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Thanks for joining us today for our earnings call to review both the fourth quarter and the full year of fiscal 2011.
All information for this quarter including updated unit counts, square footage and financial metrics, including ROI, are available on our website at walmartstores.com/investors. A full transcript of the call will be available on the website as well around 7:00 a.m. Central Time today, February 22, 2011.
Today, you'll hear from key Walmart leaders, starting with Mike Duke, President and CEO of Walmart Stores, Inc., for the opening comments and key highlights of the quarter and the year; Jeff Davis, in his first call as Walmart’s Treasurer, will cover the consolidated financial details. As you'll see from our press release, we do have some noise with our numbers. Then we'll go to the operating segments. First up this time will be Brian Cornell, President and CEO of Sam's Club; Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Walmart International, will also have highlights on our largest countries within international. We will close the segment discussion with Bill Simon, President and CEO of Walmart U.S. Finally, our CFO, Charles Holley, will cover our financial report card and a variety of points on guidance. 
Before we start to discuss our performance for the quarter, there are a few items to keep in mind as you listen to the results. First, we had certain items that affected that our fourth quarter EPS last year, as well as an accounting change in fiscal 2011 that affected last year. These items need to be considered for comparison purposes. Second, as a reminder, we had a tax benefit from the third quarter, which we reported in November. The tax benefits from the third quarter and the fourth quarter that we're reporting today affect our full year and quarterly results.
Third, I'd also like to point out that during the quarter, we had income from discontinued operations. This income resulted from the recognition of a previously unrecognized tax benefit related to the disposition of our German operations in fiscal year 2007. Including this tax benefit, diluted net income per share attributable to Walmart was $1.70 for the fourth quarter and $4.47 for the full year.
Fourth, this is the last quarter that we'll remind you about our adjusted P&Ls and balance sheets that are available on the Walmart website under Financial Information. Effective with the second quarter of fiscal 2011, Walmart changed the methodology for valuing our inventory. The retrospective application of this accounting change resulted in adjustments to reported amounts. The adjusted financial statements I mentioned earlier cover all of fiscal year 2010, as well as the first quarter of fiscal 2011 and they're on our website. Throughout this call, all earnings and earnings per share amounts reflect the amounts for FY '10 adjusted for this accounting change. 
I'd also like to mention that we're discontinuing our discussion of consolidated membership and other income beginning in fiscal 2012. This line item is most relevant for Sam's Club and they'll continue to discuss it going forward. You'll also note that in today's discussion, as well as in the accompanying press release, we provide disclosure on both reported and underlying earnings per share. The reported EPS takes into consideration all the items, including tax benefits and restructuring charges. The underlying EPS is based on our pure operating performance. You'll hear these terms throughout the discussion today.
Now Mike, let's get started with our Q4 and our full year results. Mike?"
313055,79147929,105001,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2011",2011-02-22,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Carol, and thank you all for joining us. We are pleased with our strong earnings performance for both the quarter and the full year across our three operating segments. At the same time, we are disappointed by our Walmart U.S. fourth quarter sa",1112,"Thank you, Carol, and thank you all for joining us. We are pleased with our strong earnings performance for both the quarter and the full year across our three operating segments. At the same time, we are disappointed by our Walmart U.S. fourth quarter sales. Earnings per share for both the fourth quarter and the full year exceeded the guidance we provided last quarter. We are reporting $1.41 per share for the quarter and $4.18 per share for the full year. These numbers include certain tax benefits that positively impacted EPS and Jeff will cover this shortly.
Based on the underlying performance of the company, our earnings per share were $1.34 for the fourth quarter, which exceeded First Call consensus and our guidance. Walmart increased net sales from the previous year by almost $14 billion to $419 billion. As a company, we leveraged the expenses for the quarter and the year, reinforcing our commitment to the productivity loop and EDLC.
Operating income rose to more than $25 billion for the full year, a 6.4% increase over what we reported this time last year. We continue to deliver strong free cash flow, closing the year with almost $11 billion. We met our goal to deliver stable return on investment, and finished the year again with ROI above 19%.
For the year, we returned a record $19.2 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchase. Let me pause for a moment. $19.2 billion return to shareholders. Now that was worth repeating. However, as I said, sales for Walmart U.S. were below our expectations for the fourth quarter. The team did manage expenses well during the quarter and contributed operating income growth of almost 5%. Bill has a clear vision today of the underlying issues and his action plan addresses the areas critical to the sales turnaround. Some of the pricing and merchandising issues in Walmart U.S. ran deeper than we initially expected, and they require response that will take time to see results. Price leadership is critical to our success. We will reinforce our commitment to deliver EDLP. This is what Walmart was built on.
We will deliver a merchandise assortment and presentation relevant to our customers. As Bill will share with you, many of the fourth quarter problems stem from merchandise assortment and presentation issues that contributed to customer traffic declines, as well as some of the issues related to the remodeling program. I believe Bill is on the right track to see sales improvement throughout the year. Let me be direct on this point. There is no greater priority for me or for Bill than getting sales into positive territory. 
Walmart U.S. will also continue to grow through our supercenters and additional formats. We will move forward with even greater urgency in opening small stores. I'm encouraged by the response we're seeing in urban markets like Chicago, Washington DC, San Diego and New York.
It's no surprise that we see growing opportunities in online shopping. I am pleased with the sales results of Walmart.com during the fourth quarter and expect e-commerce and multichannel to play an increasingly important role across our business. Sam's Club now has annual sales just shy of $50 billion. I am pleased that the Sam's organization is really contributing to our shareholder value. Sam's Club turned in a strong performance for the year, delivering comp sales near the top end of guidance. Brian and his team grew net sales 4.4% for the quarter and 3.5% for the year. Sam's comp sales without fuel, improved sequentially every quarter, with fourth quarter being the strongest. We're seeing the comp sales momentum continue and expect strength in the first quarter. Attracting new members will continue to be the top priority for the year ahead. 
Walmart International continued to be our growth engine and we expect accelerated growth ahead. International net sales exceeded $109 billion this year, an increase of more than 12%. Every market contributed a sales increase in fiscal 2011 compared to the prior year. For the full year, international grew operating income faster than sales.
We added 458 net units this year and almost 8% more selling space in our international markets. Almost 70% of the additional square footage came in two important emerging markets: Mexico and China. I've told our international leaders that I'd like to see them accelerate organic growth in our emerging markets.
We also will grow through acquisitions. We look forward to closing the Massmart transaction in South Africa and expanding our presence in many sub-Saharan African markets. In the U.K., we continue to work towards finalizing the acquisition of the Netto stores.
I'd like to specifically recognize our business in Japan, where our Seiyu stores continued their strong focus on everyday low price and operational efficiencies. As a result, Walmart Japan has grown full year profits for each of the past three years, with this fiscal year being the best of the three years.
You're familiar with our company mission of helping our customers save money so they can live better. Our engagement on the ""live better"" societal issues continues to have a meaningful impact in our communities. Doug and I had the opportunity to share some of our experiences with leaders from companies and countries around the world at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland last month. 
We found there's a lot of interest in our global commitment to sustainable agriculture and our new initiative in the U.S. to make the food we sell healthier, and healthier foods more affordable for our customers. We were honored that First Lady Michelle Obama joined Bill Simon to launch this initiative last month. 
We recognize that around the world, there is growing concern about inflation and higher prices, particularly in food and energy. I believe that Walmart is one of the best positioned retailers around the world to handle these kinds of headwinds, because of our commitment to EDLC and EDLP. This is something we will continue to address. You'll hear more about this from our business leaders. 
As I look ahead for this fiscal year, I am confident that no retailer is better positioned to win globally than Walmart. We will not waver in our commitment to our customers. Our financial priorities of growth, leverage and returns guide us in our decisions and strategies. We will continue to add square footage and new formats. We will grow sales and increase comps. We will continue to leverage operating expenses through the productivity loop and we will continue to maximize our returns to the shareholders through dividends, share repurchase and a stable ROI. 
Now Jeff will cover the details on our consolidated financial results. Jeff?"
313055,79147929,105001,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2011",2011-02-22,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, Walmart delivered income from continuing operations of $5 billion, an increase of 4.3% from last year. Reported earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Walmart were $1.41, an incre",1223,"Thanks, Mike. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, Walmart delivered income from continuing operations of $5 billion, an increase of 4.3% from last year. Reported earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Walmart were $1.41, an increase of 11.9% compared to $1.26 for the fourth quarter last year.
We have some noise in both this year's and last year's earnings per share numbers that I would like to explain further. This year, we recorded $243 million of net tax benefits, primarily from the repatriate of certain non-U.S. earnings that increased U.S. foreign tax credits. This net tax benefit added approximately $0.07 to our reported EPS of $1.41 for the fourth quarter. 
By comparison, last year's $1.26 per share had both a benefit and a charge in the fourth quarter. First, we incurred charges for several business restructurings in the amount of $260 million, or $162 million after-tax. These charges reduced our reported EPS by approximately $0.04 per share. Second, we recorded $372 million of net tax benefits primarily from the repatriation of certain non-U.S. earnings that increased U.S. foreign tax credits. These net tax benefit added approximately $0.09 to our reported EPS. 
In summary, our fourth quarter underlying EPS grew 10.7% from $1.21 last year to $1.34 this year, which was above our guidance of $1.29 to $1.33 per share. The $1.34 earnings per share points to the strength of our consolidated business.
For the full year, earnings from continuing operations attributable to Walmart were $15.4 billion, an increase of 6.3% over last year. For the fiscal year, reported earnings per share and underlying earnings per share from continuing operations were $4.18 and $4.07, respectively versus our adjusted EPS of $3.73 and underlying EPS of $3.67 last year. The underlying $4.07 excludes a certain tax benefits recorded in the third and fourth quarters that aggregate to approximately $0.11 per share for the fiscal year. 
Earlier, Carol mentioned an important point. In the fourth quarter, the company recognized in discontinued operations an approximately $1 billion tax benefit in connection with the disposition of our German operation in fiscal 2007. This matter was resolved with the United States Internal Revenue Service during the fourth quarter of this fiscal year. Now let's dive into the fourth quarter and the fiscal year results.
Consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter increased 2.5% or almost $2.8 billion to $115.6 billion. Net sales included a currency exchange rate benefit of $664 million. On a constant currency basis, sales grew 1.9%. The 13-week U.S. comp sales, without fuel, declined 1.1%. You'll hear more details on the Walmart U.S. and Sam's comp sales from Bill and Brian.
Gross margin for the quarter was flat to last year at 24.6% of sales. Fourth quarter consolidated operating income was $8 billion, up 7.3% or $546 million from last year. This includes a currency exchange rate benefit of $58 million. On a constant currency basis, consolidated operating income grew 6.5%. 
Operating income grew faster than sales by leveraging operating expenses. The productivity loop is a priority focus throughout the company. Expenses grew approximately 50 basis points on sales growth of 2.5%, which is the fifth consecutive quarter that expenses grew slower than sales.
Unallocated corporate overhead grew 9.1% to $505 million for the quarter. What we classify as core within our corporate overhead expense actually decreased 3% for the quarter. The mark-to-market of several unallocated foreign currency derivative positions was the primary driver of the increase. It is important to note that unallocated corporate overhead decreased 2% to about $1.7 billion for the year.
On a consolidated basis, membership and other income declined 4.5% or $36 million this quarter compared to last year. For the year, membership and other income was down 1.9% or $56 million. As Carol remarked, membership and other income continues to be an important part of the Sam's Club business but to a lesser degree for the other segments.
Net interest expense for the quarter increased 13.4% to $532 million. For the fiscal year, net interest expense was $2 billion, an increase of 6.4%. This was driven by higher debt levels but partially offset by lower interest rates. Our double A credit rating allows us to access low-cost debt. As a reminder, earlier this year, we issued $5 billion of debt at some of the lowest corporate rates on record at the time. We continue to have ample access to the credit markets. At the end of the year, our debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 42.1% compared to 37% at the end of last year.
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 30.7% and 32.2% for the year. This was due to the net tax benefits we previously discussed. These items reduced our effective tax rate by approximately 320 basis points for the quarter and approximately 180 basis points for the fiscal year.
Net sales were approximately $419 billion for the year, which is an increase of 3.4% or $13.8 billion over last year. Net sales included a currency exchange benefit of $4.5 billion. On a constant currency basis, our net sales for fiscal 2011 grew 2.3%. As a reminder, currency translation negatively impacted sales by $9.8 billion in fiscal 2010. For the 52-week period ended January 28, 2011, U.S. comp sales without fuel declined 1.1%.
Consolidated operating income was $25.5 billion, an increase of 6.4% from last year and included $231 million from currency rate fluctuations. On a constant currency basis, consolidated operating income grew 5.5% to $25.3 billion. Consistent with our quarterly results, operating income grew faster than sales for the year as we leverage expenses. Expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 32 basis points.
This year was another strong year for cash flow generation. We closed the year with free cash flow of $10.9 billion. Recall last year, free cash flow was $14.1 billion, enhanced by the artificially low inventory position at year end. Annual CapEx spend was $12.7 billion, which was lower than our most recent guidance of $13 billion to $14 billion. This resulted from lower spending and timing associated with the Walmart U.S. segment. CapEx spend for the fourth quarter was $3.4 billion.
We paid almost $1.1 billion in dividends this quarter and $4.4 billion for the year. As a reminder, we increased our dividends per share 11% to $1.21 from $1.09 in fiscal year 2010.
Walmart repurchased approximately $3.8 billion of shares during the fourth quarter and $14.8 billion for the year, which is the most we ever repurchased. This represents nearly 70 million and 280 million shares, respectively. We have approximately $4.8 billion remaining on our $15 billion share repurchase authorization announced in June of 2010.
In summary, Walmart returned $19.2 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase for the fiscal year. As Mike noted, this is truly a record return to our shareholders. Payables as a percentage of inventories for the company were 92.4%, relatively stable from 93.1% last year. Although inventory levels increased 11%, consolidated inventory turns were flat with the prior year. In addition, we effectively manage payables. 
We continue to produce a consistently high and stable ROI. We finished the year with 19.2% return on investment compared to 19.3% at the end of last year. 
Now, let's move on to a discussion of our operating segments. We'll start with Sam's Club, Brian?"
313055,79147929,105001,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2011",2011-02-22,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jeff.

We achieved that promise by understa",1904,"Thank you, Jeff. As I've shared with you during the fiscal year, our strategies to meet our members needs and deliver on the Sam's Club brand promise of simplifying our members lives by helping them make smart choices. We achieved that promise by understanding what our members want and providing them merchandise they want at the quality and value they expect. It's important to remember that in last year's fourth quarter, we took a charge for restructuring our operations related to the closure of 10 clubs. Our discussion today therefore excludes that charge of $174 million for comparative purposes.
I am very excited to share our results with you today. As they indicate Sam's members are responding to the offering and experience in our clubs. We had a strong quarter and are very pleased with our club performance thanks to the efforts of our dedicated managers and associates, we grew sales and operating profit, as well as leveraged expenses for the quarter and the fiscal year. Let's start with the fourth quarter results. 
Comp club sales, excluding fuel, increased 2.7% for the 13-week period ending January 28, 2011. I am very pleased to share with you that we were at the top end of our guidance of a comp club increase of 1% to 3% for the fourth quarter. As Mike mentioned, Sam reported sequential comp improvement quarter-over-quarter throughout the year.
Overall, comp ticket and traffic, excluding fuel, increased for the 13-week period by 210 and 70 basis points, respectively. We are also pleased that our members, both business and advantage, visited with us more often and put more items in their baskets and flat beds during the quarter. Sales during the quarter were particularly strong in fresh foods and grocery, health and wellness, home and apparel categories.
Sam's Club operating income for the fourth quarter increased slightly versus last year to $487 million. Excluding fuel, operating income for the fourth quarter was flat versus last year. And now, highlights for Sam's for the full year.
Comp club sales, excluding fuel, increased 1.7% for the 52-week period. Overall comp ticket, excluding fuel, increased for the 52-week period by 180 basis points. While overall comp traffic declined slightly, we did see increases in frequency of visit by both our Advantage and Business members.
Operating income grew 1.3% to $1.7 billion versus last year. We opened four new clubs during the fiscal year, with the most recent opening in January in Sharpsburg, Georgia. We are investing more aggressively in member acquisition ahead of club openings and are seeing positive results. We continue to see growth in the Sam's Club brand in our international markets. As Doug and his team opened 14 new Sam's Club's this fiscal year. We continue to work with fee international team to share best practices across the organization to ensure we are meeting our members needs, both in the U.S. and around the world peer
We also continue to improve our member experience by updating our older clubs. We completed 65 club remodels, expanded two clubs and relocated three clubs during the fiscal year. Now let's turn to the detailed financial results. 
For the fourth quarter, net sales for Sam's Club, excluding fuel, increased to $11.9 billion which is a 2.5% increase over last year's fourth quarter. Including fuel, fourth quarter sales were $13.1 billion, which is a 4.4% increase versus last year. Price and volume of fuel contributed almost equally to the increase in fuel sales.
For the fiscal year, net sales for Sam's Club, excluding fuel, increased 1.4% versus last year to $45.2 billion. Including fuel, net sales for the fiscal year were $49.5 billion, which is an increase of 3.5% versus last year. Fuel increases were driven by 17% increases in fuel prices and a 12% increase in gallons sold for the full year versus last year.  Including fuel, comp club sales increased 4.5% and 3.7% for both the 13-week and 52-week period, respectively.
Comp ticket, excluding fuel, increased for both business and advantage members for both the 13-week and the 52-week period. Comp traffic, excluding fuel for both the 13-week and the 52-week period, increased for our advantage members and declined for our business members. Additionally, we saw how frequency improve for both Business and Advantage members, for the quarter and the fiscal year. So our members are shopping with us more often and putting more items in their baskets and flat beds. While traffic maybe down with our business members, frequency and ticket are up. We expect to continue to see pressure on business members through late fiscal 2012.
During the holidays, we focused our messaging on feeding the family and home entertaining. And these messages delivered strong sales in fresh foods, grocery and beverages. We introduced approximately 100 new fresh foods, including bakery reprograms for cookies, cake and artisan breads. The new product launches all drove mid-double-digit comp sales. And in our freezer cooler category, we introduced a new high quality appetizer program, which also drove mid-double-digit comps. Inflation in selected meat, produce and dairy categories aided increases in average unit price, partially offset by downward unit pressure.
We also had a very successful holiday season in key discretionary categories, such as home, domestics and apparel. The team did a great job providing high-quality merchandise and preferred brands at a tremendous value to our members. We transitioned well from holiday season, minimizing markdowns and ending the year in a strong inventory position. 
Relative to the industry, we are very pleased with the sales of our electronics and technology categories in the fourth quarter and grew market share over the fiscal year. Members responded well to our strong brand offering, including LG and the Apple iPhone and iPad. We continue to experience price pressure in electronics, especially in televisions, but had positive unit sales growth of TVs for the quarter. Our expanded health and wellness offering continues to drive strong sales performance. Tobacco and fuel sales also continue to deliver strong call comps. 
Sam's grew gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased by eight basis points during the fourth quarter primarily driven by the continued shift in merchandising mix towards higher margin fresh products, very effective management of seasonal merchandise to minimize markdowns and improve global sourcing. Through improved sourcing, we decreased our damage rates throughout the year including fuel, the gross margin rate for the quarter decreased 11 basis points compared to last year.
Recall that last year's inventory levels were lower than our historic levels due to inventory management initiatives. It's not surprising that our inventory is up. We closed the year with inventory up 14% compared to this time last year. We feel we've returned to a more comfortable inventory level that provides a good balance of flow and availability. We anticipate this trend of period-over-period inventory growth to continue into the first quarter. Additionally, we have shifted shipping volume forward into the year to make our earlier club seasonal transition dates. Due to these items, our inventory turns were down slightly in the fourth quarter.
Operating expenses for the fourth quarter grew 3.4% versus last year. During the fourth quarter, we incurred charges for certain assets that were taken out of service, including the temporary closure of a club in Rhode Island we plan to rebuild, as well as costs associated with continued restructuring of our field organization. If you exclude these items, we leveraged operating expenses by approximately six basis points.
For the fiscal year, operating expenses grew 2.5%, driven by credit card interchange fees, remodeling, and higher marketing investments that drive traffic. Despite this, we were still able to leverage expenses for the fiscal year. For the quarter, sales per labor hour increased 223 basis points. Units per labor hour increased 27 basis points for the fourth quarter versus last year. For the fiscal year, sales per labor hour increased 198 basis points and units per labor hour increased 172 basis points. 
Membership and other income for the fourth quarter decreased 1.9% from last year. Membership income, the primary driver, was flat for the fourth quarter versus last year. Other income decreased 15% due to last year's results being favorably impacted by a number of miscellaneous items, none of which was individually significant to the financial statement. For the fiscal year, membership and other income decreased 2.2% driven in part by a favorable accounting adjustment in the third quarter of last year to membership income. Excluding the effects of the accounting adjustment last year, membership income, the primary driver, increased approximately 80 basis points compared to last year. The increase was driven by strength in our Plus membership upgrades, as well as the number of new members joining at the Plus level.
We continue to be pleased with the progress of our eValues program for Plus members, as we enhanced the program to make it even more meaningful for our members. Additionally, we are further simplifying the way we communicate value offered to our Plus member. For example, we've always offered a discount to our Plus members on their prescriptions, but the discount varied across prescriptions. Now it's a simplified program, with an 8% discount on branded prescriptions and a 40% discount on generics, not part of our $4 and $10 generic ascription plan. Our members understand it clearly and it's paying off with upgrades.
Our membership renewal rates remained steady throughout the year. Our win back program targeted to inactive members also contributed to our improved membership rates. We expect small businesses to continue to be under pressure throughout fiscal 2012 and anticipate continued softness in business member sign-ups.
For the fiscal year, operating income increased 1.3% versus last year. Fiscal 2012 is underway. Our plan is focused on delivering the financial priorities of growth, leverage and return. Our existing fleet of U.S. clubs will grow. As we shared with you in October, we plan to add between seven and 12 new expanded or relocated clubs next year in the United States. Sam's Club has committed a significant portion of our capital spend to remodels. We expect to complete remodels on 60 to 70 clubs this year. Our CapEx plan for the fiscal year remains the same approximately $1 billion.
Our strategic initiatives will continue to be driven by insights, quality and innovation. In merchandising, we continue to provide our members the best prices on everyday need purchases, leverage fresh foods and grocery to feed our members families, continue investing in areas like technology services and expand our progress in making Sam's Club a destination for our members health and wellness needs.
In membership, we will step up our efforts to attract new members and continue to focus on building relationships with existing members across a variety of touch points, including eValues, wireless network access in clubs, our smartphone application and an improved .com site to allow for easier member interaction and operations we are focused on driving member experiences that are efficient and engaging.
Our sales momentum for fiscal 2011 is carrying over into the first few weeks of the new fiscal year. We expect comp sales, without fuel, for the current 13-week period from January 29, 2011, through April 29, 2011, to increase between 1% and 3%. Last year, Sam's Club comp, without fuel, for the first quarter comparable 13-week period rose 70 basis points. 
Now I'll turn it over to Doug to tell you about Walmart International. Doug?"
313055,79147929,105001,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2011",2011-02-22,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brian. This year has been another year of meaningfully treatment for the team in Walmart international, both in financial terms and in our positive impact in the communities we serve around the world. Our financial goals remain grounded in growth,",2615,"Thanks, Brian. This year has been another year of meaningfully treatment for the team in Walmart international, both in financial terms and in our positive impact in the communities we serve around the world. Our financial goals remain grounded in growth, leverage and returns. And Walmart International continues to have strong growth in both net sales and operating income. On the topic of growth, I'm pleased to say that we've met our goals of opening locally relevant format as we discussed in the October meeting for the investment community. In fiscal 2011, our organic growth included 458 net new stores, representing an 11.2% increase in store count and a 7.8% increase in square footage. This growth includes 282 new stores in smaller formats, is less than 40,000 square feet. 
In addition to comp store sales growth and delivery of our new stores, we are excited about our pending investment in South Africa and the sub-Saharan region of Africa. In addition, we continue to work towards completion of our acquisition of the Netto stores in the U.K. 
Given that we're recapping the end of the year, please allow me to take just a minute and highlight some of the successes our teams have delivered beyond the quarterly financial results. For the second year in a row, Walmart Central America was named the Most Admired Multinational Company in Central America. Walmart China received several honors including the Best Retail Place to Work and a China Best Employer. Our ASDA team in the U.K. was selected as Britain's Best Value Retailer for the 12th consecutive year. In addition, Walmart Mexico's foundation received the prestigious 2010 World Business and Development Award granted by the United Nations development program, the International Chamber of Commerce and International Business Leaders Forum. The award recognized the foundations indigenous product commercialization program, which offers training and funding to boost the production processes of marginalized communities and indigenous groups living in isolated regions to improve their income in quality-of-life.
And in India, we opened our second training center to teach our associate candidates the skills of being a successful Walmart retailer. Enabling our associates in India is a critical part of our success. You can imagine the students surprise while he was in India recently, Mike Duke stopped in the classroom to answer their questions. To date, more than 3,000 students have been certified and 1,050 have been placed in various jobs, out of which nearly 200 airplanes in our best priced modern wholesale cash and carry stores. These are the associates that will help us fuel our growth in the country. 
Now let's get to the numbers. For the full year, our business achieved constant currency sales of $104.8 billion or 7.6% growth over fiscal 2010. Our constant currency operating income of $5.4 billion grew even faster at 9.7%. I'm also pleased to say that we leveraged operating expenses for the year. All markets grew full year constant currency sales over last year, with some of the highest increases coming from Brazil, China and Mexico. On a constant currency basis, operating expenses grew slower than sales at 5.8% due to strong expense management in Japan and the United Kingdom. On a constant currency basis, gross margin as a percentage of sales was flat to last year. 
On a reported basis, Walmart International's net sales were $109.2 billion in fiscal 2011, growing 12.5% over fiscal 2010. This includes a $4.5 billion benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Operating income was $5.6 billion, including a benefit of $231 million from changes in currency exchange rates. 
Now turning to our fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter constant currency sales were $30.7 billion, growing 6.6% over last year. On a constant currency basis, operating income was $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter constant currency operating income growth of 4% was slower than sales growth. While gross profit margin and expenses remain constant as a percentage of sales, this year's constant currency operating income did not have the benefits of real estate sales in Canada that we had last year. 
Constant currency operating expenses as a percentage of sales were flat to last year as expense leverage in Mexico and the U.K. offset pressures in our other markets. On a reported basis, fourth quarter net sales were $31.4 billion, growing 8.9% from last year. Net sales for the fourth quarter include a $664 million benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Fourth quarter operating income was $2 billion, including a $58 million benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. 
For the quarter, we did not meet our goal of growing inventory at less than half the rate of sales and we're intent on making improvements here. On constant currency basis inventory grew up 12.6%, days-on-hand increased 0.4 days over last year adding many of this years new stores in the fourth quarter had a significant effect on this metric. 
Now let's get into the results for several of our larger markets. As a reminder, we hold country management accountable for their results on a local currency basis without the impact of potential swings and exchange rates. The following discussion of country results excludes the impact of currency and unless otherwise stated, sales and comps are presented in nominal rates. In Mexico, Walmex continues to deliver great results, growing sales in the fourth quarter and growing operating income faster than sales. Until Walmex has annualized its March 2010 acquisition of Central American operations, the following discussion will include only Walmex's results in Mexico. While the following results are on a U.S. GAAP basis, Walmex separately reports its earnings under Mexican GAAP. So some of the numbers may be different.
Walmex's net sales for the fourth quarter were up 9.2% and comparable store sales were up 2.9%. The sales growth at Walmex is driven by the 255 stores and six restaurants that have opened since the fourth quarter of last year, positive comp growth in all Walmex formats and good holiday sales. Customer traffic increased 10 basis points and average ticket increased 2.9% in comparable stores. For the fourth quarter, Walmex comp store sales for self-service formats grew by 2.5%, while ANTAD comp store sales report for the rest of the industry excluding Walmex showed only 1.3% growth. 
Walmex's fourth quarter operating income grew faster than sales at 15.2% on a higher gross profit margin and expense leverage. Fourth quarter gross profit margin as a percent of sales increased 79 basis points from last year and disciplined in expenses allowed for expenses as a percentage of sales to decline by 27 basis points. 
Moving on to Brazil. Net sales grew in the fourth quarter amid some exciting changes that is happening in our operations there. However, we did not grew operating income faster than sales. Although we are disappointed with this year's results in Brazil, we've already begun the changes to see business improvement. In January, Brazil began implementing EDLP. Shelf prices on more than 2,000 items have reduced the week of the launch and additional items are being moved to EDLP every week. Over the long term, we expect the EDLP in Brazil to increase sales volume and reduce operating costs as we've seen in Japan. During this period of change, however, we expect some sales pressure in Brazil. 
In real terms of Brazil's a fourth quarter sales growth was 7.8% and comparable store sales were flat. Customer traffic at comparable stores declined 5.2% and average ticket increased 5.5%, both in real terms. Sales at our cash and carry and supermarket formats performed well during the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter gross profit margin as a percentage of sales increased 93 basis points over last year due to margin pressure last year. Expenses as a percentage of sales increased 161 basis points, primarily due to adding many of this years new stores in the fourth quarter. This increase in expenses caused Brazil's operating income to decline by 41.7% from last year.
In the past 12 months, we have opened 45 new stores in Brazil bringing our total store count to 479. This includes 27 new stores in the fourth quarter of this year. Moving to Asia. Walmart Japan has seen success from its implementation of EDLP, growing sales in the fourth quarter. However, operating income did not grow faster than sales. The results are showing that customers prefer EDLP. Based on information from the Japanese Ministry of the Economy, Trade and Industry or METI, our performance continues to say ahead of other large-scale retailers in Japan and we are increasing our market share in a deflationary environment. 
Fourth quarter net sales and comparable store sales increased approximately 3.1%, both in real terms. Walmart Japan's traffic increased 2% over last year as the newly remodeled stores continue to attract customers and average ticket in real terms increased 1.5%. Walmart Japan sales of food, consumables and general merchandise each showed a strong performance, while apparel sales were down. Gross profit margin as a percentage of sales increased slightly by 19 basis points from last year and expenses as a percentage of sales increased 63 basis points from last year. As with last year, fourth quarter operations were again profitable. As Mike mentioned earlier, Walmart Japan has grown full year profits for each of the past three years, with this fiscal year being the best of the three years. We look forward to the continued impact of EDLP there.
Overall, China sales grew in the fourth quarter as well but operating income did not grew faster than sales. Net sales for the fourth quarter in Walmart China grew 9.6% over last year and comparable stores growth was 1.8%. Average ticket grew 9.6% in China but traffic declined 7.2%. The primary traffic decline resulted from TrustMart finalizing its merchandising transition to Walmart assortments. Fourth quarter gross profit as a percentage of sales increased 96 basis points over last year, primarily due to purchasing efficiencies from growing sales and a reduction in the low-margin assortment to TrustMart. Expenses as a percentage of sales grew 197 basis points primarily due to the lower sales during the TrustMart merchandising transition to Walmart's assortments. Fourth quarter operating income declined approximately 8%. 
In the past 12 months, we opened 49 new stores including 45 supercenters and that brings our China store count to 328 stores. Walmart and the selling shareholder of TrustMart have mutually agreed to extend the closing of the remaining TrustMart stores to May 26, 2011, while certain conditions of the contract are completed. 
Before moving on, let's give a brief update on India. As you know, we support Bharti Retail and their new store growth in India. Bharti Retail stores are excluded from our store count opened 30 new stores in the fourth quarter this year and now operates 118 supermarkets and 10 compact hypermarkets. In our separate joint venture with Bharti, we've increased the number of cash and carry stores to five. Fourth quarter comparable store sales at our cash and carry stores increased 11.3% over last year.
Turning now to the United Kingdom. As the continued to grow sales and operating income in the fourth quarter of this year. However, operating income grew at a slower sales than sales as ASDA increased the price investments during the holiday season. In the fourth quarter of this year, comparable sales, excluding fuel, increased 1.6% with overall sales growth in the low single digits the average ticket grew 3% and traffic declined 1.4% in the fourth quarter as customers made larger purchases and shop less frequently in the U.K.'s record December snowstorm peer sales were strong in clothing, toys and sports in grocery.
ASDA launched its price guaranty last April where customers can go online and with a few clicks, check their basket rights against competitors. Over 1 million customers checked their baskets in 2010. Recently, ASDA strengthened its commitment to price, guaranteeing to be 10% cheaper than its competitors and an additional 800,000 baskets have already been checked under the 10% program. Gross profit as a percentage of sales declined slightly in the fourth quarter. Expenses as a percentage of sales were slightly lower than last year under ASDA's ""We Operate for Less"" program. However, the expense performance was not enough to offset the decline in gross margin peer
ASDA continue to broaden its appeal and sales of ASDA's premium brand ""Extra Special"" performed strongly over the Christmas period. According to Kantar Worldpanel come ""Extra Special"" was the fastest growing premium brand of the major retailers. Chosen By You, ASDA's mid-tier private label continues to perform well and in the first quarter of next year, will be extended to grocery, meal solutions and chilled foods. 
ASDA opened six new stores during the fourth quarter, including four superstores and two supermarket. ASDA's commitment to Saving Customers Money Every Day will be more important in 2011 as VAT taxes in the U.K. have risen to 20% compared to 17.5% at this time last year and fuel prices rise to record levels. 
And finally, with Canada. Walmart Canada sales grew in the fourth quarter of this year. However, operating income did not grow faster than sales. Net sales grew 4.8% in the fourth quarter compared to last year, primarily due to the supercenter expansion program and strong sales in food, hardlines and health and wellness. This translated into fourth quarter comparable sales growth of 40 basis points. As a percentage of sales, gross margin was relatively unchanged from last year's higher rate and expenses were relatively unchanged from last year as strong cost controls in our retail operations offset the costs from our new bank. 
Operating income declined as last year's results included the gains from sales of some of our real estate properties. Excluding these gains, operating income would have increased from the fourth quarter of last year. While operating income from our retail operations grew in line with sales, this growth was offset by the startup costs of our new bank.  Average ticket increased 60 basis points for the fourth quarter and traffic declined 20 basis points. 
In the past 12 months, we opened eight new stores in Canada, bringing our store count to 325 stores. In fiscal 2012, we expect to open 40 new supercenters in key regions around the country. Canada continues to offer significant opportunity and we have a winning strategy to capture a greater share of this market. Building on our long track record of growth and performance, we are confident in our ability to expand and we saw a long-term opportunity to serve our customers in more ways. 
And also like to mention in the beginning of the fourth quarter Canada open the first sustainable fresh food distribution center estimated to be 60% more energy-efficient than traditional refrigerated centers and saving approximately $4.8 million in energy costs over five years. The 400,000 square foot facilities among the most energy-efficient distribution center is in North America. 
Looking forward in the fiscal 2012, we remain committed to sales growth and growing our operating income faster than sales each quarter peer our expectations for organic growth include 23 million to 24 million new square feet in our current markets come including significant investments in soft discount formats in Mexico and Brazil and larger formats in China and Canada. We expect our capital expenditures to continue to range between $4 billion and $4.5 billion for the fiscal year.
Our focus on price leadership, customer service and productivity have produced good results for fiscal 2011 and we're well prepared to meet our fiscal goals in 2012 and more than 4,550 stores. 
Now I'll turn it over to Bill for the update on Walmart U.S. Bill?"
313055,79147929,105001,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2011",2011-02-22,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Doug. As Mike said, we were disappointed with our sales performance. Our 1.8% comp decline for the fourth quarter did not meet anyone's expectations, they certainly didn't meet mine. For The fourth quarter and the full year, we again delivered",2227,"Thank you, Doug. As Mike said, we were disappointed with our sales performance. Our 1.8% comp decline for the fourth quarter did not meet anyone's expectations, they certainly didn't meet mine. For The fourth quarter and the full year, we again delivered strong operating income and we continue to leverage operating expenses. The P&L was in excellent shape, all we need is top line growth. 
That me start with the fourth quarter recap of merchandising and I'll get into financial results for the quarter and the full year and wrap up with a look at our expectations going forward. 
Certainly as others have reported, whether an individual tax refund loan delays or headwinds for the fourth quarter sales, but the primary factor for our negative comp sales performance was General Merchandise and more specifically, electronics. It's no surprise that General Merchandise makes up a larger percentage of our sales mix for the fourth quarter and electronics, which comprises the largest portion of the overall General Merchandise sales mix, had continued price deflation. Despite the price pressure on TVs, we still have positive unit growth and we grew market share.
There are some bright spots in electronics. Though you might have not seen it on the sales line, we again had very strong sales of our prepaid wireless products in the fourth quarter. But recall, that we can only account for commission on sales of prepaid wireless products and services, as well as third-party gift cards. Had we been able to account for the full sail, we would have added 60 basis points to the fourth quarter comps.
Am pleased with our sales performance in Food and Health and Wellness businesses. Food, our largest business, delivered positive low single-digit comps in the fourth quarter. We believe the additional assortment we put in the grocery increased our relevancy for customers. We brought back many opening price point items that were important to our core customers to help generate traffic and loyalty. The modular changes for SKU add-backs in food were mostly completed in November and completed to better sales. The quality improvements we've made in our Produce business are also taking hold with our customers. 
Health and Wellness comp sales were positive, driven by improvements in both pharmacy and over-the-counter categories. This came despite supply headwinds in OTC, driven by ongoing issues as a result of recalls by key suppliers and a larger-than-expected generic mix. We see many encouraging trends in our Health and Wellness business. First, our new Humana drug program enrolled more people than we expected. This provided some tailwind toward the end of the fourth quarter and we'll continue to do so this fiscal year. Second, the cold and cough season is picking up traction and we're well prepared. 
Our Consumables business had low single-digit negative comps for the quarter. We complete our new modular sets in the first quarter, which will help us highlight opening price points and recapture traffic loss to competitors. However, in categories where we've already made modular changes such as paper products, we're seeing positive sales momentum, driven by improved customer conversion and offsetting commodity-driven deflation. 
We posted mid-single-digit negative comps in apparel. We have seen improving sales trends in men's, ladies plus and women's offset by a pullback in juniors. Customers are also buying closer to the particularly in seasonal apparel. I'm encouraged by the recent trends as we add back assortment in key apparel categories including shoes and accessories.
Home comps were low single-digit negative, though winter weather helped drive sales and snow removal and bedding. Promotional and new items as well as home management, floor care and dining did well for the holidays. Home decor continues to face headwinds. 
Sales in our seasonal category were slightly below projections in the fourth quarter. We lost sales by having seasonal merchandise spread across too many areas of the store during the fourth quarter. Going forward, our seasonal merchandise for holiday such as Easter, Halloween and Christmas will have integrated targeted plans to present a more compelling presentation product offering for customers 
Our In-store Toy business was slightly negative over the holiday season. However, combined with tremendous online Toy growth, our overall Toy sales met our expectations this holiday season. Our last General Merchandise category, hardlines, had a comp declined and low-single digits. Sales growth of course sporting goods and automotive categories where we started to add back assortment offset softer sales and large exercise equipment, crafts, stationery and books. 
I shared with you last quarter that we began reassorting our general merchandise categories adding back related items in categories and making space allocation changes. This process will take longer than it did in the food side of the business. With longer lead times in General Merchandise, we will be working on this throughout the year. Product cycle times, modular changes and of department space allocations are scheduled to change throughout the year. Our goal is to gain traction on these before we get into the General Merchandise rich fourth quarter. 
We know the power of online shopping, which industry reports said grew by 11% during the fourth quarter. Walmart.com's fourth quarter sales growth exceeded the industry and were on par with the industry leaders and these too was a competitive advantage as we offer customers the opportunity to shop on their terms. 
Now let us get to the financial details for the fourth quarter and the full year. As I mentioned, comp sales for the 13-week period were negative 1.8%. Slower traffic was a major factor in the comp declined and average ticket was up slightly versus the prior year. For the full year, comp on a 454 basis declined 1.6%. For the 52-week period, average ticket was up slightly, traffic drove the majority of the comp declined. All financial details beyond comp are provided on the fiscal quarter and the year. For the full year, net sales were up 13 basis points but declined 46 basis points in the fourth quarter. 
Inventory was up 8.2% compared to last year. Recall, we ended last year with low inventory levels as a result of our aggressive inventory reduction program. Aside from our sales shortfall in this year's fourth quarter, some of our planned initiatives deliberately increased inventory namely the additional addition of merchandise action alley and increased assortment. In fact, these two initiatives contributed approximately 120 basis points to the total gross. At the end of the year, we did not have significant inventory exposure. In fact, inventory turns in the fourth quarter were flat with last year.
Gross profit dollars improved 15 basis points for the fourth quarter. The sales decline and lower margin electronics merchandise led to a favorable mix. Gross margin rate was up 17 basis points for the quarter as a result of the favorable mix. For the year, gross margin was up $11 million or two basis points over the prior year. Our gross margin rate for the year was basically flat. 
We leveraged operating expenses again now for five consecutive quarters. Sales per labor hour or labor productivity were up again for the quarter and even more for the full year. I want to recognize the operational performance of our stores particularly during the intense winter weather storms in December, January and now February. Our store teams continue to increase store standards and this will position us to work to enhance our assortment and implement the merchandising initiatives, including adding merchandising to action alley. I would also add that our sales performance resulted in a decrease in the expense for incentive plans. Going forward, that's not how I want to reduce our expenses. 
Fourth quarter operating income grew 4.8% to more than $6 billion. For the full year, operating income was up 22 basis points as a percentage of sales, increased 3.1% to almost $20 billion. These are very strong results given the state of the economy and the difficulty we had during the fourth quarter on the sales line. I'm confident we can improve sales throughout the rest of the year. We spent the last six months analyzing our assortment and presentation and delving into customer insight about their shopping habits and their preference. 
Beginning this month, we are removing the high-capacity end caps to make way for a more robust, proper action alley presentation. As I Mentioned, space and assortment changes are now underway to improve our merchandise presentation particularly in apparel, sporting goods, toys and the hardlines in most of our U.S. stores. 
As we've experienced, average unit retail prices are expected to continue to decrease electronics particularly for TVs, hardware and gaming. We believe we can mitigate some of these price pressure by increasing our focus on products and categories like iPads and other tablets that offer greater growth opportunities. While we progress in the second and third quarter, we should begin to see the sales declines in these categories abate. 
Our team is implementing a four-point plan that we expect will improve the performance in our existing stores. First, everyday low price leadership, savings on the basket. Walmart will deliver consistent everyday low price, which is what the Walmart brands stands for on a basket of goods. We also will support our messaging with targeted marketing in-store and with a variety of media.
Two, broadest assortment possible. Under the leadership of our new chief merchant, Duncan, we will continue to work with our suppliers to deliver the broadest assortment possible at the lowest price in the market. Three, improve remodel efficiency and return. We will change our remodeling program to right-size merchandise categories and eliminate remodel disruptions pick we will continue to drive efficiencies our remodeling program to reduce capital costs and expenses. And four, access for our customers. We'll leverage Walmart's strength to expand multi-channel initiatives so our customers can shop on their terms. 
We'll also meaningful progress on growth as we expand our store format portfolio to continue to grow through supercenters which continue to offer us the best return on investment and launching small formats. The development of our small format is progressing ahead of schedule. We expect to open our first Walmart Express stores in the second quarter. This will be a new form of for both rural and urban locations. We're very pleased with the reception customers are giving potential Walmart stores in cities such as Chicago, Washington DC, New York and San Diego. As I said, we're driving efficiencies in our remodeling program. 
In October, we projected a range of $7.5 billion to $8 billion for capital expenditure budget for fiscal 2012. We're now expecting our capital, including remodeling and logistics, will be between $6.5 billion and $7 billion We continue to expect to add 11 million square feet of selling space, which will be between 185 and 205 units. We'll also continue to convert discount stores to supercenters. 
The first quarter of fiscal 2012 is under way. Pressure from higher energy and commodity costs are factors that we will watch closely as they affect our own logistics and transportation costs, as well as the prices the customer pays. Rising gas prices and still high unemployment levels way on the minds of our customers. These issues affect discretionary spending in figure into our assessment for guidance. These and government assistance programs continues to rise and is up about 50 basis points over this time last year. Close to 80% of our payment mix is still made up of some form of cash including debit cards. Credit is a form of payment that is dropped from last year and is now less than 14% of our payments tender. 
During the fourth quarter, the deflation in dairy, meat and produce were somewhat offset by deflation in snacks, beverages and dry grocery. Weather issues have affected crop availability in produce and expect to see continued inflation in fresh food categories. 
Labor and higher cotton prices are affecting apparel and home categories. And soft lines, were consolidating suppliers to improved purchasing power and leveraging our buying power with raw material suppliers. We continue to work with our suppliers to reduce inflationary pressure were possible and only pass on price increases when they cannot be avoided. Our logistics team continues to increase productivity and efficiency and I'm happy to report that for the full year, cases per hour were up 5.6% for the year over last year. Our transportation efficiency increase measured in cases per mile improved 4% for the year. I expect ore productivity initiatives can help mitigate higher fuel prices this year and further increase efficiencies in fiscal 2012.
Last year our 13-week comp for the first quarter declined 1.4%. We expect Walmart U.S. comp sales for the first quarter running from January 29, 2011, to April 29, 2011, to range from negative 2% to flat. Let me remind you the changes I outlined will take time before we see positive comp trends. 
We expect productivity initiatives to continue to help us leverage expenses in the first quarter, even on lower sales. We're forecasting our inventory levels to remain somewhat higher than last year through the first half of this year as we implement the changes I've covered. And last, we expect gross margin to be flat to slightly up for the quarter. 
Now I'll turn it over to Charles for the rest of the guidance discussion."
313055,79147929,105001,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2011",2011-02-22,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Let's get right into our financial scorecard. First, growth. Despite continued economic headwinds, we grew both sales and square footage. Sales were up 2.5% for the quarter and 3.4% or almost $14 billion for the year. By adding 511 net units",1024,"Thanks, Bill. Let's get right into our financial scorecard. First, growth. Despite continued economic headwinds, we grew both sales and square footage. Sales were up 2.5% for the quarter and 3.4% or almost $14 billion for the year. By adding 511 net units this year, we continue to provide access for customers to save money so they can ""live better"". That square footage increased by approximately 33 million square feet, to almost 985 million square feet at the end of the year. Walmart International alone contributed over 20 million square feet or more than 60% of this year's increase. Much of this growth in international was focused on emerging markets, where we believe there are excellent growth and return prospects. 
We plan to deliver square footage growth of 3% to 4% and we were just about in the middle, growing selling space by 3.4% for the year. We continue to expect to increase square footage between 3% to 4% for fiscal 2012 and this takes into account our move in the U.S. towards smaller, more productive supercenters. 
Next metric leverage. Our focus on the productivity loop has been a company priority for just over a year. We are proud of the company leveraged expenses now for five consecutive quarters. All segments contributed to the company leveraging expenses for the year. Their continued focus has helped make a significant contribution to our bottom line. This will continue to be an important focal point. 
One area where I can say I'm proud of our progress on leverage is on unallocated corporate overhead. The focus of our corporate support teams paid off with a year-over-year decline in corporate expenses. Looking forward to fiscal 2012, we have some planned investments in global e-commerce which will be reflected in unallocated corporate overhead. These are strategically important to the company but may contribute to higher growth in these unallocated expenses.
As we close of the year, I'd also like to recognize the progress that our teams around the world have made on converting our financial systems to SAP. We're not finished yet but the majority of our business now operates in the new system. We surpassed the largest implementation earlier this year with the transition of our North American operations. The countries still on the list to transition to SAP are all of those in Latin America, China and India. This will provide a common platform to better integrate acquisitions in the future.
Finally, returns. Our commitment, which I mentioned at the October Analyst meeting, was to keep ROI stable, which we did again this year. Return on investment was relatively flat at 19.2% compared to 19.3% last year. This is a very strong return relative to our competitors. I also mentioned back in October that quarterly fluctuations will occur based on our operations. For example, an acquisition may initially be dilutive to ROI. However, in the mid to long term, our continued goal is to maintain a stable ROI.
Free cash flow for the year was $10.9 billion. This is incredibly strong and gives the company tremendous flexibility. Well, let me remind you that last year, we reduced inventories in Walmart U.S. by approximately $2 billion. This made our inventory artificially low and makes the comparison difficult between last year and this year. We were not expecting to be at last year's level and we are very happy with our operating results to produce another year of strong returns. Now let's move on to guidance.
Based on our views of the economic and sales environment in the U.S. and around the world, we expect first quarter of fiscal 2012's diluted earnings per share to be between $0.91 and $0.96, which compares to last year's EPS of $0.87. The companies expectation for full fiscal 2012 EPS is to be between $4.35 and $4.50, an increase from fiscal 2011 underlying EPS of $4.07. These estimates assume that currency exchange rates remain at current levels. For fiscal 2012, we expect the effective tax rate to be between the range of 33.5% and 34.5%, although we may see some quarterly fluctuations. Factors which may affect our rate includes changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies and the mix of international to domestic income. 
In October, we announced our capital expenditure plan of between $13.5 billion and $14.5 billion for the year. Based on where we ended fiscal 2011 and reviewing our capital needs based on efficiencies for new stores and remodels, we are now reducing our guidance to $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion. This lowers the top and bottom of our range by $1 billion. If we have more opportunities to invest in emerging markets like China, we will do so. Let me remind you that this guidance does not include CapEx for any acquisitions. 
The new guidance ranges are as follows. Walmart U.S., $6.5 billion to $7 billion, down from $7.5 billion to $8 billion; Walmart International, $4 billion to $4.5 billion, unchanged; Sam's Club, $1 billion, unchanged; corporate and other, will be $1 billion, unchanged.
I am pleased and honored to serve as Walmart's Chief Financial Officer and I am proud of the finance organization I have the opportunity to lead. We remain committed to driving strong operations with the foundation of a strong financial position and. This is key to delivering long term shareholder growth. This mission is intrinsically linked with our mission to save customers money so they can ""live better"". As a company, we will continue to focus on leveraging our cost structure and global foot range, along with driving the right balance between growth and returns.
Let me remind you of Walmart's key numbers for this fiscal year of 2011 that just ended. Almost $11 billion in free cash flow; a return on investment of over 19%; over 30 million net new square feet; and over $19 billion return to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. These numbers represent the commitment and hard work of our associates around the world, the strength of the Walmart is less and the continued execution of our strategic plans. 
Thank you for your interest in Walmart. Have a great day."

This is Carol Schumacher, Vice President of Investor Relations for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Thanks for joining us today for our earnings call to review both the fourth quarter and the full year of fiscal 2011.
All information for this quarter including updated unit counts, square footage and financial metrics, including ROI, are available on our website at walmartstores.com/investors. A full transcript of the call will be available on the website as well around 7:00 a.m. Central Time today, February 22, 2011.
Today, you'll hear from key Wal-Mart leaders, starting with Mike Duke, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., for the opening comments and key highlights of the quarter and the year; Jeff Davis, in his first call as Wal-Mart’s Treasurer, will cover the consolidated financial details. As you'll see from our press release, we do have some noise with our numbers. Then we'll go to the operating segments. First up this time will be Brian Cornell, President and CEO of Sam's Club; Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart International, will also have highlights on our largest countries within international. We will close the segment discussion with Bill Simon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart U.S. Finally, our CFO, Charles Holley, will cover our financial report card and a variety of points on guidance. 
Before we start to discuss our performance for the quarter, there are a few items to keep in mind as you listen to the results. First, we had certain items that affected our fourth quarter EPS last year, as well as an accounting change in fiscal 2011 that affected [ph] last year. These items need to be considered for comparison purposes. Second, as a reminder, we had a tax benefit from the third quarter, which we reported in November. The tax benefits from the third quarter and the fourth quarter that we're reporting today affect our full year and quarterly results.
Third, I'd also like to point out that during the quarter, we had income from discontinued operations. This income resulted from the recognition of a previously unrecognized tax benefit related to the disposition of our German operations in fiscal year 2007. Including this tax benefit, diluted net income per share attributable to Wal-Mart was $1.70 for the fourth quarter and $4.47 for the full year.
Fourth, this is the last quarter that we'll remind you about our adjusted P&Ls and balance sheets that are available on the Wal-Mart website under Financial Information. Effective with the second quarter of fiscal 2011, Wal-Mart changed the methodology for valuing our inventory. The retrospective application of this accounting change resulted in adjustments to reported amounts. The adjusted financial statements I mentioned earlier cover all of fiscal year 2010 as well as the first quarter of fiscal 2011, and they're on our website. Throughout this call, all earnings and earnings per share amounts reflect the amounts for FY '10 adjusted for this accounting change. 
I'd also like to mention that we're discontinuing our discussion of consolidated membership and other income beginning in fiscal 2012. This line item is most relevant for Sam's Club and they'll continue to discuss it going forward. You'll also note that in today's discussion, as well as in the accompanying press release, we provide disclosure on both reported and underlying earnings per share. The reported EPS takes into consideration all the items, including tax benefits and restructuring charges. The underlying EPS is based on our pure operating performance. You'll hear these terms throughout the discussion today.
Now Mike, let's get started with our Q4 and our full year results. Mike?"
313055,79147929,105168,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2011",2011-02-22,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Carol, and thank you all for joining us. We are pleased with our strong earnings performance for both the quarter and the full year across our three operating segments. At the same time, we are disappointed by our Wal-Mart U.S. fourth quarter s",1114,"Thank you, Carol, and thank you all for joining us. We are pleased with our strong earnings performance for both the quarter and the full year across our three operating segments. At the same time, we are disappointed by our Wal-Mart U.S. fourth quarter sales. Earnings per share for both the fourth quarter and the full year exceeded the guidance we provided last quarter. We are reporting $1.41 per share for the quarter and $4.18 per share for the full year. These numbers include certain tax benefits that positively impacted EPS, and Jeff will cover this shortly.
Based on the underlying performance of the company, our earnings per share were $1.34 for the fourth quarter, which exceeded First Call consensus and our guidance. Wal-Mart increased net sales from the previous year by almost $14 billion to $419 billion. As a company, we leveraged the expenses for the quarter and the year, reinforcing our commitment to the productivity loop and EDLC.
Operating income rose to more than $25 billion for the full year, a 6.4% increase over what we reported this time last year. We continue to deliver strong free cash flow, closing the year with almost $11 billion. We met our goal to deliver stable return on investment, and finished the year again with ROI above 19%.
For the year, we returned a record $19.2 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchase. Let me pause for a moment. $19.2 billion return to shareholders. Now that was worth repeating. However, as I said, sales for Wal-Mart U.S. were below our expectations for the fourth quarter. The team did manage expenses well during the quarter and contributed operating income growth of almost 5%. Bill has a clear vision today of the underlying issues, and his action plan addresses the areas critical to the sales turnaround. Some of the pricing and merchandising issues in Wal-Mart U.S. ran deeper than we initially expected, and they require response that will take time to see results. Price leadership is critical to our success. We will reinforce our commitment to deliver EDLP. This is what Wal-Mart was built on.
We will deliver a merchandise assortment and presentation relevant to our customers. As Bill will share with you, many of the fourth quarter problems stem from merchandise assortment and presentation issues that contributed to customer traffic declines, as well as some of the issues related to the remodeling program. I believe Bill is on the right track to see sales improvement throughout the year. Let me be direct on this point. There is no greater priority for me or for Bill than getting sales back into positive territory. 
Wal-Mart U.S. will also continue to grow through our supercenters and additional formats. We will move forward with even greater urgency in opening small stores. I'm encouraged by the response we're seeing in urban markets like Chicago, Washington, D.C., San Diego and New York.
It's no surprise that we see growing opportunities in online shopping. I am pleased with the sales results of Walmart.com during the fourth quarter and expect e-commerce and multichannel to play an increasingly important role across our business. Sam's Club now has annual sales just shy of $50 billion. I am pleased that the Sam's organization is really contributing to our shareholder value. Sam's Club turned in a strong performance for the year, delivering comp sales near the top end of guidance. Brian and his team grew net sales 4.4% for the quarter and 3.5% for the year. Sam's comp sales, without fuel, improved sequentially every quarter, with fourth quarter being the strongest. We're seeing the comp sales momentum continue and expect strength in the first quarter. Attracting new members will continue to be the top priority for the year ahead. 
Wal-Mart International continued to be our growth engine and we expect accelerated growth ahead. International net sales exceeded $109 billion this year, an increase of more than 12%. Every market contributed a sales increase in fiscal 2011 compared to the prior year. For the full year, International grew operating income faster than sales.
We added 458 net units this year and almost 8% more selling space in our international markets. Almost 70% of the additional square footage came in two important emerging markets: Mexico and China. I've told our international leaders that I'd like to see them accelerate organic growth in our emerging markets.
We also will grow through acquisitions. We look forward to closing the Massmart transaction in South Africa and expanding our presence in many sub-Saharan African markets. In the U.K., we continue to work towards finalizing the acquisition of the Netto stores.
I'd like to specifically recognize our business in Japan, where our Seiyu stores continued their strong focus on Every Day Low Price and operational efficiencies. As a result, Wal-Mart Japan has grown full year profits for each of the past three years, with this fiscal year being the best of the three years.
You're familiar with our company mission of helping our customers save money so they can live better. Our engagement on the ""live better"" societal issues continues to have a meaningful impact in our communities. Doug and I had the opportunity to share some of our experiences with leaders from companies and countries around the world at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland last month. 
We found there's a lot of interest in our global commitment to sustainable agriculture and our new initiative in the U.S. to make the food we sell healthier, and healthier foods more affordable for our customers. We were honored that First Lady Michelle Obama joined Bill Simon to launch this initiative last month. 
We recognize that around the world, there is growing concern about inflation and higher prices, particularly in food and energy. I believe that Wal-Mart is one of the best positioned retailers around the world to handle these kinds of headwinds, because of our commitment to EDLC and EDLP. This is something we will continue to address. You'll hear more about this from our business leaders. 
As I look ahead for this fiscal year, I am confident that no retailer is better positioned to win globally than Wal-Mart. We will not waver in our commitment to our customers. Our financial priorities of growth, leverage and returns guide us in our decisions and strategies. We will continue to add square footage and new formats. We will grow sales and increase comps. We will continue to leverage operating expenses through the productivity loop and we will continue to maximize our returns to the shareholders through dividends, share repurchase and a stable ROI. 
Now Jeff will cover the details on our consolidated financial results. Jeff?"

For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, Wal-Mart delivered income from continuing operations of $5 billion, an increase of 4.3% from last year. Reported earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart were $1.41, an increase of 11.9% compared to $1.26 for the fourth quarter last year.
We have some noise in both this year's and last year's earnings per share numbers that I would like to explain further. This year, we recorded $243 million of net tax benefits, primarily from the repatriation of certain non-U.S. earnings that increased U.S. foreign tax credits. This net tax benefit added approximately $0.07 to our reported EPS of $1.41 for the fourth quarter. 
By comparison, last year's $1.26 per share had both a benefit and a charge in the fourth quarter. First, we incurred charges for several business restructurings in the amount of $260 million, or $162 million after-tax. These charges reduced our reported EPS by approximately $0.04 per share. Second, we recorded $372 million of net tax benefits primarily from the repatriation of certain non-U.S. earnings that increased U.S. foreign tax credits. These net tax benefit added approximately $0.09 to our reported EPS. 
In summary, our fourth quarter underlying EPS grew 10.7% from $1.21 last year to $1.34 this year, which was above our guidance of $1.29 to $1.33 per share. The $1.34 earnings per share points to the strength of our consolidated business.
For the full year, earnings from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart were $15.4 billion, an increase of 6.3% over last year. For the fiscal year, reported earnings per share and underlying earnings per share from continuing operations were $4.18 and $4.07, respectively versus our adjusted EPS of $3.73 and underlying EPS of $3.67 last year. The underlying $4.07 excluded certain tax benefits recorded in the third and fourth quarters that aggregate to approximately $0.11 per share for the fiscal year. 
Earlier, Carol mentioned an important point. In the fourth quarter, the company recognized in discontinued operations an approximately $1 billion tax benefit in connection with the disposition of our German operation in fiscal 2007. This matter was resolved with the United States Internal Revenue Service during the fourth quarter of this fiscal year. Now let's dive into the fourth quarter and the fiscal year results.
Consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter increased 2.5% or almost $2.8 billion to $115.6 billion. Net sales included a currency exchange rate benefit of $664 million. On a constant currency basis, sales grew 1.9%. The 13-week U.S. comp sales, without fuel, declined 1.1%. You'll hear more details on the Wal-Mart U.S. and Sam's comp sales from Bill and Brian.
Gross margin for the quarter was flat to last year at 24.6% of sales. Fourth quarter consolidated operating income was $8 billion, up 7.3% or $546 million from last year. This includes a currency exchange rate benefit of $58 million. On a constant currency basis, consolidated operating income grew 6.5%. 
Operating income grew faster than sales by leveraging operating expenses. The productivity loop is a priority focus throughout the company. Expenses grew approximately 50 basis points on sales growth of 2.5%, which is the fifth consecutive quarter that expenses grew slower than sales.
Unallocated corporate overhead grew 9.1% to $505 million for the quarter. What we classify as core within our corporate overhead expense actually decreased 3% for the quarter. The mark-to-market of several unallocated foreign currency derivative positions was the primary driver of the increase. It is important to note that unallocated corporate overhead decreased 2% to about $1.7 billion for the year.
On a consolidated basis, membership and other income declined 4.5% or $36 million this quarter compared to last year. For the year, membership and other income was down 1.9% or $56 million. As Carol remarked, membership and other income continues to be an important part of the Sam's Club business but to a lesser degree for the other segments.
Net interest expense for the quarter increased 13.4% to $532 million. For the fiscal year, net interest expense was $2 billion, an increase of 6.4%. This was driven by higher debt levels but partially offset by lower interest rates. Our AA credit rating allowed us to access low-cost debt. As a reminder, earlier this year, we issued $5 billion of debt at some of the lowest corporate rates on record at the time. We continue to have ample access to the credit markets. At the end of the year, our debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 42.1% compared to 37% at the end of last year.
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 30.7% and 32.2% for the year. This was due to the net tax benefits we previously discussed. These items reduced our effective tax rate by approximately 320 basis points for the quarter and approximately 180 basis points for the fiscal year.
Net sales were approximately $419 billion for the year, which is an increase of 3.4% or $13.8 billion over last year. Net sales included a currency exchange benefit of $4.5 billion. On a constant currency basis, our net sales for fiscal 2011 grew 2.3%. As a reminder, currency translation negatively impacted sales by $9.8 billion in fiscal 2010. For the 52-week period ended January 28, 2011, U.S. comp sales without fuel declined 1.1%.
Consolidated operating income was $25.5 billion, an increase of 6.4% from last year, and included $231 million from currency rate fluctuations. On a constant currency basis, consolidated operating income grew 5.5% to $25.3 billion. Consistent with our quarterly results, operating income grew faster than sales for the year as we leverage expenses. Expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 32 basis points.
This year was another strong year for cash flow generation. We closed the year with free cash flow of $10.9 billion. Recall last year, free cash flow was $14.1 billion, enhanced by the artificially low inventory position at year end. Annual CapEx spend was $12.7 billion, which was lower than our most recent guidance of $13 billion to $14 billion. This resulted from lower spending and timing associated with the Wal-Mart U.S. segment. CapEx spend for the fourth quarter was $3.4 billion.
We paid almost $1.1 billion in dividends this quarter and $4.4 billion for the year. As a reminder, we increased our dividends per share 11% to $1.21 from $1.09 in fiscal year 2010.
Wal-Mart repurchased approximately $3.8 billion of shares during the fourth quarter and $14.8 billion for the year, which is the most we ever repurchased. This represents nearly 70 million and 280 million shares, respectively. We have approximately $4.8 billion remaining on our $15 billion share repurchase authorization announced in June of 2010.
In summary, Wal-Mart returned $19.2 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase for the fiscal year. As Mike noted, this is truly a record return to our shareholders. Payables as a percentage of inventories for the company were 92.4%, relatively stable from 93.1% last year. Although inventory levels increased 11%, consolidated inventory turns were flat with the prior year. In addition, we effectively manage payables. 
We continue to produce a consistently high and stable ROI. We finished the year with 19.2% return on investment compared to 19.3% at the end of last year. 
Now, let's move on to a discussion of our operating segments. We'll start with Sam's Club. Brian?"
313055,79147929,105168,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2011",2011-02-22,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jeff. As I've shared with you during the fiscal year, our strategy is to meet our members' needs and deliver on the Sam's Club brand promise of simplifying our members' lives by helping them make smart choices. We achieved that promise by under",1903,"Thank you, Jeff. As I've shared with you during the fiscal year, our strategy is to meet our members' needs and deliver on the Sam's Club brand promise of simplifying our members' lives by helping them make smart choices. We achieved that promise by understanding what our members want and providing the merchandise they want at the quality and value they expect. It's important to remember that in last year's fourth quarter, we took a charge for restructuring our operations related to the closure of 10 clubs. Our discussion today therefore excludes that charge of $174 million for comparative purposes.
I am very excited to share our results with you today. As they indicate, Sam's members are responding to the offering and experience in our clubs. We had a strong quarter and are very pleased with our club performance. Thanks to the efforts of our dedicated managers and associates, we grew sales and operating profit, as well as leveraged expenses for the quarter and the fiscal year. Let's start with the fourth quarter results. 
Comp club sales, excluding fuel, increased 2.7% for the 13-week period ending January 28, 2011. I am very pleased to share with you that we were at the top end of our guidance of a comp club increase of 1% to 3% for the fourth quarter. As Mike mentioned, Sam's reported sequential comp improvement quarter-over-quarter throughout the year.
Overall, comp ticket and traffic, excluding fuel, increased for the 13-week period by 210 and 70 basis points, respectively. We are also pleased that our members, both Business and Advantage, visited with us more often and put more items in their basket and flat beds during the quarter. Sales during the quarter were particularly strong in fresh foods and grocery, health and wellness, home and apparel categories.
Sam's Club operating income for the fourth quarter increased slightly versus last year to $487 million. Excluding fuel, operating income for the fourth quarter was flat versus last year. And now, highlights for Sam's for the full year.
Comp club sales, excluding fuel, increased 1.7% for the 52-week period. Overall comp ticket, excluding fuel, increased for the 52-week period by 180 basis points. While overall comp traffic declined slightly, we did see increases in frequency of visit by both our Advantage and Business members.
Operating income grew 1.3% to $1.7 billion versus last year. We opened four new clubs during the fiscal year, with the most recent opening in January in Sharpsburg, Georgia. We are investing more aggressively in member acquisition ahead of club openings and are seeing positive results. We continue to see growth in the Sam's Club brand in our international markets as Doug and his team opened 14 new Sam's Clubs this fiscal year. We continue to work with the international team to share best practices across the organization to ensure we are meeting our members' needs, both in the U.S. and around the world.
We also continue to improve our member experience by updating our older clubs. We completed 65 club remodels, expanded two clubs and relocated three clubs during the fiscal year. Now let's turn to the detailed financial results. 
For the fourth quarter, net sales for Sam's Club, excluding fuel, increased to $11.9 billion which is a 2.5% increase over last year's fourth quarter. Including fuel, fourth quarter sales were $13.1 billion, which is a 4.4% increase versus last year. Price and volume of fuel contributed almost equally to the increase in fuel sales.
For the fiscal year, net sales for Sam's Club, excluding fuel, increased 1.4% versus last year to $45.2 billion. Including fuel, net sales for the fiscal year were $49.5 billion, which is an increase of 3.5% versus last year. Fuel increases were driven by 17% increases in fuel prices and a 12% increase in gallons sold for the full year versus last year. Including fuel, comp club sales increased 4.5% and 3.7% for both the 13-week and 52-week period, respectively.
Comp ticket, excluding fuel, increased for both Business and Advantage members for both the 13-week and the 52-week period. Comp traffic, excluding fuel for both the 13-week and the 52-week period, increased for our Advantage members and declined for our Business members. Additionally, we saw our frequency improve for both Business and Advantage members, for the quarter and the fiscal year. So our members are shopping with us more often and putting more items in their baskets and flat beds. While traffic may be down with our Business members, frequency and ticket are up. We expect to continue to see pressure on Business members through late fiscal 2012.
During the holidays, we focused our messaging on feeding the family and home entertaining, and these messages delivered strong sales in fresh foods, grocery and beverages. We introduced approximately 100 new fresh foods, including bakery programs for cookies, cake and artisan breads. The new product launches all drove mid-double-digit comp sales. And in our Freezer/Cooler category, we introduced a new high-quality appetizer program, which also drove mid-double-digit comps. Inflation in selected meat, produce and dairy categories aided increases in average unit price, partially offset by downward unit pressure.
We also had a very successful holiday season in key discretionary categories, such as home, domestics and apparel. The team did a great job providing high-quality merchandise and preferred brands at a tremendous value to our members. We transitioned well from holiday season, minimizing markdowns and ending the year in a strong inventory position. 
Relative to the industry, we are very pleased with the sales of our electronics and technology categories in the fourth quarter and grew market share over the fiscal year. Members responded well to our strong brand offering, including LG and the Apple iPhone and iPad. We continue to experience price pressure in electronics, especially in televisions, but had positive unit sales growth of TVs for the quarter. Our expanded health and wellness offering continues to drive strong sales performance. Tobacco and fuel sales also continue to deliver strong comps. 
Sam's gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased by eight basis points during the fourth quarter, primarily driven by the continued [ph] shift in merchandising mix towards higher margin fresh products, very effective management of seasonal merchandise to minimize markdowns and improved global sourcing. Through improved sourcing, we decreased our damage rates throughout the year. Including fuel, the gross margin rate for the quarter decreased 11 basis points compared to last year.
Recall that last year's inventory levels were lower than our historic levels due to inventory management initiatives. It's not surprising that our inventory is up. We closed the year with inventory up 14% compared to this time last year. We feel we've returned to a more comfortable inventory level that provides a good balance of flow and availability. We anticipate this trend of period-over-period inventory growth to continue into the first quarter. Additionally, we have shifted shipping volume forward into the year to meet our earlier club seasonal transition dates. Due to these items, our inventory turns were down slightly in the fourth quarter.
Operating expenses for the fourth quarter grew 3.4% versus last year. During the fourth quarter, we incurred charges for certain assets that were taken out of service, including the temporary closure of a club in Rhode Island we plan to rebuild, as well as costs associated with continued restructuring of our field organization. If you exclude these items, we leveraged operating expenses by approximately six basis points.
For the fiscal year, operating expenses grew 2.5%, driven by credit card interchange fees, remodeling, and higher marketing investments that drive traffic. Despite this, we were still able to leverage expenses for the fiscal year. For the quarter, sales per labor hour increased 223 basis points. Units per labor hour increased 27 basis points for the fourth quarter versus last year. For the fiscal year, sales per labor hour increased 198 basis points and units per labor hour increased 172 basis points. 
Membership and other income for the fourth quarter decreased 1.9% from last year. Membership income, the primary driver, was flat for the fourth quarter versus last year. Other income decreased 15% due to last year's results being favorably impacted by a number of miscellaneous items, none of which was individually significant to the financial statement. For the fiscal year, membership and other income decreased 2.2% driven in part by a favorable accounting adjustment in the third quarter of last year to membership income. Excluding the effects of the accounting adjustment last year, membership income, the primary driver, increased approximately 80 basis points compared to last year. The increase was driven by strength in our Plus membership upgrades, as well as the number of new members joining at the Plus level.
We continue to be pleased with the progress of our eValues program for Plus members, as we enhanced the program to make it even more meaningful for our members. Additionally, we are further simplifying the way we communicate value offered to our Plus member. For example, we've always offered a discount to our Plus members on their prescriptions, but the discount varied across prescriptions. Now it's a simplified program, with an 8% discount on branded prescriptions and a 40% discount on generics, not part of our $4 and $10 generic prescription plan. Our members understand it clearly and it's paying off with upgrades.
Our membership renewal rates remained steady throughout the year. Our win back program targeted to inactive members also contributed to our improved membership rates. We expect small businesses to continue to be under pressure throughout fiscal 2012 and anticipate continued softness in business member sign-ups.
For the fiscal year, operating income increased 1.3% versus last year. Fiscal 2012 is underway. Our plan is focused on delivering the financial priorities of growth, leverage and return. Our existing fleet of U.S. clubs will grow. As we shared with you in October, we plan to add between seven and 12 new, expanded or relocated clubs next year in the United States. Sam's Club has committed a significant portion of our capital spend to remodels. We expect to complete remodels on 60 to 70 clubs this year. Our CapEx plan for the fiscal year remains the same at approximately $1 billion.
Our strategic initiatives will continue to be driven by insights, quality and innovation. In merchandising, we continue to provide our members the best prices on everyday need purchases, leverage fresh foods and grocery to feed our members' family, continue investing in areas like technology services and expand our progress in making Sam's Club a destination for our members' health and wellness needs.
In membership, we will step up our efforts to attract new members and continue to focus on building relationships with existing members across a variety of touch points, including eValues, wireless network access in clubs, our smartphone application and an improved .com site to allow for easier member interaction, and operations we are focused on driving member experiences that are efficient and engaging.
Our sales momentum for fiscal 2011 is carrying over into the first few weeks of the new fiscal year. We expect comp sales, without fuel, for the current 13-week period from January 29, 2011 through April 29, 2011, to increase between 1% and 3%. Last year, Sam's Club comp, without fuel, for the first quarter comparable 13-week period rose 70 basis points. 
Now I'll turn it over to Doug to tell you about Wal-Mart International. Doug?"
313055,79147929,105168,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2011",2011-02-22,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brian. This year has been another one of meaningful achievement for the team in Wal-Mart International, both in financial terms and in our positive impact in the communities we serve around the world. Our financial goals remain grounded in growth,",2613,"Thanks, Brian. This year has been another one of meaningful achievement for the team in Wal-Mart International, both in financial terms and in our positive impact in the communities we serve around the world. Our financial goals remain grounded in growth, leverage and returns, and Wal-Mart International continues to have strong growth in both net sales and operating income. On the topic of growth, I'm pleased to say that we've met our goals of opening locally relevant formats as we discussed in the October meeting for the investment community. In fiscal 2011, our organic growth included 458 net new stores, representing an 11.2% increase in store count and a 7.8% increase in square footage. This growth includes 282 new stores in smaller formats, each less than 40,000 square feet. 
In addition to comp store sales growth and the delivery of our new stores, we are excited about our pending investment in South Africa and the sub-Saharan region of Africa. In addition, we continue to work towards completion of our acquisition of the Netto stores in the U.K. 
Given that we're recapping the end of the year, please allow me to take just a minute and highlight some of the successes our teams have delivered beyond the quarterly financial results. For the second year in a row, Wal-Mart Central America was named the Most Admired Multinational Company in Central America. Wal-Mart China received several honors including the Best Retail Place to Work and a China Best Employer. Our ASDA team in the U.K. was selected as Britain's Best Value Retailer for the 12th consecutive year. In addition, Wal-Mart Mexico's foundation received the prestigious 2010 World Business and Development Award granted by the United Nations development program, the International Chamber of Commerce and the International Business Leaders Forum. The award recognized the foundation's indigenous product commercialization program, which offers training and funding to boost the production processes of marginalized communities and indigenous groups living in isolated regions to improve their income and quality of life.
And in India, we opened our second training center to teach our associate candidates the skills of being a successful Wal-Mart retailer. Enabling our associates in India is a critical part of our success. You can imagine the students' surprise when, while he was in India recently, Mike Duke stopped by the classroom to answer their questions. To date, more than 3,000 students have been certified and 1,050 have been placed in various jobs, out of which nearly 200 are placed in our best priced modern wholesale cash and carry stores. These are the associates that will help us fuel our growth in the country. 
Now let's get to the numbers. For the full year, our business achieved constant currency sales of $104.8 billion or 7.6% growth over fiscal 2010. Our constant currency operating income of $5.4 billion grew even faster at 9.7%. I'm also pleased to say that we leveraged operating expenses for the year. All markets grew full year constant currency sales over last year, with some of the highest increases coming from Brazil, China and Mexico. On a constant currency basis, operating expenses grew slower than sales at 5.8% due to strong expense management in Japan and the United Kingdom. On a constant currency basis, gross margin as a percentage of sales was flat to last year. 
On a reported basis, Wal-Mart International's net sales were $109.2 billion in fiscal 2011, growing 12.5% over fiscal 2010. This includes a $4.5 billion benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Operating income was $5.6 billion, including a benefit of $231 million from changes in currency exchange rates. 
Now turning to our fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter constant currency sales were $30.7 billion, growing 6.6% over last year. On a constant currency basis, operating income was $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter constant currency operating income growth of 4% was slower than sales growth. While gross profit margin and expenses remain constant as a percentage of sales, this year's constant currency operating income did not have the benefits of real estate sales in Canada that we had last year. 
Constant currency operating expenses as a percentage of sales were flat to last year as expense leverage in Mexico and the U.K. offset pressures in our other markets. On a reported basis, fourth quarter net sales were $31.4 billion, growing 8.9% from last year. Net sales for the fourth quarter include a $664 million benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Fourth quarter operating income was $2 billion, including a $58 million benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. 
For the quarter, we did not meet our goal of growing inventory at less than half the rate of sales and we're intent on making improvements here. On a constant currency basis, inventory grew at 12.6%. Days-on-hand increased 0.4 days over last year. Adding many of this year's new stores in the fourth quarter had a significant effect on this metric. 
Now let's get into the results for several of our larger markets. As a reminder, we hold country management accountable for their results on a local currency basis without the impact of potential swings and exchange rates. The following discussion of country results excludes the impact of currency and unless otherwise stated, sales and comps are presented in nominal rates. In Mexico, Walmex continues to deliver great results, growing sales in the fourth quarter and growing operating income faster than sales. Until Walmex has annualized its March 2010 acquisition of Central American operations, the following discussion will include only Walmex's results in Mexico. While the following results are on a U.S. GAAP basis, Walmex separately reports its earnings under Mexican GAAP, so some of the numbers may be different.
Walmex's net sales for the fourth quarter were up 9.2% and comparable store sales were up 2.9%. The sales growth at Walmex is driven by the 255 stores and six restaurants that have opened since the fourth quarter of last year, positive comp growth in all Walmex formats and good holiday sales. Customer traffic increased 10 basis points and average ticket increased 2.9% in comparable stores. For the fourth quarter, Walmex comp store sales for self-service formats grew by 2.5%, while ANTAD's comp store sales report for the rest of the industry excluding Walmex showed only 1.3% growth. 
Walmex's fourth quarter operating income grew faster than sales at 15.2% on a higher gross profit margin and expense leverage. Fourth quarter gross profit margin as a percentage of sales increased 79 basis points from last year, and discipline in expenses allowed for expenses as a percentage of sales to decline by 27 basis points. 
Moving on to Brazil. Net sales grew in the fourth quarter amid some exciting changes that are happening in our operations there. However, we did not grow operating income faster than sales. Although we are disappointed with this year's results in Brazil, we've already begun the changes to see business improvement. In January, Brazil began implementing EDLP. Shelf prices on more than 2,000 items were reduced the week of the launch and additional items are being moved to EDLP every week. Over the long term, we expect the EDLP in Brazil to increase sales volume and reduce operating costs as we've seen in Japan. During this period of change, however, we expect some sales pressure in Brazil. 
In real terms, Brazil's fourth quarter sales growth was 7.8% and comparable store sales were flat. Customer traffic at comparable stores declined 5.2% and average ticket increased 5.5%, both in real terms. Sales at our cash and carry and supermarket formats performed well during the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter gross profit margin as a percentage of sales increased 93 basis points over last year due to margin pressure last year. Expenses as a percentage of sales increased 161 basis points, primarily due to adding many of this year's new stores in the fourth quarter. This increase in expenses caused Brazil's operating income to decline by 41.7% from last year. In the past 12 months, we have opened 45 new stores in Brazil, bringing our total store count to 479. This includes 27 new stores in the fourth quarter of this year.
Moving to Asia. Wal-Mart Japan has seen success from its implementation of EDLP, growing sales in the fourth quarter. However, operating income did not grow faster than sales. The results are showing that customers prefer EDLP. Based on information from the Japanese Ministry of the Economy, Trade and Industry or METI, our performance continues to stay ahead of other large-scale retailers in Japan and we are increasing our market share in a deflationary environment. 
Fourth quarter net sales and comparable store sales increased approximately 3.1%, both in real terms. Wal-Mart Japan's traffic increased 2% over last year as the newly remodeled stores continue to attract customers, and average ticket in real terms increased 1.5%. Wal-Mart Japan sales of food, consumables and general merchandise each showed a strong performance, while apparel sales were down. Gross profit margin as a percentage of sales increased slightly by 19 basis points from last year and expenses as a percentage of sales increased 63 basis points from last year. As with last year, fourth quarter operations were again profitable. As Mike mentioned earlier, Wal-Mart Japan has grown full year profits for each of the past three years, with this fiscal year being the best of the three years. We look forward to the continued impact of EDLP there.
Overall, China sales grew in the fourth quarter as well, but operating income did not grow faster than sales. Net sales for the fourth quarter in Wal-Mart China grew 9.6% over last year and comparable stores growth was 1.8%. Average ticket grew 9.6% in China but traffic declined 7.2%. The primary traffic decline resulted from Trust-Mart finalizing its merchandising transition to Wal-Mart assortments. Fourth quarter gross profit as a percentage of sales increased 96 basis points over last year, primarily due to purchasing efficiencies from growing sales and a reduction in the low-margin assortments at Trust-Mart. Expenses as a percentage of sales grew 197 basis points primarily due to the lower sales during the Trust-Mart merchandising transition to Wal-Mart's assortments. Fourth quarter operating income declined approximately 8%. 
In the past 12 months, we opened 49 new stores including 45 supercenters and that brings our China store count to 328 stores. Wal-Mart and the selling shareholder of Trust-Mart have mutually agreed to extend the closing of the remaining Trust-Mart stores to May 26, 2011, while certain conditions of the contract are completed. 
Before moving on, let's give a brief update on India. As you know, we support Bharti Retail and their new store growth in India. Bharti Retail, whose stores are excluded from our store counts, opened 30 new stores in the fourth quarter of this year and now operates 118 supermarkets and 10 compact hypermarkets. In our separate joint venture with Bharti, we've increased the number of cash and carry stores to five. Fourth quarter comparable sales at our cash and carry stores increased 11.3% over last year.
Turning now to the United Kingdom. ASDA continued to grow sales and operating income in the fourth quarter of this year. However, operating income grew at a slower rate than sales as ASDA increased price investments during the holiday season. In the fourth quarter of this year, comparable sales, excluding fuel, increased 1.6% with overall sales growth in the low single digits. Average ticket grew 3% and traffic declined 1.4% in the fourth quarter as customers made larger purchases and shopped less frequently in the U.K.'s record December snowstorm. Sales were strong in clothing, toys and sports, and grocery.
ASDA launched its price guarantee last April where customers can go online and with a few clicks, check their basket price against competitors. Over 1 million customers checked their baskets in 2010. Recently, ASDA strengthened its commitment to price, guaranteeing to be 10% cheaper than its competitors and an additional 800,000 baskets have already been checked under the 10% program. Gross profit as a percentage of sales declined slightly in the fourth quarter. Expenses as a percentage of sales were slightly lower than last year under ASDA's ""We Operate for Less"" program. However, the expense performance was not enough to offset the decline in gross margin peer
ASDA continues to broaden its appeal and sales of ASDA's premium brand ""Extra Special"" performed strongly over the Christmas period. According to Kantar Worldpanel, ""Extra Special"" was the fastest growing premium brand of the major retailers. Chosen By You, ASDA's mid-tier private label continues to perform well, and in the first quarter of next year will be extended to grocery, meal solutions and chilled foods. 
ASDA opened six new stores during the fourth quarter, including four superstores and two supermarkets. ASDA's commitment to Saving Customers Money Every Day will be more important in 2011 as VAT taxes in the U.K. have risen to 20% compared to 17.5% at this time last year and fuel prices rise to record levels. 
And finally with Canada. Wal-Mart Canada sales grew in the fourth quarter of this year. However, operating income did not grow faster than sales. Net sales grew 4.8% in the fourth quarter compared to last year, primarily due to the supercenter expansion program and strong sales in food, hardlines and health and wellness. This translated into fourth quarter comparable sales growth of 40 basis points. As a percentage of sales, gross margin was relatively unchanged from last year's higher rate and expenses were relatively unchanged from last year as strong cost controls in our retail operations offset the costs from our new bank. 
Operating income declined as last year's results included the gains from sales of some of our real estate properties. Excluding these gains, operating income would have increased from the fourth quarter of last year. While operating income from our retail operations grew in line with sales, this growth was offset by the startup costs of our new bank.  Average ticket increased 60 basis points for the fourth quarter and traffic declined 20 basis points. 
In the past 12 months, we opened eight new stores in Canada, bringing our store count to 325 stores. In fiscal 2012, we expect to open 40 new supercenters in key regions around the country. Canada continues to offer significant opportunity and we have a winning strategy to capture a greater share of this market. Building on our long track record of growth and performance, we are confident in our ability to expand and we see a long-term opportunity to serve our customers in more ways. 
I'd also like to mention that in the beginning of the fourth quarter, Canada opened the first sustainable fresh food distribution center estimated to be 60% more energy-efficient than traditional refrigerated centers and saving approximately $4.8 million in energy costs over five years. The 400,000-square-foot Balzac facility is among the most energy-efficient distribution centers in North America. 
Looking forward into fiscal 2012, we remain committed to sales growth and growing our operating income faster than sales each quarter. Our expectations for organic growth include 23 million to 24 million new square feet in our current markets, including significant investments in soft discount formats in Mexico and Brazil, and larger formats in China and Canada. We expect our capital expenditures to continue to range between $4 billion and $4.5 billion for the fiscal year.
Our focus on price leadership, customer service and productivity have produced good results for fiscal 2011 and we're well prepared to meet our fiscal goals in 2012 in more than 4,550 stores.

Our 1.8% comp decline for the fourth quarter didn't meet anyone's expectations. They certainly didn't meet mine, period. For the fourth quarter and the full year, we again delivered strong operating income and we continue to leverage operating expenses. The P&L is in excellent shape, all we need is top line growth. 
Let me start with the fourth quarter recap of merchandising and I'll get into financial results for the quarter and the full year and wrap up with a look at our expectations going forward. 
Certainly as others have reported, whether an individual tax refund loan delays or headwinds for the fourth quarter sales, but the primary factor for our negative comp sales performance was General Merchandise and more specifically, electronics. It's no surprise that General Merchandise makes up a larger percentage of our sales mix for the fourth quarter, and electronics, which comprises the largest portion of the overall General Merchandise sales mix, had continued price deflation. Despite the price pressure on TVs, we still had positive unit growth and we grew market share.
There are some bright spots in electronics. Though you may not have seen it on the sales line, we again had very strong sales of our prepaid wireless products in the fourth quarter. But recall, that we can only account for commission on sales of prepaid wireless products and services, as well as third-party gift cards. Had we been able to account for the full sale, we would have added 60 basis points to the fourth quarter comps.
I'm pleased with our sales performance in Food and Health and Wellness businesses. Food, our largest business, delivered positive low single-digit comps in the fourth quarter. We believe the additional assortment we put in the grocery increased our relevancy for customers. We brought back many opening price point items that were important to our core customers to help generate traffic and loyalty. The modular changes for SKU add-backs in Food were mostly completed by November and contributed to better sales. The quality improvements we've made in our Produce business are also taking hold with our customers. 
Health and Wellness comp sales were positive, driven by improvements in both pharmacy and over-the-counter categories. This came despite supply headwinds in OTC, driven by ongoing issues as a result of recalls by key suppliers and a larger-than-expected generic mix. We see many encouraging trends in our Health and Wellness business. First, our new Humana drug program enrolled more people than we expected. This provided some tailwind toward the end of the fourth quarter and we'll continue to do so this fiscal year. Second, the cold and cough season is picking up traction and we're well prepared. 
Our Consumables business had low single-digit negative comps for the quarter. We'll complete our new modular sets in the first quarter, which will help us highlight opening price points and recapture traffic loss to competitors. However, in categories where we've already made modular changes such as paper products, we're seeing positive sales momentum, driven by improved customer conversion and offsetting commodity-driven deflation. 
We posted mid-single-digit negative comps in apparel. We have seen improving sales trends in Men's, Ladies' Plus and Women's offset by a pullback in Juniors. Customers are also buying closer to need, particularly in seasonal apparel. I'm encouraged by recent trends as we add back assortment in key apparel categories including shoes and accessories.
Home comps were low single-digit negative, though winter weather helped drive sales in snow removal and bedding. Promotional and new items as well as home management, floor care and dining did well for the holidays. Home decor continues to face headwinds. 
Sales in our seasonal category were slightly below projections in the fourth quarter. We lost sales by having seasonal merchandise spread across too many areas of the store during the fourth quarter. Going forward, our seasonal merchandise for holidays such as Easter, Halloween and Christmas will have integrated targeted plans to present a more compelling presentation and product offering for our customers.
Our In-store Toy business was slightly negative over the holiday season. However, combined with tremendous online Toy growth, our overall Toy sales met our expectations this holiday season. Our last General Merchandise category, hardlines, had a comp decline in low single digits. Sales growth of course sporting goods and automotive categories where we started to add back assortment, offset softer sales in large exercise equipment, crafts, stationery and books. 
I shared with you last quarter that we began reassorting our General Merchandise categories, adding back deleted items and categories and making space allocation changes. This process will take longer than it did in the Food side of the business. With the longer lead times in General Merchandise, we will be working on this throughout the year. Product cycle times, modular changes and department space allocations are scheduled to change throughout the year. Our goal is to gain traction on these before we get into the General Merchandise-rich fourth quarter. 
We know the power of online shopping, which industry reports said grew by 11% during the fourth quarter. Walmart.com's fourth quarter sales growth exceeded the industry and were on par with the industry leaders, and this too is a competitive advantage as we offer customers the opportunity to shop on their terms. 
Now let us get into the financial details for the fourth quarter and the full year. As I mentioned, comp sales for the 13-week period were negative 1.8%. Slower traffic was a major factor in the comp decline, and average ticket was up slightly versus the prior year. For the full year, comps on a 4-5-4 basis declined 1.6%. For the 52-week period, average ticket was up slightly, traffic drove the majority of the comp decline. All financial details beyond comp are provided on the fiscal quarter and the year. For the full year, net sales were up 13 basis points but declined 46 basis points in the fourth quarter. 
Inventory was up 8.2% compared to last year. Recall, we ended last year with low inventory levels as a result of our aggressive inventory reduction program. Aside from our sales shortfall in this year's fourth quarter, some of our planned initiatives deliberately increased inventory, namely the addition of merchandise on Action Alley and increased assortment. In fact, these two initiatives contributed approximately 120 basis points of the total growth. At the end of the year, we did not have any significant inventory exposure. In fact, inventory turns in the fourth quarter were flat with last year.
Gross profit dollars improved 15 basis points for the fourth quarter. The sales decline and lower margin electronics merchandise led to a favorable mix. Gross margin rate was up 17 basis points for the quarter as a result of the favorable mix. For the year, gross margin was up $11 million or two basis points over the prior year. Our gross margin rate for the year was basically flat. 
We leveraged operating expenses again now for five consecutive quarters. Sales per labor hour or labor productivity were up again for the quarter and even more for the full year. I want to recognize the operational performance of our stores, particularly during the intense winter weather storms in December, January and now February. Our store teams continue to increase store standards and this will position us well as we work to enhance our assortment and implement the merchandising initiatives, including adding merchandising to Action Alley. I would also add that our sales performance resulted in a decrease in the expense for incentive plans. Going forward, that's not how I want to reduce our expenses. 
Fourth quarter operating income grew 4.8% to more than $6 billion. For the full year, operating income was up 22 basis points as a percentage of sales increased 3.1% to almost $20 billion. These are very strong results given the state of the economy and the difficulty we had during the fourth quarter on the sales line. I'm confident we can improve sales throughout the rest of the year. We spent the last six months analyzing our assortment and presentation and delving into customer insights about their shopping habits and their preference. 
Beginning this month, we're removing the high-capacity end caps to make way for a more robust, proper Action Alley presentation. As I mentioned, space and assortment changes are now underway to improve our merchandise presentation, particularly in apparel, sporting goods, toys and hardlines in most of our U.S. stores. 
As we've experienced, average unit retail prices are expected to continue to decrease in electronics particularly for TVs, hardware and gaming. We believe we can mitigate some of this price pressure by increasing our focus on products and categories like iPads and other tablets that offer greater growth opportunities. While we progress in the second and third quarter, we should begin to see the sales declines in these categories abate. 
Our team is implementing a four-point plan that we expect will improve performance in our existing stores. First, Every Day Low Price leadership, savings on the basket. Wal-Mart will deliver consistent Every Day Low Price, which is what the Wal-Mart brand stands for, on a basket of goods. We also will support our messaging with targeted marketing in-store and with a variety of media.
Two, broadest assortment possible. Under the leadership of our new chief merchant, Duncan Mac Naughton, we will continue to work with our suppliers to deliver the broadest assortment possible at the lowest price in the market. Three, improve remodel efficiency and returns. We will change our remodeling program to right-size merchandise categories and eliminate remodel disruptions. We will continue to drive efficiencies through our remodeling program to reduce capital costs and expenses. And four, access for our customers. We'll leverage Walmart's strength to expand multi-channel initiatives so our customers can shop on their terms. 
We'll also make meaningful progress on growth as we expand our store format portfolio to continue to grow through supercenters which continue to offer us the best return on investment and launching small formats. The development of our small format is progressing ahead of schedule. We expect to open our first Wal-Mart Express stores in the second quarter. This will be a new format for both rural and urban locations. We're very pleased with the reception customers are giving potential Wal-Mart stores in cities such as Chicago, Washington, D.C., New York and San Diego. As I said, we're driving efficiencies in our remodeling program. 
In October, we projected a range of $7.5 billion to $8 billion for our capital expenditure budget for fiscal 2012. We're now expecting our capital, including remodeling and logistics, will be between $6.5 billion and $7 billion. We continue to expect to add 11 million square feet of selling space, which will be between 185 and 205 units. We'll also continue to convert discount stores to supercenters. 
The first quarter of fiscal 2012 is underway. Pressure from higher energy and commodity costs are factors that we'll watch closely as they affect our own logistics and transportation costs, as well as the prices the customer pays. Rising gas prices and still-high unemployment levels weigh on the minds of our customers. These issues affect discretionary spending and figure into our assessment for guidance. These and [ph] government assistance programs continues to rise and is up about 50 basis points over this time last year. Close to 80% of our payment mix is still made up of some form of cash including debit cards. Credit as a form of payment has dropped from last year and is now less than 14% of our payment tender. 
During the fourth quarter, inflation in dairy, meat and produce were somewhat offset by deflation in snacks, beverages and dry grocery. Weather issues have affected crop availability in produce and we expect to see continued inflation in fresh food categories. 
Labor and higher cotton prices are affecting apparel and home categories, and softlines were consolidating suppliers to improve purchasing power and leveraging our buying power with raw material suppliers. We continue to work with our suppliers to reduce inflationary pressure where possible and only pass on price increases when they cannot be avoided. Our logistics team continues to increase productivity and efficiency, and I'm happy to report that for the full year, cases per hour were up 5.6% for the year over last year. Our transportation efficiency increase measured in cases per mile improved 4% for the year. We expect that our productivity initiatives can help mitigate higher fuel prices this year and further increase efficiencies in fiscal 2012.
Last year, our 13-week comp for the first quarter declined 1.4%. We expect Wal-Mart U.S. comp sales for the first quarter running from January 29, 2011 through April 29, 2011, to range from negative 2% to flat. Let me remind you, the changes that I outlined will take time before we see positive comp trends. 
We expect our productivity initiatives to continue to help us leverage expenses in the first quarter, even on lower sales. We're forecasting our inventory levels to remain somewhat higher than last year through the first half of this year as we implement the changes I've covered. And last, we expect gross margin to be flat to slightly up for the quarter. 
Now I'll turn it over to Charles for the rest of the guidance discussion."
313055,79147929,105168,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2011",2011-02-22,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Let's get right into our financial scorecard. First, growth. Despite continued economic headwinds, we grew both sales and square footage. Sales were up 2.5% for the quarter and 3.4% or almost $14 billion for the year. By adding 511 net units",1020,"Thanks, Bill. Let's get right into our financial scorecard. First, growth. Despite continued economic headwinds, we grew both sales and square footage. Sales were up 2.5% for the quarter and 3.4% or almost $14 billion for the year. By adding 511 net units this year, we continue to provide access for customers to save money so they can live better. Net square footage increased by approximately 33 million square feet, to almost 985 million square feet at the end of the year. Wal-Mart International alone contributed over 20 million square feet or more than 60% of this year's increase. Much of this growth in International was focused on emerging markets, where we believe there are excellent growth and return prospects. 
We plan to deliver square footage growth of 3% to 4% and we were just about in the middle, growing selling space by 3.4% for the year. We continue to expect to increase square footage between 3% to 4% for fiscal 2012, and this takes into account our move in the U.S. towards smaller, more productive supercenters. 
Next metric, leverage. Our focus on the productivity loop has been a company priority for just over a year. We are proud that the company leveraged expenses now for five consecutive quarters. All segments contributed to the company leveraging expenses for the year. Their continued focus has helped make a significant contribution to our bottom line. This will continue to be an important focal point. 
One area where I can say I'm proud of our progress on leverage is in unallocated corporate overhead. The focus of our corporate support teams paid off with a year-over-year decline in corporate expenses. Looking forward to fiscal 2012, we have some planned investments in global e-commerce which will be reflected in unallocated corporate overhead. These are strategically important to the company but may contribute to higher growth in these unallocated expenses.
As we close the year, I'd also like to recognize the progress that our teams around the world have made on converting our financial systems to SAP. We're not finished yet, but the majority of our business now operates on the new system. We surpassed the largest implementation earlier this year with the transition of our North American operations. The countries still on the list to transition to SAP are all of those in Latin America, China and India. This will provide a common platform to better integrate acquisitions in the future.
Finally, returns. Our commitment, which I mentioned at the October Analyst Meeting, was to keep ROI stable, which we did again this year. Return on investment was relatively flat at 19.2% compared to 19.3% last year. This is a very strong return relative to our competitors. I also mentioned back in October that quarterly fluctuations will occur based on our operations. For example, an acquisition may initially be dilutive to ROI. However, in the mid to long term, our continued goal is to maintain a stable ROI.
Free cash flow for the year was $10.9 billion. This is incredibly strong and gives the company tremendous flexibility. Well, let me remind you that last year, we reduced inventories in Wal-Mart U.S. by approximately $2 billion. This made our inventory artificially low and makes the comparison difficult between last year and this year. We were not expecting to be at last year's level and we are very happy with our operating results to produce another year of strong returns. Now let's move on to guidance.
Based on our views of the economic and sales environment in the U.S. and around the world, we expect first quarter of fiscal 2012's diluted earnings per share to be between $0.91 and $0.96, which compares to last year's EPS of $0.87. The company's expectations for full fiscal 2012 EPS is to be between $4.35 and $4.50, an increase from fiscal 2011 underlying EPS of $4.07. These estimates assume that currency exchange rates remain at current levels. For fiscal 2012, we expect the effective tax rate to be between the range of 33.5% and 34.5%, although we may see some quarterly fluctuations. Factors which may affect our rate include changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies and the mix of international to domestic income. 
In October, we announced our capital expenditure plan of between $13.5 billion and $14.5 billion for the year. Based on where we ended fiscal 2011 and reviewing our capital needs based on efficiencies for new stores and remodels, we are now reducing our guidance to $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion. This lowers the top and bottom of our range by $1 billion. If we have more opportunities to invest in emerging markets like China, we will do so. Let me remind you that this guidance does not include CapEx for any acquisitions. 
The new guidance ranges are as follows: Wal-Mart U.S., $6.5 billion to $7 billion, down from $7.5 billion to $8 billion; Wal-Mart International, $4 billion to $4.5 billion, unchanged; Sam's Club, $1 billion, unchanged; and corporate and other will be $1 billion, unchanged.
I am pleased and honored to serve as Wal-Mart's Chief Financial Officer, and I am proud of the finance organization I have the opportunity to lead. We remain committed to driving strong operations with the foundation of a strong financial position. This is key to delivering long-term shareholder growth. This mission is intrinsically linked with our mission to save customers money so they can ""live better"". As a company, we will continue to focus on leveraging our cost structure and global footprint, along with driving the right balance between growth and returns.
Let me remind you of Wal-Mart's key numbers for this fiscal year of 2011 that just ended. Almost $11 billion in free cash flow; a return on investment of over 19%; over 30 million net new square feet; and over $19 billion return to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. These numbers represent the commitment and hard work of our associates around the world, the strength of the Wal-Mart business, and the continued execution of our strategic plans. 
Thank you for your interest in Wal-Mart. Have a great day."

This is Carol Schumacher, Vice President of Investor Relations for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.

This is Carol Schumacher, Vice President of Investor Relations for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Thanks for joining us today for our earnings call to review both the fourth quarter and the full year of fiscal 2011.
All information for this quarter including updated unit counts, square footage and financial metrics, including ROI, are available on our website at walmartstores.com/investors. A full transcript of the call will be available on the website as well around 7:00 a.m. Central Time today, February 22, 2011.
Today, you'll hear from key Wal-Mart leaders, starting with Mike Duke, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., for the opening comments and key highlights of the quarter and the year; Jeff Davis, in his first call as Wal-Mart’s Treasurer, will cover the consolidated financial details. As you'll see from our press release, we do have some noise with our numbers. Then we'll go to the operating segments. First up this time will be Brian Cornell, President and CEO of Sam's Club; Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart International, will also have highlights on our largest countries within international. We will close the segment discussion with Bill Simon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart U.S. Finally, our CFO, Charles Holley, will cover our financial report card and a variety of points on guidance. 
Before we start to discuss our performance for the quarter, there are a few items to keep in mind as you listen to the results. First, we had certain items that affected our fourth quarter EPS last year, as well as an accounting change in fiscal 2011 that affected last year. These items need to be considered for comparison purposes. Second, as a reminder, we had a tax benefit from the third quarter, which we reported in November. The tax benefits from the third quarter and the fourth quarter that we're reporting today affect our full year and quarterly results.
Third, I'd also like to point out that during the quarter, we had income from discontinued operations. This income resulted from the recognition of a previously unrecognized tax benefit related to the disposition of our German operations in fiscal year 2007. Including this tax benefit, diluted net income per share attributable to Wal-Mart was $1.70 for the fourth quarter and $4.47 for the full year.
Fourth, this is the last quarter that we'll remind you about our adjusted P&Ls and balance sheets that are available on the Wal-Mart website under Financial Information. Effective with the second quarter of fiscal 2011, Wal-Mart changed the methodology for valuing our inventory. The retrospective application of this accounting change resulted in adjustments to reported amounts. The adjusted financial statements I mentioned earlier cover all of fiscal year 2010 as well as the first quarter of fiscal 2011, and they're on our website. Throughout this call, all earnings and earnings per share amounts reflect the amounts for FY '10 adjusted for this accounting change. 
I'd also like to mention that we're discontinuing our discussion of consolidated membership and other income beginning in fiscal 2012. This line item is most relevant for Sam's Club and they'll continue to discuss it going forward. You'll also note that in today's discussion, as well as in the accompanying press release, we provide disclosure on both reported and underlying earnings per share. The reported EPS takes into consideration all the items, including tax benefits and restructuring charges. The underlying EPS is based on our pure operating performance. You'll hear these terms throughout the discussion today.
Now Mike, let's get started with our Q4 and our full year results. Mike?"

We are reporting $1.41 per share for the quarter and $4.18 per share for the full year. These numbers include certain tax benefits that positively impacted EPS, and Jeff will cover this shortly.
Based on the underlying performance of the company, our earnings per share were $1.34 for the fourth quarter, which exceeded First Call consensus and our guidance. Wal-Mart increased net sales from the previous year by almost $14 billion to $419 billion. As a company, we leveraged the expenses for the quarter and the year, reinforcing our commitment to the productivity loop and EDLC.
Operating income rose to more than $25 billion for the full year, a 6.4% increase over what we reported this time last year. We continue to deliver strong free cash flow, closing the year with almost $11 billion. We met our goal to deliver stable return on investment, and finished the year again with ROI above 19%.
For the year, we returned a record $19.2 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchase. Let me pause for a moment. $19.2 billion return to shareholders. Now that was worth repeating. However, as I said, sales for Wal-Mart U.S. were below our expectations for the fourth quarter. The team did manage expenses well during the quarter and contributed operating income growth of almost 5%. Bill has a clear vision today of the underlying issues, and his action plan addresses the areas critical to the sales turnaround. Some of the pricing and merchandising issues in Wal-Mart U.S. ran deeper than we initially expected, and they require response that will take time to see results. Price leadership is critical to our success. We will reinforce our commitment to deliver EDLP. This is what Wal-Mart was built on.
We will deliver a merchandise assortment and presentation relevant to our customers. As Bill will share with you, many of the fourth quarter problems stem from merchandise assortment and presentation issues that contributed to customer traffic declines, as well as some of the issues related to the remodeling program. I believe Bill is on the right track to see sales improvement throughout the year. Let me be direct on this point. There is no greater priority for me or for Bill than getting sales back into positive territory. 
Wal-Mart U.S. will also continue to grow through our supercenters and additional formats. We will move forward with even greater urgency in opening small stores. I'm encouraged by the response we're seeing in urban markets like Chicago, Washington, D.C., San Diego and New York.
It's no surprise that we see growing opportunities in online shopping. I am pleased with the sales results of Walmart.com during the fourth quarter and expect e-commerce and multichannel to play an increasingly important role across our business. Sam's Club now has annual sales just shy of $50 billion. I'm pleased that the Sam's organization is really contributing to our shareholder value. Sam's Club turned in a strong performance for the year, delivering comp sales near the top end of guidance. Brian and his team grew net sales 4.4% for the quarter and 3.5% for the year. Sam's comp sales, without fuel, improved sequentially every quarter, with fourth quarter being the strongest. We're seeing the comp sales momentum continue and expect strength in the first quarter. Attracting new members will continue to be the top priority for the year ahead. 
Wal-Mart International continued to be our growth engine and we expect accelerated growth ahead. International net sales exceeded $109 billion this year, an increase of more than 12%. Every market contributed a sales increase in fiscal 2011 compared to the prior year. For the full year, International grew operating income faster than sales.
We added 458 net units this year and almost 8% more selling space in our international markets. Almost 70% of the additional square footage came in two important emerging markets: Mexico and China. I've told our international leaders that I'd like to see them accelerate organic growth in our emerging markets.
We also will grow through acquisitions. We look forward to closing the Massmart transaction in South Africa and expanding our presence in many sub-Saharan African markets. In the U.K., we continue to work towards finalizing the acquisition of the Netto stores.
I'd like to specifically recognize our business in Japan, where our Seiyu stores continued their strong focus on Every Day Low Price and operational efficiencies. As a result, Wal-Mart Japan has grown full year profits for each of the past three years, with this fiscal year being the best of the three years.
You're familiar with our company mission of helping our customers save money so they can live better. Our engagement on the ""live better"" societal issues continues to have a meaningful impact in our communities. Doug and I had the opportunity to share some of our experiences with leaders from companies and countries around the world at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland last month. 
We found there's a lot of interest in our global commitment to sustainable agriculture and our new initiative in the U.S. to make the food we sell healthier, and healthier foods more affordable for our customers. We were honored that First Lady Michelle Obama joined Bill Simon to launch this initiative last month. 
We recognize that around the world, there is growing concern about inflation and higher prices, particularly in food and energy. I believe that Wal-Mart is one of the best positioned retailers around the world to handle these kinds of headwinds, because of our commitment to EDLC and EDLP. This is something we will continue to address. You'll hear more about this from our business leaders. 
As I look ahead for this fiscal year, I am confident that no retailer is better positioned to win globally than Wal-Mart. We will not waver in our commitment to our customers. Our financial priorities of growth, leverage and returns guide us in our decisions and strategies. We will continue to add square footage and new formats. We will grow sales and increase comps. We will continue to leverage operating expenses through the productivity loop and we will continue to maximize our returns to the shareholders through dividends, share repurchase and a stable ROI. 
Now Jeff will cover the details on our consolidated financial results. Jeff?"
313055,79147929,105319,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2011",2011-02-22,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, Wal-Mart delivered income from continuing operations of $5 billion, an increase of 4.3% from last year. Reported earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart were $1.41, an inc",1221,"Thanks, Mike. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, Wal-Mart delivered income from continuing operations of $5 billion, an increase of 4.3% from last year. Reported earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart were $1.41, an increase of 11.9% compared to $1.26 for the fourth quarter last year.
We have some noise in both this year's and last year's earnings per share numbers that I would like to explain further. This year, we recorded $243 million of net tax benefits, primarily from the repatriation of certain non-U.S. earnings that increased U.S. foreign tax credits. This net tax benefit added approximately $0.07 to our reported EPS of $1.41 for the fourth quarter. 
By comparison, last year's $1.26 per share had both a benefit and a charge in the fourth quarter. First, we incurred charges for several business restructurings in the amount of $260 million, or $162 million after-tax. These charges reduced our reported EPS by approximately $0.04 per share. Second, we recorded $372 million of net tax benefits primarily from the repatriation of certain non-U.S. earnings that increased U.S. foreign tax credits. These net tax benefit added approximately $0.09 to our reported EPS. 
In summary, our fourth quarter underlying EPS grew 10.7% from $1.21 last year to $1.34 this year, which was above our guidance of $1.29 to $1.33 per share. The $1.34 earnings per share points to the strength of our consolidated business.
For the full year, earnings from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart were $15.4 billion, an increase of 6.3% over last year. For the fiscal year, reported earnings per share and underlying earnings per share from continuing operations were $4.18 and $4.07, respectively versus our adjusted EPS of $3.73 and underlying EPS of $3.67 last year. The underlying $4.07 excluded certain tax benefits recorded in the third and fourth quarters that aggregate to approximately $0.11 per share for the fiscal year. 
Earlier, Carol mentioned an important point. In the fourth quarter, the company recognized in discontinued operations an approximately $1 billion tax benefit in connection with the disposition of our German operation in fiscal 2007. This matter was resolved with the United States Internal Revenue Service during the fourth quarter of this fiscal year. Now let's dive into the fourth quarter and the fiscal year results.
Consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter increased 2.5% or almost $2.8 billion to $115.6 billion. Net sales included a currency exchange rate benefit of $664 million. On a constant currency basis, sales grew 1.9%. The 13-week U.S. comp sales, without fuel, declined 1.1%. You'll hear more details on the Wal-Mart U.S. and Sam's comp sales from Bill and Brian.
Gross margin for the quarter was flat to last year at 24.6% of sales. Fourth quarter consolidated operating income was $8 billion, up 7.3% or $546 million from last year. This includes a currency exchange rate benefit of $58 million. On a constant currency basis, consolidated operating income grew 6.5%. 
Operating income grew faster than sales by leveraging operating expenses. The productivity loop is a priority focus throughout the company. Expenses grew approximately 50 basis points on sales growth of 2.5%, which is the fifth consecutive quarter that expenses grew slower than sales.
Unallocated corporate overhead grew 9.1% to $505 million for the quarter. What we classify as core within our corporate overhead expense actually decreased 3% for the quarter. The mark-to-market of several unallocated foreign currency derivative positions was the primary driver of the increase. It is important to note that unallocated corporate overhead decreased 2% to about $1.7 billion for the year.
On a consolidated basis, membership and other income declined 4.5% or $36 million this quarter compared to last year. For the year, membership and other income was down 1.9% or $56 million. As Carol remarked, membership and other income continues to be an important part of the Sam's Club business but to a lesser degree for the other segments.
Net interest expense for the quarter increased 13.4% to $532 million. For the fiscal year, net interest expense was $2 billion, an increase of 6.4%. This was driven by higher debt levels but partially offset by lower interest rates. Our AA credit rating allowed us to access low-cost debt. As a reminder, earlier this year, we issued $5 billion of debt at some of the lowest corporate rates on record at the time. We continue to have ample access to the credit markets. At the end of the year, our debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 42.1% compared to 37% at the end of last year.
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 30.7% and 32.2% for the year. This was due to the net tax benefits we previously discussed. These items reduced our effective tax rate by approximately 320 basis points for the quarter and approximately 180 basis points for the fiscal year.
Net sales were approximately $419 billion for the year, which is an increase of 3.4% or $13.8 billion over last year. Net sales included a currency exchange benefit of $4.5 billion. On a constant currency basis, our net sales for fiscal 2011 grew 2.3%. As a reminder, currency translation negatively impacted sales by $9.8 billion in fiscal 2010. For the 52-week period ended January 28, 2011, U.S. comp sales without fuel declined 1.1%.
Consolidated operating income was $25.5 billion, an increase of 6.4% from last year, and included $231 million from currency rate fluctuations. On a constant currency basis, consolidated operating income grew 5.5% to $25.3 billion. Consistent with our quarterly results, operating income grew faster than sales for the year as we leveraged expenses. Expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 32 basis points.
This year was another strong year for cash flow generation. We closed the year with free cash flow of $10.9 billion. Recall last year, free cash flow was $14.1 billion, enhanced by the artificially low inventory position at year end. Annual CapEx spend was $12.7 billion, which was lower than our most recent guidance of $13 billion to $14 billion. This resulted from lower spending and timing associated with the Wal-Mart U.S. segment. CapEx spend for the fourth quarter was $3.4 billion.
We paid almost $1.1 billion in dividends this quarter and $4.4 billion for the year. As a reminder, we increased our dividends per share 11% to $1.21 from $1.09 in fiscal year 2010.
Wal-Mart repurchased approximately $3.8 billion of shares during the fourth quarter and $14.8 billion for the year, which is the most we ever repurchased. This represents nearly 70 million and 280 million shares, respectively. We have approximately $4.8 billion remaining on our $15 billion share repurchase authorization announced in June of 2010.
In summary, Wal-Mart returned $19.2 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase for the fiscal year. As Mike noted, this is truly a record return to our shareholders. Payables as a percentage of inventories for the company were 92.4%, relatively stable from 93.1% last year. Although inventory levels increased 11%, consolidated inventory turns were flat with the prior year. In addition, we effectively manage payables. 
We continue to produce a consistently high and stable ROI. We finished the year with 19.2% return on investment compared to 19.3% at the end of last year. 
Now, let's move on to a discussion of our operating segments. We'll start with Sam's Club. Brian?"
313055,79147929,105319,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2011",2011-02-22,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jeff. As I've shared with you during the fiscal year, our strategy is to meet our members' needs and deliver on the Sam's Club brand promise of simplifying our members' lives by helping them make smart choices. We achieved that promise by under",1903,"Thank you, Jeff. As I've shared with you during the fiscal year, our strategy is to meet our members' needs and deliver on the Sam's Club brand promise of simplifying our members' lives by helping them make smart choices. We achieved that promise by understanding what our members want and providing the merchandise they want at the quality and value they expect. It's important to remember that in last year's fourth quarter, we took a charge for restructuring our operations related to the closure of 10 clubs. Our discussion today therefore excludes that charge of $174 million for comparative purposes.
I am very excited to share our results with you today. As they indicate, Sam's members are responding to the offering and experience in our clubs. We had a strong quarter and are very pleased with our club performance. Thanks to the efforts of our dedicated managers and associates, we grew sales and operating profit, as well as leveraged expenses for the quarter and the fiscal year. Let's start with the fourth quarter results. 
Comp club sales, excluding fuel, increased 2.7% for the 13-week period ending January 28, 2011. I am very pleased to share with you that we were at the top end of our guidance of a comp club increase of 1% to 3% for the fourth quarter. As Mike mentioned, Sam's reported sequential comp improvement quarter-by-quarter throughout the year.
Overall, comp ticket and traffic, excluding fuel, increased for the 13-week period by 210 and 70 basis points, respectively. We are also pleased that our members, both Business and Advantage, visited with us more often and put more items in their basket and flat beds during the quarter. Sales during the quarter were particularly strong in fresh foods and grocery, health and wellness, home and apparel categories.
Sam's Club operating income for the fourth quarter increased slightly versus last year to $487 million. Excluding fuel, operating income for the fourth quarter was flat versus last year. And now, highlights for Sam's for the full year.
Comp club sales, excluding fuel, increased 1.7% for the 52-week period. Overall comp ticket, excluding fuel, increased for the 52-week period by 180 basis points. While overall comp traffic declined slightly, we did see increases in frequency of visit by both our Advantage and Business members.
Operating income grew 1.3% to $1.7 billion versus last year. We opened four new clubs during the fiscal year, with the most recent opening in January in Sharpsburg, Georgia. We are investing more aggressively in member acquisition ahead of club openings and are seeing positive results. We continue to see growth in the Sam's Club brand in our international markets as Doug and his team opened 14 new Sam's Clubs this fiscal year. We continue to work with the international team to share best practices across the organization to ensure we are meeting our members' needs, both in the U.S. and around the world.
We also continue to improve our member experience by updating our older clubs. We completed 65 club remodels, expanded two clubs and relocated three clubs during the fiscal year. Now let's turn to the detailed financial results. 
For the fourth quarter, net sales for Sam's Club, excluding fuel, increased to $11.9 billion which is a 2.5% increase over last year's fourth quarter. Including fuel, fourth quarter sales were $13.1 billion, which is a 4.4% increase versus last year. Price and volume of fuel contributed almost equally to the increase in fuel sales.
For the fiscal year, net sales for Sam's Club, excluding fuel, increased 1.4% versus last year to $45.2 billion. Including fuel, net sales for the fiscal year were $49.5 billion, which is an increase of 3.5% versus last year. Fuel increases were driven by 17% increases in fuel prices and a 12% increase in gallons sold for the full year versus last year. Including fuel, comp club sales increased 4.5% and 3.7% for both the 13-week and 52-week period, respectively.
Comp ticket, excluding fuel, increased for both Business and Advantage members for both the 13-week and the 52-week period. Comp traffic, excluding fuel for both the 13-week and the 52-week period, increased for our Advantage members and declined for our Business members. Additionally, we saw our frequency improve for both Business and Advantage members, for the quarter and the fiscal year. So our members are shopping with us more often and putting more items in their baskets and flat beds. While traffic may be down with our Business members, frequency and ticket are up. We expect to continue to see pressure on Business members through late fiscal 2012.
During the holidays, we focused our messaging on feeding the family and home entertaining, and these messages delivered strong sales in fresh foods, grocery and beverages. We introduced approximately 100 new fresh foods, including bakery programs for cookies, cake and artisan breads. The new product launches all drove mid-double-digit comp sales. And in our Freezer/Cooler category, we introduced a new high-quality appetizer program, which also drove mid-double-digit comps. Inflation in selected meat, produce and dairy categories aided increases in average unit price, partially offset by downward unit pressure.
We also had a very successful holiday season in key discretionary categories, such as home, domestics and apparel. The team did a great job providing high-quality merchandise and preferred brands at a tremendous value to our members. We transitioned well from holiday season, minimizing markdowns and ending the year in a strong inventory position. 
Relative to the industry, we are very pleased with the sales of our electronics and technology categories in the fourth quarter and grew market share over the fiscal year. Members responded well to our strong brand offering, including LG and the Apple iPhone and iPad. We continue to experience price pressure in electronics, especially in televisions, but had positive unit sales growth of TVs for the quarter. Our expanded health and wellness offering continues to drive strong sales performance. Tobacco and fuel sales also continue to deliver strong comps. 
Sam's gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased by eight basis points during the fourth quarter, primarily driven by the continued [ph] shift in merchandising mix towards higher margin fresh products, very effective management of seasonal merchandise to minimize markdowns and improved global sourcing. Through improved sourcing, we decreased our damage rates throughout the year. Including fuel, the gross margin rate for the quarter decreased 11 basis points compared to last year.
Recall that last year's inventory levels were lower than our historic levels due to inventory management initiatives. It's not surprising that our inventory is up. We closed the year with inventory up 14% compared to this time last year. We feel we've returned to a more comfortable inventory level that provides a good balance of flow and availability. We anticipate this trend of period-over-period inventory growth to continue into the first quarter. Additionally, we have shifted shipping volume forward into the year to meet our earlier club seasonal transition dates. Due to these items, our inventory turns were down slightly in the fourth quarter.
Operating expenses for the fourth quarter grew 3.4% versus last year. During the fourth quarter, we incurred charges for certain assets that were taken out of service, including the temporary closure of a club in Rhode Island we plan to rebuild, as well as costs associated with continued restructuring of our field organization. If you exclude these items, we leveraged operating expenses by approximately six basis points.
For the fiscal year, operating expenses grew 2.5%, driven by credit card interchange fees, remodeling, and higher marketing investments that drive traffic. Despite this, we were still able to leverage expenses for the fiscal year. For the quarter, sales per labor hour increased 223 basis points. Units per labor hour increased 27 basis points for the fourth quarter versus last year. For the fiscal year, sales per labor hour increased 198 basis points and units per labor hour increased 172 basis points. 
Membership and other income for the fourth quarter decreased 1.9% from last year. Membership income, the primary driver, was flat for the fourth quarter versus last year. Other income decreased 15% due to last year's results being favorably impacted by a number of miscellaneous items, none of which was individually significant to the financial statement. For the fiscal year, membership and other income decreased 2.2% driven in part by a favorable accounting adjustment in the third quarter of last year to membership income. Excluding the effects of the accounting adjustment last year, membership income, the primary driver, increased approximately 80 basis points compared to last year. The increase was driven by strength in our Plus membership upgrades, as well as the number of new members joining at the Plus level.
We continue to be pleased with the progress of our eValues program for Plus members, as we enhanced the program to make it even more meaningful for our members. Additionally, we are further simplifying the way we communicate value offered to our Plus member. For example, we've always offered a discount to our Plus members on their prescriptions, but the discount varied across prescriptions. Now it's a simplified program, with an 8% discount on branded prescriptions and a 40% discount on generics, not part of our $4 and $10 generic prescription plan. Our members understand it clearly and it's paying off with upgrades.
Our membership renewal rates remained steady throughout the year. Our win back program targeted to inactive members also contributed to our improved membership rates. We expect small businesses to continue to be under pressure throughout fiscal 2012 and anticipate continued softness in business member sign-ups.
For the fiscal year, operating income increased 1.3% versus last year. Fiscal 2012 is underway. Our plan is focused on delivering the financial priorities of growth, leverage and return. Our existing fleet of U.S. clubs will grow. As we shared with you in October, we plan to add between seven and 12 new, expanded or relocated clubs next year in the United States. Sam's Club has committed a significant portion of our capital spend to remodels. We expect to complete remodels on 60 to 70 clubs this year. Our CapEx plan for the fiscal year remains the same at approximately $1 billion.
Our strategic initiatives will continue to be driven by insights, quality and innovation. In merchandising, we continue to provide our members the best prices on everyday need purchases, leverage fresh foods and grocery to feed our members' family, continue investing in areas like technology services and expand our progress in making Sam's Club a destination for our members' health and wellness needs.
In membership, we will step up our efforts to attract new members and continue to focus on building relationships with existing members across a variety of touch points, including eValues, wireless network access in clubs, our smartphone application and an improved .com site to allow for easier member interaction, and operations we are focused on driving member experiences that are efficient and engaging.
Our sales momentum for fiscal 2011 is carrying over into the first few weeks of the new fiscal year. We expect comp sales, without fuel, for the current 13-week period from January 29, 2011 through April 29, 2011, to increase between 1% and 3%. Last year, Sam's Club comp, without fuel, for the first quarter comparable 13-week period rose 70 basis points. 
Now I'll turn it over to Doug to tell you about Wal-Mart International. Doug?"
313055,79147929,105319,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2011",2011-02-22,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brian. This year has been another one of meaningful achievement for the team in Wal-Mart International, both in financial terms and in our positive impact in the communities we serve around the world. Our financial goals remain grounded in growth,",2612,"Thanks, Brian. This year has been another one of meaningful achievement for the team in Wal-Mart International, both in financial terms and in our positive impact in the communities we serve around the world. Our financial goals remain grounded in growth, leverage and returns, and Wal-Mart International continues to have strong growth in both net sales and operating income. On the topic of growth, I'm pleased to say that we've met our goals of opening locally relevant formats as we discussed in the October meeting for the investment community. In fiscal 2011, our organic growth included 458 net new stores, representing an 11.2% increase in store count and a 7.8% increase in square footage. This growth includes 282 new stores in smaller formats, each less than 40,000 square feet. 
In addition to comp store sales growth and the delivery of our new stores, we are excited about our pending investment in South Africa and the sub-Saharan region of Africa. In addition, we continue to work towards completion of our acquisition of the Netto stores in the U.K. 
Given that we're recapping the end of the year, please allow me to take just a minute and highlight some of the successes our teams have delivered beyond the quarterly financial results. For the second year in a row, Wal-Mart Central America was named the Most Admired Multinational Company in Central America. Wal-Mart China received several honors including the Best Retail Place to Work and a China Best Employer. Our ASDA team in the U.K. was selected as Britain's Best Value Retailer for the 12th consecutive year. In addition, Wal-Mart Mexico's foundation received the prestigious 2010 World Business and Development Award granted by the United Nations development program, the International Chamber of Commerce and the International Business Leaders Forum. The award recognized the foundation's indigenous product commercialization program, which offers training and funding to boost the production processes of marginalized communities and indigenous groups living in isolated regions to improve their income and quality of life.
And in India, we opened our second training center to teach our associate candidates the skills of being a successful Wal-Mart retailer. Enabling our associates in India is a critical part of our success. You can imagine the students' surprise when, while he was in India recently, Mike Duke stopped by the classroom to answer their questions. To date, more than 3,000 students have been certified and 1,050 have been placed in various jobs, out of which nearly 200 are placed in our best priced modern wholesale cash and carry stores. These are the associates that will help us fuel our growth in the country. 
Now let's get to the numbers. For the full year, our business achieved constant currency sales of $104.8 billion or 7.6% growth over fiscal 2010. Our constant currency operating income of $5.4 billion grew even faster at 9.7%. I'm also pleased to say that we leveraged operating expenses for the year. All markets grew full year constant currency sales over last year, with some of the highest increases coming from Brazil, China and Mexico. On a constant currency basis, operating expenses grew slower than sales at 5.8% due to strong expense management in Japan and the United Kingdom. On a constant currency basis, gross margin as a percentage of sales was flat to last year. 
On a reported basis, Wal-Mart International's net sales were $109.2 billion in fiscal 2011, growing 12.1% over fiscal 2010. This includes a $4.5 billion benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Operating income was $5.6 billion, including a benefit of $231 million from changes in currency exchange rates. 
Now turning to our fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter constant currency sales were $30.7 billion, growing 6.6% over last year. On a constant currency basis, operating income was $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter constant currency operating income growth of 4% was slower than sales growth. While gross profit margin and expenses remain constant as a percentage of sales, this year's constant currency operating income did not have the benefits of real estate sales in Canada that we had last year. 
Constant currency operating expenses as a percentage of sales were flat to last year as expense leverage in Mexico and the U.K. offset pressures in our other markets. On a reported basis, fourth quarter net sales were $31.4 billion, growing 8.9% from last year. Net sales for the fourth quarter include a $664 million benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Fourth quarter operating income was $2 billion, including a $58 million benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. 
For the quarter, we did not meet our goal of growing inventory at less than half the rate of sales and we're intent on making improvements here. On a constant currency basis, inventory grew at 12.6%. Days-on-hand increased 0.4 days over last year. Adding many of this year's new stores in the fourth quarter had a significant effect on this metric. 
Now let's get into the results for several of our larger markets. As a reminder, we hold country management accountable for their results on a local currency basis without the impact of potential swings and exchange rates. The following discussion of country results excludes the impact of currency and unless otherwise stated, sales and comps are presented in nominal rates. In Mexico, Walmex continues to deliver great results, growing sales in the fourth quarter and growing operating income faster than sales. Until Walmex has annualized its March 2010 acquisition of Central American operations, the following discussion will include only Walmex's results in Mexico. While the following results are on a U.S. GAAP basis, Walmex separately reports its earnings under Mexican GAAP, so some of the numbers may be different.
Walmex's net sales for the fourth quarter were up 9.2% and comparable store sales were up 2.9%. The sales growth at Walmex is driven by the 255 stores and six restaurants that have opened since the fourth quarter of last year, positive comp growth in all Walmex formats and good holiday sales. Customer traffic increased 10 basis points and average ticket increased 2.9% in comparable stores. For the fourth quarter, Walmex comp store sales for self-service formats grew by 2.5%, while ANTAD's comp store sales report for the rest of the industry excluding Walmex showed only 1.3% growth. 
Walmex's fourth quarter operating income grew faster than sales at 15.2% on a higher gross profit margin and expense leverage. Fourth quarter gross profit margin as a percentage of sales increased 79 basis points from last year, and discipline in expenses allowed for expenses as a percentage of sales to decline by 27 basis points. 
Moving on to Brazil. Net sales grew in the fourth quarter amid some exciting changes that are happening in our operations there. However, we did not grow operating income faster than sales. Although we are disappointed with this year's results in Brazil, we've already begun the changes to see business improvement. In January, Brazil began implementing EDLP. Shelf prices on more than 2,000 items were reduced the week of the launch and additional items are being moved to EDLP every week. Over the long term, we expect the EDLP in Brazil to increase sales volume and reduce operating costs as we've seen in Japan. During this period of change, however, we expect some sales pressure in Brazil. 
In real terms, Brazil's fourth quarter sales growth was 7.8% and comparable store sales were flat. Customer traffic at comparable stores declined 5.2% and average ticket increased 5.5%, both in real terms. Sales at our cash and carry and supermarket formats performed well during the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter gross profit margin as a percentage of sales increased 93 basis points over last year due to margin pressure last year. Expenses as a percentage of sales increased 161 basis points, primarily due to adding many of this year's new stores in the fourth quarter. This increase in expenses caused Brazil's operating income to decline by 41.7% from last year. In the past 12 months, we have opened 45 new stores in Brazil, bringing our total store count to 479. This includes 27 new stores in the fourth quarter of this year.
Moving to Asia. Wal-Mart Japan has seen success from its implementation of EDLP, growing sales in the fourth quarter. However, operating income did not grow faster than sales. The results are showing that customers prefer EDLP. Based on information from the Japanese Ministry of the Economy, Trade and Industry or METI, our performance continues to stay ahead of other large-scale retailers in Japan and we are increasing our market share in a deflationary environment. 
Fourth quarter net sales and comparable store sales increased approximately 3.1%, both in real terms. Wal-Mart Japan's traffic increased 2% over last year as the newly remodeled stores continue to attract customers, and average ticket in real terms increased 1.5%. Wal-Mart Japan sales of food, consumables and general merchandise each showed a strong performance, while apparel sales were down. Gross profit margin as a percentage of sales increased slightly by 19 basis points from last year and expenses as a percentage of sales increased 63 basis points from last year. As with last year, fourth quarter operations were again profitable. As Mike mentioned earlier, Wal-Mart Japan has grown full year profits for each of the past three years, with this fiscal year being the best of the three years. We look forward to the continued impact of EDLP there.
Overall, China sales grew in the fourth quarter as well, but operating income did not grow faster than sales. Net sales for the fourth quarter in Wal-Mart China grew 9.6% over last year and comparable stores growth was 1.8%. Average ticket grew 9.6% in China but traffic declined 7.2%. The primary traffic decline resulted from Trust-Mart finalizing its merchandising transition to Wal-Mart assortments. Fourth quarter gross profit as a percentage of sales increased 96 basis points over last year, primarily due to purchasing efficiencies from growing sales and a reduction in the low-margin assortments at Trust-Mart. Expenses as a percentage of sales grew 197 basis points primarily due to the lower sales during the Trust-Mart merchandising transition to Wal-Mart's assortments. Fourth quarter operating income declined approximately 8%. 
In the past 12 months, we opened 49 new stores including 45 supercenters and that brings our China store count to 328 stores. Wal-Mart and the selling shareholder of Trust-Mart have mutually agreed to extend the closing of the remaining Trust-Mart stores to May 26, 2011, while certain conditions of the contract are completed. 
Before moving on, let's give a brief update on India. As you know, we support Bharti Retail and their new store growth in India. Bharti Retail, whose stores are excluded from our store counts, opened 30 new stores in the fourth quarter of this year and now operates 118 supermarkets and 10 compact hypermarkets. In our separate joint venture with Bharti, we've increased the number of cash and carry stores to five. Fourth quarter comparable sales at our cash and carry stores increased 11.3% over last year.
Turning now to the United Kingdom. ASDA continued to grow sales and operating income in the fourth quarter of this year. However, operating income grew at a slower rate than sales as ASDA increased price investments during the holiday season. In the fourth quarter of this year, comparable sales, excluding fuel, increased 1.6% with overall sales growth in the low single digits. Average ticket grew 3% and traffic declined 1.4% in the fourth quarter as customers made larger purchases and shopped less frequently in the U.K.'s record December snowstorm. Sales were strong in clothing, toys and sports, and grocery.
ASDA launched its price guarantee last April where customers can go online and with a few clicks, check their basket price against competitors. Over 1 million customers checked their baskets in 2010. Recently, ASDA strengthened its commitment to price, guaranteeing to be 10% cheaper than its competitors and an additional 800,000 baskets have already been checked under the 10% program. Gross profit as a percentage of sales declined slightly in the fourth quarter. Expenses as a percentage of sales were slightly lower than last year under ASDA's ""We Operate for Less"" program. However, the expense performance was not enough to offset the decline in gross margin.
ASDA continues to broaden its appeal and sales of ASDA's premium brand ""Extra Special"" performed strongly over the Christmas period. According to Kantar Worldpanel, ""Extra Special"" was the fastest growing premium brand of the major retailers. Chosen By You, ASDA's mid-tier private label continues to perform well, and in the first quarter of next year will be extended to grocery, meal solutions and chilled foods. 
ASDA opened six new stores during the fourth quarter, including four superstores and two supermarkets. ASDA's commitment to Saving Customers Money Every Day will be more important in 2011 as VAT taxes in the U.K. have risen to 20% compared to 17.5% at this time last year and fuel prices rise to record levels. 
And finally with Canada. Wal-Mart Canada sales grew in the fourth quarter of this year. However, operating income did not grow faster than sales. Net sales grew 4.8% in the fourth quarter compared to last year, primarily due to the supercenter expansion program and strong sales in food, hardlines and health and wellness. This translated into fourth quarter comparable sales growth of 40 basis points. As a percentage of sales, gross margin was relatively unchanged from last year's higher rate and expenses were relatively unchanged from last year as strong cost controls in our retail operations offset the costs from our new bank. 
Operating income declined as last year's results included the gains from sales of some of our real estate properties. Excluding these gains, operating income would have increased from the fourth quarter of last year. While operating income from our retail operations grew in line with sales, this growth was offset by the startup costs of our new bank.  Average ticket increased 60 basis points for the fourth quarter and traffic declined 20 basis points.
In the past 12 months, we opened eight new stores in Canada, bringing our store count to 325 stores. In fiscal 2012, we expect to open 40 new supercenters in key regions around the country. Canada continues to offer significant opportunity and we have a winning strategy to capture a greater share of this market. Building on our long track record of growth and performance, we are confident in our ability to expand and we see a long-term opportunity to serve our customers in more ways. 
I'd also like to mention that in the beginning of the fourth quarter, Canada opened the first sustainable fresh food distribution center estimated to be 60% more energy-efficient than traditional refrigerated centers and saving approximately $4.8 million in energy costs over five years. The 400,000-square-foot Balzac facility is among the most energy-efficient distribution centers in North America. 
Looking forward into fiscal 2012, we remain committed to sales growth and growing our operating income faster than sales each quarter. Our expectations for organic growth include 23 million to 24 million new square feet in our current markets, including significant investments in soft discount formats in Mexico and Brazil, and larger formats in China and Canada. We expect our capital expenditures to continue to range between $4 billion and $4.5 billion for the fiscal year.
Our focus on price leadership, customer service and productivity have produced good results for fiscal 2011 and we're well prepared to meet our fiscal goals in 2012 in more than 4,550 stores. 
Now I'll turn it over to Bill for the update on Wal-Mart U.S. Bill?"
313055,79147929,105319,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2011",2011-02-22,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Doug. As Mike said, we were disappointed with our sales performance. Our 1.8% comp decline for the fourth quarter didn't meet anyone's expectations. They certainly didn't meet mine, period. For the fourth quarter and the full year, we again del",2233,"Thank you, Doug. As Mike said, we were disappointed with our sales performance. Our 1.8% comp decline for the fourth quarter didn't meet anyone's expectations. They certainly didn't meet mine, period. For the fourth quarter and the full year, we again delivered strong operating income and we continue to leverage operating expenses. The P&L is in excellent shape, all we need is top line growth. 
Let me start with the fourth quarter recap of merchandising and I'll get into financial results for the quarter and the full year and wrap up with a look at our expectations going forward. 
Certainly as others have reported, whether an individual tax refund loan delays or headwinds for the fourth quarter sales, but the primary factor for our negative comp sales performance was General Merchandise and more specifically, electronics. It's no surprise that General Merchandise makes up a larger percentage of our sales mix for the fourth quarter, and electronics, which comprises the largest portion of the overall General Merchandise sales mix, had continued price deflation. Despite the price pressure on TVs, we still had positive unit growth and we grew market share.
There are some bright spots in electronics. Though you may not have seen it on the sales line, we again had very strong sales of our prepaid wireless products in the fourth quarter. But recall, that we can only account for commission on sales of prepaid wireless products and services, as well as third-party gift cards. Had we been able to account for the full sale, we would have added 60 basis points to the fourth quarter comps.
I'm pleased with our sales performance in Food and Health and Wellness businesses. Food, our largest business, delivered positive low single-digit comps in the fourth quarter. We believe the additional assortment we put in the grocery increased our relevancy for customers. We brought back many opening price point items that were important to our core customers to help generate traffic and loyalty. The modular changes for SKU add-backs in Food were mostly completed by November and contributed to better sales. The quality improvements we've made in our Produce business are also taking hold with our customers. 
Health and Wellness comp sales were positive, driven by improvements in both pharmacy and over-the-counter categories. This came despite supply headwinds in OTC, driven by ongoing issues as a result of recalls by key suppliers and a larger-than-expected generic mix. We see many encouraging trends in our Health and Wellness business. First, our new Humana drug program enrolled more people than we expected. This provided some tailwind toward the end of the fourth quarter and will continue to do so this fiscal year. Second, the cold and cough season is picking up traction and we're well prepared. 
Our Consumables business had low single-digit negative comps for the quarter. We'll complete our new modular sets in the first quarter, which will help us highlight opening price points and recapture traffic loss to competitors. However, in categories where we've already made modular changes such as paper products, we're seeing positive sales momentum, driven by improved customer conversion and offsetting commodity-driven deflation. 
We posted mid-single-digit negative comps in apparel. We have seen improving sales trends in Men's, Ladies' Plus and Women's offset by a pullback in Juniors. Customers are also buying closer to need, particularly in seasonal apparel. I'm encouraged by recent trends as we add back assortment in key apparel categories including shoes and accessories.
Home comps were low single-digit negative, though winter weather helped drive sales in snow removal and bedding. Promotional and new items as well as home management, floor care and dining did well for the holidays. Home decor continues to face headwinds. 
Sales in our seasonal category were slightly below projections in the fourth quarter. We lost sales by having seasonal merchandise spread across too many areas of the store during the fourth quarter. Going forward, our seasonal merchandise for holidays such as Easter, Halloween and Christmas will have integrated targeted plans to present a more compelling presentation and product offering for our customers.
Our In-store Toy business was slightly negative over the holiday season. However, combined with tremendous online Toy growth, our overall Toy sales met our expectations this holiday season. Our last General Merchandise category, hardlines, had a comp decline in low single digits. Sales growth of course sporting goods and automotive categories where we started to add back assortment, offset softer sales in large exercise equipment, crafts, stationery and books. 
I shared with you last quarter that we began reassorting our General Merchandise categories, adding back deleted items and categories and making space allocation changes. This process will take longer than it did in the Food side of the business. With the longer lead times in General Merchandise, we will be working on this throughout the year. Product cycle times, modular changes and department space allocations are scheduled to change throughout the year. Our goal is to gain traction on these before we get into the General Merchandise-rich fourth quarter. 
We know the power of online shopping, which industry reports said grew by 11% during the fourth quarter. Walmart.com's fourth quarter sales growth exceeded the industry and were on par with the industry leaders, and this too is a competitive advantage as we offer customers the opportunity to shop on their terms. 
Now let us get into the financial details for the fourth quarter and the full year. As I mentioned, comp sales for the 13-week period were negative 1.8%. Slower traffic was a major factor in the comp decline, and average ticket was up slightly versus the prior year. For the full year, comps on a 4-5-4 basis declined 1.6%. For the 52-week period, average ticket was up slightly, traffic drove the majority of the comp decline. All financial details beyond comp are provided on the fiscal quarter and the year. For the full year, net sales were up 13 basis points but declined 46 basis points in the fourth quarter. 
Inventory was up 8.2% compared to last year. Recall, we ended last year with low inventory levels as a result of our aggressive inventory reduction program. Aside from our sales shortfall in this year's fourth quarter, some of our planned initiatives deliberately increased inventory, namely the addition of merchandise in Action Alley and increased assortment. In fact, these two initiatives contributed approximately 120 basis points of the total growth. At the end of the year, we did not have any significant inventory exposure. In fact, inventory turns in the fourth quarter were flat with last year.
Gross profit dollars improved 15 basis points for the fourth quarter. The sales decline and lower margin electronics merchandise led to a favorable mix. Gross margin rate was up 17 basis points for the quarter as a result of the favorable mix. For the year, gross margin was up $11 million or two basis points over the prior year. Our gross margin rate for the year was basically flat. 
We leveraged operating expenses again now for five consecutive quarters. Sales per labor hour or labor productivity were up again for the quarter and even more for the full year. I want to recognize the operational performance of our stores, particularly during the intense winter weather storms in December, January and now February. Our store teams continue to increase store standards and this will position us well as we work to enhance our assortment and implement the merchandising initiatives, including adding merchandising to Action Alley. I would also add that our sales performance resulted in a decrease in the expense for incentive plans. Going forward, that's not how I want to reduce our expenses. 
Fourth quarter operating income grew 4.8% to more than $6 billion. For the full year, operating income was up 22 basis points as a percentage of sales increased 3.1% to almost $20 billion. These are very strong results given the state of the economy and the difficulty we had during the fourth quarter on the sales line. I'm confident we can improve sales throughout the rest of the year. We spent the last six months analyzing our assortment and presentation and delving into customer insights about their shopping habits and their preference. 
Beginning this month, we're removing the high-capacity end caps to make way for a more robust, proper Action Alley presentation. As I mentioned, space and assortment changes are now underway to improve our merchandise presentation, particularly in apparel, sporting goods, toys and hardlines in most of our U.S. stores. 
As we've experienced, average unit retail prices are expected to continue to decrease in electronics particularly for TVs, hardware and gaming. We believe we can mitigate some of this price pressure by increasing our focus on products and categories like iPads and other tablets that offer greater growth opportunities. While we progress in the second and third quarter, we should begin to see the sales declines in these categories abate. 
Our team is implementing a four-point plan that we expect will improve performance in our existing stores. First, Every Day Low Price leadership, savings on the basket. Wal-Mart will deliver consistent Every Day Low Price, which is what the Wal-Mart brand stands for, on a basket of goods. We also will support our messaging with targeted marketing in-store and with a variety of media.
Two, broadest assortment possible. Under the leadership of our new chief merchant, Duncan Mac Naughton, we will continue to work with our suppliers to deliver the broadest assortment possible at the lowest price in the market. Three, improve remodel efficiency and returns. We will change our remodeling program to right-size merchandise categories and eliminate remodel disruptions. We will continue to drive efficiencies through our remodeling program to reduce capital costs and expenses. And four, access for our customers. We'll leverage Walmart's strength to expand multi-channel initiatives so our customers can shop on their terms. 
We'll also make meaningful progress on growth as we expand our store format portfolio to continue to grow through supercenters which continue to offer us the best return on investment and launching small formats. The development of our small format is progressing ahead of schedule. We expect to open our first Wal-Mart Express stores in the second quarter. This will be a new format for both rural and urban locations. We're very pleased with the reception customers are giving potential Wal-Mart stores in cities such as Chicago, Washington, D.C., New York and San Diego. As I said, we're driving efficiencies in our remodeling program. 
In October, we projected a range of $7.5 billion to $8 billion for our capital expenditure budget for fiscal 2012. We're now expecting our capital, including remodeling and logistics, will be between $6.5 billion and $7 billion. We continue to expect to add 11 million square feet of selling space, which will be between 185 and 205 units. We'll also continue to convert discount stores to supercenters. 
The first quarter of fiscal 2012 is underway. Pressure from higher energy and commodity costs are factors that we'll watch closely as they affect our own logistics and transportation costs, as well as the prices the customer pays. Rising gas prices and still-high unemployment levels weigh on the minds of our customers. These issues affect discretionary spending and figure into our assessment for guidance. The use of government assistance programs continues to rise and is up about 50 basis points over this time last year. Close to 80% of our payment mix is still made up of some form of cash including debit cards. Credit as a form of payment has dropped from last year and is now less than 14% of our payment tender. 
During the fourth quarter, inflation in dairy, meat and produce were somewhat offset by deflation in snacks, beverages and dry grocery. Weather issues have affected crop availability in produce and we expect to see continued inflation in fresh food categories. 
Labor and higher cotton prices are affecting apparel and home categories, and softlines were consolidating suppliers to improve purchasing power and leveraging our buying power with raw material suppliers. We continue to work with our suppliers to reduce inflationary pressure where possible and only pass on price increases when they cannot be avoided. Our logistics team continues to increase productivity and efficiency, and I'm happy to report that for the full year, cases per hour were up 5.6% for the year over last year. Our transportation efficiency increase measured in cases per mile improved 4% for the year. We expect that our productivity initiatives can help mitigate higher fuel prices this year and further increase efficiencies in fiscal 2012.
Last year, our 13-week comp for the first quarter declined 1.4%. We expect Wal-Mart U.S. comp sales for the first quarter running from January 29, 2011 through April 29, 2011, to range from negative 2% to flat. Let me remind you, the changes that I outlined will take time before we see positive comp trends. 
We expect our productivity initiatives to continue to help us leverage expenses in the first quarter, even on lower sales. We're forecasting our inventory levels to remain somewhat higher than last year through the first half of this year as we implement the changes I've covered. And last, we expect gross margin to be flat to slightly up for the quarter. 
Now I'll turn it over to Charles for the rest of the guidance discussion."
313055,79147929,105319,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2011",2011-02-22,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Let's get right into our financial scorecard. First, growth. Despite continued economic headwinds, we grew both sales and square footage. Sales were up 2.5% for the quarter and 3.4% or almost $14 billion for the year. By adding 511 net units",1020,"Thanks, Bill. Let's get right into our financial scorecard. First, growth. Despite continued economic headwinds, we grew both sales and square footage. Sales were up 2.5% for the quarter and 3.4% or almost $14 billion for the year. By adding 511 net units this year, we continue to provide access for customers to save money so they can live better. Net square footage increased by approximately 33 million square feet, to almost 985 million square feet at the end of the year. Wal-Mart International alone contributed over 20 million square feet or more than 60% of this year's increase. Much of this growth in International was focused on emerging markets, where we believe there are excellent growth and return prospects. 
We plan to deliver square footage growth of 3% to 4% and we were just about in the middle, growing selling space by 3.4% for the year. We continue to expect to increase square footage between 3% to 4% for fiscal 2012, and this takes into account our move in the U.S. towards smaller, more productive supercenters. 
Next metric, leverage. Our focus on the productivity loop has been a company priority for just over a year. We are proud that the company leveraged expenses now for five consecutive quarters. All segments contributed to the company leveraging expenses for the year. Their continued focus has helped make a significant contribution to our bottom line. This will continue to be an important focal point. 
One area where I can say I'm proud of our progress on leverage is in unallocated corporate overhead. The focus of our corporate support teams paid off with a year-over-year decline in corporate expenses. Looking forward to fiscal 2012, we have some planned investments in global e-commerce which will be reflected in unallocated corporate overhead. These are strategically important to the company but may contribute to higher growth in these unallocated expenses.
As we close the year, I'd also like to recognize the progress that our teams around the world have made on converting our financial systems to SAP. We're not finished yet, but the majority of our business now operates on the new system. We surpassed the largest implementation earlier this year with the transition of our North American operations. The countries still on the list to transition to SAP are all of those in Latin America, China and India. This will provide a common platform to better integrate acquisitions in the future.
Finally, returns. Our commitment, which I mentioned at the October Analyst Meeting, was to keep ROI stable, which we did again this year. Return on investment was relatively flat at 19.2% compared to 19.3% last year. This is a very strong return relative to our competitors. I also mentioned back in October that quarterly fluctuations will occur based on our operations. For example, an acquisition may initially be dilutive to ROI. However, in the mid to long term, our continued goal is to maintain a stable ROI.
Free cash flow for the year was $10.9 billion. This is incredibly strong and gives the company tremendous flexibility. Well, let me remind you that last year, we reduced inventories in Wal-Mart U.S. by approximately $2 billion. This made our inventory artificially low and makes the comparison difficult between last year and this year. We were not expecting to be at last year's level and we are very happy with our operating results to produce another year of strong returns. Now let's move on to guidance.
Based on our views of the economic and sales environment in the U.S. and around the world, we expect first quarter of fiscal 2012's diluted earnings per share to be between $0.91 and $0.96, which compares to last year's EPS of $0.87. The company's expectations for full fiscal 2012 EPS is to be between $4.35 and $4.50, an increase from fiscal 2011 underlying EPS of $4.07. These estimates assume that currency exchange rates remain at current levels. For fiscal 2012, we expect the effective tax rate to be between the range of 33.5% and 34.5%, although we may see some quarterly fluctuations. Factors which may affect our rate include changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies and the mix of international to domestic income. 
In October, we announced our capital expenditure plan of between $13.5 billion and $14.5 billion for the year. Based on where we ended fiscal 2011 and reviewing our capital needs based on efficiencies for new stores and remodels, we are now reducing our guidance to $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion. This lowers the top and bottom of our range by $1 billion. If we have more opportunities to invest in emerging markets like China, we will do so. Let me remind you that this guidance does not include CapEx for any acquisitions. 
The new guidance ranges are as follows: Wal-Mart U.S., $6.5 billion to $7 billion, down from $7.5 billion to $8 billion; Wal-Mart International, $4 billion to $4.5 billion, unchanged; Sam's Club, $1 billion, unchanged; and corporate and other will be $1 billion, unchanged.
I am pleased and honored to serve as Wal-Mart's Chief Financial Officer, and I am proud of the finance organization I have the opportunity to lead. We remain committed to driving strong operations with the foundation of a strong financial position. This is key to delivering long-term shareholder growth. This mission is intrinsically linked with our mission to save customers money so they can ""live better"". As a company, we will continue to focus on leveraging our cost structure and global footprint, along with driving the right balance between growth and returns.
Let me remind you of Wal-Mart's key numbers for this fiscal year of 2011 that just ended. Almost $11 billion in free cash flow; a return on investment of over 19%; over 30 million net new square feet; and over $19 billion return to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. These numbers represent the commitment and hard work of our associates around the world, the strength of the Wal-Mart business, and the continued execution of our strategic plans. 
Thank you for your interest in Wal-Mart. Have a great day."

Thanks for joining us today for our earnings call to review the first quarter of fiscal year 2012. Key information for this quarter, including updated unit counts, square footage and financial metrics, is available on our website at www.walmartstores.com/investors. A full transcript of the call will be available on the website after 7 a.m. Central Time today on May 17, 2011. Historical data can also be found on the site as well. 
We have a full agenda for today's first quarter recap. Mike Duke, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., will start off with the key results and commentary on our business strategies. As you can see from our press release this morning, we do have some discrete items that are accounted for in our results. So Jeff Davis, SVP of Finance and Treasurer, will cover the consolidated financial results, including more analysis on the noise. Then we'll go to the operating segments. First up will be Brian Cornell, President and CEO of Sam's Club. Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart International, will cover the overall results for International, as well as our 6 largest countries. We will close the segment discussion with Bill Simon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart U.S. Finally, our CFO, Charles Holley, will present our financial report card and our guidance for the second quarter. 
Recall that we do not provide a full year guidance update this quarter. In our fourth quarter call from February, we said that we would no longer provide details on the membership and other income line, except for Sam's Club, because it's only relevant and material for Sam's. In this quarter, we include a discussion of a gain from the sale of an investment in Chile that is included in other income. Also as we do from time to time, we will make reclassifications for consistency. 
Let me remind you as you listen today that our fiscal calendar for Wal-Mart International is different from the corporate fiscal calendar. All of our international countries, with the exception of Canada, end their fiscal quarter on March 31 while our consolidated financials end on April 30. This is particularly important given the shift in the Easter timing this year. International sales from Easter in all but Canada will be included in the second quarter results. 
And finally, our Annual Meeting of Shareholders is Friday, June 3, at the Bud Walton Arena in Fayetteville, Arkansas. We'll start promptly at 7 a.m. Central time. If you can't join us in person, the meeting will be available via webcast on the corporate website. That's www.walmartstores.com. Now Mike, let's get started with our first quarter results. Mike?"

Wal-Mart is reporting EPS of $0.98 from continuing operations, exceeding our guidance range for the first quarter. This reflects the stability and strength of our global operations. Let me dive into some of the",1136,"Thank you, Carol. Good morning, everyone. Wal-Mart is reporting EPS of $0.98 from continuing operations, exceeding our guidance range for the first quarter. This reflects the stability and strength of our global operations. 
Let me dive into some of the key numbers for the quarter. Net sales were up 4.4% to $103.4 billion, with strong contributions from Wal-Mart International and Sam's Club. Wal-Mart U.S. comps were negative 1.1%, which was roughly the mid-point of our guidance. Sam's Club comp of 4.2% was 120 basis points above guidance. Consolidated operating income was up 2.8% to $5.9 billion. 
The company leveraged its operating expenses. The really great thing is that we have many more opportunities to leverage our scale, technology and innovative processes across the entire business. Return on investment was down, due primarily to currency translation and cash accumulations. Jeff will provide additional details. For the quarter, the company returned $3.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Now let me move on to the highlights of the individual operating segments. The Wal-Mart U.S. comp sales decline of 1.1% was within our guidance range. We recognize we still have work to do, and comp sales growth remains the greatest priority for me and the entire Wal-Mart U.S. team. The good news is that the plan Bill Simon and his team are executing is gaining traction. Bill will elaborate more on our progress. We're focused on delivering EDLP in a wide assortment, and customers are responding favorably where we've made the most progress on executing the plan. I'm encouraged with what I hear from customers when I visit our U.S. stores. In grocery, we are further along with the transition, but the work on general merchandise will not be completed until the second half of the year. 
Our business model positions us well for customers who appreciate the one-stop shopping that our U.S. supercenters offer. Despite improvements in some areas of the economy, core Wal-Mart U.S. customers are still stretched. They remain concerned about rising prices for gas, energy and food, as well as employment issues. Customers trust us to be their ally in fighting rising gas prices and inflation. We continue to earn that trust when we deliver on our commitment to EDLP. 
International remains the key growth driver for our company, and the segment has seen continued growth through a combination of comps and new stores. We will see the results of the Easter sales in the second quarter in our international markets so I'm pleased to report that almost every market had strong sales growth this quarter. Mexico, China and Chile, not only had the best comp growth, but also the highest percentage sales increase for the quarter compared to last year. It's not a surprise that Japan's March sales were soft as the country continues to recover from the devastation of the earthquake and tsunami. We're pleased that we're beginning to see Japan stabilize. 
Our overall growth comes from comp sales and new stores but we also grow through acquisitions. In April, we completed the acquisition of the Netto stores in the U.K., and the transition is underway to convert these stores to the ASDA brand. The Netto transaction and its results will show up in our second quarter. We're waiting for the outcome of the competition tribunal hearings in South Africa on our proposed investment in Massmart. 
I continue to see tremendous opportunity in the emerging markets like Brazil. Last month, I spent a week traveling to 3 cities in Brazil where I visited 25 stores. I believe that the transition underway to EDLP is right for our customers, though it will take time to shift the culture and improve the profitability. 
Operating income for Wal-Mart International was up 1.2% on a reported basis. International did not leverage expenses so there is further opportunity on SG&A. 
Sam's Club delivered really good results this quarter with a 4.2% comp that was well above our guidance. I really like the positive momentum at Sam's Club, which is reflected not only in comp sales but also in increases in new members. We've been upgrading the quality and the value of our offering at Sam's, and results are strong across-the-board. This quarter delivered the highest member experience scores that Sam's has ever had. 
I'm proud of the work of the Sam's Club team. They also delivered strong operating income and leveraged expenses. The warehouse club channel is increasing in importance in the retail landscape, and Sam's is gaining further momentum. We expect Sam's to add even more value to the company's overall portfolio. 
Wal-Mart has a tremendous growth opportunity in e-commerce. Customers today want continuous shopping channels, and they want price transparency. We're bringing together our stores, logistics expertise and systems to create an integrated shopping experience that moves seamlessly with the customer from the store to Web-enabled devices. 
Over the last few weeks, you've also seen us ramp up investments in new talent and technology. We closed on the acquisition of Kosmix, and our teams are integrated into @Walmartlabs in Silicon Valley. This acquisition allows us to expand our capabilities in the online social commerce environment. 
The growth potential of e-commerce is especially significant in markets like China. We are committed to being at the forefront of this growth. On Friday, we announced that we are acquiring a minority stake in Yihaodian, one of China's leading online retailers. Yihaodian has achieved a significant position in online grocery sales, as well as general merchandise, including electronics and apparel. We expect ongoing activity in the e-commerce area around the world. 
We know our customers also expect us to be a leader on the issues that matter to them. In April, we issued an expanded Global Responsibility Report in which we provided greater transparency and accountability on our efforts to be a responsible company around the world. We're pleased with the response to this report. 
As we build the next-generation Wal-Mart, staying close to the front lines of the business is at the top of my agenda, and I expect the same of every member of our leadership team. From Brazil to Silicon Valley, I visited more than 75 stores in this quarter alone. Everywhere I go, I see customers working hard to make ends meet. Inflation and gas prices are adding to the pressures. They look to us to help them save money and live better. 
I've never been more confident in the relevance of our EDLP promise and our talented teams delivering on that promise. Wal-Mart will continue to manage the business for the short term and the long term. We will grow comps and open new stores, and we remain committed to leveraging expenses and improving returns for our shareholders. 
Now I'll turn it over to Jeff for more details on our financial results. Jeff?"
313055,129808219,131064,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 17, 2011",2011-05-17,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. For the first quarter of fiscal 2012, Wal-Mart's income from continuing operations was $3.4 billion, an increase of 3.8% over last year. Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart were $0.98, on increase of 12.",947,"Thank you, Mike. For the first quarter of fiscal 2012, Wal-Mart's income from continuing operations was $3.4 billion, an increase of 3.8% over last year. Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart were $0.98, on increase of 12.6% compared to $0.87 for the first quarter last year. First quarter EPS from continuing operations included the benefit of approximately $0.01 per share related to currency translation. In the first quarter last year, earnings per share benefited from currency translation by $0.02. 
In addition to the impact of currency translation, we have several other discrete items that impacted the first quarter. All the following numbers are pretax. We realized approximately $117 million from the mark-to-market gains on foreign currency derivative positions. ASDA recorded an approximate $67 million charge related to the removal of future benefit accruals and the effect of future pay increases from its defined benefit plan. Wal-Mart Japan incurred approximately $51 million casualty loss related to the March earthquake and tsunami. And finally, Wal-Mart Chile recorded approximately $51 million gain from the sale of an investment. 
All of these items are included in operating expenses, with the exception of the gain from the sale in Chile, which is recorded in membership and other income. The net summary of these items accounted for approximately $0.01 of our EPS for the first quarter. 
As Mike mentioned, consolidated net sales increased by 4.4% or $4.3 billion to $103.4 billion for the quarter. The increase in sales was driven by Wal-Mart International and Sam's Club and included a currency exchange rate benefit of $1.3 billion. On a constant currency basis, sales grew 3% to $102.1 billion. 
The 13-week U.S. comp sales, without fuel, decreased 0.3%. You will hear more details on the Wal-Mart U.S. and Sam's comp sales from Bill and Brian. 
For the quarter, gross margin on sales was 24.4%, down 30 basis points compared to last year, driven by Wal-Mart international and Sam's Club. Unallocated corporate overhead and other, which includes other investment in global e-commerce, decreased by 20.8% to $309 million for the quarter. The $117 million mark-to-market gains on foreign currency derivative positions were the primary drivers of the decrease. Excluding these gains and global e-commerce initiatives, our core corporate overhead expense increased approximately $15 million or 3.9% compared to last year. I'm happy to say we have EDLP focused in our corporate areas. 
Consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 18 basis points on sales growth of 4.4%. On a constant currency basis, consolidated operating expenses increased 1.9%. Our focus on ensuring everyday low cost remains a priority throughout the company. 
First quarter consolidated operating income was $5.9 billion, a 2.8% increase versus last year, which included a $49 million currency benefit. On a constant currency basis, consolidated operating income increased 1.9% for the first quarter versus last year. 
Net interest expense for the quarter increased 10% to $518 million. This was driven by higher debt levels compared to last year as we opportunistically issued new debt at historically low rates, offset partially by lower average interest rates on our outstanding debt. 
The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 33.5%. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 to be between 33.5% and 34.5%, although we will see some quarterly fluctuations. Changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations may impact our effective tax rate. 
First quarter consolidated inventory grew 9.5% compared to last year. The inventory growth was primarily covered by a comparable increase in payables. Payables as a percentage of inventories remained stable at approximately 90%. In addition, consolidated inventory turns remain stable. 
In the first quarter, we issued $5 billion of long-term bonds for general corporate purposes at tighter levels than preliminary pricing guidance suggested, indicating strong investment demand. Our AA credit rating provides continued access to low-cost debt. 
The debt-to-total-capitalization ratio was 46.1% in the first quarter compared to 41.6% at the end of the first quarter last year. Since last year, we issued more than $10 billion in debt at historically low interest rates. We ended the first quarter with negative free cash flow of approximately $400 million due to our increased investment in inventory and timing of payments for our accrued liabilities. Free cash flow was in line with expectations. The company ended last year's first quarter with negative free cash flow of $1.6 million due to lower-than-normal inventory levels at the end of fiscal 2010.
Capital expenditures were approximately $2.4 billion for the first quarter compared with $2.6 billion in the first quarter last year. We added approximately 3.7 million of new retail square footage and 59 new operating units during the quarter. In the first quarter, we distributed $1.3 billion in dividends. As a reminder, we increased our fiscal 2012 annual dividend per share by approximately 21% to $1.46 from $1.21 in fiscal 2011. 
In addition, we repurchased approximately $2.1 billion of shares during the first quarter, representing approximately 39.3 million shares. This leaves us with approximately $2.7 billion remaining on our $15 billion share repurchase authorization announced last June. 
Clearly, one of our priorities is returning value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During the first quarter, Wal-Mart returned $3.4 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Return on investment or ROI, for the trailing 12 months ended April 3, 2011, was 18.5% compared to 19.2% for the prior year. The primary drivers of change in ROI were the impact from currency exchange and cash held for pending acquisitions. Now let's move to the discussion of our operating segments. We'll start with Sam's Club. Brian?"

I am very excited to share that Sam's Club momentum has continued in the new fiscal year. We sequentially increased our comp sales in each quarter of last year, and that momentum continued into the first quarter. Comp club sales, exclud",1173,"Thank you, Jeff. I am very excited to share that Sam's Club momentum has continued in the new fiscal year. We sequentially increased our comp sales in each quarter of last year, and that momentum continued into the first quarter. 
Comp club sales, excluding fuel, increased 4.2% for the 13-week period ending April 29, 2011, exceeding our guidance of 1% to 3%. This is our fifth quarter of sequential quarterly comp improvement. We combined solid unit sales growth and increased traffic with excellent margin management. We leveraged operating expenses this quarter. 
Our membership acquisition performance was wrong. In fact, it was our best quarterly performance since I joined Sam's Club in March of 2009. This strength was driven by key membership events and excellent execution in the clubs. These strong results across all key areas of our business flow through to operating income, which, excluding fuel, increase faster than the rate of sales. 
Before I get into the detailed financial results, let me address the current dynamic around fuel, an important part of our value proposition. Our fuel stations establish the initial price perception and drive traffic to the clubs. We also note that great prices on gasoline drive member loyalty in terms of renewal rates and ticket. We're pumping more gallons of fuel and generating more sales dollars per gallon this year versus last year. 
Fuel prices in the first quarter this year are approximately 35% higher than a year ago, and gallons sold are up 22%. Including fuel, first quarter sales were $12.8 billion, a 9.4% increase over last year, and operating income increased 7% to $459 million. While top line fuel sales have increased, fuel profit on a dollar basis was basically flat to last year for the quarter. 
We see a large impact on gross margin percentages. Volatility in fuel prices can have a notable impact on our financial results, both positive and negative. We will continue with our strategy around fuel to be the price leader in the market. Our discussion today therefore excludes fuel for comparative purposes unless otherwise noted. 
Now let's turn to the detailed financial results. For the first quarter, net sales for Sam's Club increased to $11.3 billion, a 4.9% increase over last year. Comp club sales for the 13-week period increased 4.2%. Despite the impact of heavy snow in February and flooding and tornadoes in April, comp club sales increases were strong across all 3 geographic operating divisions. And we are particularly pleased with the combined sales strength of our South and West divisions. Comp performance was driven more by our item growth than inflation. 
Comp ticket and traffic increased for the 13-week period by 190 and 230 basis points, respectively. Comp ticket increased for both Business and Advantage members. Comp traffic increased for Advantage members and was relatively flat for our Business members. 
Our ticket and traffic performance was driven in part due to our strategy to be the price leader in key everyday needs categories, such as grocery, cleaning and laundry. We also hosted several events such as our second eValues savings celebration, in which we offered eValues to all members and the Taste of Sam's event. 
The frequency of member visits improved for both Business and Advantage members, particularly during the weekends. We have taken an approach to the weekends in which our clubs are focused on executing specific plans to elevate the in-club experience and member service. The plans are focused on key areas that are high touch points like fresh food, grocery and the front end. These are paying off in sales and improved member experience scores. 
From a merchandise perspective, comp increases were strong across fresh foods, grocery, home and apparel categories. We continue to see inflation in key categories such as produce, meat and dairy. However, we managed through inflation with little impact on our margin and have seen continued growth in units sold year-over-year. The quality of our sales in our core categories was very strong, and we grew comp sales despite tobacco being a headwind during the first quarter. The challenge in tobacco is driven by the cycling of last year's tobacco pre-buys in anticipation of significant price increases, as well as a change in our credit card reward program that disproportionately impacts our members who shop this category heavily. We anticipate tobacco being a headwind for the rest of the year. Recall that the average income for a Sam's Club member is above $75,000 annually. Discretionary spend is increasing, as seen in our improved sales performance in home, apparel and certain technology and entertainment categories, including consumer electronics. 
Our gross margin rate was flat as a percentage of sales for the first quarter. 
For the quarter, inventory him including fuel, was up 10.6%. As we have mentioned in previous calls, we anticipated higher inventory growth rates through the quarter. These increases were driven by larger seasonal buys, earlier transition in seasonal and electronics and inflation. Additionally, we were up against historically low inventory levels last year. We expect inventory growth rates to return to a single digit in the second quarter as we manage inventory flow and members' needs. 
As mentioned earlier, I am very pleased with our progress on expense leverage and club efficiency. We reduced expenses as a percentage of sales by 17 basis points, driven by controlling wage costs. For the quarter, sales per labor hour increased 3.1%, and units per labor hour increased 2.5%. 
Membership and other income for the first quarter increased 40 basis points versus last year. As you know, membership income is recorded on a deferred revenue recognition basis so it's important to understand what's going on with membership income on a cash basis. Growth in membership income on a cash basis was very strong with increases in the mid-single-digits. This strength came across all membership segments, and we are very pleased with the overall membership results. Membership income in the first quarter increased 40 basis points versus last year. For the second quarter, we anticipate membership income to continue the positive momentum, with key events planned to engage our members in the clubs. 
We have also placed an emphasis on in-club renewals and on our Plus membership offering. We saw broad-based strength in renewal rates across membership categories in the quarter. Business add-on membership trends had begun to stabilize and are showing positive momentum. However, our small business members remain concerned with the economy and reduced access to credit. Therefore, we anticipate continued headwinds for our Business memberships throughout the fiscal year. 
First quarter operating income increased to $457 million, a 6.3% increase. Our sales momentum remains strong as we enter the first weeks of the second quarter. We expect comp club sales, without fuel for the current 13-week period from April 30 through July 29 to increase 3% to 5%. Last year, Sam's comp club sales, excluding fuel, increased 1% for the comparable 13-week period. 
Now I will turn the program over to Doug to share with you the results for Wal-Mart International. Doug?"

On March 30 and 31, we shared with you, while we are so excited about the growth prospects for China and Asia at our Annual International Conference for the investment community in Shenzhen, China. We came with a full team, including Scott Price, Cathy Smith, Ed Chan, Ed Kolodzieski and others, and we provided additional insight into our business strategy, our Asian operations and answered many questions from the analyst community. 
One of the key takeaways from that meeting is that we have a strategic plan in place to move Wal-Mart International from a good business into a great business, and this will be underpinned by doing what we do best: providing our customers great value through everyday low prices. Our management team is focused on delivering that plan through what I referred to as the 4 dimensions of growth, comp store sales, new stores, e-commerce and multichannel and finally acquisitions. 
Here is what our first fiscal quarter looked like in terms of these 4 dimensions. For the first quarter of fiscal 2012, all of our markets had encouraging comp store sales results, with Mexico, China and Chile having the highest comps. By the way, as it relates to Chile, we've seen double-digit comp store sales for several quarters since we made this investment, and I'm really proud of the Wal-Mart Chile team and our integration team. They've done a great job. 
The Easter calendar change and Brazil's EDLP implementation impacted our comp store sales, and I'll discuss the details shortly. 
As it relates to new store growth, we increased our total store count 11.8% or 487 stores for the past 12 months. This translates into 7.9% more square feet than at the end of the first quarter of last year, with most of the increase in Mexico and China. 
During the first quarter, Wal-Mart International added 2.6 million square feet of retail space through 54 units. We have had some good results internationally in the area of e-commerce and multichannel. During the first quarter of this year, as is online grocery and general merchandise sales grew 20.8% from last year, and Brazil's online general merchandise sales grew 41.1%. We're learning more about the online business in China through the November 2010 launch of the Sam's Club e-commerce site. 
As it relates to acquisitions, our team in the U.K. completed its purchase of the 147 Netto stores from Dansk Supermarked in April 2011, which falls on our second fiscal quarter. We expect to complete the in-store conversions this year, investing more than £100 million and creating more than 1,500 jobs. 
2 of our leaders in the U.K., Judith McKenna and Karen Hubbard have done a great job getting us to this point, and we look forward to seeing the results of our conversions and integration. In fact, we have already opened our first 3 converted stores. We currently own a 35% equity interest in Trust-Mart stores and hold voting rights with respect to an additional 30% interest. We have agreed to acquire the remainder of Trust-Mart once regulatory approvals have been obtained. 
In April, we obtained antitrust clearance and now expect to finalize the other regulatory approvals and complete the transaction by the end of this fiscal year. 
And finally, in South Africa. Competition Tribunal hearings began on May 9. This is what we expect to be the final step in the approval process for our potential investment in Massmart and in sub-Saharan Africa. We remain excited about the opportunity to serve customers in this part of the world. 
Turning to other events happening with our business. We're very proud of the passion and speed with which our associates responded to the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Within the first 3 days following these events, Wal-Mart associates working across Japan quickly took action to help by setting up distribution points for relief items in our store parking lots when the stores themselves were too damaged to open. Associates brought in 95 tons of blankets, flashlights, batteries, water, emergency food and warm clothing. We will continue to actively provide assistance on the ground and monitor the situation to look for additional ways we can help. Our thoughts are with our associates, our customers and the communities we serve in the affected areas. 
From a global perspective, food inflation has made recent headlines. Families in many countries spend a significant amount of income just on food and some of these countries rely heavily on imported commodities as the primary source of food. So increases in food prices can have a fast and dramatic effect in some parts of the world. We're experiencing some inflation in our sales number in just about every market. Argentina, Brazil and Central America are currently experiencing inflation across our basket of goods. We're seeing our highest inflation levels in Argentina, and we're doing our best to keep prices down for our customers in each market. 
Now let's get to the numbers. Carol reminded you earlier about the one-month lag on the international calendar year consequently, we will see the majority of this year's Easter sales in our second quarter results. Wal-Mart International's first quarter reported sales were $27.9 billion, a growth of 11.5% over the first quarter of last year. All of our markets had strong sales growth, except in Japan as our sales results include the effects of the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami.  Changes in currency rates increased our net sales by $1.3 billion. Our first quarter constant currency sales grew 6.2% over last year. This growth came despite the effects of the Japan disasters and the Easter flip. Mexico, China and Chile provided the strongest net sales growth in the first quarter. Jeff detailed the results of several discrete items that affected first quarter comparative results for Wal-Mart International. Please remember these as you review our segment details. 
Our first quarter operating income increased 1.2% over last year to $1.1 billion. However, on a constant-currency basis, operating income was $1 billion, a decline of 3.3%. The decline in constant currency operating income resulted from a decline in our overall gross profit margins and the effect of the discrete items Jeff mentioned earlier. Without these discrete items, constant currency operating income increased over last year but did not grow faster than sales. Wal-Mart International's first quarter constant currency gross profit margin declined from last year due primarily to the change in sales mix associated with the Easter calendar shift and investments in price. 
First quarter membership and other income increased from last year to the $51 million gain on the sale of an investment in Chile. Without this game, membership and other income would've increased $23 million. Constant currency operating expenses for Wal-Mart International grew faster than sales because of the pressure from the discrete items Jeff covered. Without these items, we leveraged constant currency expenses versus last year because of strong expense management in Chile, Canada and Japan. 
Our progress on inventory was disappointing for the first quarter of this year, with days on hand increasing over last year in most of our markets. Much of the 11.4% increase in inventory has to do with new store growth, but clearly our management teams across all countries, especially China and Brazil have this as a priority. Now let's get into the results for several of our larger markets. Country management teams account for the results on a local-currency basis. The following discussion of country results excludes the impact of currency and unless otherwise stated, sales and comp sales are presented on a nominal basis. In Mexico, our sales continue to grow at a fast rate, and operating income grew faster than sales. This will be the last quarter we only discuss Walmex as a result in Mexico. Our second fiscal quarter will be the first time we discuss consolidated results of Walmex and Central America. While the following results are on a U.S. GAAP basis, Walmex separately reports its earnings under Mexican GAAP so some numbers are different from the Walmex reported results. 
Walmex's net sales for the first quarter were up 6.9%, and comparable store sales were up 1.7%. Sales growth came from the strong new store growth program in Mexico where we have 288 more stores than at the end of the first quarter of last year. Customer traffic declined 2.2%, and average ticket increased 3.9% at comparable stores. 
For the first quarter, Walmex's comp store sales for the self service formats grew by 1.5% while ANTAD's comp store sales report the rest of the industry, excluding Walmex, showed only 0.9% growth. Walmex's first quarter operating income grew faster than sales at 9.2% due to higher gross profit margin. 
First quarter gross profit margin as a percentage of sales increased 54 basis points from last year. However, expenses grew 10.4%, primarily on costs of new stores and remodels. Moving on to Brazil. Net sales grew in the first quarter, and Brazil continues to implement EDLP and increase the number of items. However, operating income declined from last year. Prices on more than 10,000 items, primarily in food, have been reduced.  And this number increases each month. As I've said before and as we saw in Japan, this is a long-term initiatives to the expect experience some pain during the conversion period. We're very confident about your opportunities in Brazil, and expect to invest approximately $775 million this year upgrading logistics and technology and opening 80 new stores. 
On another note, our wholesale operations, Sam's Club and Maxxi, have delivered on plan for the first quarter in Brazil. In real terms or removing the impact of inflation, Brazil's first quarter net sales and comparable sales both declined from last year. Customer traffic at comparable stores decreased 8%, and average ticket increased 1.9% in real terms. As expected, first quarter gross profit margin as a percentage of sales declined 140 basis points from last year due to the migration toward a consistent EDLP offering. 
Expenses as a percentage of sales increased 92 points, primarily because of the lower sales growth and 42 new stores opened since the first quarter of last year. The gross margin pressure caused a significant decline in Brazil's operating results from last year.
Earlier, I mentioned the online business in Brazil grew 41.1% this quarter. This was on top of last year's sales growth of 80%. We launched the e-commerce site at the end of 2008, with 10,000 in 11 categories. Today, we offer than 70,000 products across 21 categories. 
In the past 12 months, we have opened 42 new stores in Brazil, bringing our total store count to 480. This includes one new store in the first quarter of this year. 
Moving to Asia, during our investor meeting in March, Scott Price provided insight into our execution path for Japan's EDLP and EDLC implementation and importantly, the value of successfully communicating our EDLP approach to Japanese customers yet as you know, the March 2011 earthquake affected Japan and began the start of a very challenging period. According to statistics released by the Japanese Ministry of the Economy, Trade and Industry, or METI, overall supermarket comparable store sales declined by 3.3% in March of 2011. This is especially tough since this decline is on top of last year's 5.6% of sales decline. According to METI, our performance continues to stay ahead of other large-scale retailers in Japan, and we've maintained our market share in what has been a deflationary environment. 
Wal-Mart Japan's first quarter sales were better than overall supermarket sales. However, the effects of the earthquake and tsunami resulted in an operating loss in the first quarter of this year. First quarter net sales and comparable store sales were flat with last year in real terms. Wal-Mart Japan's traffic declined 2.8% over last year, and the average ticket in real terms increased 2.2%. Our remodeled stores had increases in average ticket of 5.7%, and our other stores had ticket increases of 1.7%, both in real terms. 
Sales in over-the-counter Pharmacy, paper goods and baby had the strongest performance, while sales of electronics, apparel and cosmetics were down. Gross profit margin as a percentage of sales increased by 79 basis points from last year. Expenses as a percentage of sales increased 2% from last year or declined 67 basis points without the earthquake and tsunami charge. Wal-Mart China sales grew in the first quarter as well, but operating income declined slightly from last year. Net sales for the first quarter grew 12.4% over last year, and comparable store growth was 4.5%. 
Average ticket grew 11% in China, but traffic declined 5.8%. The primary traffic decline was in Trust-Mart stores. First quarter gross margin increased 54 basis points over last year, primarily due to purchasing efficiencies. Expenses as a percentage of sales grew 102 basis points, primarily due to increases in associate compensation and tax costs. First quarter operating income declined 4.2%. In the past 12 months, we opened 49 new stores, including 45 supercenters, and that brings our China store count to 333 stores. 
Turning now to the United Kingdom. Andy Clarke and the ASDA team had a solid start to the year, growing sales in the first quarter of this year. However, operating declined from last year, primarily as a result of the charge for the ASDA defined benefit plan and, to a lesser extent, acquisition cost for Netto. 
In the first quarter of this year, comparable sales, excluding fuel,, increased 10 basis points. We will see ASDA strong sales from Easter and the royal wedding in the Easter in the second day. Average ticket in the first quarter increased 30 basis points and traffic decreased by 30 basis points. Sales of chilled foods, children's wear and home were particularly strong in the first quarter. In support of ASDA's EDLP offering, ASDA increased its price guarantee to 10% at the start of the year and almost 3 million customer baskets have been checked online. First quarter operating income declined from last year due to the discrete charge covered earlier, as well as other acquisition costs associated with the Netto purchase. Excluding these charges, as these expenses grew slower than sales under the We Operate for Less program. Operating income was essentially flat to last year. 
ASDA private brands continue to perform well, with its premium brand Extra Special and the mid-tier brand Chosen By You. Chosen by You has been ranked by Kantar Worldpanel as the fastest-growing private brand across the top 4 U.K. grocery retailers. In the last 12 months, ASDA has opened 12 new stores for a total store count of 386. ASDA's commitment to EDLP comes at an important time for its customers who are dealing with the burden of inflation, taxes and record petrol prices. And finally, Canada. 
Wal-Mart Canada sales grew in the first quarter of this year, and operating income grew faster than sales. Net sales grew 4.4% in the first quarter compared to last year, primarily due to the supercenter expansion program and strong sales in most categories. However, first quarter comparables sales declined 60 basis points from last year. Average ticket increased 3.6% for the first quarter and traffic declined 4.2%. As a percentage of sales, gross margin declined 38 basis points from last year and expenses also declined 42 basis points, despite the increase in cost from the new Walmart Canada Bank. The 5.8% increase in operating income from last year was a result of operating expense savings. Wal-Mart Canada recently announced its plans to enter the Québec grocery market with the transformation of its existing stores into supercenters. The first phase of this conversion is scheduled to begin in the second quarter of this year, and these supercenters will carry a full range of fresh food, as well as general merchandise.  
In addition, we will open our first 5 supercenters in the province of Manitoba in the second quarter. In the past 12 months, we opened 8 new stores in Canada, bringing our store count to 325 stores. This year, we expect to open 40 supercenters, including conversions and expansions. 
There are also strong results in our other markets. We have a good track record of leveraging our processes and resources to add value for a new markets, customers and associates. Our January 2009 acquisition of D&S in Chile's a recent example. Wal-Mart Chile grew constant currency sales at 11.5% in the first quarter, and retail square footage increased by 6.5% or 31 stores. 
Our focus on growing sales continues long after the acquisition. Constant currency sales grew 10.9% in the first quarter of this year at our Central American operations. We acquired Central America in 2005, and first quarter sales are now just under $1 billion at $950 million. In closing, Wal-Mart International is well positioned to continue delivering on growth opportunities and comp stores sales, e-commerce and acquisitions. We will also continue to deliver on new store growth. Now I'll turn it over to bill for the update on Wal-Mart U.S."
313055,129808219,131064,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 17, 2011",2011-05-17,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Doug. Earlier in the call, Mike mentioned that we're gaining traction in our Wal-Mart U.S. business as we implement be 4-point plan that I laid out in the fourth quarter. Recall that this plan focuses on driving everyday low price, delivering t",2076,"Thank you, Doug. Earlier in the call, Mike mentioned that we're gaining traction in our Wal-Mart U.S. business as we implement be 4-point plan that I laid out in the fourth quarter. Recall that this plan focuses on driving everyday low price, delivering the broadest assortment possible improving our remodeling efforts and integrating a multichannel experience for our customers. 
Now our best comp performance or remains in the grocery and health and wellness business, both of which had positive comps in the first quarter. As I mentioned in February, these businesses delivered positive comps in the fourth quarter as well. Our negative one point one comp sales were the midpoint of our guidance of negative 2% to flat for the quarter. Comp sales declined for the 13 week period that was driven by lower traffic, which was partially offset by an increase in ticket. Inflation provided a small tailwind. The importance of delivering everyday low price has never been greater as our customers are consolidating trips due to higher gas prices. Our greatest priority remains to grow comp sales. We're focused on our EDLP strategy and moving away from the deep discounts that were in the headlines this time last year. 
We've launched our new ad match marketing campaign in early April, and the customer response has been terrific. Net sales rose 0.6% to $62.7 billion for the first quarter. Grocery again delivered low-single-digit positive comps for the quarter. Our food business is delivering positive sales growth that's on par with the top competitors, and we're seeing a recovery in our consumables business. Customers are responding positively as we expand our merchandise assortment, adding back items across all categories. We began our SKU add back program in the third quarter with dry grocery. We're pleased with the comp sales improvement to date in this area, which is up 150 basis points from the fourth quarter. I believe that sales improvement supports our belief that we're on the right track. As we add more SKUs throughout all categories, we expect to gain further traction, improving both traffic and ticket. 
In consumables, we executed modular changes, the ones I mentioned last quarter and saw positive sales momentum from categories like haircare and fragrance. These modular changes focused on bringing assortment, ensuring opening price points were available in all categories, and increased the holding power on the shelf. As an example, our air care modular was updated in February and we've experienced an 880 basis point comp improvement from the fourth quarter through the first quarter. 
The paycheck cycle remains pronounced. During the quarter, we saw a continued pressure from ongoing macroeconomic conditions as customers continued to trade down to opening price points in some private label products. Our grocery inflation was approximately 1% during the quarter, with the greatest impact on perishables. We continue to act as the agent for our customers by building trust through EDLP. 
Our health and wellness business had a low-single-digit positive comp, driven by our prescription business. 5 years ago, Wal-Mart launched the $4 prescription drug program, and moved that changed the industry and shifted more customers from branded to generic products. While this change helped drive traffic and unit sales, the increase in generic utilization does pressure the top line. However, the new Humana program, which is generating incremental Pharmacy sales and other industry dynamics more than offset this pressure. We expect this program to drive positive results in the coming months. 
Entertainment had mid-single-digit negative comps. That area is still being impacted by price deflation in key electronics items. We did have strong TV unit sales as customers used tax refund loans during the quarter. We continue to see strong prepaid wireless sales, especially in services, though these services are not fully reflected in our top line sales. Hardlines comps were low-single-digit negative. Easter crafts performed well, offset by a weakness in Stationary and hardware. Automotive generated positive comp sales. Temperatures have begun to rebound this month, and we expect improved results across the hardline business. Apparel had mid-single digit negative comp, with the greatest weakness in kids, ladies and shoes. Where we've brought back assortment, like ladies plus, sales and trends are improving. In fact, we posted positive comp for the quarter in ladies plus. We simply are not converting enough of our grocery customers to shop Apparel, and we've been working hard on strategies to improve this important area of the store. We're very focused on driving improvement in basics, including socks, underwear and T-shirts. We're adding back deleted items and even more categories, though this will continue to take time. 
And we're investing in prices we recognize that customers have seen higher prices across the industry for cotton-related Apparel. Apparel's a work in progress but one that has tremendous amount of attention throughout the organization. 
Home posted a mid-single-digit negative comp as well, impacted by delays in the start of the spring selling season. Outdoor Living in particular, a large part of our sales plan for the quarter, had double-digit negative comps because of weather impacts. We're seeing that net turn around now with more favorable weather across most of the country, and I'm pleased with how our customers are responding to our Outdoor Living assortment this month. 
During the first quarter, most of our indoor Home categories, including home decor, cooking, dining and bath had improving sales trends, the result of offering broader assortment. We expect to see momentum pick up in indoor category during the second quarter. Our Walmart.com online business remains strong with an increase in traffic and order size. Sean x remains a strong category including televisions, wireless and Home office. 
In hardlines, tires and automotive categories are strong.  And in Home, we're seeing ongoing strength of sales and furniture. We're also pleased with the ongoing momentum of our Site to Store business.  And now I'll cover the remaining financial results. Gross profit dollars were up 0.6% over last year, in line with the first quarter sales growth, causing the gross margin rate as a percentage of sales to remain flat as expected. Our logistics team continues to implement multiple efficiency initiatives that have minimized the impact of diesel price increases on the cost of sales. 
We were able to leverage expenses again this quarter with total SG&A up only approximately 40 basis points compared to last year. Sales per labor hour improved again for the first quarter building on last year's progress and productivity. Marketing expenses were more nervous levels compared to the same quarter last year. Additionally, we delivered reductions in our excellent costs due to significant attention from store operations. 
Operating income grew faster than sales at 0.8% for the quarter over last year. As expected, inventory was up 6.3% compared to this time last year. However, the year-over-year growth rate of inventory has slowed 109 basis points compared to the fourth quarter. The increase is due in part to our continued focus on bringing back assortment in grocery. 100 basis points was due to inflation, primarily in grocery categories. Approximately, 100 basis points of the increase were also due to higher in transit inventory as we expand our global sourcing initiatives. 
We also recognized increases in inventory for Home, Toys and Seasonal, where weather slowed seasonal sales. Overall, the quality of our inventory remains in good shape. We can ensure that Wal-mart's stores are always in stock, especially for high-turn items in grocery. We must make sure that all stores are customer-ready everyday. 
Our displays must come to life in terms of delivering value and excitement for our customers. We remain optimistic about our growth opportunities in the U.S., and plan to open between 140 and 160 new and converted units this year. Back in October, we shared with you that we plan to open between 185 and 205 units. Consistent with the $1 billion reduction in capital expenditures that we disclosed last quarter, we are delaying the delivery of additional inbox conversions of discount stores to supercenters as we take the time to review and adjust this initiative. Was of Most. Capital commitment goes to supercenters. However, we's are also committing to small formats, including those between 30,000 and 60,000 square feet, as well as stores that will range from 15,000 to 30,000 square feet. 
The strength of our food business is reflected in the continued performance of our Neighborhood Market grocery stores, which average about 40,000 square feet today. We're pleased with both the comp and the returns of these grocery stores. In fact, this quarter, our Neighborhood Market comp increase was approximately 4%, driven by traffic increase of almost 2%. 
Because of this momentum, we're starting to accelerate the opening of even more Neighborhood Markets. We're on schedule this year to open between 15 and 20 Neighborhood Market stores to capture growth in untapped markets. 
We'll also open several of the Wal-Mart Express stores as a pilot in both rural and urban areas, with the goal of having 15 to 20 stores by year end. This is our new format, averaging 15,000 square feet and offering customers fresh food along with key general merchandise categories. 
Wal-Mart Express will also include our Site to Store programs so that customers can take advantage of Wal-Mart's broad online merchandise assortment. The Express pilots will be different so we can determine which merchandise assortment is right for the community. Some will have pharmacy, some won't. The goal is to get the model right so that when we have the format, we'll roll it out and it will be successful. 
I've already talked about the first 2 points of the 4-point plan, price leadership and the broadest assortment. Our third point we're driving efficiencies in our remodel program. Our remodels are underway this quarter and will be completed in less time than in the past 2 years. They will be less disruptive to our customers and associates. Through reengineering efforts, we're able to increase the efficiency of our remodeling plan by reducing, on average, 15% in the cost for each supercenter. 
And finally, our multichannel integration is an important focus for our long-term growth strategy. We're testing several programs to help us better integrate the stores with our website. Our expanded Pick Up Today program is currently rolled out to 2,800 stores and doing well. While it's early for data, we're pleased with the customer response. The program will be in 3,000 stores by the end of the second quarter. We expect to see continued growth in this service as we make more items available on Walmart.com for immediate pickup. 
Rising gas prices, high unemployment and increasing inflation continue to be the most important issues facing our customers today. 1 in 5 Wal-Mart moms list gasoline as a top expense behind housing and car payments. We continue to be prepared to help her with low prices and broad assortment during this time of uncertainty. 
Last year, during the second quarter, Wal-Mart had the deep rollbacks that drove our unit sales of some items but did not deliver the intended traffic and basket lift we were looking for.  We will not repeat these programs this year. 
We're monitoring the economic environment carefully, and significant changes in gas prices and inflation during the quarter will influence our actual performance. We expect Wal-Mart U.S. comp sales for the second quarter period running from April 30 through July 29 to range from negative 1% to positive 1%, and our 13-week comp for last year in the second quarter declined 1.8%. 
Our continued focus on productivity initiatives will enable us to leverage expenses through the second quarter. Inventory will return to normal Wal-Mart levels, meaning 1/3 the rate of sales growth, by the end of the third quarter after we anniversary our efforts to bring back assortment. 
Before I close, I'd like to recognize the hard work of our associates who've been impacted by the flooding across the central plains in the South. Countless associates and customers are dealing with the effects of the rising Mississippi River. When our stores are also affected, our priorities are to get them open and operating. They're often the first place that people in the community turn to for basics and clean up products, and Wal-Mart will be there to help our customers get back on their feet no matter what the disaster. It's part of our mission and it's part who we are. Now I'll turn it over to Charles."

First, growth. Jeff pointed out earlier that sales increased 4.4% in the first quarter, with solid sales results from Wal-Mart International and Sam's Club.

Jeff pointed out earlier that sales increased 4.4% in the first quarter, with solid sales results from Wal-Mart International and Sam's Club. We continue to remain focused on growing comp sales and new stores throughout our markets. And let me add, comp sales improvement is our clear priority for Wal-Mart U.S. We will continue to invest in growth, and our capital plan of $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion remains in place for this year. 
We're still on track for sales growth of 4% to 6% and square footage growth of 3% to 4%. I remind you that these goals exclude acquisitions such as Netto. We added 59 net units and approximately 3.7 million square feet of retail space since the end of fiscal 2011. International contributed almost 2.6 million square feet in the first quarter. Worldwide, we now have 9,029 units and approximately 989 million square feet of retail space. 
We have great opportunities for long-term growth in emerging markets such as Brazil and China. Wal-Mart U.S. will continue to open supercenters in smaller formats. In addition, Sam's Club will open between 7 and 10 clubs this year. 
Turning to leverage. As Mike said earlier, the productivity loop remains a crucial priority for us. We continue to drive efficiencies throughout our business, which helps sustain our commitment to everyday low price. For 6 consecutive quarters now, our company has leveraged operating expenses.  And our third priority, returns. On a rolling 12-month basis ending April 30, 2011, return on investment ended at 18.5%. It is important to know that our underlying operations continue to remain maintain stable returns. 
In March, we were pleased to report that our board declared an annual dividend of $1.46 per share for the fiscal year, a 21% increase over the previous year's dividend. We returned a $3.4 billion to our shareholders during the first quarter through dividends and share repurchase. We remain committed to returning the value to shareholders. 
Last quarter, I mentioned that the majority of our business now operates on our new SAP financial system, including the U.S., U.K. and Canada. We have completed our conversions in Mexico, and we have just recently started in Central America and Argentina. These improved systems provide more efficient financial processes around the world, allowing Wal-Mart to leverage knowledge and resources and increase consistency throughout our organization. 
Next, let's move on to guidance. Based on our views of the macroeconomic and sales environment in the U.S. and around the world, we expect second quarter fiscal 2012 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.05 and $1.10, which compares to last year's earning per share of $0.97. These estimates assume the currency exchange rates remain at current levels. 
In closing, I'd like to summarize a few points from our call today. We delivered strong earnings per share above our guidance for the first quarter of the fiscal year despite continued economic headwinds affecting our customers. We increased net sales by 4.4% and added approximately 3.7 million square feet of retail selling space around the world. 
Leveraging expenses remains a priority as it serves as a pre-cursor to EDLP. Since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we have leveraged operating expenses. Our business model, Every Day Low Costs, driving everyday low prices is central to how we operate. We are on track for company sales growth of 4% to 6% this year. We intend to grow through comp sales and new stores, as well as through multichannel initiatives, including e-commerce. And finally, we remain committed to shareholder returns through share repurchase and dividends. Thank you for listening today. We appreciate your interest in Wal-Mart."

Thanks for joining us today for our earnings call to review the first quarter of fiscal year 2012. Key information for this quarter, including updated unit counts, square footage and financial metrics, is available on our website at walmartstores.com/investors. A full transcript of the call will be available on the website after 7 a.m. Central Time today on May 17, 2011. Historical data can also be found on the site as well. 
We have a full agenda for today's first quarter recap. Mike Duke, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., will start off with the key results and commentary on our business strategies. As you can see from our press release this morning, we do have some discrete items that are accounted for in our results. So Jeff Davis, SVP of Finance and Treasurer, will cover the consolidated financial results, including more analysis on the noise. Then we'll go to the Operating segments. First up will be Brian Cornell, President and CEO of Sam's Club. Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart International, will cover the overall results for International as well as our 6 largest countries. We will close the segment discussion with Bill Simon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart U.S. Finally, our CFO, Charles Holley, will present our financial report card and our guidance for the second quarter. 
Recall that we do not provide a full year guidance update this quarter. In our fourth quarter call from February, we said that we would no longer provide details on the membership and other income line except for Sam's Club because it's only relevant and material for Sam's. In this quarter, we include a discussion of a gain from the sale of an investment in Chile that is included in other income. Also, as we do from time to time, we will make reclassifications for consistency. 
Let me remind you as you listen today that our fiscal calendar for Wal-Mart International is different from the corporate fiscal calendar. All of our International countries, with the exception of Canada, end their fiscal quarter on March 31, while our consolidated financials end on April 30. This is particularly important given the shift in the Easter timing this year. International sales from Easter in all but Canada will be included in the second quarter results. 
And finally, our Annual Meeting of Shareholders is Friday, June 3, at the Bud Walton Arena in Fayetteville, Arkansas. We'll start promptly at 7 a.m. Central Time. If you can't join us in person, the meeting will be available via webcast on the corporate website. That's walmartstores.com. 
Now Mike, let's get started with our first quarter results. Mike?"

Wal-Mart is reporting EPS of $0.98 from continuing operations, exceeding our guidance range for the first quarter. This reflects the stability and strength of our global operations. Let me dive into some of the",1136,"Thank you, Carol. Good morning, everyone. Wal-Mart is reporting EPS of $0.98 from continuing operations, exceeding our guidance range for the first quarter. This reflects the stability and strength of our global operations. 
Let me dive into some of the key numbers for the quarter. Net sales were up 4.4% to $103.4 billion with strong contributions from Wal-Mart International and Sam's Club. Wal-Mart U.S. comps were negative 1.1%, which was roughly the mid-point of our guidance. Sam's Club comp of 4.2% was 120 basis points above guidance. Consolidated operating income was up 2.8% to $5.9 billion. 
The company leveraged operating expenses. The really great thing is that we have many more opportunities to leverage our scale, technology and innovative processes across the entire business. Return on investment was down due primarily to currency translation and cash accumulations. Jeff will provide additional details. For the quarter, the company returned $3.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Now let me move on to the highlights of the individual Operating segments. The Wal-Mart U.S. comp sales decline of 1.1% was within our guidance range. We recognize we still have work to do, and comp sales growth remains the greatest priority for me and the entire Wal-Mart U.S. team. The good news is that the plan Bill Simon and his team are executing is gaining traction. Bill will elaborate more on our progress. We're focused on delivering EDLP in a wide assortment, and customers are responding favorably where we've made the most progress on executing the plan. I'm encouraged with what I hear from customers when I visit our U.S. stores. In grocery, we are further along with the transition, but the work on general merchandise will not be completed until the second half of the year. 
Our business model positions us well for customers who appreciate the one-stop shopping that our U.S. supercenters offer. Despite improvements in some areas of the economy, core Wal-Mart U.S. customers are still stretched. They remain concerned about rising prices for gas, energy and food as well as employment issues. Customers trust us to be their ally in fighting rising gas prices and inflation. We continue to earn that trust when we deliver on our commitment to EDLP. 
International remains the key growth driver for our company, and the segment has seen continued growth through a combination of comps and new stores. We will see the results of the Easter sales in the second quarter in our International markets, so I'm pleased to report that almost every market had strong sales growth this quarter. Mexico, China and Chile, not only had the best comp growth, but also the highest percentage sales increase for the quarter compared to last year. It's not a surprise that Japan's March sales were soft as the country continues to recover from the devastation of the earthquake and tsunami. We're pleased that we're beginning to see Japan stabilize. 
Our overall growth comes from comp sales and new stores, but we also grow through acquisitions. In April, we completed the acquisition of the Netto stores in the U.K., and the transition is underway to convert these stores to the ASDA brand. The Netto transaction and its results will show up in our second quarter. We're waiting for the outcome of the competition tribunal hearings in South Africa on our proposed investment in Massmart. 
I continue to see tremendous opportunity in the emerging markets like Brazil. Last month, I spent a week traveling to 3 cities in Brazil where I visited 25 stores. I believe that the transition underway to EDLP is right for our customers, though it will take time to shift the culture and improve the profitability. 
Operating income for Wal-Mart International was up 1.2% on a reported basis. International did not leverage expenses, so there is further opportunity on SG&A. 
Sam's Club delivered really good results this quarter with a 4.2% comp that was well above our guidance. I really like the positive momentum at Sam's Club, which is reflected, not only in comp sales, but also in increases in new members. We've been upgrading the quality and the value of our offering at Sam's, and the results are strong across-the-board. This quarter delivered the highest member experience scores that Sam's has ever had. 
I'm proud of the work of the Sam's Club team. They also delivered strong operating income and leveraged expenses. The warehouse club channel is increasing in importance in the retail landscape, and Sam's is gaining further momentum. We expect Sam's to add even more value to the company's overall portfolio. 
Wal-Mart has a tremendous growth opportunity in e-commerce. Customers today want continuous shopping channels, and they want price transparency. We're bringing together our stores, logistics expertise and systems to create an integrated shopping experience that moves seamlessly with the customer from the store to web-enabled devices. 
Over the last few weeks, you've also seen us ramp up investments in new talent and technology. We closed on the acquisition of Kosmix, and our teams are integrated into @WalmartLabs in Silicon Valley. This acquisition allows us to expand our capabilities in the online social commerce environment. 
The growth potential of e-commerce is especially significant in markets like China. We are committed to being at the forefront of this growth. On Friday, we announced that we are acquiring a minority stake in Yihaodian, one of China's leading online retailers. Yihaodian has achieved a significant position in online grocery sales as well as general merchandise, including electronics and apparel. We expect ongoing activity in the e-commerce area around the world. 
We know our customers also expect us to be a leader on the issues that matter to them. In April, we issued an expanded Global Responsibility Report in which we provided greater transparency and accountability on our efforts to be a responsible company around the world. We're pleased with the response to this report. 
As we build the next-generation Wal-Mart, staying close to the front lines of the business is at the top of my agenda, and I expect the same of every member of our leadership team. From Brazil to Silicon Valley, I visited more than 75 stores in this quarter alone. Everywhere I go I see customers working hard to make ends meet. Inflation and gas prices are adding to the pressures. They look to us to help them save money and live better. 
I've never been more confident in the relevance of our EDLP promise and our talented teams delivering on that promise. Wal-Mart will continue to manage the business for the short term and the long term. We will grow comps and open new stores, and we remain committed to leveraging expenses and improving returns for our shareholders. 
Now I'll turn it over to Jeff for more details on our financial results. Jeff?"
313055,129808219,131103,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 17, 2011",2011-05-17,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. For the first quarter of fiscal 2012, Wal-Mart's income from continuing operations was $3.4 billion, an increase of 3.8% over last year. Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart were $0.98, an increase of 12.",948,"Thank you, Mike. For the first quarter of fiscal 2012, Wal-Mart's income from continuing operations was $3.4 billion, an increase of 3.8% over last year. Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart were $0.98, an increase of 12.6% compared to $0.87 for the first quarter last year. First quarter EPS from continuing operations included the benefit of approximately $0.01 per share related to currency translation. In the first quarter last year, earnings per share benefited from currency translation by $0.02. 
In addition to the impact of currency translation, we have several other discrete items that impacted the first quarter. All the following numbers are pretax. We realized approximately $117 million from the mark-to-market gains on foreign currency derivative positions. ASDA recorded an approximate $67 million charge related to the removal of future benefit accruals and the effect of future pay increases from its defined benefit plan. Wal-Mart Japan incurred approximately $51 million casualty loss related to the March earthquake and tsunami. And finally, Wal-Mart Chile recorded approximately $51 million gain from the sale of an investment. 
All of these items are included in operating expenses with the exception of the gain from the sale in Chile, which is recorded in membership and other income. The net summary of these items accounted for approximately $0.01 of our EPS for the first quarter. 
As Mike mentioned, consolidated net sales increased by 4.4% or $4.3 billion to $103.4 billion for the quarter. The increase in sales was driven by Wal-Mart International and Sam's Club and included a currency exchange rate benefit of $1.3 billion. On a constant currency basis, sales grew 3% to $102.1 billion. 
The 13-week U.S. comp sales, without fuel, decreased 0.3%. You will hear more details on the Wal-Mart U.S. and Sam's comp sales from Bill and Brian. 
For the quarter, gross margin on sales was 24.4%, down 30 basis points compared to last year, driven by Wal-Mart International and Sam's Club. Unallocated corporate overhead and other, which includes other investment in global e-commerce, decreased by 20.8% to $309 million for the quarter. The $117 million mark-to-market gains on foreign currency derivative positions were the primary drivers of the decrease. Excluding these gains and global e-commerce initiatives, our core corporate overhead expense increased approximately $15 million or 3.9% compared to last year. I'm happy to say we have EDLC focused in our corporate areas. 
Consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 18 basis points on sales growth of 4.4%. On a constant currency basis, consolidated operating expenses increased 1.9%. Our focus on ensuring Every Day Low Costs remains a priority throughout the company. 
First quarter consolidated operating income was $5.9 billion, a 2.8% increase versus last year, which included a $49 million currency benefit. On a constant currency basis, consolidated operating income increased 1.9% for the first quarter versus last year. 
Net interest expense for the quarter increased 10% to $518 million. This was driven by higher debt levels compared to last year as we opportunistically issued new debt at historically low rates, offset partially by lower average interest rates on our outstanding debt. 
The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 33.5%. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 to be between 33.5% and 34.5%, although we will see some quarterly fluctuations. Changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and International operations may impact our effective tax rate. 
First quarter consolidated inventory grew 9.5% compared to last year. The inventory growth was primarily covered by a comparable increase in payables. Payables as a percentage of inventories remained stable at approximately 90%. In addition, consolidated inventory turns remained stable. 
In the first quarter, we issued $5 billion of long-term bonds for general corporate purposes at tighter levels than preliminary pricing guidance suggested, indicating strong investor demand. Our AA credit rating provides continued access to low-cost debt. 
The debt-to-total-capitalization ratio was 46.1% in the first quarter compared to 41.6% at the end of the first quarter last year. Since last year, we issued more than $10 billion in debt at historically low interest rates. We ended the first quarter with negative free cash flow of approximately $400 million due to our increased investment in inventory and timing of payments for our accrued liabilities. Free cash flow was in line with expectations. The company ended last year's first quarter with negative free cash flow of $1.6 billion due to lower-than-normal inventory levels at the end of fiscal 2010.
Capital expenditures were approximately $2.4 billion for the first quarter compared with $2.6 billion in the first quarter last year. We added approximately 3.7 million of new retail square footage and 59 new operating units during the quarter. In the first quarter, we distributed $1.3 billion in dividends. As a reminder, we increased our fiscal 2012 annual dividend per share by approximately 21% to $1.46 from $1.21 in fiscal 2011. 
In addition, we repurchased approximately $2.1 billion of shares during the first quarter, representing approximately 39.3 million shares. This leaves us with approximately $2.7 billion remaining on our $15 billion share repurchase authorization announced last June. 
Clearly, one of our priorities is returning value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During the first quarter, Wal-Mart returned $3.4 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Return on investment or ROI for the trailing 12 months ended April 3, 2011, was 18.5% compared to 19.2% for the prior year. The primary drivers of change in ROI were the impact from currency exchange and cash held for pending acquisitions. 
Now let's move to the discussion of our Operating segments. We'll start with Sam's Club. Brian?"
313055,129808219,131103,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 17, 2011",2011-05-17,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jeff. I am very excited to share that Sam's Club momentum has continued into the new fiscal year. We sequentially increased our comp sales in each quarter of last year, and that momentum continued into the first quarter. Comp club sales, excl",1174,"Thank you, Jeff. I am very excited to share that Sam's Club momentum has continued into the new fiscal year. We sequentially increased our comp sales in each quarter of last year, and that momentum continued into the first quarter. 
Comp club sales, excluding fuel, increased 4.2% for the 13-week period ending April 29, 2011, exceeding our guidance of 1% to 3%. This is our fifth quarter of sequential quarterly comp improvement. We combined solid unit sales growth and increased traffic with excellent margin management. We leveraged operating expenses this quarter. 
Our membership acquisition performance was wrong. In fact, it was our best quarterly performance since I joined Sam's Club in March of 2009. This strength was driven by key membership events and excellent execution in the clubs. These strong results across all key areas of our business flow through to operating income, which, excluding fuel, increase faster than the rate of sales. 
Before I get in the detailed financial results, let me address the current dynamic around fuel, an important part of our value proposition. Our fuel stations establish the initial price perception and drive traffic to the clubs. We also know that great prices on gasoline drive member loyalty in terms of renewal rates and ticket. We're pumping more gallons of fuel and generating more sales dollars per gallon this year versus last year. 
Fuel prices in the first quarter this year are approximately 35% higher than a year ago, and gallons sold are up 22%. Including fuel, first quarter sales were $12.8 billion, a 9.4% increase over last year, and operating income increased 7% to $459 million. While top line fuel sales have increased, fuel profit on a dollar basis was basically flat to last year for the quarter. 
We see a large impact on gross margin percentages. Volatility in fuel prices can have a notable impact on our financial results, both positive and negative. We will continue with our strategy around fuel to be the price leader in the market. Our discussion today therefore excludes fuel for comparative purposes unless otherwise noted. 
Now let's turn to the detailed financial results. For the first quarter, net sales for Sam's Club increased to $11.3 billion, a 4.9% increase over last year. Comp club sales for the 13-week period increased 4.2%. Despite the impact of heavy snow in February, and flooding and tornadoes in April, comp club sales increases were strong across all 3 geographic operating divisions, and we are particularly pleased with the combined sales strength of our South and West divisions. Comp performance was driven more by our item growth than inflation. 
Comp ticket and traffic increased for the 13-week period by 190 and 230 basis points, respectively. Comp ticket increased for both Business and Advantage members. Comp traffic increased for Advantage members and was relatively flat for our Business members. 
Our ticket and traffic performance was driven in part due to our strategy to be the price leader in key everyday needs categories, such as grocery, cleaning and laundry. We also hosted several events, such as our second eValues Savings Celebration, in which we offered eValues to all members and the Taste of Sam's event. 
The frequency of member visits improved for both Business and Advantage members, particularly during the weekends. We have taken an approach to the weekends in which our clubs are focused on executing specific plans to elevate the in-club experience and member service. The plans are focused on key areas that are high touch points like fresh food, grocery and the front end. These are paying off in sales and improved member experience scores. 
From a merchandise perspective, comp increases were strong across fresh foods, grocery, home and apparel categories. We continue to see inflation in key categories, such as produce, meat and dairy. However, we managed through inflation with little impact on our margin and have seen continued growth in units sold year-over-year. The quality of our sales in our core categories was very strong, and we grew comp sales despite tobacco being a headwind during the first quarter. The challenge in tobacco is driven by the cycling of last year's tobacco pre-buys in anticipation of significant price increases as well as a change in our credit card reward program that disproportionately impacts our members who shop this category heavily. We anticipate tobacco being a headwind for the rest of the year. Recall that the average income for a Sam's Club member is above $75,000 annually. Discretionary spend is increasing as seen in our improved sales performance in home, apparel and certain technology and entertainment categories, including consumer electronics. Our gross margin rate was flat as a percentage of sales for the first quarter. 
For the quarter, inventory, including fuel, was up 10.6%. As we have mentioned in previous calls, we anticipated higher inventory growth rates through the quarter. These increases were driven by larger seasonal buys, earlier transition in seasonal and electronics and inflation. Additionally, we were up against historically low inventory levels last year. We expect inventory growth rates to return to a single digit in the second quarter as we manage inventory flow and members' needs. 
As mentioned earlier, I am very pleased with our progress on expense leverage and club efficiency. We reduced expenses as a percentage of sales by 17 basis points, driven by controlling wage costs. For the quarter, sales per labor hour increased 3.1% and units per labor hour increased 2.5%. 
Membership and other income for the first quarter increased 40 basis points versus last year. As you know, membership income is recorded under the deferred revenue recognition basis, so it's important to understand what's going on with membership income on a cash basis. Growth in membership income on a cash basis was very strong with increases in the mid- single digits. This strength came across all membership segments, and we are very pleased with the overall membership results. Membership income in the first quarter increased 40 basis points versus last year. For the second quarter, we anticipate membership income to continue the positive momentum with key events planned to engage our members in the clubs. 
We have also placed an emphasis on in-club renewals and on our Plus membership offering. We saw broad-based strength in renewal rates across membership categories in the quarter. Business add-on membership trends had begun to stabilize and are showing positive momentum. However, our small business members remain concerned with the economy and reduced access to credit. Therefore, we anticipate continued headwinds for our Business memberships throughout the fiscal year. 
First quarter operating income increased to $457 million, a 6.3% increase. Our sales momentum remains strong as we enter the first weeks of the second quarter. We expect comp club sales, without fuel, for the current 13-week period from April 30 through July 29 to increase 3% to 5%. Last year, Sam's comp club sales, excluding fuel, increased 1% for the comparable 13-week period. 
Now I will turn the program over to Doug to share with you the results for Wal-Mart International. Doug?"
313055,129808219,131103,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 17, 2011",2011-05-17,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brian.

On March 30 and 31, we shared with you while we are so excited about the growth prospects for China and Asia at our Annual International Conference for the Investment Community in Shenzhen, China. We came with a full team, including Scott Price, Cathy Smith, Ed Chan, Ed Kolodzieski and others, and we provided additional insight into our business strategy, our Asian operations and answered many questions from the analyst community. 
One of the key takeaways from that meeting is that we have a strategic plan in place to move Wal-Mart International from a good business into a great business, and this will be underpinned by doing what we do best: providing our customers great value through Every Day Low Prices. Our management team is focused on delivering that plan through what I referred to as the 4 dimensions of growth: comp store sales; new stores; e-commerce and multichannel; and finally, acquisitions. 
Here is what our first fiscal quarter looked like in terms of these 4 dimensions. For the first quarter of fiscal 2012, all of our markets had encouraging comp store sales results with Mexico, China and Chile having the highest comps. By the way, as it relates to Chile, we've seen double-digit comp store sales for several quarters since we made this investment, and I'm really proud of the Wal-Mart Chile team and our integration team. They've done a great job. The Easter calendar change and Brazil's EDLP implementation negatively impacted our comp store sales, and I'll discuss the detail shortly. 
As it relates to new store growth, we increased our total store count 11.8% or 487 stores for the past 12 months. This translates into 7.9% more square feet than at the end of the first quarter of last year with most of the increase in Mexico and China. 
During the first quarter, Wal-Mart International added 2.6 million square feet of retail space through 54 units. We have had some good results internationally in the area of e-commerce and multichannel. During the first quarter of this year, ASDA's online grocery and general merchandise sales grew 20.8% from last year, and Brazil's online general merchandise sales grew 41.1%. We're learning more about the Online business in China through the November 2010 launch of the Sam's Club e-commerce site. 
As it relates to acquisitions, our team in the U.K. completed its purchase of the 147 Netto stores from Dansk Supermarked in April 2011, which falls in our second fiscal quarter. We expect to complete the in-store conversions this year, investing more than GBP 100 million and creating more than 1,500 jobs. 
Two of our leaders in the U.K., Judith McKenna and Karen Hubbard, have done a great job getting us to this point, and we look forward to seeing the results of our conversions and integration. In fact, we have already opened our first 3 converted stores. We currently own a 35% equity interest in Trust-Mart stores and hold voting rights with respect to an additional 30% interest. We have agreed to acquire the remainder of Trust-Mart once regulatory approvals have been obtained. 
In April, we obtained antitrust clearance and now expect to finalize the other regulatory approvals and complete the transaction by the end of this fiscal year. 
And finally, in South Africa, competition tribunal hearings began on May 9. This is what we expect to be the final step in the approval process for our potential investment in Massmart and in sub-Saharan Africa. We remain excited about the opportunity to serve customers in this part of the world. 
Turning to other events happening with our business. We're very proud of the passion and speed with which our associates responded to the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Within the first 3 days following these events, Wal-Mart associates working across Japan quickly took action to help by setting up distribution points for relief items in our store parking lots when the stores themselves were too damaged to open. Associates brought in 95 tons of blankets, flashlights, batteries, water, emergency food and warm clothing. We will continue to actively provide assistance on the ground and monitor the situation to look for additional ways we can help. Our thoughts are with our associates, our customers and the communities we serve in the affected areas. 
From a global perspective, food inflation has made recent headlines. Families in many countries spend a significant amount of their income just on food, and some of these countries rely heavily on imported commodities as the primary source of food. So increases in food prices can have a fast and dramatic effect in some parts of the world. We're experiencing some inflation in our sales numbers in just about every market. Argentina, Brazil and Central America are currently experiencing inflation across our basket of goods. We're seeing our highest inflation levels in Argentina, and we're doing our best to keep prices down for our customers in each market. 
Now let's get to the numbers. Carol reminded you earlier about the one-month lag on the International calendar. Consequently, we will see the majority of this year's Easter sales in our second quarter results. Wal-Mart International's first quarter reported sales were $27.9 billion, a growth of 11.5% over the first quarter of last year. All of our markets had strong sales growth except in Japan as our sales results include the effects of the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Changes in currency rates increased our net sales by $1.3 billion. Our first quarter constant currency sales grew 6.2% over last year. This growth came despite the effects of the Japan disasters and the Easter flip. Mexico, China and Chile provided the strongest net sales growth in the first quarter. Jeff detailed the results of several discrete items that affected first quarter comparative results for Wal-Mart International. Please remember these as you review our segment details. 
Our first quarter operating income increased 1.2% over last year to $1.1 billion. However, on a constant currency basis, operating income was $1 billion, a decline of 3.3%. The decline in constant currency operating income resulted from a decline in our overall gross profit margins and the effect of the discrete items Jeff mentioned earlier. Without these discrete items, constant currency operating income increased over last year but did not grow faster than sales. Wal-Mart International's first quarter constant currency gross profit margin declined from last year due primarily to the change in sales mix associated with the Easter calendar shift and investments in price. 
First quarter membership and other income increased from last year to the $51 million gain on the sale of an investment in Chile. Without this gain, membership and other income would've increased $23 million. Constant currency operating expenses for Wal-Mart International grew faster than sales because of the pressure from the discrete items Jeff covered. Without these items, we leveraged constant currency expenses versus last year because of strong expense management in Chile, Canada and Japan. 
Our progress on inventory was disappointing for the first quarter of this year with days on hand increasing over last year in most of our markets. Much of the 11.4% increase in inventory has to do with new store growth, but clearly, our management teams across all countries, especially China and Brazil, have this as a priority. 
Now let's get into the results for several of our larger markets. Country management teams account for the results on a local currency basis. The following discussion of country results excludes the impact of currency, and unless otherwise stated, sales and comp sales are presented on a nominal basis. In Mexico, our sales continue to grow at a fast rate, and operating income grew faster than sales. This will be the last quarter we only discuss Walmex as results in Mexico. Our second fiscal quarter will be the first time we discuss consolidated results of Walmex and Central America. While the following results are on a U.S. GAAP basis, Walmex separately reports its earnings under Mexican GAAP, so some numbers are different from the Walmex reported results. 
Walmex's net sales for the first quarter were up 6.9% and comparable store sales were up 1.7%. Sales growth came from the strong new store growth program in Mexico where we have 288 more stores than at the end of the first quarter of last year. Customer traffic declined to 2.2% and average ticket increased 3.9% at comparable stores. 
For the first quarter, Walmex comp store sales for the self-service formats grew by 1.5%, while ANTAD's comp store sales report for the rest of the industry, excluding Walmex, showed only 0.9% growth. Walmex's first quarter operating income grew faster than sales at 9.2% due to higher gross profit margin. 
First quarter gross profit margin as a percentage of sales increased 54 basis points from last year. However, expenses grew 10.4%, primarily on costs of new stores and remodels. Moving on to Brazil. Net sales grew in the first quarter, and Brazil continues to implement EDLP and increase the number of items. However, operating income declined from last year. Prices on more than 10,000 items, primarily in food, have been reduced, and this number increases each month. As I've said before and as we saw in Japan, this is a long-term initiative, so we expect to experience some pain during the conversion period. We're very confident about our opportunities in Brazil and expect to invest approximately $775 million this year, upgrading logistics, and technology and opening 80 new stores. 
On another note, our wholesale operations, Sam's Club and Maxxi, have delivered on plan for the first quarter in Brazil. In real terms or removing the impact of inflation, Brazil's first quarter net sales and comparable sales both declined from last year. Customer traffic at comparable stores decreased 8% and average ticket increased 1.9% in real terms. As expected, first quarter gross profit margin as a percentage of sales declined 140 basis points from last year due to the migration toward a consistent EDLP offering. 
Expenses as a percentage of sales increased 92 basis points, primarily because of the lower sales growth and 42 new stores opened since the first quarter of last year. The gross margin pressure caused a significant decline in Brazil's operating results from last year.
Earlier, I mentioned the Online business in Brazil grew 41.1% this quarter. This was on top of last year's sales growth of 80%. We launched the e-commerce site at the end of 2008 with 10,000 products in 11 categories. Today, we offer than 70,000 products across 21 categories. 
In the past 12 months, we have opened 42 new stores in Brazil, bringing our total store count to 480. This includes one new store in the first quarter of this year. 
Moving to Asia, during our investor meeting in March, Scott Price provided insight into our execution path for Japan's EDLP and EDLC implementation, and importantly, the value of successfully communicating our EDLP approach to Japanese customers. As you know, the March 2011 earthquake affected Japan and began the start of a very challenging period. According to statistics released by the Japanese Ministry of the Economy, Trade and Industry or METI, overall supermarket comparable store sales declined by 3.3% in March of 2011. This is especially tough since this decline is on top of last year's 5.6% comp sales decline. According to METI, our performance continues to stay ahead of other large-scale retailers in Japan, and we've maintained our market share in what has been a deflationary environment. 
Wal-Mart Japan's first quarter sales were better than overall supermarket sales. However, the effects of the earthquake and tsunami resulted in an operating loss in the first quarter of this year. First quarter net sales and comparable store sales were flat to last year in real terms. Wal-Mart Japan's traffic declined 2.8% over last year, and the average ticket in real terms increased 2.2%. Our remodeled stores had increases in average ticket of 5.7%, and our other stores had ticket increases of 1.7% both in real terms. 
Sales in over-the-counter pharmacy, paper goods and baby had the strongest performance, while sales of electronics, apparel and cosmetics were down. Gross profit margin as a percentage of sales increased by 79 basis points from last year. Expenses as a percentage of sales increased 2% from last year or declined 67 basis points without the earthquake and tsunami charge. Wal-Mart China sales grew in the first quarter as well, but operating income declined slightly from last year. Net sales for the first quarter grew 12.4% over last year and comparable store growth was 4.5%. 
Average ticket grew 11% in China, but traffic declined 5.8%. The primary traffic decline was in Trust-Mart stores. First quarter gross margin increased 54 basis points over last year, primarily due to purchasing efficiencies. Expenses as a percentage of sales grew 102 basis points, primarily due to increases in associate compensation and tax costs. First quarter operating income declined 4.2%. In the past 12 months, we opened 49 new stores, including 45 supercenters, and that brings our China store count to 333 stores. 
Turning now to the United Kingdom. Andy Clarke and the ASDA team had a solid start to the year, growing sales in the first quarter of this year. However, operating income declined from last year, primarily as a result of the charge for the ASDA-defined benefit plan and, to a lesser extent, acquisition cost for Netto. 
In the first quarter of this year, comparable sales, excluding fuel, increased 10 basis points. We will see ASDA's strong sales from Easter and the royal wedding in our second quarter. Average ticket in the first quarter increased 30 basis points and traffic decreased by 20 basis points. Sales of chilled foods, children's wear and home were particularly strong in the first quarter. In support of ASDA's EDLP offering, ASDA increased its price guarantee to 10% at the start of the year, and almost 3 million customer baskets have been checked online. First quarter operating income declined from last year due to the discrete charge covered earlier as well as other acquisition costs associated with the Netto purchase. Excluding these charges, ASDA's expenses grew slower than sales under the We Operate for Less program. Operating income was essentially flat to last year. 
ASDA private brands continue to perform well with its premium brand, Extra Special, and the mid-tier brand, Chosen By You. Chosen by You has been ranked by Kantar Worldpanel as the fastest-growing private brand across the top 4 U.K. grocery retailers. In the last 12 months, ASDA has opened 12 new stores for a total store count of 386. ASDA's commitment to EDLP comes at an important time for its customers who are dealing with the burden of inflation, taxes and record petrol prices. 
And finally, Canada. Walmart Canada sales grew in the first quarter of this year, and operating income grew faster than sales. Net sales grew 4.4% in the first quarter compared to last year, primarily due to the supercenter expansion program and strong sales in most categories. However, first quarter comparables sales declined 60 basis points from last year. Average ticket increased 3.6% for the first quarter and traffic declined 4.2%. As a percentage of sales, gross margin declined to 38 basis points from last year and expenses also declined 42 basis points despite the increase in cost from the new Walmart Canada Bank. The 5.8% increase in operating income from last year was a result of operating expense savings. Walmart Canada recently announced its plans to enter the Quebec grocery market with the transformation of its existing stores into supercenters. The first phase of this conversion is scheduled to begin in the second quarter of this year, and these supercenters will carry a full range of fresh food as well as general merchandise.  
In addition, we will open our first 5 supercenters in the province of Manitoba in the second quarter. In the past 12 months, we opened 8 new stores in Canada, bringing our store count to 325 stores. This year, we expect to open 40 supercenters, including conversions and expansions. 
There are also strong results in our other markets. We have a good track record of leveraging our processes and resources to add value for a new markets, customers and associates. Our January 2009 acquisition of D&S in Chile is a recent example. Wal-Mart Chile grew constant currency sales, 11.5% in the first quarter, and retail square footage increased by 6.5% or 31 stores. 
Our focus on growing sales continues long after the acquisition. Constant currency sales grew 10.9% in the first quarter of this year at our Central American operations. We acquired Central America in 2005, and first quarter sales are now just under $1 billion at $950 million. 
In closing, Wal-Mart International is well positioned to continue delivering on growth opportunities and comp stores sales, e-commerce and acquisitions. We will also continue to deliver on new store growth. 
Now I'll turn it over to Bill for the update on Wal-Mart U.S."
313055,129808219,131103,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 17, 2011",2011-05-17,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Doug. Earlier in the call, Mike mentioned that we're gaining traction in our Wal-Mart U.S. business as we implement the 4-point plan that I laid out in the fourth quarter. Recall that this plan focuses on driving Every Day Low Price, delivering",2080,"Thank you, Doug. Earlier in the call, Mike mentioned that we're gaining traction in our Wal-Mart U.S. business as we implement the 4-point plan that I laid out in the fourth quarter. Recall that this plan focuses on driving Every Day Low Price, delivering the broadest assortment possible, improving our remodeling efforts and integrating a multichannel experience for our customers. 
Now our best comp performance remains in the Grocery and Health and Wellness business, both of which had positive comps in the first quarter. As I mentioned in February, these businesses delivered positive comps in the fourth quarter as well. Our negative 1.1 comp sales were the midpoint of our guidance of negative 2% to flat for the quarter. Comp sales declined for the 13-week period was driven by lower traffic, which was partially offset by an increase in ticket. Inflation provided the small tailwind. The importance of delivering Every Day Low Price has never been greater, as our customers are consolidating trips due to higher gas prices. Our greatest priority remains to grow comp sales. We're focused on our EDLP strategy and moving away from the deep discounts that were in the headlines this time last year. 
We've launched our new ad match marketing campaign in early April, and the customer response has been terrific. Net sales rose 0.6% to $62.7 billion for the first quarter. Grocery, again, delivered low single-digit positive comps for the quarter. Our Food business is delivering positive sales growth that's on par with the top competitors, and we're seeing a recovery in our Consumables business. Customers are responding positively as we expand our merchandise assortment, adding back items across all categories. We began our SKU add back program in the third quarter with dry grocery. We're pleased with the comp sales improvement to date in this area, which is up 150 basis points from the fourth quarter. I believe that sales improvement supports our belief that we're on the right track. As we add more SKUs throughout all categories, we expect to gain further traction, improving both traffic and ticket. 
In Consumables, we executed modular changes, the ones I mentioned last quarter, and saw positive sales momentum from categories like hair care and fragrance. These modular changes focused on bringing back assortment, ensuring opening price points were available in all categories and increased the holding power on the shelf. As an example, our air care modular was updated in February, and we've experienced an 880-basis-point comp improvement from the fourth quarter through the first quarter. 
The paycheck cycle remains pronounced. During the quarter, we saw a continued pressure from ongoing macroeconomic conditions as customers continued to trade down to opening price points in some private label products. Our grocery inflation was approximately 1% during the quarter with the greatest impact on perishables. We continue to act as the agent for our customers by building trust through EDLP. 
Our Health and Wellness business had a low single-digit positive comp, driven by our Prescription business. 5 years ago, Wal-Mart launched the $4 prescription drug program, a move that changed the industry and shifted more customers from branded to generic products. While this change helped drive traffic and unit sales, the increase in generic utilization does pressure the top line. However, the new Humana program, which is generating incremental pharmacy sales and other industry dynamics, more than offset this pressure. We expect this program to drive positive results in the coming months. 
Entertainment had mid- single-digit negative comps. That area is still being impacted by price deflation in key electronics items. We did have strong TV unit sales as customers used tax refund loans during the quarter. We continue to see strong prepaid wireless sales, especially in services, though these services are not fully reflected in our top line sales. Hardlines comps were low single-digit negative. Easter crafts performed well, offset by a weakness in stationary and hardware. Automotive generated positive comp sales. Temperatures have begun to rebound this month, and we expect improved results across the Hardline business. Apparel had mid- single-digit negative comp, with the greatest weakness in kids, ladies and shoes. Where we've brought back assortment, like ladies plus, sales and trends are improving. In fact, we posted positive comp for the quarter in ladies plus. We simply are not converting enough of our grocery customers to shop apparel, and we've been working hard on strategies to improve this important area of the store. We're very focused on driving improvement in basics, including socks, underwear and T-shirts. We're adding back deleted items and even more categories, though this will continue to take time. 
And we're investing in prices we recognize that customers have seen higher prices across the industry for cotton-related apparel. Apparel is a work in progress, but one that has a tremendous amount of an attention throughout the organization. 
Home posted a mid- single-digit negative comp as well, impacted by delays in the start of the spring selling season. Outdoor Living, in particular, a large part of our sales plan for the quarter, had double-digit negative comps because of weather impacts. We're seeing that turn around now with more favorable weather across most of the country, and I'm pleased with how our customers are responding to our Outdoor Living assortment this month. 
During the first quarter, most of our indoor home categories, including home decor, cooking, dining and bath, had improving sales trends, the result of offering broader assortment. We expect to see momentum pick up in indoor categories during the second quarter. Our Walmart.com Online business remained strong with an increase in traffic and order size. Electronics remained a strong category, including televisions, wireless and home office. 
In Hardlines, tires and automotive categories are strong. And in home, we're seeing ongoing strength of sales and furniture. We're also pleased with the ongoing momentum of our Site to Store business. 
And now I'll cover the remaining financial results. Gross profit dollars were up 0.6% over last year, in line with the first quarter sales growth, causing the gross margin rate as a percentage of sales to remain flat as expected. Our logistics team continues to implement multiple efficiency initiatives that have minimized the impact of diesel price increases on the cost of sales. 
We were able to leverage expenses again this quarter with total SG&A up only approximately 40 basis points compared to last year. Sales per labor hour improved again for the first quarter, building on last year's progress and productivity. Marketing expenses were at more normalized levels compared to the same quarter last year. Additionally, we delivered reductions in our accident costs due to significant attention from store operations. 
Operating income grew faster than sales at 0.8% for the quarter over last year. As expected, inventory was up 6.3% compared to this time last year. However, the year-over-year growth rate of inventory has slowed 190 basis points compared to the fourth quarter. The increase is due in part to our continued focus on bringing back assortment in grocery. 100 basis points was due to inflation, primarily in grocery categories. Approximately, 100 basis points of the increase were also due to higher in-transit inventory as we expand our global sourcing initiatives. 
We also recognized increases in inventory for home, toys and seasonal, where weather slowed seasonal sales. Overall, the quality of our inventory remains in good shape. We can assure that Wal-mart stores are always in stock, especially for high turn items in grocery. We must make sure that all stores are customer-ready everyday. 
Our displays must come to life in terms of delivering value and excitement for our customers. We remain optimistic about our growth opportunities in the U.S. and plan to open between 140 and 160 new and converted units this year. Back in October, we shared with you that we plan to open between 185 and 205 units. Consistent with the $1 billion reduction in capital expenditures that we disclosed last quarter, we are delaying the delivery of additional in-box conversions of discount stores to supercenters as we take the time to review and adjust this initiative. Most of our capital commitment goes to supercenters. However, we're also committing to small formats, including those between 30,000 and 60,000 square feet as well as stores that will range from 15,000 to 30,000 square feet. 
The strength of our Food business is reflected in the continued performance of our Neighborhood Market grocery stores, which average about 40,000 square feet today. We're pleased with both the comp and the returns of these grocery stores. In fact, this quarter, our Neighborhood Market comp increase was approximately 4%, driven by traffic increase of almost 2%. 
Because of this momentum, we're starting to accelerate the opening of even more Neighborhood Markets. We're on schedule this year to open between 15 and 20 Neighborhood Market stores to capture growth in untapped markets. 
We will also open several of the Wal-Mart Express stores as a pilot in both rural and urban areas with the goal of having 15 to 20 stores by year end. This is our new format, averaging 15,000 square feet and offering customers fresh food along with key general merchandise categories. 
Wal-Mart Express will also include our Site to Store programs, so that customers can take advantage of Wal-Mart's broad online merchandise assortment. The Express pilots will be different, so we can determine which merchandise assortment is right for the community. Some will have pharmacy, some won't. The goal is to get the model right, so that when we have the format, we'll roll it out and it will be successful. 
I've already talked about the first 2 points of the 4-point plan: price leadership and the broadest assortment. Our third point: We're driving efficiencies in our remodel program. Our remodels are underway this quarter and will be completed in less time than in the past 2 years. They will be less disruptive to our customers and associates. Through reengineering efforts, we're able to increase the efficiency of our remodeling plan by reducing, on average, 15% in the cost for each supercenter. 
And finally, our multichannel integration is an important focus for our long-term growth strategy. We're testing several programs to help us better integrate the stores with our website. Our expanded Pick Up Today program is currently rolled out to 2,800 stores and doing well. While it's early for data, we're pleased with the customer response. The program will be in 3,000 stores by the end of the second quarter. We expect to see continued growth in this service as we make more items available on Walmart.com for immediate pick up. 
Rising gas prices, high unemployment and increasing inflation continue to be the most important issues facing our customers today. One in 5 Wal-Mart moms list gasoline as a top expense behind housing and car payments. We continue to be prepared to help her with low prices and broad assortment during this time of uncertainty. 
Last year, during the second quarter, Wal-Mart had the deep rollbacks that drove our unit sales of some items but did not deliver the intended traffic and basket lift we were looking for. We will not repeat these programs this year. 
We're monitoring the economic environment carefully, as significant changes in gas prices and inflation during the quarter will influence our actual performance. We expect Wal-Mart U.S. comp sales for the second quarter period, running from April 30 through July 29, to range from negative 1% to positive 1%, and our 13-week comp for last year in the second quarter declined 1.8%. 
Our continued focus on productivity initiatives will enable us to leverage expenses through the second quarter. Inventory will return to normal Wal-Mart levels, meaning half the rate of sales growth by the end of the third quarter after we anniversary our efforts to bring back assortment. 
Before I close, I'd like to recognize the hard work of our associates who've been impacted by the flooding across the central plains in the South. Countless associates and customers are dealing with the effects of the rising Mississippi River. When our stores are also affected, our priorities are to get them open and operating. They're often the first place that people in the community turn to for basics and clean-up products, and Wal-Mart will be there to help our customers get back on their feet no matter what the disaster. It's part of our mission and it's part who we are. 
Now I'll turn it over to Charles."
313055,129808219,131103,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 17, 2011",2011-05-17,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Let's get right to our financial scorecard. First, growth. Jeff pointed out earlier that sales increased 4.4% in the first quarter with solid sales results from Wal-Mart International and Sam's Club. We continue to remain focused on growing",617,"Thanks, Bill. Let's get right to our financial scorecard. First, growth. Jeff pointed out earlier that sales increased 4.4% in the first quarter with solid sales results from Wal-Mart International and Sam's Club. We continue to remain focused on growing comp sales and new stores throughout our markets. And let me add, comp sales improvement is our clear priority for Wal-Mart U.S. We will continue to invest in growth, and our capital plan of $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion remains in place for this year. 
We're still on track for sales growth of 4% to 6% and square footage growth of 3% to 4%. I remind you that these goals exclude acquisitions, such as Netto. We added 59 net units and approximately 3.7 million square feet of retail space since the end of fiscal 2011. International contributed almost 2.6 million square feet in the first quarter. Worldwide, we now have 9,029 units and approximately 989 million square feet of retail space. 
We have great opportunities for long-term growth in emerging markets, such as Brazil and China. Wal-Mart U.S. will continue to open supercenters in smaller formats. In addition, Sam's Club will open between 7 and 10 clubs this year. 
Turning to leverage. As Mike said earlier, the productivity loop remains a crucial priority for us. We continue to drive efficiencies throughout our business, which helps sustain our commitment to Every Day Low Price. For 6 consecutive quarters now, our company has leveraged operating expenses.  
And our third priority, returns. On a rolling 12-month basis ending April 30, 2011, return on investment ended at 18.5%. It is important to know that our underlying operations continue to maintain stable returns. 
In March, we were pleased to report that our Board declared an annual dividend of $1.46 per share for the fiscal year, a 21% increase over the previous year's dividend. We returned $3.4 billion to our shareholders during the first quarter through dividends and share repurchase. We remain committed to returning value to shareholders. 
Last quarter, I mentioned that the majority of our business now operates on our new SAP financial system, including the U.S., U.K. and Canada. We have completed our conversions in Mexico, and we have just recently started in Central America and Argentina. These improved systems provide more efficient financial processes around the world, allowing Wal-Mart to leverage knowledge and resources and increase consistency throughout our organization. 
Next let's move on to guidance. Based on our views of the macroeconomic and sales environment in the U.S. and around the world, we expect second quarter fiscal 2012 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.05 and $1.10, which compares to last year's earnings per share of $0.97. These estimates assume the currency exchange rates remain at current levels. 
In closing, I'd like to summarize a few points from our call today. We delivered strong earnings per share above our guidance for the first quarter of the fiscal year despite continued economic headwinds affecting our customers. We increased net sales by 4.4% and added approximately 3.7 million square feet of retail selling space around the world. 
Leveraging expenses remains a priority as it serves as a pre-cursor to EDLP. Since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we have leveraged operating expenses. Our business model, Every Day Low Costs driving Every Day Low Prices, is central to how we operate. We are on track for company sales growth of 4% to 6% this year. We intend to grow through comp sales and new stores as well as through multichannel initiatives, including e-commerce. And finally, we remain committed to shareholder returns through share repurchase and dividends. 
Thank you for listening today. We appreciate your interest in Wal-Mart."

Thanks for joining us today for our earnings call to review the first quarter of fiscal year 2012. Key information for this quarter, including updated unit counts, square footage and financial metrics, is available on our website at walmartstores.com/investors. A full transcript of the call will be available on the website after 7 a.m. Central Time today on May 17, 2011. Historical data can also be found on the site as well. 
We have a full agenda for today's first quarter recap. Mike Duke, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., will start off with the key results and commentary on our business strategies. As you can see from our press release this morning, we do have some discrete items that are accounted for in our results. So Jeff Davis, SVP of Finance and Treasurer, will cover the consolidated financial results, including more analysis on the noise. Then we'll go to the operating segments. First up will be Brian Cornell, President and CEO of Sam's Club. Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart International, will cover the overall results for International as well as our 6 largest countries. We will close the segment discussion with Bill Simon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart U.S. Finally, our CFO, Charles Holley, will present our financial report card and our guidance for the second quarter. 
Recall that we do not provide a full year guidance update this quarter. In our fourth quarter call from February, we said that we would no longer provide details on the membership and other income line except for Sam's Club because it's only relevant and material for Sam's. In this quarter, we include a discussion of a gain from the sale of an investment in Chile that is included in other income. Also, as we do from time to time, we will make reclassifications for consistency. 
Let me remind you as you listen today that our fiscal calendar for Wal-Mart International is different from the corporate fiscal calendar. All of our International countries, with the exception of Canada, end their fiscal quarter on March 31, while our consolidated financials end on April 30. This is particularly important given the shift in the Easter timing this year. International sales from Easter in all but Canada will be included in the second quarter results. 
And finally, our Annual Meeting of Shareholders is Friday, June 3, at the Bud Walton Arena in Fayetteville, Arkansas. We'll start promptly at 7 a.m. Central Time. If you can't join us in person, the meeting will be available via webcast on the corporate website. That's walmartstores.com. 
Now Mike, let's get started with our first quarter results. Mike?"
313055,129808219,131157,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 17, 2011",2011-05-17,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Carol. Good morning, everyone. Wal-Mart is reporting EPS of $0.98 from continuing operations, exceeding our guidance range for the first quarter. This reflects the stability and strength of our global operations. Let me dive into some of the",1136,"Thank you, Carol. Good morning, everyone. Wal-Mart is reporting EPS of $0.98 from continuing operations, exceeding our guidance range for the first quarter. This reflects the stability and strength of our global operations. 
Let me dive into some of the key numbers for the quarter. Net sales were up 4.4% to $103.4 billion with strong contributions from Wal-Mart International and Sam's Club. Wal-Mart U.S. comps were negative 1.1%, which was roughly the mid-point of our guidance. Sam's Club comp of 4.2% was 120 basis points above guidance. Consolidated operating income was up 2.8% to $5.9 billion. 
The company leveraged operating expenses. The really great thing is that we have many more opportunities to leverage our scale, technology and innovative processes across the entire business. Return on investment was down due primarily to currency translation and cash accumulations. Jeff will provide additional details. For the quarter, the company returned $3.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Now let me move on to the highlights of the individual operating segments. The Wal-Mart U.S. comp sales decline of 1.1% was within our guidance range. We recognize we still have work to do, and comp sales growth remains the greatest priority for me and the entire Wal-Mart U.S. team. The good news is that the plan Bill Simon and his team are executing is gaining traction. Bill will elaborate more on our progress. We're focused on delivering EDLP in a wide assortment, and customers are responding favorably where we've made the most progress on executing the plan. I'm encouraged with what I hear from customers when I visit our U.S. stores. In grocery, we are further along with the transition, but the work on general merchandise will not be completed until the second half of the year. 
Our business model positions us well for customers who appreciate the one-stop shopping that our U.S. supercenters offer. Despite improvements in some areas of the economy, core Wal-Mart U.S. customers are still stretched. They remain concerned about rising prices for gas, energy and food as well as employment issues. Customers trust us to be their ally in fighting rising gas prices and inflation. We continue to earn that trust when we deliver on our commitment to EDLP. 
International remains the key growth driver for our company, and the segment has seen continued growth through a combination of comps and new stores. We will see the results of the Easter sales in the second quarter in our International markets, so I'm pleased to report that almost every market had strong sales growth this quarter. Mexico, China and Chile, not only had the best comp growth, but also the highest percentage sales increase for the quarter compared to last year. It's not a surprise that Japan's March sales were soft as the country continues to recover from the devastation of the earthquake and tsunami. We're pleased that we're beginning to see Japan stabilize. 
Our overall growth comes from comp sales and new stores, but we also grow through acquisitions. In April, we completed the acquisition of the Netto stores in the U.K., and the transition is underway to convert these stores to the ASDA brand. The Netto transaction and its results will show up in our second quarter. We're waiting for the outcome of the competition tribunal hearings in South Africa on our proposed investment in Massmart. 
I continue to see tremendous opportunity in the emerging markets like Brazil. Last month, I spent a week traveling to 3 cities in Brazil where I visited 25 stores. I believe that the transition underway to EDLP is right for our customers, though it will take time to shift the culture and improve the profitability. 
Operating income for Wal-Mart International was up 1.2% on a reported basis. International did not leverage expenses, so there is further opportunity on SG&A. 
Sam's Club delivered really good results this quarter with a 4.2% comp that was well above our guidance. I really like the positive momentum at Sam's Club, which is reflected, not only in comp sales, but also in increases in new members. We've been upgrading the quality and the value of our offering at Sam's, and the results are strong across-the-board. This quarter delivered the highest member experience scores that Sam's has ever had. 
I'm proud of the work of the Sam's Club team. They also delivered strong operating income and leveraged expenses. The warehouse club channel is increasing in importance in the retail landscape, and Sam's is gaining further momentum. We expect Sam's to add even more value to the company's overall portfolio. 
Wal-Mart has a tremendous growth opportunity in e-commerce. Customers today want continuous shopping channels, and they want price transparency. We're bringing together our stores, logistics expertise and systems to create an integrated shopping experience that moves seamlessly with the customer from the store to web-enabled devices. 
Over the last few weeks, you've also seen us ramp up investments in new talent and technology. We closed on the acquisition of Kosmix, and our teams are integrated into @WalmartLabs in Silicon Valley. This acquisition allows us to expand our capabilities in the online social commerce environment. 
The growth potential of e-commerce is especially significant in markets like China. We are committed to being at the forefront of this growth. On Friday, we announced that we are acquiring a minority stake in Yihaodian, one of China's leading online retailers. Yihaodian has achieved a significant position in online grocery sales as well as general merchandise, including electronics and apparel. We expect ongoing activity in the e-commerce area around the world. 
We know our customers also expect us to be a leader on the issues that matter to them. In April, we issued an expanded Global Responsibility Report in which we provided greater transparency and accountability on our efforts to be a responsible company around the world. We're pleased with the response to this report. 
As we build the next-generation Wal-Mart, staying close to the front lines of the business is at the top of my agenda, and I expect the same of every member of our leadership team. From Brazil to Silicon Valley, I visited more than 75 stores in this quarter alone. Everywhere I go I see customers working hard to make ends meet. Inflation and gas prices are adding to the pressures. They look to us to help them save money and live better. 
I've never been more confident in the relevance of our EDLP promise and our talented teams delivering on that promise. Wal-Mart will continue to manage the business for the short term and the long term. We will grow comps and open new stores, and we remain committed to leveraging expenses and improving returns for our shareholders. 
Now I'll turn it over to Jeff for more details on our financial results. Jeff?"
313055,129808219,131157,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 17, 2011",2011-05-17,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. For the first quarter of fiscal 2012, Wal-Mart's income from continuing operations was $3.4 billion, an increase of 3.8% over last year. Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart were $0.98, an increase of 12.",948,"Thank you, Mike. For the first quarter of fiscal 2012, Wal-Mart's income from continuing operations was $3.4 billion, an increase of 3.8% over last year. Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart were $0.98, an increase of 12.6% compared to $0.87 for the first quarter last year. First quarter EPS from continuing operations included the benefit of approximately $0.01 per share related to currency translation. In the first quarter last year, earnings per share benefited from currency translation by $0.02. 
In addition to the impact of currency translation, we have several other discrete items that impacted the first quarter. All the following numbers are pretax. We realized approximately $117 million from the mark-to-market gains on foreign currency derivative positions. ASDA recorded an approximate $67 million charge related to the removal of future benefit accruals and the effect of future pay increases from its defined benefit plan. Wal-Mart Japan incurred approximately $51 million casualty loss related to the March earthquake and tsunami. And finally, Wal-Mart Chile recorded approximately $51 million gain from the sale of an investment. 
All of these items are included in operating expenses with the exception of the gain from the sale in Chile, which is recorded in membership and other income. The net summary of these items accounted for approximately $0.01 of our EPS for the first quarter. 
As Mike mentioned, consolidated net sales increased by 4.4% or $4.3 billion to $103.4 billion for the quarter. The increase in sales was driven by Wal-Mart International and Sam's Club and included a currency exchange rate benefit of $1.3 billion. On a constant currency basis, sales grew 3% to $102.1 billion. 
The 13-week U.S. comp sales, without fuel, decreased 0.3%. You will hear more details on the Wal-Mart U.S. and Sam's comp sales from Bill and Brian. 
For the quarter, gross margin on sales was 24.4%, down 30 basis points compared to last year, driven by Wal-Mart International and Sam's Club. Unallocated corporate overhead and other, which includes other investment in global e-commerce, decreased by 20.8% to $309 million for the quarter. The $117 million mark-to-market gains on foreign currency derivative positions were the primary drivers of the decrease. Excluding these gains and global e-commerce initiatives, our core corporate overhead expense increased approximately $15 million or 3.9% compared to last year. I'm happy to say we have EDLC focused in our corporate areas. 
Consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 18 basis points on sales growth of 4.4%. On a constant currency basis, consolidated operating expenses increased 1.9%. Our focus on ensuring Every Day Low Costs remains a priority throughout the company. 
First quarter consolidated operating income was $5.9 billion, a 2.8% increase versus last year, which included a $49 million currency benefit. On a constant currency basis, consolidated operating income increased 1.9% for the first quarter versus last year. 
Net interest expense for the quarter increased 10% to $518 million. This was driven by higher debt levels compared to last year as we opportunistically issued new debt at historically low rates, offset partially by lower average interest rates on our outstanding debt. 
The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 33.5%. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 to be between 33.5% and 34.5%, although we will see some quarterly fluctuations. Changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and International operations may impact our effective tax rate. 
First quarter consolidated inventory grew 9.5% compared to last year. The inventory growth was primarily covered by a comparable increase in payables. Payables as a percentage of inventories remained stable at approximately 90%. In addition, consolidated inventory turns remained stable. 
In the first quarter, we issued $5 billion of long-term bonds for general corporate purposes at tighter levels than preliminary pricing guidance suggested, indicating strong investor demand. Our AA credit rating provides continued access to low-cost debt. 
The debt-to-total-capitalization ratio was 46.1% in the first quarter compared to 41.6% at the end of the first quarter last year. Since last year, we issued more than $10 billion in debt at historically low interest rates. We ended the first quarter with negative free cash flow of approximately $400 million due to our increased investment in inventory and timing of payments for our accrued liabilities. Free cash flow was in line with expectations. The company ended last year's first quarter with negative free cash flow of $1.6 billion due to lower-than-normal inventory levels at the end of fiscal 2010.
Capital expenditures were approximately $2.4 billion for the first quarter compared with $2.6 billion in the first quarter last year. We added approximately 3.7 million of new retail square footage and 59 new operating units during the quarter. In the first quarter, we distributed $1.3 billion in dividends. As a reminder, we increased our fiscal 2012 annual dividend per share by approximately 21% to $1.46 from $1.21 in fiscal 2011. 
In addition, we repurchased approximately $2.1 billion of shares during the first quarter, representing approximately 39.3 million shares. This leaves us with approximately $2.7 billion remaining on our $15 billion share repurchase authorization announced last June. 
Clearly, one of our priorities is returning value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During the first quarter, Wal-Mart returned $3.4 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Return on investment or ROI for the trailing 12 months ended April 3, 2011, was 18.5% compared to 19.2% for the prior year. The primary drivers of change in ROI were the impact from currency exchange and cash held for pending acquisitions. 
Now let's move to the discussion of our operating segments. We'll start with Sam's Club. Brian?"
313055,129808219,131157,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 17, 2011",2011-05-17,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jeff. I am very excited to share that Sam's Club momentum has continued into the new fiscal year. We sequentially increased our comp sales in each quarter of last year, and that momentum continued into the first quarter. Comp club sales, excl",1174,"Thank you, Jeff. I am very excited to share that Sam's Club momentum has continued into the new fiscal year. We sequentially increased our comp sales in each quarter of last year, and that momentum continued into the first quarter. 
Comp club sales, excluding fuel, increased 4.2% for the 13-week period ending April 29, 2011, exceeding our guidance of 1% to 3%. This is our fifth quarter of sequential quarterly comp improvement. We combined solid unit sales growth and increased traffic with excellent margin management. We leveraged operating expenses this quarter. 
Our membership acquisition performance was wrong. In fact, it was our best quarterly performance since I joined Sam's Club in March of 2009. This strength was driven by key membership events and excellent execution in the clubs. These strong results across all key areas of our business flow through to operating income, which, excluding fuel, increase faster than the rate of sales. 
Before I get in the detailed financial results, let me address the current dynamic around fuel, an important part of our value proposition. Our fuel stations establish the initial price perception and drive traffic to the clubs. We also know that great prices on gasoline drive member loyalty in terms of renewal rates and ticket. We're pumping more gallons of fuel and generating more sales dollars per gallon this year versus last year. 
Fuel prices in the first quarter this year are approximately 35% higher than a year ago, and gallons sold are up 22%. Including fuel, first quarter sales were $12.8 billion, a 9.4% increase over last year, and operating income increased 7% to $459 million. While top line fuel sales have increased, fuel profit on a dollar basis was basically flat to last year for the quarter. 
We see a large impact on gross margin percentages. Volatility in fuel prices can have a notable impact on our financial results, both positive and negative. We will continue with our strategy around fuel to be the price leader in the market. Our discussion today therefore excludes fuel for comparative purposes unless otherwise noted. 
Now let's turn to the detailed financial results. For the first quarter, net sales for Sam's Club increased to $11.3 billion, a 4.9% increase over last year. Comp club sales for the 13-week period increased 4.2%. Despite the impact of heavy snow in February, and flooding and tornadoes in April, comp club sales increases were strong across all 3 geographic operating divisions, and we are particularly pleased with the combined sales strength of our South and West divisions. Comp performance was driven more by our item growth than inflation. 
Comp ticket and traffic increased for the 13-week period by 190 and 230 basis points, respectively. Comp ticket increased for both Business and Advantage members. Comp traffic increased for Advantage members and was relatively flat for our Business members. 
Our ticket and traffic performance was driven in part due to our strategy to be the price leader in key everyday needs categories, such as grocery, cleaning and laundry. We also hosted several events, such as our second eValues Savings Celebration, in which we offered eValues to all members and the Taste of Sam's event. 
The frequency of member visits improved for both Business and Advantage members, particularly during the weekends. We have taken an approach to the weekends in which our clubs are focused on executing specific plans to elevate the in-club experience and member service. The plans are focused on key areas that are high touch points like fresh food, grocery and the front end. These are paying off in sales and improved member experience scores. 
From a merchandise perspective, comp increases were strong across fresh foods, grocery, home and apparel categories. We continue to see inflation in key categories, such as produce, meat and dairy. However, we managed through inflation with little impact on our margin and have seen continued growth in units sold year-over-year. The quality of our sales in our core categories was very strong, and we grew comp sales despite tobacco being a headwind during the first quarter. The challenge in tobacco is driven by the cycling of last year's tobacco pre-buys in anticipation of significant price increases as well as a change in our credit card reward program that disproportionately impacts our members who shop this category heavily. We anticipate tobacco being a headwind for the rest of the year. Recall that the average income for a Sam's Club member is above $75,000 annually. Discretionary spend is increasing as seen in our improved sales performance in home, apparel and certain technology and entertainment categories, including consumer electronics. Our gross margin rate was flat as a percentage of sales for the first quarter. 
For the quarter, inventory, including fuel, was up 10.6%. As we have mentioned in previous calls, we anticipated higher inventory growth rates through the quarter. These increases were driven by larger seasonal buys, earlier transition in seasonal and electronics and inflation. Additionally, we were up against historically low inventory levels last year. We expect inventory growth rates to return to a single digit in the second quarter as we manage inventory flow and members' needs. 
As mentioned earlier, I am very pleased with our progress on expense leverage and club efficiency. We reduced expenses as a percentage of sales by 17 basis points, driven by controlling wage costs. For the quarter, sales per labor hour increased 3.1% and units per labor hour increased 2.5%. 
Membership and other income for the first quarter increased 40 basis points versus last year. As you know, membership income is recorded under the deferred revenue recognition basis, so it's important to understand what's going on with membership income on a cash basis. Growth in membership income on a cash basis was very strong with increases in the mid- single digits. This strength came across all membership segments, and we are very pleased with the overall membership results. Membership income in the first quarter increased 40 basis points versus last year. For the second quarter, we anticipate membership income to continue the positive momentum with key events planned to engage our members in the clubs. 
We have also placed an emphasis on in-club renewals and on our Plus membership offering. We saw broad-based strength in renewal rates across membership categories in the quarter. Business add-on membership trends had begun to stabilize and are showing positive momentum. However, our small business members remain concerned with the economy and reduced access to credit. Therefore, we anticipate continued headwinds for our Business memberships throughout the fiscal year. 
First quarter operating income increased to $457 million, a 6.3% increase. Our sales momentum remains strong as we enter the first weeks of the second quarter. We expect comp club sales, without fuel, for the current 13-week period from April 30 through July 29 to increase 3% to 5%. Last year, Sam's comp club sales, excluding fuel, increased 1% for the comparable 13-week period. 
Now I will turn the program over to Doug to share with you the results for Wal-Mart International. Doug?"

On March 30 and 31, we shared with you while we are so excited about the growth prospects for China and Asia at our Annual International Conference for the Investment Community in Shenzhen, China. We came with a full team, including Scott Price, Cathy Smith, Ed Chan, Ed Kolodzieski and others, and we provided additional insight into our business strategy, our Asian operations and answered many questions from the analyst community. 
One of the key takeaways from that meeting is that we have a strategic plan in place to move Wal-Mart International from a good business into a great business, and this will be underpinned by doing what we do best: providing our customers great value through Every Day Low Prices. Our management team is focused on delivering that plan through what I referred to as the 4 dimensions of growth: comp store sales; new stores; e-commerce and multichannel; and finally, acquisitions. 
Here is what our first fiscal quarter looked like in terms of these 4 dimensions. For the first quarter of fiscal 2012, all of our markets had encouraging comp store sales results with Mexico, China and Chile having the highest comps. By the way, as it relates to Chile, we've seen double-digit comp store sales for several quarters since we made this investment, and I'm really proud of the Wal-Mart Chile team and our integration team. They've done a great job. The Easter calendar change and Brazil's EDLP implementation negatively impacted our comp store sales, and I'll discuss the detail shortly. 
As it relates to new store growth, we increased our total store count 11.8% or 487 stores for the past 12 months. This translates into 7.9% more square feet than at the end of the first quarter of last year with most of the increase in Mexico and China. 
During the first quarter, Wal-Mart International added 2.6 million square feet of retail space through 54 units. We have had some good results internationally in the area of e-commerce and multichannel. During the first quarter of this year, ASDA's online grocery and general merchandise sales grew 20.8% from last year, and Brazil's online general merchandise sales grew 41.1%. We're learning more about the online business in China through the November 2010 launch of the Sam's Club e-commerce site. 
As it relates to acquisitions, our team in the U.K. completed its purchase of the 147 Netto stores from Dansk Supermarked in April 2011, which falls in our second fiscal quarter. We expect to complete the in-store conversions this year, investing more than GBP 100 million and creating more than 1,500 jobs. 
Two of our leaders in the U.K., Judith McKenna and Karen Hubbard, have done a great job getting us to this point, and we look forward to seeing the results of our conversions and integration. In fact, we have already opened our first 3 converted stores. We currently own a 35% equity interest in Trust-Mart stores and hold voting rights with respect to an additional 30% interest. We have agreed to acquire the remainder of Trust-Mart once regulatory approvals have been obtained. 
In April, we obtained antitrust clearance and now expect to finalize the other regulatory approvals and complete the transaction by the end of this fiscal year. 
And finally, in South Africa, competition tribunal hearings began on May 9. This is what we expect to be the final step in the approval process for our potential investment in Massmart and in sub-Saharan Africa. We remain excited about the opportunity to serve customers in this part of the world. 
Turning to other events happening with our business. We're very proud of the passion and speed with which our associates responded to the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Within the first 3 days following these events, Wal-Mart associates working across Japan quickly took action to help by setting up distribution points for relief items in our store parking lots when the stores themselves were too damaged to open. Associates brought in 95 tons of blankets, flashlights, batteries, water, emergency food and warm clothing. We will continue to actively provide assistance on the ground and monitor the situation to look for additional ways we can help. Our thoughts are with our associates, our customers and the communities we serve in the affected areas. 
From a global perspective, food inflation has made recent headlines. Families in many countries spend a significant amount of their income just on food, and some of these countries rely heavily on imported commodities as the primary source of food. So increases in food prices can have a fast and dramatic effect in some parts of the world. We're experiencing some inflation in our sales numbers in just about every market. Argentina, Brazil and Central America are currently experiencing inflation across our basket of goods. We're seeing our highest inflation levels in Argentina, and we're doing our best to keep prices down for our customers in each market. 
Now let's get to the numbers. Carol reminded you earlier about the one-month lag on the International calendar. Consequently, we will see the majority of this year's Easter sales in our second quarter results. Wal-Mart International's first quarter reported sales were $27.9 billion, a growth of 11.5% over the first quarter of last year. All of our markets had strong sales growth except in Japan as our sales results include the effects of the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Changes in currency rates increased our net sales by $1.3 billion. Our first quarter constant currency sales grew 6.2% over last year. This growth came despite the effects of the Japan disasters and the Easter flip. Mexico, China and Chile provided the strongest net sales growth in the first quarter. Jeff detailed the results of several discrete items that affected first quarter comparative results for Wal-Mart International. Please remember these as you review our segment details. 
Our first quarter operating income increased 1.2% over last year to $1.1 billion. However, on a constant currency basis, operating income was $1 billion, a decline of 3.3%. The decline in constant currency operating income resulted from a decline in our overall gross profit margins and the effect of the discrete items Jeff mentioned earlier. Without these discrete items, constant currency operating income increased over last year but did not grow faster than sales. Wal-Mart International's first quarter constant currency gross profit margin declined from last year due primarily to the change in sales mix associated with the Easter calendar shift and investments in price. 
First quarter membership and other income increased from last year to the $51 million gain on the sale of an investment in Chile. Without this gain, membership and other income would've increased $23 million. Constant currency operating expenses for Wal-Mart International grew faster than sales because of the pressure from the discrete items Jeff covered. Without these items, we leveraged constant currency expenses versus last year because of strong expense management in Chile, Canada and Japan. 
Our progress on inventory was disappointing for the first quarter of this year with days on hand increasing over last year in most of our markets. Much of the 11.4% increase in inventory has to do with new store growth, but clearly, our management teams across all countries, especially China and Brazil, have this as a priority. 
Now let's get into the results for several of our larger markets. Country management teams account for the results on a local currency basis. The following discussion of country results excludes the impact of currency, and unless otherwise stated, sales and comp sales are presented on a nominal basis. In Mexico, our sales continue to grow at a fast rate, and operating income grew faster than sales. This will be the last quarter we only discuss Walmex as results in Mexico. Our second fiscal quarter will be the first time we discuss consolidated results of Walmex and Central America. While the following results are on a U.S. GAAP basis, Walmex separately reports its earnings under Mexican GAAP, so some numbers are different from the Walmex reported results. 
Walmex's net sales for the first quarter were up 6.9% and comparable store sales were up 1.7%. Sales growth came from the strong new store growth program in Mexico where we have 288 more stores than at the end of the first quarter of last year. Customer traffic declined to 2.2% and average ticket increased 3.9% at comparable stores. 
For the first quarter, Walmex comp store sales for the self-service formats grew by 1.5%, while ANTAD's comp store sales report for the rest of the industry, excluding Walmex, showed only 0.9% growth. Walmex's first quarter operating income grew faster than sales at 9.2% due to higher gross profit margin. 
First quarter gross profit margin as a percentage of sales increased 54 basis points from last year. However, expenses grew 10.4%, primarily on costs of new stores and remodels. Moving on to Brazil. Net sales grew in the first quarter, and Brazil continues to implement EDLP and increase the number of items. However, operating income declined from last year. Prices on more than 10,000 items, primarily in food, have been reduced, and this number increases each month. As I've said before and as we saw in Japan, this is a long-term initiative, so we expect to experience some pain during the conversion period. We're very confident about our opportunities in Brazil and expect to invest approximately $775 million this year, upgrading logistics, and technology and opening 80 new stores. 
On another note, our wholesale operations, Sam's Club and Maxxi, have delivered on plan for the first quarter in Brazil. In real terms or removing the impact of inflation, Brazil's first quarter net sales and comparable sales both declined from last year. Customer traffic at comparable stores decreased 8% and average ticket increased 1.9% in real terms. As expected, first quarter gross profit margin as a percentage of sales declined 140 basis points from last year due to the migration toward a consistent EDLP offering. 
Expenses as a percentage of sales increased 92 basis points, primarily because of the lower sales growth and 42 new stores opened since the first quarter of last year. The gross margin pressure caused a significant decline in Brazil's operating results from last year.
Earlier, I mentioned the Online business in Brazil grew 41.1% this quarter. This was on top of last year's sales growth of 80%. We launched the e-commerce site at the end of 2008 with 10,000 products in 11 categories. Today, we offer than 70,000 products across 21 categories. 
In the past 12 months, we have opened 42 new stores in Brazil, bringing our total store count to 480. This includes one new store in the first quarter of this year. 
Moving to Asia, during our investor meeting in March, Scott Price provided insight into our execution path for Japan's EDLP and EDLC implementation, and importantly, the value of successfully communicating our EDLP approach to Japanese customers. As you know, the March 2011 earthquake affected Japan and began the start of a very challenging period. According to statistics released by the Japanese Ministry of the Economy, Trade and Industry or METI, overall supermarket comparable store sales declined by 3.3% in March of 2011. This is especially tough since this decline is on top of last year's 5.6% comp sales decline. According to METI, our performance continues to stay ahead of other large-scale retailers in Japan, and we've maintained our market share in what has been a deflationary environment. 
Wal-Mart Japan's first quarter sales were better than overall supermarket sales. However, the effects of the earthquake and tsunami resulted in an operating loss in the first quarter of this year. First quarter net sales and comparable store sales were flat to last year in real terms. Wal-Mart Japan's traffic declined 2.8% over last year, and the average ticket in real terms increased 2.2%. Our remodeled stores had increases in average ticket of 5.7%, and our other stores had ticket increases of 1.7% both in real terms. 
Sales in over-the-counter pharmacy, paper goods and baby had the strongest performance, while sales of electronics, apparel and cosmetics were down. Gross profit margin as a percentage of sales increased by 79 basis points from last year. Expenses as a percentage of sales increased 2% from last year or declined 67 basis points without the earthquake and tsunami charge. Wal-Mart China sales grew in the first quarter as well, but operating income declined slightly from last year. Net sales for the first quarter grew 12.4% over last year and comparable store growth was 4.5%. 
Average ticket grew 11% in China, but traffic declined 5.8%. The primary traffic decline was in Trust-Mart stores. First quarter gross margin increased 54 basis points over last year, primarily due to purchasing efficiencies. Expenses as a percentage of sales grew 102 basis points, primarily due to increases in associate compensation and tax costs. First quarter operating income declined 4.2%. In the past 12 months, we opened 49 new stores, including 45 supercenters, and that brings our China store count to 333 stores. 
Turning now to the United Kingdom. Andy Clarke and the ASDA team had a solid start to the year, growing sales in the first quarter of this year. However, operating income declined from last year, primarily as a result of the charge for the ASDA-defined benefit plan and, to a lesser extent, acquisition cost for Netto. 
In the first quarter of this year, comparable sales, excluding fuel, increased 10 basis points. We will see ASDA's strong sales from Easter and the royal wedding in our second quarter. Average ticket in the first quarter increased 30 basis points and traffic decreased by 20 basis points. Sales of chilled foods, children's wear and home were particularly strong in the first quarter. In support of ASDA's EDLP offering, ASDA increased its price guarantee to 10% at the start of the year, and almost 3 million customer baskets have been checked online. First quarter operating income declined from last year due to the discrete charge covered earlier as well as other acquisition costs associated with the Netto purchase. Excluding these charges, ASDA's expenses grew slower than sales under the We Operate for Less program. Operating income was essentially flat to last year. 
ASDA private brands continue to perform well with its premium brand, Extra Special, and the mid-tier brand, Chosen By You. Chosen by You has been ranked by Kantar Worldpanel as the fastest-growing private brand across the top 4 U.K. grocery retailers. In the last 12 months, ASDA has opened 12 new stores for a total store count of 386. ASDA's commitment to EDLP comes at an important time for its customers who are dealing with the burden of inflation, taxes and record petrol prices. 
And finally, Canada. Walmart Canada sales grew in the first quarter of this year, and operating income grew faster than sales. Net sales grew 4.4% in the first quarter compared to last year, primarily due to the supercenter expansion program and strong sales in most categories. However, first quarter comparables sales declined 60 basis points from last year. Average ticket increased 3.6% for the first quarter and traffic declined 4.2%. As a percentage of sales, gross margin declined to 38 basis points from last year and expenses also declined 42 basis points despite the increase in cost from the new Walmart Canada Bank. The 5.8% increase in operating income from last year was a result of operating expense savings. Walmart Canada recently announced its plans to enter the Quebec grocery market with the transformation of its existing stores into supercenters. The first phase of this conversion is scheduled to begin in the second quarter of this year, and these supercenters will carry a full range of fresh food as well as general merchandise.  
In addition, we will open our first 5 supercenters in the province of Manitoba in the second quarter. In the past 12 months, we opened 8 new stores in Canada, bringing our store count to 325 stores. This year, we expect to open 40 supercenters, including conversions and expansions. 
There are also strong results in our other markets. We have a good track record of leveraging our processes and resources to add value for a new markets, customers and associates. Our January 2009 acquisition of D&S in Chile is a recent example. Wal-Mart Chile grew constant currency sales, 11.5% in the first quarter, and retail square footage increased by 6.5% or 31 stores. 
Our focus on growing sales continues long after the acquisition. Constant currency sales grew 10.9% in the first quarter of this year at our Central American operations. We acquired Central America in 2005, and first quarter sales are now just under $1 billion at $950 million. 
In closing, Wal-Mart International is well positioned to continue delivering on growth opportunities and comp stores sales, e-commerce and acquisitions. We will also continue to deliver on new store growth. 
Now I'll turn it over to Bill for the update on Wal-Mart U.S."
313055,129808219,131157,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 17, 2011",2011-05-17,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Doug. Earlier in the call, Mike mentioned that we're gaining traction in our Wal-Mart U.S. business as we implement the 4-point plan that I laid out in the fourth quarter. Recall that this plan focuses on driving Every Day Low Price, delivering",2080,"Thank you, Doug. Earlier in the call, Mike mentioned that we're gaining traction in our Wal-Mart U.S. business as we implement the 4-point plan that I laid out in the fourth quarter. Recall that this plan focuses on driving Every Day Low Price, delivering the broadest assortment possible, improving our remodeling efforts and integrating a multichannel experience for our customers. 
Now our best comp performance remains in the Grocery and Health and Wellness business, both of which had positive comps in the first quarter. As I mentioned in February, these businesses delivered positive comps in the fourth quarter as well. Our negative 1.1 comp sales were the midpoint of our guidance of negative 2% to flat for the quarter. Comp sales declined for the 13-week period was driven by lower traffic, which was partially offset by an increase in ticket. Inflation provided the small tailwind. The importance of delivering Every Day Low Price has never been greater, as our customers are consolidating trips due to higher gas prices. Our greatest priority remains to grow comp sales. We're focused on our EDLP strategy and moving away from the deep discounts that were in the headlines this time last year. 
We've launched our new ad match marketing campaign in early April, and the customer response has been terrific. Net sales rose 0.6% to $62.7 billion for the first quarter. Grocery, again, delivered low single-digit positive comps for the quarter. Our Food business is delivering positive sales growth that's on par with the top competitors, and we're seeing a recovery in our Consumables business. Customers are responding positively as we expand our merchandise assortment, adding back items across all categories. We began our SKU add back program in the third quarter with dry grocery. We're pleased with the comp sales improvement to date in this area, which is up 150 basis points from the fourth quarter. I believe that sales improvement supports our belief that we're on the right track. As we add more SKUs throughout all categories, we expect to gain further traction, improving both traffic and ticket. 
In Consumables, we executed modular changes, the ones I mentioned last quarter, and saw positive sales momentum from categories like hair care and fragrance. These modular changes focused on bringing back assortment, ensuring opening price points were available in all categories and increased the holding power on the shelf. As an example, our air care modular was updated in February, and we've experienced an 880-basis-point comp improvement from the fourth quarter through the first quarter. 
The paycheck cycle remains pronounced. During the quarter, we saw a continued pressure from ongoing macroeconomic conditions as customers continued to trade down to opening price points in some private label products. Our grocery inflation was approximately 1% during the quarter with the greatest impact on perishables. We continue to act as the agent for our customers by building trust through EDLP. 
Our Health and Wellness business had a low single-digit positive comp, driven by our Prescription business. 5 years ago, Wal-Mart launched the $4 prescription drug program, a move that changed the industry and shifted more customers from branded to generic products. While this change helped drive traffic and unit sales, the increase in generic utilization does pressure the top line. However, the new Humana program, which is generating incremental pharmacy sales and other industry dynamics, more than offset this pressure. We expect this program to drive positive results in the coming months. 
Entertainment had mid- single-digit negative comps. That area is still being impacted by price deflation in key electronics items. We did have strong TV unit sales as customers used tax refund loans during the quarter. We continue to see strong prepaid wireless sales, especially in services, though these services are not fully reflected in our top line sales. Hardlines comps were low single-digit negative. Easter crafts performed well, offset by a weakness in stationary and hardware. Automotive generated positive comp sales. Temperatures have begun to rebound this month, and we expect improved results across the Hardline business. Apparel had mid- single-digit negative comp, with the greatest weakness in kids, ladies and shoes. Where we've brought back assortment, like ladies plus, sales and trends are improving. In fact, we posted positive comp for the quarter in ladies plus. We simply are not converting enough of our grocery customers to shop apparel, and we've been working hard on strategies to improve this important area of the store. We're very focused on driving improvement in basics, including socks, underwear and T-shirts. We're adding back deleted items and even more categories, though this will continue to take time. 
And we're investing in prices we recognize that customers have seen higher prices across the industry for cotton-related apparel. Apparel is a work in progress, but one that has a tremendous amount of an attention throughout the organization. 
Home posted a mid- single-digit negative comp as well, impacted by delays in the start of the spring selling season. Outdoor Living, in particular, a large part of our sales plan for the quarter, had double-digit negative comps because of weather impacts. We're seeing that turn around now with more favorable weather across most of the country, and I'm pleased with how our customers are responding to our Outdoor Living assortment this month. 
During the first quarter, most of our indoor home categories, including home decor, cooking, dining and bath, had improving sales trends, the result of offering broader assortment. We expect to see momentum pick up in indoor categories during the second quarter. Our Walmart.com Online business remained strong with an increase in traffic and order size. Electronics remained a strong category, including televisions, wireless and home office. 
In Hardlines, tires and automotive categories are strong. And in home, we're seeing ongoing strength of sales and furniture. We're also pleased with the ongoing momentum of our Site to Store business. 
And now I'll cover the remaining financial results. Gross profit dollars were up 0.6% over last year, in line with the first quarter sales growth, causing the gross margin rate as a percentage of sales to remain flat as expected. Our logistics team continues to implement multiple efficiency initiatives that have minimized the impact of diesel price increases on the cost of sales. 
We were able to leverage expenses again this quarter with total SG&A up only approximately 40 basis points compared to last year. Sales per labor hour improved again for the first quarter, building on last year's progress and productivity. Marketing expenses were at more normalized levels compared to the same quarter last year. Additionally, we delivered reductions in our accident costs due to significant attention from store operations. 
Operating income grew faster than sales at 0.8% for the quarter over last year. As expected, inventory was up 6.3% compared to this time last year. However, the year-over-year growth rate of inventory has slowed 190 basis points compared to the fourth quarter. The increase is due in part to our continued focus on bringing back assortment in grocery. 100 basis points was due to inflation, primarily in grocery categories. Approximately, 100 basis points of the increase were also due to higher in-transit inventory as we expand our global sourcing initiatives. 
We also recognized increases in inventory for home, toys and seasonal, where weather slowed seasonal sales. Overall, the quality of our inventory remains in good shape. We can assure that Wal-mart stores are always in stock, especially for high turn items in grocery. We must make sure that all stores are customer-ready everyday. 
Our displays must come to life in terms of delivering value and excitement for our customers. We remain optimistic about our growth opportunities in the U.S. and plan to open between 140 and 160 new and converted units this year. Back in October, we shared with you that we plan to open between 185 and 205 units. Consistent with the $1 billion reduction in capital expenditures that we disclosed last quarter, we are delaying the delivery of additional in-box conversions of discount stores to supercenters as we take the time to review and adjust this initiative. Most of our capital commitment goes to supercenters. However, we're also committing to small formats, including those between 30,000 and 60,000 square feet as well as stores that will range from 15,000 to 30,000 square feet. 
The strength of our Food business is reflected in the continued performance of our Neighborhood Market grocery stores, which average about 40,000 square feet today. We're pleased with both the comp and the returns of these grocery stores. In fact, this quarter, our Neighborhood Market comp increase was approximately 4%, driven by traffic increase of almost 2%. 
Because of this momentum, we're starting to accelerate the opening of even more Neighborhood Markets. We're on schedule this year to open between 15 and 20 Neighborhood Market stores to capture growth in untapped markets. 
We will also open several of the Wal-Mart Express stores as a pilot in both rural and urban areas with the goal of having 15 to 20 stores by year end. This is our new format, averaging 15,000 square feet and offering customers fresh food along with key general merchandise categories. 
Wal-Mart Express will also include our Site to Store programs, so that customers can take advantage of Wal-Mart's broad online merchandise assortment. The Express pilots will be different, so we can determine which merchandise assortment is right for the community. Some will have pharmacy, some won't. The goal is to get the model right, so that when we have the format, we'll roll it out and it will be successful. 
I've already talked about the first 2 points of the 4-point plan: price leadership and the broadest assortment. Our third point: We're driving efficiencies in our remodel program. Our remodels are underway this quarter and will be completed in less time than in the past 2 years. They will be less disruptive to our customers and associates. Through reengineering efforts, we're able to increase the efficiency of our remodeling plan by reducing, on average, 15% in the cost for each supercenter. 
And finally, our multichannel integration is an important focus for our long-term growth strategy. We're testing several programs to help us better integrate the stores with our website. Our expanded Pick Up Today program is currently rolled out to 2,800 stores and doing well. While it's early for data, we're pleased with the customer response. The program will be in 3,000 stores by the end of the second quarter. We expect to see continued growth in this service as we make more items available on Walmart.com for immediate pick up. 
Rising gas prices, high unemployment and increasing inflation continue to be the most important issues facing our customers today. One in 5 Wal-Mart moms list gasoline as a top expense behind housing and car payments. We continue to be prepared to help her with low prices and broad assortment during this time of uncertainty. 
Last year, during the second quarter, Wal-Mart had the deep rollbacks that drove our unit sales of some items but did not deliver the intended traffic and basket lift we were looking for. We will not repeat these programs this year. 
We're monitoring the economic environment carefully, as significant changes in gas prices and inflation during the quarter will influence our actual performance. We expect Wal-Mart U.S. comp sales for the second quarter period, running from April 30 through July 29, to range from negative 1% to positive 1%, and our 13-week comp for last year in the second quarter declined 1.8%. 
Our continued focus on productivity initiatives will enable us to leverage expenses through the second quarter. Inventory will return to normal Wal-Mart levels, meaning half the rate of sales growth by the end of the third quarter after we anniversary our efforts to bring back assortment. 
Before I close, I'd like to recognize the hard work of our associates who've been impacted by the flooding across the central plains in the South. Countless associates and customers are dealing with the effects of the rising Mississippi River. When our stores are also affected, our priorities are to get them open and operating. They're often the first place that people in the community turn to for basics and clean-up products, and Wal-Mart will be there to help our customers get back on their feet no matter what the disaster. It's part of our mission and it's part who we are. 
Now I'll turn it over to Charles."
313055,129808219,131157,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 17, 2011",2011-05-17,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Let's get right to our financial scorecard. First, growth. Jeff pointed out earlier that sales increased 4.4% in the first quarter with solid sales results from Wal-Mart International and Sam's Club. We continue to remain focused on growing",617,"Thanks, Bill. Let's get right to our financial scorecard. First, growth. Jeff pointed out earlier that sales increased 4.4% in the first quarter with solid sales results from Wal-Mart International and Sam's Club. We continue to remain focused on growing comp sales and new stores throughout our markets. And let me add, comp sales improvement is our clear priority for Wal-Mart U.S. We will continue to invest in growth, and our capital plan of $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion remains in place for this year. 
We're still on track for sales growth of 4% to 6% and square footage growth of 3% to 4%. I remind you that these goals exclude acquisitions, such as Netto. We added 59 net units and approximately 3.7 million square feet of retail space since the end of fiscal 2011. International contributed almost 2.6 million square feet in the first quarter. Worldwide, we now have 9,029 units and approximately 989 million square feet of retail space. 
We have great opportunities for long-term growth in emerging markets, such as Brazil and China. Wal-Mart U.S. will continue to open supercenters in smaller formats. In addition, Sam's Club will open between 7 and 10 clubs this year. 
Turning to leverage. As Mike said earlier, the productivity loop remains a crucial priority for us. We continue to drive efficiencies throughout our business, which helps sustain our commitment to Every Day Low Price. For 6 consecutive quarters now, our company has leveraged operating expenses.  
And our third priority, returns. On a rolling 12-month basis ending April 30, 2011, return on investment ended at 18.5%. It is important to know that our underlying operations continue to maintain stable returns. 
In March, we were pleased to report that our Board declared an annual dividend of $1.46 per share for the fiscal year, a 21% increase over the previous year's dividend. We returned $3.4 billion to our shareholders during the first quarter through dividends and share repurchase. We remain committed to returning value to shareholders. 
Last quarter, I mentioned that the majority of our business now operates on our new SAP financial system, including the U.S., U.K. and Canada. We have completed our conversions in Mexico, and we have just recently started in Central America and Argentina. These improved systems provide more efficient financial processes around the world, allowing Wal-Mart to leverage knowledge and resources and increase consistency throughout our organization. 
Next let's move on to guidance. Based on our views of the macroeconomic and sales environment in the U.S. and around the world, we expect second quarter fiscal 2012 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.05 and $1.10, which compares to last year's earnings per share of $0.97. These estimates assume the currency exchange rates remain at current levels. 
In closing, I'd like to summarize a few points from our call today. We delivered strong earnings per share above our guidance for the first quarter of the fiscal year despite continued economic headwinds affecting our customers. We increased net sales by 4.4% and added approximately 3.7 million square feet of retail selling space around the world. 
Leveraging expenses remains a priority as it serves as a pre-cursor to EDLP. Since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we have leveraged operating expenses. Our business model, Every Day Low Costs driving Every Day Low Prices, is central to how we operate. We are on track for company sales growth of 4% to 6% this year. We intend to grow through comp sales and new stores as well as through multichannel initiatives, including e-commerce. And finally, we remain committed to shareholder returns through share repurchase and dividends. 
Thank you for listening today. We appreciate your interest in Wal-Mart."

Thanks for joining us today for our earnings call to review the first quarter of fiscal year 2012. Key information for this quarter, including updated unit counts, square footage and financial metrics, is available on our website at walmartstores.com/investors. A full transcript of the call will be available on the website after 7 a.m. Central Time today on May 17, 2011. Historical data can also be found on the site as well. 
We have a full agenda for today's first quarter recap. Mike Duke, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., will start off with the key results and commentary on our business strategies. As you can see from our press release this morning, we do have some discrete items that are accounted for in our results. So Jeff Davis, SVP of Finance and Treasurer, will cover the consolidated financial results, including more analysis on the noise. Then we'll go to the operating segments. First up will be Brian Cornell, President and CEO of Sam's Club. Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart International, will cover the overall results for International as well as our 6 largest countries. We will close the segment discussion with Bill Simon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart U.S. Finally, our CFO, Charles Holley, will present our financial report card and our guidance for the second quarter. 
Recall that we do not provide a full year guidance update this quarter. In our fourth quarter call from February, we said that we would no longer provide details on the membership and other income line except for Sam's Club because it's only relevant and material for Sam's. In this quarter, we include a discussion of a gain from the sale of an investment in Chile that is included in other income. Also, as we do from time to time, we will make reclassifications for consistency. 
Let me remind you as you listen today that our fiscal calendar for Wal-Mart International is different from the corporate fiscal calendar. All of our International countries, with the exception of Canada, end their fiscal quarter on March 31, while our consolidated financials end on April 30. This is particularly important given the shift in the Easter timing this year. International sales from Easter in all but Canada will be included in the second quarter results. 
And finally, our Annual Meeting of Shareholders is Friday, June 3, at the Bud Walton Arena in Fayetteville, Arkansas. We'll start promptly at 7 a.m. Central Time. If you can't join us in person, the meeting will be available via webcast on the corporate website. That's walmartstores.com. 
Now Mike, let's get started with our first quarter results. Mike?"

Wal-Mart is reporting EPS of $0.98 from continuing operations, exceeding our guidance range for the first quarter. This reflects the stability and strength of our global operations. Let me dive into some of the",1136,"Thank you, Carol. Good morning, everyone. Wal-Mart is reporting EPS of $0.98 from continuing operations, exceeding our guidance range for the first quarter. This reflects the stability and strength of our global operations. 
Let me dive into some of the key numbers for the quarter. Net sales were up 4.4% to $103.4 billion with strong contributions from Wal-Mart International and Sam's Club. Wal-Mart U.S. comps were negative 1.1%, which was roughly the mid-point of our guidance. Sam's Club comp of 4.2% was 120 basis points above guidance. Consolidated operating income was up 2.8% to $5.9 billion. 
The company leveraged operating expenses. The really great thing is that we have many more opportunities to leverage our scale, technology and innovative processes across the entire business. Return on investment was down due primarily to currency translation and cash accumulations. Jeff will provide additional details. For the quarter, the company returned $3.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Now let me move on to the highlights of the individual operating segments. The Wal-Mart U.S. comp sales decline of 1.1% was within our guidance range. We recognize we still have work to do, and comp sales growth remains the greatest priority for me and the entire Wal-Mart U.S. team. The good news is that the plan Bill Simon and his team are executing is gaining traction. Bill will elaborate more on our progress. We're focused on delivering EDLP in a wide assortment, and customers are responding favorably where we've made the most progress on executing the plan. I'm encouraged with what I hear from customers when I visit our U.S. stores. In grocery, we are further along with the transition, but the work on general merchandise will not be completed until the second half of the year. 
Our business model positions us well for customers who appreciate the one-stop shopping that our U.S. supercenters offer. Despite improvements in some areas of the economy, core Wal-Mart U.S. customers are still stretched. They remain concerned about rising prices for gas, energy and food as well as employment issues. Customers trust us to be their ally in fighting rising gas prices and inflation. We continue to earn that trust when we deliver on our commitment to EDLP. 
International remains the key growth driver for our company, and the segment has seen continued growth through a combination of comps and new stores. We will see the results of the Easter sales in the second quarter in our International markets, so I'm pleased to report that almost every market had strong sales growth this quarter. Mexico, China and Chile, not only had the best comp growth, but also the highest percentage sales increase for the quarter compared to last year. It's not a surprise that Japan's March sales were soft as the country continues to recover from the devastation of the earthquake and tsunami. We're pleased that we're beginning to see Japan stabilize. 
Our overall growth comes from comp sales and new stores, but we also grow through acquisitions. In April, we completed the acquisition of the Netto stores in the U.K., and the transition is underway to convert these stores to the ASDA brand. The Netto transaction and its results will show up in our second quarter. We're waiting for the outcome of the competition tribunal hearings in South Africa on our proposed investment in Massmart. 
I continue to see tremendous opportunity in the emerging markets like Brazil. Last month, I spent a week traveling to 3 cities in Brazil where I visited 25 stores. I believe that the transition underway to EDLP is right for our customers, though it will take time to shift the culture and improve the profitability. 
Operating income for Wal-Mart International was up 1.2% on a reported basis. International did not leverage expenses, so there is further opportunity on SG&A. 
Sam's Club delivered really good results this quarter with a 4.2% comp that was well above our guidance. I really like the positive momentum at Sam's Club, which is reflected, not only in comp sales, but also in increases in new members. We've been upgrading the quality and the value of our offering at Sam's, and the results are strong across-the-board. This quarter delivered the highest member experience scores that Sam's has ever had. 
I'm proud of the work of the Sam's Club team. They also delivered strong operating income and leveraged expenses. The warehouse club channel is increasing in importance in the retail landscape, and Sam's is gaining further momentum. We expect Sam's to add even more value to the company's overall portfolio. 
Wal-Mart has a tremendous growth opportunity in e-commerce. Customers today want continuous shopping channels, and they want price transparency. We're bringing together our stores, logistics expertise and systems to create an integrated shopping experience that moves seamlessly with the customer from the store to web-enabled devices. 
Over the last few weeks, you've also seen us ramp up investments in new talent and technology. We closed on the acquisition of Kosmix, and our teams are integrated into @WalmartLabs in Silicon Valley. This acquisition allows us to expand our capabilities in the online social commerce environment. 
The growth potential of e-commerce is especially significant in markets like China. We are committed to being at the forefront of this growth. On Friday, we announced that we are acquiring a minority stake in Yihaodian, one of China's leading online retailers. Yihaodian has achieved a significant position in online grocery sales as well as general merchandise, including electronics and apparel. We expect ongoing activity in the e-commerce area around the world. 
We know our customers also expect us to be a leader on the issues that matter to them. In April, we issued an expanded Global Responsibility Report in which we provided greater transparency and accountability on our efforts to be a responsible company around the world. We're pleased with the response to this report. 
As we build the next-generation Wal-Mart, staying close to the front lines of the business is at the top of my agenda, and I expect the same of every member of our leadership team. From Brazil to Silicon Valley, I visited more than 75 stores in this quarter alone. Everywhere I go I see customers working hard to make ends meet. Inflation and gas prices are adding to the pressures. They look to us to help them save money and live better. 
I've never been more confident in the relevance of our EDLP promise and our talented teams delivering on that promise. Wal-Mart will continue to manage the business for the short term and the long term. We will grow comps and open new stores, and we remain committed to leveraging expenses and improving returns for our shareholders. 
Now I'll turn it over to Jeff for more details on our financial results. Jeff?"
313055,129808219,131280,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 17, 2011",2011-05-17,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. For the first quarter of fiscal 2012, Wal-Mart's income from continuing operations was $3.4 billion, an increase of 3.8% over last year. Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart were $0.98, an increase of 12.",948,"Thank you, Mike. For the first quarter of fiscal 2012, Wal-Mart's income from continuing operations was $3.4 billion, an increase of 3.8% over last year. Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart were $0.98, an increase of 12.6% compared to $0.87 for the first quarter last year. First quarter EPS from continuing operations included the benefit of approximately $0.01 per share related to currency translation. In the first quarter last year, earnings per share benefited from currency translation by $0.02. 
In addition to the impact of currency translation, we have several other discrete items that impacted the first quarter. All the following numbers are pretax. We realized approximately $117 million from the mark-to-market gains on foreign currency derivative positions. ASDA recorded an approximate $67 million charge related to the removal of future benefit accruals and the effect of future pay increases from its defined benefit plan. Wal-Mart Japan incurred approximately $51 million casualty loss related to the March earthquake and tsunami. And finally, Wal-Mart Chile recorded approximately $51 million gain from the sale of an investment. 
All of these items are included in operating expenses with the exception of the gain from the sale in Chile, which is recorded in membership and other income. The net summary of these items accounted for approximately $0.01 of our EPS for the first quarter. 
As Mike mentioned, consolidated net sales increased by 4.4% or $4.3 billion to $103.4 billion for the quarter. The increase in sales was driven by Wal-Mart International and Sam's Club and included a currency exchange rate benefit of $1.3 billion. On a constant currency basis, sales grew 3% to $102.1 billion. 
The 13-week U.S. comp sales, without fuel, decreased 0.3%. You will hear more details on the Wal-Mart U.S. and Sam's comp sales from Bill and Brian. 
For the quarter, gross margin on sales was 24.4%, down 30 basis points compared to last year, driven by Wal-Mart International and Sam's Club. Unallocated corporate overhead and other, which includes other investment in global e-commerce, decreased by 20.8% to $309 million for the quarter. The $117 million mark-to-market gains on foreign currency derivative positions were the primary drivers of the decrease. Excluding these gains and global e-commerce initiatives, our core corporate overhead expense increased approximately $15 million or 3.9% compared to last year. I'm happy to say we have EDLC focused in our corporate areas. 
Consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 18 basis points on sales growth of 4.4%. On a constant currency basis, consolidated operating expenses increased 1.9%. Our focus on ensuring Every Day Low Costs remains a priority throughout the company. 
First quarter consolidated operating income was $5.9 billion, a 2.8% increase versus last year, which included a $49 million currency benefit. On a constant currency basis, consolidated operating income increased 1.9% for the first quarter versus last year. 
Net interest expense for the quarter increased 10% to $518 million. This was driven by higher debt levels compared to last year as we opportunistically issued new debt at historically low rates, offset partially by lower average interest rates on our outstanding debt. 
The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 33.5%. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 to be between 33.5% and 34.5%, although we will see some quarterly fluctuations. Changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and International operations may impact our effective tax rate. 
First quarter consolidated inventory grew 9.5% compared to last year. The inventory growth was primarily covered by a comparable increase in payables. Payables as a percentage of inventories remained stable at approximately 90%. In addition, consolidated inventory turns remained stable. 
In the first quarter, we issued $5 billion of long-term bonds for general corporate purposes at tighter levels than preliminary pricing guidance suggested, indicating strong investor demand. Our AA credit rating provides continued access to low-cost debt. 
The debt-to-total-capitalization ratio was 46.1% in the first quarter compared to 41.6% at the end of the first quarter last year. Since last year, we issued more than $10 billion in debt at historically low interest rates. We ended the first quarter with negative free cash flow of approximately $400 million due to our increased investment in inventory and timing of payments for our accrued liabilities. Free cash flow was in line with expectations. The company ended last year's first quarter with negative free cash flow of $1.6 billion due to lower-than-normal inventory levels at the end of fiscal 2010.
Capital expenditures were approximately $2.4 billion for the first quarter compared with $2.6 billion in the first quarter last year. We added approximately 3.7 million of new retail square footage and 59 new operating units during the quarter. In the first quarter, we distributed $1.3 billion in dividends. As a reminder, we increased our fiscal 2012 annual dividend per share by approximately 21% to $1.46 from $1.21 in fiscal 2011. 
In addition, we repurchased approximately $2.1 billion of shares during the first quarter, representing approximately 39.3 million shares. This leaves us with approximately $2.7 billion remaining on our $15 billion share repurchase authorization announced last June. 
Clearly, one of our priorities is returning value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During the first quarter, Wal-Mart returned $3.4 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Return on investment or ROI for the trailing 12 months ended April 3, 2011, was 18.5% compared to 19.2% for the prior year. The primary drivers of change in ROI were the impact from currency exchange and cash held for pending acquisitions. 
Now let's move to the discussion of our operating segments. We'll start with Sam's Club. Brian?"
313055,129808219,131280,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 17, 2011",2011-05-17,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jeff. I am very excited to share that Sam's Club momentum has continued into the new fiscal year. We sequentially increased our comp sales in each quarter of last year, and that momentum continued into the first quarter. Comp club sales, excl",1174,"Thank you, Jeff. I am very excited to share that Sam's Club momentum has continued into the new fiscal year. We sequentially increased our comp sales in each quarter of last year, and that momentum continued into the first quarter. 
Comp club sales, excluding fuel, increased 4.2% for the 13-week period ending April 29, 2011, exceeding our guidance of 1% to 3%. This is our fifth quarter of sequential quarterly comp improvement. We combined solid unit sales growth and increased traffic with excellent margin management. We leveraged operating expenses this quarter. 
Our membership acquisition performance was wrong. In fact, it was our best quarterly performance since I joined Sam's Club in March of 2009. This strength was driven by key membership events and excellent execution in the clubs. These strong results across all key areas of our business flow through to operating income, which, excluding fuel, increase faster than the rate of sales. 
Before I get in the detailed financial results, let me address the current dynamic around fuel, an important part of our value proposition. Our fuel stations establish the initial price perception and drive traffic to the clubs. We also know that great prices on gasoline drive member loyalty in terms of renewal rates and ticket. We're pumping more gallons of fuel and generating more sales dollars per gallon this year versus last year. 
Fuel prices in the first quarter this year are approximately 35% higher than a year ago, and gallons sold are up 22%. Including fuel, first quarter sales were $12.8 billion, a 9.4% increase over last year, and operating income increased 7% to $459 million. While top line fuel sales have increased, fuel profit on a dollar basis was basically flat to last year for the quarter. 
We see a large impact on gross margin percentages. Volatility in fuel prices can have a notable impact on our financial results, both positive and negative. We will continue with our strategy around fuel to be the price leader in the market. Our discussion today therefore excludes fuel for comparative purposes unless otherwise noted. 
Now let's turn to the detailed financial results. For the first quarter, net sales for Sam's Club increased to $11.3 billion, a 4.9% increase over last year. Comp club sales for the 13-week period increased 4.2%. Despite the impact of heavy snow in February, and flooding and tornadoes in April, comp club sales increases were strong across all 3 geographic operating divisions, and we are particularly pleased with the combined sales strength of our South and West divisions. Comp performance was driven more by our item growth than inflation. 
Comp ticket and traffic increased for the 13-week period by 190 and 230 basis points, respectively. Comp ticket increased for both Business and Advantage members. Comp traffic increased for Advantage members and was relatively flat for our Business members. 
Our ticket and traffic performance was driven in part due to our strategy to be the price leader in key everyday needs categories, such as grocery, cleaning and laundry. We also hosted several events, such as our second eValues Savings Celebration, in which we offered eValues to all members and the Taste of Sam's event. 
The frequency of member visits improved for both Business and Advantage members, particularly during the weekends. We have taken an approach to the weekends in which our clubs are focused on executing specific plans to elevate the in-club experience and member service. The plans are focused on key areas that are high touch points like fresh food, grocery and the front end. These are paying off in sales and improved member experience scores. 
From a merchandise perspective, comp increases were strong across fresh foods, grocery, home and apparel categories. We continue to see inflation in key categories, such as produce, meat and dairy. However, we managed through inflation with little impact on our margin and have seen continued growth in units sold year-over-year. The quality of our sales in our core categories was very strong, and we grew comp sales despite tobacco being a headwind during the first quarter. The challenge in tobacco is driven by the cycling of last year's tobacco pre-buys in anticipation of significant price increases as well as a change in our credit card reward program that disproportionately impacts our members who shop this category heavily. We anticipate tobacco being a headwind for the rest of the year. Recall that the average income for a Sam's Club member is above $75,000 annually. Discretionary spend is increasing as seen in our improved sales performance in home, apparel and certain technology and entertainment categories, including consumer electronics. Our gross margin rate was flat as a percentage of sales for the first quarter. 
For the quarter, inventory, including fuel, was up 10.6%. As we have mentioned in previous calls, we anticipated higher inventory growth rates through the quarter. These increases were driven by larger seasonal buys, earlier transition in seasonal and electronics and inflation. Additionally, we were up against historically low inventory levels last year. We expect inventory growth rates to return to a single digit in the second quarter as we manage inventory flow and members' needs. 
As mentioned earlier, I am very pleased with our progress on expense leverage and club efficiency. We reduced expenses as a percentage of sales by 17 basis points, driven by controlling wage costs. For the quarter, sales per labor hour increased 3.1% and units per labor hour increased 2.5%. 
Membership and other income for the first quarter increased 40 basis points versus last year. As you know, membership income is recorded under the deferred revenue recognition basis, so it's important to understand what's going on with membership income on a cash basis. Growth in membership income on a cash basis was very strong with increases in the mid- single digits. This strength came across all membership segments, and we are very pleased with the overall membership results. Membership income in the first quarter increased 40 basis points versus last year. For the second quarter, we anticipate membership income to continue the positive momentum with key events planned to engage our members in the clubs. 
We have also placed an emphasis on in-club renewals and on our Plus membership offering. We saw broad-based strength in renewal rates across membership categories in the quarter. Business add-on membership trends had begun to stabilize and are showing positive momentum. However, our small business members remain concerned with the economy and reduced access to credit. Therefore, we anticipate continued headwinds for our Business memberships throughout the fiscal year. 
First quarter operating income increased to $457 million, a 6.3% increase. Our sales momentum remains strong as we enter the first weeks of the second quarter. We expect comp club sales, without fuel, for the current 13-week period from April 30 through July 29 to increase 3% to 5%. Last year, Sam's comp club sales, excluding fuel, increased 1% for the comparable 13-week period. 
Now I will turn the program over to Doug to share with you the results for Wal-Mart International. Doug?"

On March 30 and 31, we shared with you while we are so excited about the growth prospects for China and Asia at our Annual International Conference for the Investment Community in Shenzhen, China. We came with a full team, including Scott Price, Cathy Smith, Ed Chan, Ed Kolodzieski and others, and we provided additional insight into our business strategy, our Asian operations and answered many questions from the analyst community. 
One of the key takeaways from that meeting is that we have a strategic plan in place to move Wal-Mart International from a good business into a great business, and this will be underpinned by doing what we do best: providing our customers great value through Every Day Low Prices. Our management team is focused on delivering that plan through what I referred to as the 4 dimensions of growth: comp store sales; new stores; e-commerce and multichannel; and finally, acquisitions. 
Here is what our first fiscal quarter looked like in terms of these 4 dimensions. For the first quarter of fiscal 2012, all of our markets had encouraging comp store sales results with Mexico, China and Chile having the highest comps. By the way, as it relates to Chile, we've seen double-digit comp store sales for several quarters since we made this investment, and I'm really proud of the Wal-Mart Chile team and our integration team. They've done a great job. The Easter calendar change and Brazil's EDLP implementation negatively impacted our comp store sales, and I'll discuss the detail shortly. 
As it relates to new store growth, we increased our total store count 11.8% or 487 stores for the past 12 months. This translates into 7.9% more square feet than at the end of the first quarter of last year with most of the increase in Mexico and China. 
During the first quarter, Wal-Mart International added 2.6 million square feet of retail space through 54 units. We have had some good results internationally in the area of e-commerce and multichannel. During the first quarter of this year, ASDA's online grocery and general merchandise sales grew 20.8% from last year, and Brazil's online general merchandise sales grew 41.1%. We're learning more about the online business in China through the November 2010 launch of the Sam's Club e-commerce site. 
As it relates to acquisitions, our team in the U.K. completed its purchase of the 147 Netto stores from Dansk Supermarked in April 2011, which falls in our second fiscal quarter. We expect to complete the in-store conversions this year, investing more than GBP 100 million and creating more than 1,500 jobs. 
Two of our leaders in the U.K., Judith McKenna and Karen Hubbard, have done a great job getting us to this point, and we look forward to seeing the results of our conversions and integration. In fact, we have already opened our first 3 converted stores. We currently own a 35% equity interest in Trust-Mart stores and hold voting rights with respect to an additional 30% interest. We have agreed to acquire the remainder of Trust-Mart once regulatory approvals have been obtained. 
In April, we obtained antitrust clearance and now expect to finalize the other regulatory approvals and complete the transaction by the end of this fiscal year. 
And finally, in South Africa, competition tribunal hearings began on May 9. This is what we expect to be the final step in the approval process for our potential investment in Massmart and in sub-Saharan Africa. We remain excited about the opportunity to serve customers in this part of the world. 
Turning to other events happening with our business. We're very proud of the passion and speed with which our associates responded to the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Within the first 3 days following these events, Wal-Mart associates working across Japan quickly took action to help by setting up distribution points for relief items in our store parking lots when the stores themselves were too damaged to open. Associates brought in 95 tons of blankets, flashlights, batteries, water, emergency food and warm clothing. We will continue to actively provide assistance on the ground and monitor the situation to look for additional ways we can help. Our thoughts are with our associates, our customers and the communities we serve in the affected areas. 
From a global perspective, food inflation has made recent headlines. Families in many countries spend a significant amount of their income just on food, and some of these countries rely heavily on imported commodities as the primary source of food. So increases in food prices can have a fast and dramatic effect in some parts of the world. We're experiencing some inflation in our sales numbers in just about every market. Argentina, Brazil and Central America are currently experiencing inflation across our basket of goods. We're seeing our highest inflation levels in Argentina, and we're doing our best to keep prices down for our customers in each market. 
Now let's get to the numbers. Carol reminded you earlier about the one-month lag on the International calendar. Consequently, we will see the majority of this year's Easter sales in our second quarter results. Wal-Mart International's first quarter reported sales were $27.9 billion, a growth of 11.5% over the first quarter of last year. All of our markets had strong sales growth except in Japan as our sales results include the effects of the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Changes in currency rates increased our net sales by $1.3 billion. Our first quarter constant currency sales grew 6.2% over last year. This growth came despite the effects of the Japan disasters and the Easter flip. Mexico, China and Chile provided the strongest net sales growth in the first quarter. Jeff detailed the results of several discrete items that affected first quarter comparative results for Wal-Mart International. Please remember these as you review our segment details. 
Our first quarter operating income increased 1.2% over last year to $1.1 billion. However, on a constant currency basis, operating income was $1 billion, a decline of 3.3%. The decline in constant currency operating income resulted from a decline in our overall gross profit margins and the effect of the discrete items Jeff mentioned earlier. Without these discrete items, constant currency operating income increased over last year but did not grow faster than sales. Wal-Mart International's first quarter constant currency gross profit margin declined from last year due primarily to the change in sales mix associated with the Easter calendar shift and investments in price. 
First quarter membership and other income increased from last year to the $51 million gain on the sale of an investment in Chile. Without this gain, membership and other income would've increased $23 million. Constant currency operating expenses for Wal-Mart International grew faster than sales because of the pressure from the discrete items Jeff covered. Without these items, we leveraged constant currency expenses versus last year because of strong expense management in Chile, Canada and Japan. 
Our progress on inventory was disappointing for the first quarter of this year with days on hand increasing over last year in most of our markets. Much of the 11.4% increase in inventory has to do with new store growth, but clearly, our management teams across all countries, especially China and Brazil, have this as a priority. 
Now let's get into the results for several of our larger markets. Country management teams account for the results on a local currency basis. The following discussion of country results excludes the impact of currency, and unless otherwise stated, sales and comp sales are presented on a nominal basis. In Mexico, our sales continue to grow at a fast rate, and operating income grew faster than sales. This will be the last quarter we only discuss Walmex as results in Mexico. Our second fiscal quarter will be the first time we discuss consolidated results of Walmex and Central America. While the following results are on a U.S. GAAP basis, Walmex separately reports its earnings under Mexican GAAP, so some numbers are different from the Walmex reported results. 
Walmex's net sales for the first quarter were up 6.9% and comparable store sales were up 1.7%. Sales growth came from the strong new store growth program in Mexico where we have 288 more stores than at the end of the first quarter of last year. Customer traffic declined to 2.2% and average ticket increased 3.9% at comparable stores. 
For the first quarter, Walmex comp store sales for the self-service formats grew by 1.5%, while ANTAD's comp store sales report for the rest of the industry, excluding Walmex, showed only 0.9% growth. Walmex's first quarter operating income grew faster than sales at 9.2% due to higher gross profit margin. 
First quarter gross profit margin as a percentage of sales increased 54 basis points from last year. However, expenses grew 10.4%, primarily on costs of new stores and remodels. Moving on to Brazil. Net sales grew in the first quarter, and Brazil continues to implement EDLP and increase the number of items. However, operating income declined from last year. Prices on more than 10,000 items, primarily in food, have been reduced, and this number increases each month. As I've said before and as we saw in Japan, this is a long-term initiative, so we expect to experience some pain during the conversion period. We're very confident about our opportunities in Brazil and expect to invest approximately $775 million this year, upgrading logistics, and technology and opening 80 new stores. 
On another note, our wholesale operations, Sam's Club and Maxxi, have delivered on plan for the first quarter in Brazil. In real terms or removing the impact of inflation, Brazil's first quarter net sales and comparable sales both declined from last year. Customer traffic at comparable stores decreased 8% and average ticket increased 1.9% in real terms. As expected, first quarter gross profit margin as a percentage of sales declined 140 basis points from last year due to the migration toward a consistent EDLP offering. 
Expenses as a percentage of sales increased 92 basis points, primarily because of the lower sales growth and 42 new stores opened since the first quarter of last year. The gross margin pressure caused a significant decline in Brazil's operating results from last year.
Earlier, I mentioned the Online business in Brazil grew 41.1% this quarter. This was on top of last year's sales growth of 80%. We launched the e-commerce site at the end of 2008 with 10,000 products in 11 categories. Today, we offer than 70,000 products across 21 categories. 
In the past 12 months, we have opened 42 new stores in Brazil, bringing our total store count to 480. This includes one new store in the first quarter of this year. 
Moving to Asia, during our investor meeting in March, Scott Price provided insight into our execution path for Japan's EDLP and EDLC implementation, and importantly, the value of successfully communicating our EDLP approach to Japanese customers. As you know, the March 2011 earthquake affected Japan and began the start of a very challenging period. According to statistics released by the Japanese Ministry of the Economy, Trade and Industry or METI, overall supermarket comparable store sales declined by 3.3% in March of 2011. This is especially tough since this decline is on top of last year's 5.6% comp sales decline. According to METI, our performance continues to stay ahead of other large-scale retailers in Japan, and we've maintained our market share in what has been a deflationary environment. 
Wal-Mart Japan's first quarter sales were better than overall supermarket sales. However, the effects of the earthquake and tsunami resulted in an operating loss in the first quarter of this year. First quarter net sales and comparable store sales were flat to last year in real terms. Wal-Mart Japan's traffic declined 2.8% over last year, and the average ticket in real terms increased 2.2%. Our remodeled stores had increases in average ticket of 5.7%, and our other stores had ticket increases of 1.7% both in real terms. 
Sales in over-the-counter pharmacy, paper goods and baby had the strongest performance, while sales of electronics, apparel and cosmetics were down. Gross profit margin as a percentage of sales increased by 79 basis points from last year. Expenses as a percentage of sales increased 2% from last year or declined 67 basis points without the earthquake and tsunami charge. Wal-Mart China sales grew in the first quarter as well, but operating income declined slightly from last year. Net sales for the first quarter grew 12.4% over last year and comparable store growth was 4.5%. 
Average ticket grew 11% in China, but traffic declined 5.8%. The primary traffic decline was in Trust-Mart stores. First quarter gross margin increased 54 basis points over last year, primarily due to purchasing efficiencies. Expenses as a percentage of sales grew 102 basis points, primarily due to increases in associate compensation and tax costs. First quarter operating income declined 4.2%. In the past 12 months, we opened 49 new stores, including 45 supercenters, and that brings our China store count to 333 stores. 
Turning now to the United Kingdom. Andy Clarke and the ASDA team had a solid start to the year, growing sales in the first quarter of this year. However, operating income declined from last year, primarily as a result of the charge for the ASDA-defined benefit plan and, to a lesser extent, acquisition cost for Netto. 
In the first quarter of this year, comparable sales, excluding fuel, increased 10 basis points. We will see ASDA's strong sales from Easter and the royal wedding in our second quarter. Average ticket in the first quarter increased 30 basis points and traffic decreased by 20 basis points. Sales of chilled foods, children's wear and home were particularly strong in the first quarter. In support of ASDA's EDLP offering, ASDA increased its price guarantee to 10% at the start of the year, and almost 3 million customer baskets have been checked online. First quarter operating income declined from last year due to the discrete charge covered earlier as well as other acquisition costs associated with the Netto purchase. Excluding these charges, ASDA's expenses grew slower than sales under the We Operate for Less program. Operating income was essentially flat to last year. 
ASDA private brands continue to perform well with its premium brand, Extra Special, and the mid-tier brand, Chosen By You. Chosen by You has been ranked by Kantar Worldpanel as the fastest-growing private brand across the top 4 U.K. grocery retailers. In the last 12 months, ASDA has opened 12 new stores for a total store count of 386. ASDA's commitment to EDLP comes at an important time for its customers who are dealing with the burden of inflation, taxes and record petrol prices. 
And finally, Canada. Walmart Canada sales grew in the first quarter of this year, and operating income grew faster than sales. Net sales grew 4.4% in the first quarter compared to last year, primarily due to the supercenter expansion program and strong sales in most categories. However, first quarter comparables sales declined 60 basis points from last year. Average ticket increased 3.6% for the first quarter and traffic declined 4.2%. As a percentage of sales, gross margin declined to 38 basis points from last year and expenses also declined 42 basis points despite the increase in cost from the new Walmart Canada Bank. The 5.8% increase in operating income from last year was a result of operating expense savings. Walmart Canada recently announced its plans to enter the Quebec grocery market with the transformation of its existing stores into supercenters. The first phase of this conversion is scheduled to begin in the second quarter of this year, and these supercenters will carry a full range of fresh food as well as general merchandise.  
In addition, we will open our first 5 supercenters in the province of Manitoba in the second quarter. In the past 12 months, we opened 8 new stores in Canada, bringing our store count to 325 stores. This year, we expect to open 40 supercenters, including conversions and expansions. 
There are also strong results in our other markets. We have a good track record of leveraging our processes and resources to add value for a new markets, customers and associates. Our January 2009 acquisition of D&S in Chile is a recent example. Wal-Mart Chile grew constant currency sales, 11.5% in the first quarter, and retail square footage increased by 6.5% or 31 stores. 
Our focus on growing sales continues long after the acquisition. Constant currency sales grew 10.9% in the first quarter of this year at our Central American operations. We acquired Central America in 2005, and first quarter sales are now just under $1 billion at $950 million. 
In closing, Wal-Mart International is well positioned to continue delivering on growth opportunities and comp stores sales, e-commerce and acquisitions. We will also continue to deliver on new store growth. 
Now I'll turn it over to Bill for the update on Wal-Mart U.S."
313055,129808219,131280,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 17, 2011",2011-05-17,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Doug. Earlier in the call, Mike mentioned that we're gaining traction in our Wal-Mart U.S. business as we implement the 4-point plan that I laid out in the fourth quarter. Recall that this plan focuses on driving Every Day Low Price, delivering",2081,"Thank you, Doug. Earlier in the call, Mike mentioned that we're gaining traction in our Wal-Mart U.S. business as we implement the 4-point plan that I laid out in the fourth quarter. Recall that this plan focuses on driving Every Day Low Price, delivering the broadest assortment possible, improving our remodeling efforts and integrating a multichannel experience for our customers. 
Now our best comp performance remains in the Grocery and Health and Wellness business, both of which had positive comps in the first quarter. As I mentioned in February, these businesses delivered positive comps in the fourth quarter as well. Our negative 1.1 comp sales were the midpoint of our guidance of negative 2% to flat for the quarter. Comp sales declined for the 13-week period was driven by lower traffic, which was partially offset by an increase in ticket. Inflation provided the small tailwind. The importance of delivering Every Day Low Price has never been greater, as our customers are consolidating trips due to higher gas prices. Our greatest priority remains to grow comp sales. We're focused on our EDLP strategy and moving away from the deep discounts that were in the headlines this time last year. 
We've launched our new ad match marketing campaign in early April, and the customer response has been terrific. Net sales rose 0.6% to $62.7 billion for the first quarter. Grocery, again, delivered low single-digit positive comps for the quarter. Our Food business is delivering positive sales growth that's on par with the top competitors, and we're seeing a recovery in our Consumables business. Customers are responding positively as we expand our merchandise assortment, adding back items across all categories. We began our SKU add back program in the third quarter with dry grocery. We're pleased with the comp sales improvement to date in this area, which is up 150 basis points from the fourth quarter. I believe that sales improvement supports our belief that we're on the right track. As we add more SKUs throughout all categories, we expect to gain further traction, improving both traffic and ticket. 
In Consumables, we executed modular changes, the ones I mentioned last quarter, and saw positive sales momentum from categories like hair care and fragrance. These modular changes focused on bringing back assortment, ensuring opening price points were available in all categories and increased the holding power on the shelf. As an example, our air care modular was updated in February, and we've experienced an 880-basis-point comp improvement from the fourth quarter through the first quarter. 
The paycheck cycle remains pronounced. During the quarter, we saw a continued pressure from ongoing macroeconomic conditions as customers continued to trade down to opening price points in some private label products. Our grocery inflation was approximately 1% during the quarter with the greatest impact on perishables. We continue to act as the agent for our customers by building trust through EDLP. 
Our Health and Wellness business had a low single-digit positive comp, driven by our Prescription business. 5 years ago, Wal-Mart launched the $4 prescription drug program, a move that changed the industry and shifted more customers from branded to generic products. While this change helped drive traffic and unit sales, the increase in generic utilization does pressure the top line. However, the new Humana program, which is generating incremental pharmacy sales and other industry dynamics, more than offset this pressure. We expect this program to drive positive results in the coming months. 
Entertainment had mid- single-digit negative comps. That area is still being impacted by price deflation in key electronics items. We did have strong TV unit sales as customers used tax refund loans during the quarter. We continue to see strong prepaid wireless sales, especially in services, though these services are not fully reflected in our top line sales. Hardlines comps were low single-digit negative. Easter crafts performed well, offset by a weakness in stationary and hardware. Automotive generated positive comp sales. Temperatures have begun to rebound this month, and we expect improved results across the Hardline business. Apparel had mid- single-digit negative comp, with the greatest weakness in kids, ladies and shoes. Where we've brought back assortment, like ladies plus, sales and trends are improving. In fact, we posted positive comp for the quarter in ladies plus. We simply are not converting enough of our grocery customers to shop apparel, and we've been working hard on strategies to improve this important area of the store. We're very focused on driving improvement in basics, including socks, underwear and T-shirts. We're adding back deleted items and even more categories, though this will continue to take time. 
And we're investing in prices we recognize that customers have seen higher prices across the industry for cotton-related apparel. Apparel is a work in progress, but one that has a tremendous amount of an attention throughout the organization. 
Home posted a mid- single-digit negative comp as well, impacted by delays in the start of the spring selling season. Outdoor Living, in particular, a large part of our sales plan for the quarter, had double-digit negative comps because of weather impacts. We're seeing that turn around now with more favorable weather across most of the country, and I'm pleased with how our customers are responding to our Outdoor Living assortment this month. 
During the first quarter, most of our indoor home categories, including home decor, cooking, dining and bath, had improving sales trends, the result of offering broader assortment. We expect to see momentum pick up in indoor categories during the second quarter. Our Walmart.com Online business remained strong with an increase in traffic and order size. Electronics remained a strong category, including televisions, wireless and home office. 
In Hardlines, tires and automotive categories are strong. And in home, we're seeing ongoing strength of sales and furniture. We're also pleased with the ongoing momentum of our Site to Store business. 
And now I'll cover the remaining financial results. Gross profit dollars were up 0.6% over last year, in line with the first quarter sales growth, causing the gross margin rate as a percentage of sales to remain flat as expected. Our logistics team continues to implement multiple efficiency initiatives that have minimized the impact of diesel price increases on the cost of sales. 
We were able to leverage expenses again this quarter with total SG&A up only approximately 40 basis points compared to last year. Sales per labor hour improved again for the first quarter, building on last year's progress and productivity. Marketing expenses were at more normalized levels compared to the same quarter last year. Additionally, we delivered reductions in our accident costs due to significant attention from store operations. 
Operating income grew faster than sales at 0.8% for the quarter over last year. As expected, inventory was up 6.3% compared to this time last year. However, the year-over-year growth rate of inventory has slowed 190 basis points compared to the fourth quarter. The increase is due in part to our continued focus on bringing back assortment in grocery. 100 basis points was due to inflation, primarily in grocery categories. Approximately, 100 basis points of the increase were also due to higher in-transit inventory as we expand our global sourcing initiatives. 
We also recognized increases in inventory for home, toys and seasonal, where weather slowed seasonal sales. Overall, the quality of our inventory remains in good shape. We can assure that Wal-mart stores are always in stock, especially for high turn items in grocery. We must make sure that all stores are customer-ready every day. 
Our displays must come to life in terms of delivering value and excitement for our customers. We remain optimistic about our growth opportunities in the U.S. and plan to open between 140 and 160 new and converted units this year. Back in October, we shared with you that we plan to open between 185 and 205 units. Consistent with the $1 billion reduction in capital expenditures that we disclosed last quarter, we are delaying the delivery of additional in-box conversions of discount stores to supercenters as we take the time to review and adjust this initiative. Most of our capital commitment goes to supercenters. However, we're also committing to small formats, including those between 30,000 and 60,000 square feet as well as stores that will range from 15,000 to 30,000 square feet. 
The strength of our Food business is reflected in the continued performance of our Neighborhood Market grocery stores, which average about 40,000 square feet today. We're pleased with both the comp and the returns of these grocery stores. In fact, this quarter, our Neighborhood Market comp increase was approximately 4%, driven by traffic increase of almost 2%. 
Because of this momentum, we're starting to accelerate the opening of even more Neighborhood Markets. We're on schedule this year to open between 15 and 20 Neighborhood Market stores to capture growth in untapped markets. 
We will also open several of the Wal-Mart Express stores as a pilot in both rural and urban areas with the goal of having 15 to 20 stores by year end. This is our new format, averaging 15,000 square feet and offering customers fresh food along with key general merchandise categories. 
Wal-Mart Express will also include our Site to Store programs, so that customers can take advantage of Wal-Mart's broad online merchandise assortment. The Express pilots will be different, so we can determine which merchandise assortment is right for the community. Some will have pharmacy, some won't. The goal is to get the model right, so that when we have the format, we'll roll it out and it will be successful. 
I've already talked about the first 2 points of the 4-point plan: price leadership and the broadest assortment. Our third point: We're driving efficiencies in our remodel program. Our remodels are underway this quarter and will be completed in less time than in the past 2 years. They will be less disruptive to our customers and associates. Through reengineering efforts, we're able to increase the efficiency of our remodeling plan by reducing, on average, 15% in the cost for each supercenter. 
And finally, our multichannel integration is an important focus for our long-term growth strategy. We're testing several programs to help us better integrate the stores with our website. Our expanded Pick Up Today program is currently rolled out to 2,800 stores and doing well. While it's early for data, we're pleased with the customer response. The program will be in 3,000 stores by the end of the second quarter. We expect to see continued growth in this service as we make more items available on Walmart.com for immediate pick up. 
Rising gas prices, high unemployment and increasing inflation continue to be the most important issues facing our customers today. One in 5 Wal-Mart moms list gasoline as a top expense behind housing and car payments. We continue to be prepared to help her with low prices and broad assortment during this time of uncertainty. 
Last year, during the second quarter, Wal-Mart had the deep rollbacks that drove our unit sales of some items but did not deliver the intended traffic and basket lift we were looking for. We will not repeat these programs this year. 
We're monitoring the economic environment carefully, as significant changes in gas prices and inflation during the quarter will influence our actual performance. We expect Wal-Mart U.S. comp sales for the second quarter period, running from April 30 through July 29, to range from negative 1% to positive 1%, and our 13-week comp for last year in the second quarter declined 1.8%. 
Our continued focus on productivity initiatives will enable us to leverage expenses through the second quarter. Inventory will return to normal Wal-Mart levels, meaning half the rate of sales growth by the end of the third quarter after we anniversary our efforts to bring back assortment. 
Before I close, I'd like to recognize the hard work of our associates who've been impacted by the flooding across the central plains in the South. Countless associates and customers are dealing with the effects of the rising Mississippi River. When our stores are also affected, our priorities are to get them open and operating. They're often the first place that people in the community turn to for basics and clean-up products, and Wal-Mart will be there to help our customers get back on their feet no matter what the disaster. It's part of our mission and it's part who we are. 
Now I'll turn it over to Charles."
313055,129808219,131280,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 17, 2011",2011-05-17,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Let's get right to our financial scorecard. First, growth. Jeff pointed out earlier that sales increased 4.4% in the first quarter with solid sales results from Wal-Mart International and Sam's Club. We continue to remain focused on growing",617,"Thanks, Bill. Let's get right to our financial scorecard. First, growth. Jeff pointed out earlier that sales increased 4.4% in the first quarter with solid sales results from Wal-Mart International and Sam's Club. We continue to remain focused on growing comp sales and new stores throughout our markets. And let me add, comp sales improvement is our clear priority for Wal-Mart U.S. We will continue to invest in growth, and our capital plan of $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion remains in place for this year. 
We're still on track for sales growth of 4% to 6% and square footage growth of 3% to 4%. I remind you that these goals exclude acquisitions, such as Netto. We added 59 net units and approximately 3.7 million square feet of retail space since the end of fiscal 2011. International contributed almost 2.6 million square feet in the first quarter. Worldwide, we now have 9,029 units and approximately 989 million square feet of retail space. 
We have great opportunities for long-term growth in emerging markets, such as Brazil and China. Wal-Mart U.S. will continue to open supercenters in smaller formats. In addition, Sam's Club will open between 7 and 10 clubs this year. 
Turning to leverage. As Mike said earlier, the productivity loop remains a crucial priority for us. We continue to drive efficiencies throughout our business, which helps sustain our commitment to Every Day Low Price. For 6 consecutive quarters now, our company has leveraged operating expenses.  
And our third priority, returns. On a rolling 12-month basis ending April 30, 2011, return on investment ended at 18.5%. It is important to know that our underlying operations continue to maintain stable returns. 
In March, we were pleased to report that our Board declared an annual dividend of $1.46 per share for the fiscal year, a 21% increase over the previous year's dividend. We returned $3.4 billion to our shareholders during the first quarter through dividends and share repurchase. We remain committed to returning value to shareholders. 
Last quarter, I mentioned that the majority of our business now operates on our new SAP financial system, including the U.S., U.K. and Canada. We have completed our conversions in Mexico, and we have just recently started in Central America and Argentina. These improved systems provide more efficient financial processes around the world, allowing Wal-Mart to leverage knowledge and resources and increase consistency throughout our organization. 
Next let's move on to guidance. Based on our views of the macroeconomic and sales environment in the U.S. and around the world, we expect second quarter fiscal 2012 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.05 and $1.10, which compares to last year's earnings per share of $0.97. These estimates assume the currency exchange rates remain at current levels. 
In closing, I'd like to summarize a few points from our call today. We delivered strong earnings per share above our guidance for the first quarter of the fiscal year despite continued economic headwinds affecting our customers. We increased net sales by 4.4% and added approximately 3.7 million square feet of retail selling space around the world. 
Leveraging expenses remains a priority as it serves as a pre-cursor to EDLP. Since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we have leveraged operating expenses. Our business model, Every Day Low Costs driving Every Day Low Prices, is central to how we operate. We are on track for company sales growth of 4% to 6% this year. We intend to grow through comp sales and new stores as well as through multichannel initiatives, including e-commerce. And finally, we remain committed to shareholder returns through share repurchase and dividends. 
Thank you for listening today. We appreciate your interest in Wal-Mart."

Before we discuss our second quarter performance, we do have a couple of reminders. You'll note in our press release that we have certain items affecting EPS this quarter and Jeff will cover these shortly. As you know, we closed on the acquisitions of the 147 Netto stores in the U.K. and our majority interest in [indiscernible] during this quarter. The Netto stores are fully consolidated into our financials but do not include our results from [indiscernible]. The balance sheet from Massmart is consolidated using their fiscal year balance.

Many of you often ask about what's included in the noncontrolling or as we used to call minority interest line. This line primarily relates to noncontrolling ownership interest in Mexico, which includes Central America, as well as Chile, Massmart in China, India and now Massmart.

Today, Walmart is reporting second quarter earnings per share of $1.09 from continuing operations, which is a 12.4% increase over last year and near the top of our guidance. Let's give light to get key results. Net s",1103,"Thanks, Carol. Good morning, everyone. Today, Walmart is reporting second quarter earnings per share of $1.09 from continuing operations, which is a 12.4% increase over last year and near the top of our guidance. Let's give light to get key results. Net sales increased 5.5% to $108.6 billion. Total U.S. comp sales, without fuel, were flat for the 13-week period. Sam's Club comp, without fuel, was up 5%, right at the top of the guidance for the period. And Walmart U.S. delivered comp sales within guidance at negative 0.9%. International reported net sales of $30 billion, a strong 16.2% increase. We also grew internationally [indiscernible], reduced significant acquisitions. Consolidated operating income increased 3.1%. Walmart ended the quarter with free cash flow of $4 billion. For the quarter, the company returned $2.7 billion to shareholders for dividends and share repurchases. Operating expenses in the second quarter grew at the same rate as sales. We remain committed to the productivity loop and the strong expense management throughout the Walmart organization. We have the right initiatives in place to leverage for the full year. 
Let's move to the highlights of the individual segments. I'm encouraged by the sales improvement in our Walmart U.S. stores. Comp have improved sequentially month-to-month within the quarter. In fact, this was the best quarterly performance since the third quarter of fiscal 2010. The goal of the Walmart U.S. team remains positive comp by year end. In the second quarter, Bill Simon and the Walmart U.S. team completed the assortment [indiscernible] in grocery in food and consumables, resulting in better customer traffic on this side of the store. We're making progress in expanding our general merchandise assortment and seeing positive comp in some categories such as sporting goods, but we still have work to do and the team is focused on implementing the plan. 
I've recently observed several consumer focused group and it's clear that many consumers are still struggling. They're trading down to stretch their budgets. Buying a lower-priced brand of detergent, moving from branded canned goods to private label and purchasing half gallons of milk instead of gallons. That's why we are laser focused on investing in price to help our customers. There are certainly are many reports on Walmart pricing and the fact is that the gap has narrowed in some cases. We are committed to widening the gap on price and we have a specific plan and timetable to deliver EDLP to every customer. 
Walmart U.S. also managed the business well in the second quarter, growing operating profit faster than sales to nearly $5 billion. Walmart International has strong growth against through a combination of comp and new stores. Second quarter sales were 16.2% with sales growth in all markets except Japan, which is still recovering from the natural disasters. The international segment is an increasingly important part of our growth story and operating income improved nearly 9% in the second quarter. 
I'm pleased that we closed on the acquisitions of Netto and Massmart and [indiscernible] in the U.K. and Africa. I'm excited about helping underserved customers in sub-Saharan Africa and I'm also excited about the 15,000 jobs that we expect to create on the continent over the next 5 years. We'll hear more of from Doug [indiscernible] about the significant new growth in Latin America this quarter led by Mexico. 
Every Day Low Price remains one of our strongest competitive advantages and we continue to use this strategy in more of our international markets. We're transitioning to EDLP in Brazil and Central America. We recognize that it takes time to implement [indiscernible] markets but we believe this is right for our customers over the long-term. 
Sam's Club continued its strong momentum in the second quarter, delivering a 5% comp without fuel. This is the sixth straight quarter of comp improvement for Sam's, a testament to the team's execution to drive quality, value and savings for members. I'm also pleased with the momentum in membership income as Sam's improves its renewals and upgrades. Sam's also delivered strong operating income, driven in part by very good fuel sales and Sam's leverage operating expenses. The strategy to win the weekend that Brian Cornell and his team have in place will position Sam's Club well for the back half of the year. 
In the second quarter, our global e-commerce [indiscernible] stepped-up its work on delivering continuous shopping experience to customers from the store to the web to the mobile devices. In the [indiscernible] markets, we're investing in multichannel initiatives by integrating our stores with online services. We completed the rollout of Pick Up Today in all Walmart U.S. stores and [indiscernible] we announced that [indiscernible], our movie streaming technology is now available on Walmart.com as well as through iPad browser. 
Walmart's brand and scale, coupled with consumers' need for [indiscernible], also gives us opportunities in some of the fastest growing markets in the world today. In June, we established Walmart's China e-commerce headquarters in Shanghai and we put in place the leadership team to quickly build this business. We are investing in the right talent and technology to pursue the growth in e-commerce. I believe that Walmart is the best position retailer to serve the needs of the next-generation customers who are striving to join the emerging global [indiscernible]. They're connected to the world through smartphone and social media. They have higher expectations of value, quality and a better life. We will continue to advocate for policies that make sense for our customers and our business. 
In the U.S., we're pleased by the momentum around e-fairness, legislation to eliminate the unfair advantage that online only retailers currently have. Recently, we've seen the process of laws in key states like California, Illinois and Texas, strong efforts from the small business community and clear call for reform from our nation editorial pages. We're encouraged by the growing interest in a federal response to this issue as well. And we will remain engaged in the debate in Washington. 
We've also called for modernizing our nation's corporate tax code. Last month, I testified before the U.S. committee on reforming the tax code, to drive job growth here at home and encourage Americas competitiveness abroad. To achieve comprehensive reform, we [indiscernible] for putting everything on the table including the existing incentives that benefit us. There are 3 key points that I emphasize to the committee. One, forward corporate tax rate; two, get rid of existing incentives that benefit some industries over others; and three, level the international playing field with a territorial system. 
Now I'll turn it over to Jeff to detail the Financial Reports. Jeff?"

For the second quarter of fiscal 2011, Walmart reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.09, which was been our guidance from $1.05 to $1.10.

For the second quarter of fiscal 2011, Walmart reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.09, which was been our guidance from $1.05 to $1.10. [indiscernible] to $0.97 for the second quarter last year. Income from continuing operations included certain pre tax items as follows: we reported approximately an $49 million mark-to-market loss on certain foreign currency derivative positions related to the Massmart acquisition; we realized cost of approximately $36 million related to [indiscernible] Netto and Massmart; we recognized expenses approximately $30 million related to the damages from tornadoes and floods in our United States operations. These items totaled $115 million are included in our operating expenses. 
In addition, Walmart Mexico, recorded an approximately $17 million revaluation charge from the implementation of the SAP financial system, which Doug will provide additional details later. Combination of these expense and gross margin items on EPS from continuing operations was approximately $0.03. 
Now let's move to the rest of the P&L. Consolidated net sales increased 5.5%, $5.6 billion [indiscernible] $108.6 billion for the quarter. Increase was driven primarily by Walmart International and Sam's Club and included a currency exchange benefit of $2.3 billion. Sales for Massmart were reported in our operating results starting in the third quarter. 
Total U.S. comp sales, without fuel, for the 13-week period ended July 29, were flat and negative 20 basis points for the 26-week period. You will hear more details in the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club sales from Bill and Brian. 
For the quarter, gross margin on sales was 24.7%, a 10-basis point reduction compared to last year. Sam's Club fuel sales was the primary contributor to the margin decline. Unallocated corporate overhead and other includes our ongoing investment in global e-commerce [indiscernible] approximately 21.8% to $509 million for the second quarter. Excluding the $49 million loss on mark-to-market foreign currency derivative positions I mentioned earlier and our global e-commerce initiatives, our 4 corporate overhead expenses increased [indiscernible]. 
Consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of sales were flat to last year at 19.5%, operating expenses grew at the same rate of sales or 5.5%. Excluding the items affecting operating expenses that I previously mentioned, the company leveraged operating expenses for the second quarter. To reiterate what Mike said, the company is expected to leveraging expenses for the full year and we have focused expense management initiatives in place throughout the company. 
Consolidated operating income, which included $110 million currency benefit was $6.4 billion, a 3.1% increase versus last year. Net interest expense for the quarter increased 19.2% to $578 million, increased interest expense was [indiscernible] hired debt levels as we opportunistically issued new debt over the last 12 months at historically low rates. Retired debt levels were partially offset by lower rates on outstanding debt. Going forward, we expect the percentage growth net interest expense to moderate but remain low- to mid-teens through the balance of the year. 
The additional debt raised our debt-to-total capitalization ratio to 45.7% at the end of the second quarter compared to 43.2% last year. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 32.2%. We expect the effective tax rate in fiscal 2012 to be at the lower end of our range of 33.5% to 34.5%, although we may see quarterly fluctuations. Our effective tax rate may be impacted by a number of factors including some [indiscernible] our assessment of certain tax contingencies, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations. 
Income from continuing operations attributable to Walmart was $3.8 billion, an increase of 5.7% over the last year. During the second quarter, the company repurchased $1.4 billion of shares, representing approximately 26.1 million shares which brings the year-to-date repurchase to $3.5 billion or 65.4 million shares. In June, the board approved a new $15 billion repurchase authorization, which has $14.1 billion remaining. In addition to the share purchases, Walmart returned to shareholders $1.3 billion in dividends during the quarter and $2.5 billion year-to-date. So in summary, Walmart returned $2.7 billion to shareholders [indiscernible] dividends [indiscernible] share purchase during the second quarter with $6.1 billion year-to-date. 
Consolidated inventory grew 11.1% compared to last year. Walmart International was [indiscernible] out to the increase primarily driven by currency devaluation, acquisitions and significant international growth. [indiscernible] as a percentage of inventories were 90% versus 98% in the prior year. As [indiscernible] percent receive a benefit from the payment cycles, which resulted in higher-than-normal payables balance. Capital expenditures were approximately $3.3 billion for the second quarter compared to $3 billion in the prior year. We added growth conversely in every country with 176 net new units, excluding acquisitions of which 113 units were opened in Mexico. 
Free cash flow remained strong. At the end of the quarter with a positive free cash flow of $4 billion compared to $4.5 billion last year. As I mentioned earlier, the increase in accounts payables from timing of payment cycles and hands free cash flow last year. 
Turning on investment or ROI for the trailing 12 months ended July 31, 2011, was 18.4% compared to 19% for the prior year. Majority of the decline in ROI is attributable to acquisitions in currency. We are always aware that acquisitions like Netto and Massmart have a short-term impact on [indiscernible] impact on ROI. On the other hand, these acquisitions had 462 new units and 18 [indiscernible] feet this quarter. 
Now we'll turn to our operating segments. We'll start with Walmart U.S. Bill?"

The goal of Walmart U.S. remains clear, deliver positive comps by year end and our plan is straightforward and is also working. We're expanding our assortment of merchandise back with Walmart's everyday low-price promise. Customers response is reflected in the improved results that we saw in the second quarter. Walmart U.S. gained sales momentum throughout the quarter after a difficult May, which was impacted by high prices of the gas pump and severe spring weather, a sales trend improved in June and again in July. In fact, our July 454 comp was positive and we improved both customer traffic and ticket as the quarter progressed. 
Net sales rose approximately 40 basis points to $64.9 billion for the second quarter. Comp sales for the 13-week period ending July 29 was inside our guidance at negative 0.9% and the best quarterly comp performance in almost 2 years. It was positive every month of the quarter, traffic which drove more than half of the comp improved sequentially [indiscernible] month. Better traffic was driven in part by the 90-day rollback program at the gas pump. This program, which is available in 18 states saves customer $0.10 a gallon on gas and diesel when used with reloadable Walmart gift card and credit card. 
Grocery and health and wellness, which represents 2/3 of our sales revenue, continue to deliver positive comps. We also saw trend improvements in all our other businesses, except entertainment. This improvement is attributable to our focus on expanding merchandise assortment, price leadership and increase stock levels. Weather trends across the country later in the quarter also helped. 
The economy remains challenging for our core customers. Customers are still consolidating trips due to higher year-over-year gas prices. Swing in sales due to paycheck cycles remain pronounced and our stores must staff and stock to the volatility both up-and-down. We have also seen an increase in the number of customers relying on government assistance for food and necessities for their families. Grocery business continued its positive trend [indiscernible] low-single digit positive comps for the period. Food remains a key traffic driver to our stores. Strong performance during the July 4 weekend offsets softness in the Memorial Day weekend. 
Sales across the dry grocery continue to accelerate from additional assortment. Sales of consumables also improved over the first quarter. We continue to see strength in our new modular programs that are bringing back assortment and had strong seasonal performance in pet and beauty, both of which delivered [indiscernible] basis points comp improvement in the triple digit versus the first quarter. While we saw an increase in grocery inflation of approximately 3.5% during the quarter, customers remain under continued pressure and are trading down to lower-priced points and smaller pack sizes as well as opting out a discretionary purchases. As a result, we're seeing minimal past-through of inflation to sales. 
Food inflation has replaced gasoline price as the most important household expense [indiscernible]. In addition, more than 15% of Walmart moms at our monthly survey have experienced a loss of household wage earners job in the last year. Almost 40% of these Walmart moms indicate they're holding off or eliminating items they would normally buy, reinforcing the key for us to drive everyday low-price. Moms of all income levels showed a drop in confidence over the last year, with middle-income moms showing the greatest drop. Our health and wellness business again delivered low single-digit positive comp driven by the strength of our prescription business. Continue to benefit from the additional traffic in our pharmacies as a result of the Humana program and our optical business benefited from [indiscernible] of the $29 back-to-school eyewear offering. We expect the momentum to continue in the third quarter as more parents get their children ready for school. 
[indiscernible] markets posted positive comps for 15 consecutive months now, delivering a comp of over 3% for the second quarter. This format reflects the ongoing strength of our food, health and wellness business. Overall, apparel comps declined in the mid-single digits during the second quarter, which includes approximately 300 basis points [indiscernible] in the first quarter. This performance was driven by ongoing business initiatives, especially in our basic apparel offering, an improvement in sales of summer merchandise tied to the warm whether. Men's, ladies and our baby apparel delivered the best comps for the period. Our children's apparel, shoes and intimate department remains [indiscernible]. We're well-positioned to gain sales and share for the important back-to-school season. We're expanding on offerings in important categories to regain customers and we're adding back items in key brands. We're confident through the back half of the year will see ongoing improvement in apparel sales. 
Comp sales for home declined [indiscernible] single digits is quarter. We remain committed to strengthening this important category. Better weather versus the first quarter drove customers to our Outdoor Living department and we're ready given our [indiscernible] across the category. Private [indiscernible] have been a trade-off in indoor living categories, customers are opting [indiscernible] for their homes or are trading down. 
Entertainment had high-single digits negative comp sales for the quarter. As others have reported, media and gaming continue to experience significant headwinds. New movie releases from last year were also a headwind. However, customers do shop for value and our $5 movie bin continues to [indiscernible]. Double-digit deflation in TV prices still exists, but our unit sales were up [indiscernible]. Customers want innovation and [indiscernible] and continue to sell very well. Continue to see strength in our prepaid wireless business, although we [indiscernible] recorded this as a net commission in our comp sales as opposed to its full [indiscernible] value. Straight Talk remains a billion dollars dollar plus brand for Walmart U.S. And in toys, we gain momentum as the quarter progressed. Sales of licensed toys [indiscernible] with new movie releases and seasonal items including pools, water toys and bikes improved significantly. 
Hardlines had low single-digit negative comp sales but improved over the first quarter. Favorable weather drove sales across sporting goods, especially hunting, fishing and camping and air movement-related products. New modulars and stationary and crafts help push items in these categories. Tires sales continue to do well for automotive. 
We've spoke often about multichannel retailing, allowing customers to shop on their own terms. We're now moving toward a strategy called continuous channel shopping, recognizing the continued integration of customers using web-based devices to shop our stores and to research and shop online as well. Today, roughly 60% of Walmart.com sales involve the stores through services such as Site to Store and pick up today. In fact, some of our highest volume Site to Store sales, come out of large metropolitan areas such as New York City and the San Francisco Bay Area. 
During second quarter, we also launched the delivery and installation service program for electronics. We're providing delivery setup and installation for TVs. We also offer basic setup for home theater and wireless networks. The in-home service network has up to 50,000 technicians available who service our customers. Our prices are very competitive and this has now puts us on par with other electronics retailers. 
Now I'll cover the remaining financial results. Our gross profit dollars were up 1.2% over last year second quarter, growing faster than the rate of sales. We lap last year's deep rollback program in the second quarter, which we expected to impact our rate comparison this quarter. Additionally, our logistics team continues to drive routing and load efficiencies, allowing us to minimize the majority of the headwinds associated with rising diesel prices impacting the cost of goods. In fact, rising diesel costs were a headwind, 2/3 of which were mitigated by these transportation initiatives. 
SG&A was up approximately 70 basis points compared to last year, slightly higher payroll-related expenses, management incentive plan accruals, as well as the storm-related damage Jeff mentioned earlier were the primary drivers for the increase in SG&A. These increases were partially offset by lower advertising spend versus last year and a reduction in our accident costs related to store operations. Operating income grew faster than sales for the quarter. Operating income rose 2.1% over last year to almost $5 billion. 
Inventory was up 4.8% compared to this time last year, which on a year-over-year quarter comparable is 150 basis points lower than what I reported last quarter. Productivity gains offset inventory growth that was primarily driven by inflation, new stores and assortment add-back initiatives I mentioned. In short, inventories moving back in line with where we'd like it to be. We're focused on growing our business also through new stores and our priority remains supercenter growth. We added 18 supercenters this quarter, including new and converted stores. We're very pleased with the opening of the first 4 Walmart express units and the initial results are positive. Let me remind you, these are still pilot stores and we're testing different formats. 
Our Neighborhood Market format is delivering a return at the same level as our supercenters, which have the best ROI in the company. These results have encouraged us to move faster on expanding our gross reformat. Our multiyear development pipeline has approved 180 Neighborhood Markets to our real estate committee and we'll announce more details on this growth plans in October. 
We're moving forward with our remodel plan that we discussed last quarter. In addition to reducing the cost of remodels, we expect faster completions and significantly less customer disruption. In July, we entered into an agreement with the Neilsen Company to share our point of sales data, which will provide deeper insights in customer purchasing and unmet needs, both nationally and in key local markets. The data will cover grocery, including food, consumables and health and wellness categories, except for prescription. 
This agreement will better equip our merchant to evaluate their business and optimize assortment, pricing and promotion. It will enable our store operators to react and quickly make changes in their local stores. And the data analysis puts us in a better position to identify category opportunities in the U.S. and collaborate with suppliers to develop customer-driven programs. 
Based on the start of August sales, we're confident that our plans are working and we'll see ongoing self-improvement. Expect comp sales for the 13-week period from July 30 through October 28 to be between minus 1% and plus 1%. Last year's third quarter 13-week comp was negative 1.3%. The timing of our calendar ending on Friday means a large portion of the Halloween sales could fall into the fourth quarter period. We still remain concerned about the increased economic pressure on our customers and the uncertain impact it will have on their shopping behavior. With the ongoing economic volatility, it's important as ever to deliver on our one-stop shopping promise, a broad assortment of merchandise backed with everyday low-price. 
We remain committed to the productivity loop and our goal of leveraging operating expense. We will continue to invest in price to help our customers weather the economy to a gross profit should be flat to slightly down for the third quarter. 
Now, I'll turn it over to Doug for the international update."

During our briefing following our Shareholder Meeting on June 3, I laid out our key initiatives for leveraging our scale and expertise in the Walmart International markets. They included: making progress on EDLP as a global pricing philosophy, enhancing the productivity loop to get cost down, further developing global talent and sharing ideas back-and-forth with the U.S. businesses, both Walmart and Sam's Club. It's only been a couple of months since then and I'm happy to report that we have already made progress on each of these areas. I'm also proud to share some important milestones that Walmart International achieved in the second quarter. As you know, as the completed its acquisition of 147 Netto stores in the U.K., as is always converted more than 60 of these stores which now have more than 4x the number of products than previously offered. This means customers can find what they need for the entire week just as they do in as the superstores. 
In addition, we completed our 51% acquisition of Massmart. Massmart is a leading general merchandise retailer and basic food wholesaler in sub-Saharan Africa and the second largest in consumer goods. As you heard, we will include the results from our countries in Africa in our third fiscal quarter. In terms of sharing ideas back and forth, South African suppliers offer an important opportunity for us to bring new and exciting merchandise to our other markets. Recently, we contracted with Ocean Fresh, a South African seafood supplier to export sustainably sourced wild hack of fish to our stores in the United States. This is helping to create 100 jobs in South African and we believe this is the first indicator of even more opportunities on the continent. To recognize our new partnership with our customers in sub-Saharan Africa, we have launched our working together to save you money campaign, offering price reductions in Massmart stores for an extended period of time. 
Now let's get to the numbers. Walmart International reported second quarter net sales of $30.1 billion an increase of 16.2% over last year. Changes in currency rates increased our net sales by $2.3 billion. As a reminder, our markets benefited this fiscal quarter from Easter sales and in the United Kingdom, the royal wedding. Last year, second quarter results benefited from sales related to the World Cup. So in some cases, there were difficult comp sales comparisons. 
On a constant currency basis, net sales were $27.8 billion, an increase of 7.1% over last year second quarter, all of our markets had constant currency sales growth, except in Japan where sales were affected by the March 2011 natural disasters.  Mexico, the U.K., Canada, Brazil and China provided the strongest net sales growth in the second quarter. As a percentage of sales, Walmart International second quarter constant currency gross profit margin and other income was flat to last year. Second quarter reported operating expenses were $6 billion, which includes an increase of $500 million due to changes in currency exchange rates. Although Japan, Brazil, the U.K. and Chile have expense leverage in the second quarter, Walmart International's constant currency operating expenses grew faster than sales at 9.4%. 
Our second quarter reported operating income grew 8.9% from last year to $1.4 billion, and this includes a benefit of $110 million from changes in currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, operating income grew 50 basis points. Excluding the $53 million and charges that Jeff mentioned and the $14 million impact on cost associated with the integration of Netto, Walmart International grew constant currency operating income 5.6%. Inventory management continues to be a challenge as days on hand increase over last year in most of our markets. Our constant currency inventory, excluding Massmart, grew 11.1% as we added a significant number of stores in most of our markets. 
Now let's get into the results for several of our larger markets. Country management teams are held accountable for their results on a constant currency basis. The following discussion of country results excludes the impact of currency and unless otherwise stated, sales and comp sales are presented on a nominal basis. Comps sales are reported on a calendar basis. We'll kick off this quarter with the U.K. As we had a solid second quarter, growing sales excluding fuel ahead of last year, however, operating income declined due to $31 million of costs related to Netto. Adjusting for fuel sales and Netto as they grew operating income faster than sales. 
In the second quarter of this year, comparable sales, excluding fuel, increased 50 basis points. Traffic decreased by 120 basis points and average ticket increased 170 basis points. Customers are consolidating their trips in the face of high fuel prices. As to growth expenses lower than sales in the second quarter, leveraging on tight expense management after excluding the Netto cost as is expenses declined from last year. Is it continues to gain recognition for saving people money everyday, supported by the 10% online price guarantee and now more than 250,000 baskets are being checked online by customers each week. As a clear statement to the quality our customers can find, as this private and other products have won more than 300 awards so far this year, including retail champion in the international cheese awards, meat and fish retailer of the year and numerous other wine awards. 
In June, as it was recognized as the price leader by the Grocer magazine as the lowest priced supermarket for the 14th year running. So it was no surprise that they were long lines of customers on grand opening day at our converted Netto stores. In these stores, customers will receive the same as to low prices, the 10% price guarantee and in-store pickup from online shopping. 
Including the stores from the Netto acquisition, as ASDA's total store count was 536 at the end of the second quarter. Economic indicators suggest that 2011 will remain a challenging year for our U.K. consumers and we're confident that ASDA and its Netto store conversions are entering the second half of the year with good momentum, delivering availability and Every Day Low Prices. 
Finally, Judith MacKenna, who spent several years as ASDA's Chief Financial Officer has been promoted to Chief Operating Officer. Judith has a long track record of success and we look forward to her experience in ASDA's operations. Congratulations, Judith. 
Let's move to the Americas. In previous earnings discussions, I discussed only the results of Mexico and Central America separately in this section. Not Now that one year's passed since our Central American operations have been combined into Walmex, we will discuss results of the consolidated company going forward. While the following results are in the U.S. GAAP basis, Walmex separately reports its earnings under Mexican GAAP. So some numbers are different from the Walmex reported results. Overall, Walmex sales grew at a fast rate, but operating income declined from last year second quarter due to the noncash accounting charge mentioned earlier by Jeff. As we mentioned last quarter, our operations in Mexico went live with the SAP implementation during Q2. This effort increased the level of precision for inventory valuation and the result was a noncash accounting charge of $17 million. Walmex consolidated net sales for the second quarter were up 9.1%, comparable sales from Mexico were up 1.1%, average ticket in Mexico increased 2.2% and customer traffic declined 1.1%. Comp stores in Central America were up 6.2% on a constant currency basis. 
As Walmex noted in its earnings call on July 19, our teams continue to strengthen its EDLP position in Mexico and we've converted to EDLP in each of our 5 Central American countries, making permanent price reductions in more than 12,000 items. We've also converted all of our Central American supercenters to the Walmart brand. 
Mexico's second quarter consolidated comp store sales for the self-service formats grew by 1.9%, while ANTAD comp store sales report for the rest of the industry, exuding Walmart, grew faster at 2.2%. In the second quarter, Walmex advanced its investment schedule for new stores and logistics modernization and opened 129 stores in this quarter as compared to 57 in the second quarter of last year. An aggressive, but steady rate of new store openings is part of the new store growth plan. And Walmex has achieved 45% of plan floor expansion to date. We will begin to see the sales from these new stores in our third fiscal quarter as the majority were opened at the end of June. 
Second quarter gross margin as a percentage of sales was flat to last year. Walmex's consolidated second quarter operating income declined 5.3% from last year and decreased 2.2% from last year after excluding the noncash inventory charge. Walmex's expenses grew faster than sales at 14.1% from last year, primarily due to the new stores. With 394 more stores than at the end of the second quarter of last year, Walmex is well-positioned for the rest of the year. 
Moving on to Brazil. Net sales grew in the second quarter, however, operating income declined from last year. As part of our progress in implementing EDLP as a global pricing philosophy, Brazil began its EDLP conversion earlier this year. The number of items converted to date represents a large portion of Brazil's overall sales. Brazil's second quarter net sales grew and comparable sales grew from last year. Average ticket increased 7.4% and customer traffic declined 4.6%. We believe that the investments in EDLP is right for our ultimate success in the marketplace and more important, best for our customers. 
Second quarter gross profit margin and expenses both as a percentage of sales declined slightly from last year. So in terms of enhancing the productivity loop, Brazil is making progress. Brazil has a long history of sustainability initiatives and this is an area where Walmart can make a big difference and contribute savings from the company and our customers as well. Walmart Brazil is partnered with 13 of the largest multinational suppliers to review end-to-end sustainability and reduce our impact on the environment. 
In the past 12 months, we have opened 42 net new stores in Brazil, bringing our total store count to 487. This includes 7 new stores in the second quarter of this year. And for Canada, Walmart Canada had solid sales growth in the second quarter of this year with operating income growing faster than sales. Net sales grew 5% in the second quarter compared to last year, primarily due to the supercenter expansion program and strong sales in many merchandise categories. Second quarter comparable sales increased 1.2% from last year, average ticket increased 2.1% for the second quarter and traffic declined 0.9% for comparable stores. 
Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased 62 basis points from last year. Canada's merchants continues to be very focused on inventory management. Expenses as a percentage of sales increased only 31 basis points from last year, primarily from the increase in costs from growing Walmart Canada bank. Walmart Canada has been successful in managing its expenses by placing a significant focus on enhancing supercenter productivity. And this contributed to the 10% increase in operating income from last year. Canada's supercenter presence continues to grow at a faster rate. In addition to 9 store expansions and 9 in-box conversions this year, we expect to open about 40 new supercenters this year. Currently, just over 8 million customers a week visit our Canadian stores. Our goal is to have customer shop the entire store and we're working on further strengthening all of our merchandise categories. In the past 12 months, we opened 10 new stores in Canada, bringing our store count to 329 stores. 
Moving to Asia, Japan's constant currency sales declined in the second fiscal quarter, but operating income grew when compared to last year. Japan's second quarter results include the effects of the March 2011 natural disasters, which continue to affect the entire country in many ways such as brownouts, food shortages and contamination fears. 3 of our stores in Japan have yet to reopen. According to statistics released by the Japanese Ministry of the Economy Trade and Industry, or METI, overall supermarket comparable sales for the second quarter declined by 1.7% from last year. When comparing our performance to these METI's results, our comp performance continues to stay ahead of other large-scale retailers in Japan. 
Second quarter net sales declined 1.6% from last year and comparable sales declined 28 basis points, both in real terms. Walmart Japan's traffic declined 23 basis points last year and the average ticket in real terms declined 5 basis points. Walmart Japan has recently announced permanent EDLP reductions on 1,000 items that [indiscernible] customers needed the most. Sales and general merchandise had the strongest performance as customers prepare for energy shortages and restrictions. Sales of televisions were higher than normal as the exploration of analog television signals nears. 
Gross profit margin as a percentage of sales were flat to last year and Japan leveraged expenses even in these trying times. Expenses as a percentage of sales declined 49 basis point from last year. Steve Dacas, who is serving as Chief Operating Officer was promoted to CEO of Walmart Japan in June. His extensive experience in Japanese retail, combined with his time in our Sam's operations in the U.S. position him very well to lead our team. Congratulations, Steve. 
While Walmart China sales continue to grow in the second quarter, the sales growth was not enough to offset the increased in expenses. As a result, China had a small loss from operations. Net sales for the second quarter grew 9.7% over last year and comparable store growth was 1.8%. Average ticket grew 10% in China but traffic declined 8.2%. The primary traffic decline was in our [indiscernible] Stores. In April, we obtained antitrust clearance to purchase the remaining interest in trust Mart. We began the rebranding of our Trust-Mart stores this year, which provides us the first opportunity to communicate the new types of merchandise already being offered in our Trust-Mart stores. Expenses as a percentage of sales, grew 244 basis ponts, increasing from last year as result of additional government levies and new store growth. Second quarter gross margin increased to 103 basis points over last year as our Trust-Mart stores can now take advantage of leverage opportunities from our Walmart stores. 
In the past 12 months, we opened 53 new stores including 48 supercenters and that brings our China store count to 344 stores. I'd like to congratulate Sean Clarke on his promotion to Chief Operating Officer of Walmart China. Sean has spent several years as the Chief Financial Officer in Canada and we look forward to leveraging his experience into our Chinese operations. 
In closing, all of our markets are focused on our key goals of delivering growth, leverage and returns with organic growth of 24 million square feet since the second quarter of last year and an acquisition of an additional 18.4 million square feet in the second quarter this year, we are well-positioned to drive growth for the balance of the year. 
Now I'll turn it over to Brian for the news on Sam's Club. Brian?"

I am very pleased to give the Sam's Club today. We had an outstanding second quarter. Sam's Club posted its sixth quarter of sequential improvement, as comp club sales, excluding fuel, increase, increased 5% at the top of our range. We have the best momentum in membership we've seen in years, driven by strong renewals and growth in the members joining at the plus level. Not only do we leverage expenses, but we also grew operating profit without fuel by 13.3%, much faster than the growth in sales. Similar to first quarter, our fuel business was strong during the quarter. We're pumping more gallons of fuel and generating more sales dollars per gallon this year versus last year. Fuel prices in this year second quarter are approximately 43% higher than a year ago and gallons sold are up 16%. Fuel price is an important first price impression for our members, reminding them the value of their membership. 
Including fuel, second quarter net sales were $13.6 billion, a 9.5% increase over last year and operating income increased 50% to $492 million. Volatility and fuel prices can have a notable impact on our financial results. Our discussion today therefore is focused on our core business and excludes fuel for comparative purposes, unless otherwise noted. 
Now let's look at the financial results and our achievements for the quarter. Net sales for the second quarter were $12 billion, up 4.9% from last year. Comp club sales for the 13-week period increased 5% and we're strong across all 3 geographic operating divisions. We are particularly pleased with the sales strength of our Western division, which includes 22 states located in the Western U.S. Recall that we have 3 divisions in Sam's Club, each headed by a seasoned SVP. Comp traffic and ticket increased for the 13-week period by 2.6 and 2.4 percentage points, respectively. Our traffic and ticket increased for both advantage and business members. 
The quality of our sales growth in our core categories was very strong, despite the over 100 basis points headwind we have in the Tobacco sales. We continue to face challenges in Tobacco sales. The industry is softer than last year. In addition, since we've changed the credit card rewards program, there's a greater impact on members who shop this category heavily. We anticipate Tobacco being a headwind for the rest of the year. We continue to focus on categories our members tell us are most important to them such as fresh and health and wellness to optimize our growth. We also want to be the price leader in everyday needs items. This is contributing to strong ticket and traffic performance despite inflation pressure. Our fresh business delivered high single-digit comps for the quarter led by bakery, produce, meats, and home meal solutions. These results are driven by high-quality standards we have in place. 
Dry grocery and beverage comps were in the mid-single digits. In beverages, hot weather categories such as soda and sports drinks performed very well. Comps for our health and wellness area were in the mid-single digits. Sam's [indiscernible] are driving traffic and pharmacies script growth. 
Despite the challenging economy, we continue to see good results in discretionary areas, including home and apparel, driven by very strong sales in men's, children's and basic areas, apparel achieved a double-digit comp increase this quarter. Our homeland area achieved a high-single digits comp as kitchen electrics, housewares and domestics were all strong. Even with average selling price deflation, our consumer electronics business delivered a mid-single-digit comp sales increase. New products like tablets are driving greater sales in electronics. 
Overall, we believe that inflation impacts are comp sales by 200 to 250 basis points. We continue to see mid-single-digit inflation in key food categories. However, we have managed through these price increases with little impact on margin. Despite the impact of inflation, we continue to see growth in units sold year-over-year. We continue to deliver on our commitment to quality and value, especially with our proprietary brands. These initiatives are important in giving our members choices. Here are a few highlights. Since the beginning of the year, we have introduced 3 new brands, [indiscernible] and fresh, deli and bakery, simply right and baby and health and beauty aids and daily chef and frozen foods and refrigerated products. These new brands represent close to 100 items this month, with plans to roll out 400 more by the end of Q1 next year. Early sales and number feedback are overwhelmingly positive with results at or above expectations in all 3 brands. Our regional management structure and improved training program continue to help our operations team focused on winning the weekend. This focused on weekend performers has yield a positive results and we are pleased with our weekend traffic and comp sales results. Our most recent member satisfaction survey results tell us that our members think we're on the right track. The survey showed improvement across all metrics, with strong improvement in overall member satisfaction. Our July 4 eValue savings celebration, which gave all our member eValues program performed well. Compared to both last year's performance and the preevent period, the savings grew a higher percentage of member pricing, higher sales per member and an increase in members upgrading to plus membership. Additionally, baskets that include eValues items at a higher value than those without an eValues items. 
Membership and other income was down 11 basis points as a percentage of sales when compared to the second quarter last year. It's important to explain what's driving this reduction in other income. Previously, we rented space to a third party for a portion of our wireless business. We are now running this business with Sam's Club associates. This means we no longer receive rental income from third party as we have in prior years. The sale and expenses of our wireless business are now included directly in our operating results. While we are just a few months into the change, we're encouraged by the early results. Wireless sales performance in the back half of the quarter was better than expected and we anticipate the overall of this change to be positive to our operating results. 
Membership income for the second quarter increased 1.2% versus last year. We continue to see a trend from the past several quarters of improving net membership results. Growth in membership income on a cash basis was strong. Renewals are increasing the rate that has exceeded our expectations and outpaced last year's performance. Our penetration of plus members continues to grow at a healthy pace. 
We have seen new sign of growth overall even at small business members continue to struggle in this economy. Our proprietary [indiscernible] program continue to be well received by our members, driven by in-club marketing initiatives and an overall bounce back in the utilization of credit. We find that among members who use their Sam's Club credit product, overall engagement and retention is higher. For the third quarter, we anticipate continued positive momentum in membership. Gross margin rate increased by 9 basis points compared second quarter last year, while gross profit dollars increased 5.6%. 
As I mentioned earlier, we are experiencing inflation in several categories and we are managing this impact across the business. We believe that inflation will continue to be pressure point for the remainder of the year. 
I am very pleased with how our clubs manage expenses during the quarter, driven by strong wage cost control, we reduced expenses as a percentage of sales by 32 basis points. You may recall that last year in this call we discussed the impact of higher interchange fees related to the Sam's rewards credit program. I'm happy to say that even when this expense is excluded in last year's comparison, we leverage expenses by 14 basis points. For the quarter, sales per labor hour increased 1.9% and units per labor hour increased 69 basis points. 
Looking at the bottom line, our second quarter operating income without fuel increased to $467 million, a 13.3% increase over second quarter last year. At the end of the second quarter, inventory, including fuel inventory, was up 5.5% compared to last year. Overall, we are pleased with inventory levels in our clubs and distribution centers. Our inventory increase is primarily due to inflation and to a lesser extent a change in the seasonal transition of holiday merchandise. 
Looking ahead, our sales momentum remains strong. Our growth rates were strong in the back half for the second quarter and as we enter the first few weeks of the third quarter, our momentum has continued. It's important to remember that it was in the third quarter last year that our comp performance began to accelerate so our comparison for the back half will be more challenging. We expect comp club sales without fuel for the 13-week period from July 30 through October 28 to increase 3% to 5%. Last year, Sam's club sales excluding fuel increased 2.4% for the comparable 13-week period. 
Now, I will turn the program over to Charles for a wrap up in guidance. Charles?"

As Mike said, we continue to be very focused on our financial priorities of growth, leverage and returns. I'm really proud of the way we continued to improve throughout the quarter despite the fragile global economy, which is obviously affecting consumers. I also want to note that Walmart's balance sheet and capacity continue to be an advantage, especially during the market volatility we have seen recently. Our ability to access short and long-term funding has never been better. This is a result of a strong Walmart business model. We still have many opportunities to improve around the world. In the second quarter, we had solid sales growth in international and Sam's and we're progressing in Walmart U.S. We still have much work to do to drive top line growth and we believe we are focused on the right initiatives. Despite the slowdown in the global economy, we continue to find very good growth opportunities for new stores across our global operations. We added 638 net units, 315 units for Massmart, 147 units from Netto and 176 units through organic growth. Regarding acquisitions, we remain very thoughtful in acquiring new operations. Our focus will continue to be investing in companies that can deliver value to our customers and shareholders. 
Turning to leverage, our committee to productivity and cost containment remains high. Although we were flat on this metric on a reported basis, I remain encouraged with our expense management. The underlying SG&A rose less than the rate of sales when you exclude FX losses and acquisition-related costs. Bear in mind that our efforts are not just simply focused on [indiscernible] expenses but on the blend of expense management and technology leveraged to improve productivity. I want to point out that productivity improvements also help our associates serve our customers and members better and improve our cost structure. If we can save 1 or 2 seconds in every cash transaction around the world, the savings can truly add up. 
As an example of a productivity initiatives in our Walmart U.S. stores, we have implemented more one-touch freight, which optimizes [indiscernible] prior to arrival at the store. We're collaborating with suppliers to look at the entire supply chain as if it were vertically integrated to take unnecessary costs out of the system. We are also leveraging technology to enhance our workflow to make the work date more efficient for our store associates. 
As you have heard from our us before, we know that strengthening price leadership starts with being the low cost provider. As we continue to lower our costs, we will also be investing in price, helping our customers save money so they can live better. We will be relentless in widening the price gap as Mike says, to pass setting along to our customers around the world? We believe that EDLP will lead to top line growth as customer traffic improves. 
And last, our priority of returns. On a rolling 12-month basis ending July 31, 2011, return on investment or ROI ended at 18.4%. ROI was impacted negatively by the acquisition in currently. It's important to note that our underlying operations remains solid. 
As you know, our company remains committed to share repurchase. We announced a new $15 billion share repurchase authorization on June 3 at our annual shareholders meeting. Given our acquisition activity in the second quarter, we have less money dedicated to share repurchase. The combination of our annual dividend and share repurchase program indicates the strength of our company and our continued commitment to returning value to Walmart's shareholders. Our investment in SAP throughout the company is ongoing and it's designed to increase the consistency of our processes throughout the organization. While the majority of our businesses have converted or are underway, the effects of the conversion will continue until next year. The financial effect should be minimal. 
Now let's move on to guidance. Based on how we view our business relative to the economy and sales environment in the United States and throughout the world, we expect third quarter 2012 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $0.95 and $1 which compares to last year's third quarter earnings per share of $0.95. Last year's third quarter included $0.05 per share of tax benefits. We are narrowing the range of our full year earnings per share guidance and increasing it by $0.01. We now expect our full year earnings per share guidance to range between $4.41 and $4.51 versus our previously stated range of $4.35 to $4.50. All of the above EPS guidance assumes currency exchange rates remain at current levels. 
As I close, I'd like to summarize a few key points from today's call. First, our second quarter earnings per share of $1.09 is solidly within our guidance. Looking ahead, and we are raising our full year EPS guidance. We continue to manage our business well despite a very tough global economy. Net sales increased 5.5% with contributions from all 3 operating segments. We are still on track to deliver our yearly sales growth target of 4% to 6%. We will use the productivity loop to deliver on our EDLC, EDLP model and are committed to leveraging expenses for the full year. Walmart has a very strong balance sheet that we believe is an important advantage as the global markets remain volatile. Last, we remain committed to delivering shareholder returns through a combination of share repurchase and dividends as we did in the second quarter. 
Thank you for your continued interest in Walmart and we look forward to seeing you in October for our investor meeting."

Thanks for joining us today for our earnings call to review the second quarter of fiscal year 2012. All information for this quarter, including our unit count, square feet and financial metrics is available on our website at walmartstores.com/investors. A full transcript of this call will be available on the website after 7:00 a.m. Central Time today on August 16, 2011. 
Mike Duke, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. will open the call with his thoughts and key highlights of the quarter. Jeff Davis, SVP of Finance and Treasurer, will cover the consolidated financial details, including information on certain items affecting our EPS. Then we'll go to the operating segments. Bill Simon, President and CEO of Walmart U.S. will begin our segment discussions. Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Walmart International, will follow Bill. Please note in his call, the clarifications on the impact of our acquisitions. We'll close the segment discussion with Brian Cornell, President and CEO of Sam's Club. And our CFO, Charles Holley, will wrap up with our financial report card and guidance. 
Before we discuss our second quarter performance, we do have a couple of reminders. You'll note in our press release that we have certain items affecting EPS this quarter, and Jeff will cover these shortly. As you know, we closed on the acquisitions of the 147 Netto stores in the U.K. and our majority interest in Massmart during this quarter. The Netto stores are fully consolidated into our financials but do not include any results from Massmart. The balance sheet from Massmart is consolidated using their fiscal year end balance. Massmart continues to operate as a public company and close their fiscal year on June 26. Massmart will report its year-end results on Thursday, August 25. 
Many of you often ask about what's included in the non-controlling or as we used to call minority interest line. This line primarily relates to non-controlling ownership interests in Mexico, which includes Central America, as well as Chile, Trust-Mart in China, India and now Massmart. Beginning in the third quarter, we will consolidate Massmart's operations in our consolidated financials on a 1 month lag, consistent with most of our international operations. Finally, let me remind you that our fiscal calendars for international differ from that of our corporate time line. All of our international countries, with the exception of Canada, and their fiscal year on December 31, while our U.S. and Canada operations end on January 31. 
Now Mike, let's get started with our Q2 results. Mike?"
313055,129808251,159092,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 16, 2011",2011-08-16,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Carol. Good morning, everyone. Today, Walmart is reporting second quarter earnings per share of $1.09 from continuing operations, which is a 12.4% increase over last year and near the top of our guidance. Let's get right to the key results. Net sa",1114,"Thanks, Carol. Good morning, everyone. Today, Walmart is reporting second quarter earnings per share of $1.09 from continuing operations, which is a 12.4% increase over last year and near the top of our guidance. Let's get right to the key results. Net sales increased 5.5% to $108.6 billion. Total U.S. comp sales, without fuel, were flat for the 13-week period. Sam's Club comps, without fuel, were up 5%, right at the top of the guidance for the period, and Walmart U.S. delivered comp sales within guidance at negative 0.9%. International reported net sales of $30 billion, a strong 16.2% increase. We also grew internationally through 2 significant acquisitions. 
Consolidated operating income increased 3.1%. Walmart ended the quarter with free cash flow of $4 billion. For the quarter, the company returned $2.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Operating expenses in the second quarter grew at the same rate as sales. We remain committed to the productivity loop and the strong expense management throughout the Walmart organization. We have the right initiatives in place to leverage for the full year. 
Let's move to the highlights of the individual segments. I'm encouraged by the sales improvements in our Walmart U.S. stores. Comps have improved sequentially month-to-month within the quarter. In fact, this was the best quarterly performance since the third quarter of fiscal 2010. The goal of the Walmart U.S. team remains positive comp by year end. In the second quarter, Bill Simon and the Walmart U.S. team completed the assortment add back in grocery for food and consumables, resulting in better customer traffic on this side of the store. We're making progress in expanding our general merchandise assortment and seeing positive comps in some categories such as sporting goods, but we still have work to do, and the team is focused on implementing the plan. 
I've recently observed several consumer focus groups, and it's clear that many consumers are still struggling. They're trading down to stretch their budgets, buying a lower-priced brand of detergent, moving from branded canned goods to private label and purchasing half gallons of milk instead of gallons. That's why we are laser-focused on investing in price to help our customers. There certainly are many reports on Walmart pricing and the fact is, that the gap has narrowed in some cases. We're committed to widening the gap on price, and we have a specific plan and timetable to deliver EDLP to every customer. 
Walmart U.S. also managed the business well in the second quarter, growing operating profit faster than sales to nearly $5 billion. Walmart International has strong growth again through a combination of comp and new stores. Second quarter sales grew 16.2% with sales growth in all markets except Japan, which is still recovering from the natural disasters. The international segment is an increasingly important part of our growth story and operating income improved nearly 9% in the second quarter. 
I'm pleased that we closed on the acquisitions of Netto and Massmart. An integration is well underway in the U.K. and Africa. I'm excited about helping underserved customers in sub-Saharan Africa, and I'm also excited about the 15,000 jobs that we expect to create on the continent over the next 5 years. You'll hear more from Doug McMillon about the significant new store growth in Latin America this quarter led by Mexico. 
Every Day Low Price remains one of our strongest competitive advantages, and we continue to use this strategy in more of our international markets. We're transitioning to EDLP in Brazil and Central America. We recognize that it takes time to implement EDLP fully in a markets, but we believe this is right for our customers over the long term. 
Sam's Club continued its strong momentum in the second quarter, delivering a 5% comp without fuel. This is the sixth straight quarter of comp improvement for Sam's, a testament to the team's execution to drive quality, value and savings for members. I'm also pleased with the momentum in membership income as Sam's improves its renewals and upgrades. Sam's also delivered strong operating income, driven in part by very good fuel sales and Sam's leveraged operating expenses. The strategy to win the weekend that Brian Cornell and his team have in place will position Sam's Club well for the back half of the year. 
In the second quarter, our global e-commerce team stepped-up its work on delivering a continuous shopping experience to customers from the store to the web to their mobile devices. In mature markets, we're investing in multi-channel initiatives by integrating our stores with online services. We completed the rollout of Pick Up Today in all Walmart U.S. stores and within the last month, we announced that VUDU, our movie streaming technology, is now available on Walmart.com, as well as through iPad browser. 
Walmart's brand and scale, coupled with consumers' need for value, also gives us opportunities in some of the fastest growing markets in the world today. In June, we established Walmart's China e-commerce headquarters in Shanghai, and we put in place the leadership team to quickly build this business. We are investing in the right talent and technology to pursue the growth in e-commerce. I believe that Walmart is the best position retailer to serve the needs of the next-generation customers who are striving to join the emerging global middle class. They're connected to the world through smartphones and social media. They have higher expectations of value, quality and a better life. We will continue to advocate for policies that make sense for our customers and our business. 
In the U.S., we're pleased by the momentum around e-fairness legislation to eliminate the unfair advantage that online-only retailers currently have. Recently, we've seen the passage of laws in key states like California, Illinois and Texas, strong efforts from the small business community and a clearer call for reform from our nation's editorial pages. We're encouraged by the growing interest in a federal response to this issue as well. We will remain engaged in the debate in Washington. 
We've also called for modernizing our nation's corporate tax code. Last month, I testified before the U.S. Senate Finance Committee on reforming the tax code to drive job growth here at home and encourage America's competitiveness abroad. To achieve comprehensive reform, we've called for putting everything on the table including the existing incentives that benefit us. There are 3 key points that I emphasized to the committee: one, lower their corporate tax rate; two, get rid of existing incentives that benefit some industries over others; and three, level the international playing field with a territorial system. 
Now I'll turn it over to Jeff for the detailed financial report. Jeff?"
313055,129808251,159092,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 16, 2011",2011-08-16,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. For the second quarter of fiscal 2012, Walmart reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.09, which has been our guidance of $1.05 to $1.10. The $0.09 compares to $0.97 for the second quarter of last year. Income",935,"Thank you, Mike. For the second quarter of fiscal 2012, Walmart reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.09, which has been our guidance of $1.05 to $1.10. The $0.09 compares to $0.97 for the second quarter of last year. Income from continuing operations included certain pre-tax items as follows: we recorded an approximately $49 million mark-to-market loss on certain foreign currency derivative positions related to the Massmart acquisition, we realized cost of approximately $36 million related to acquisitions of Netto and Massmart, we recognized expenses of approximately $30 million related to the damages from tornadoes and floods in our United States operations. These items totaled $115 million and are included in our operating expenses. In addition, Walmart Mexico recorded an approximate $17 million revaluation charge from the implementation of the SAP financial system, which Doug will provide additional details later. The combination of these expense and gross margin items on EPS from continuing operations was approximately $0.03. 
Now let's move to the rest of the P&L. Consolidated net sales increased 5.5% or $5.6 billion to $108.6 billion for the quarter. The increase was driven primarily by Walmart International and Sam's Club and included a currency exchange benefit of $2.3 billion. Sales for Massmart were reported in our operating results starting in the third quarter.  Total U.S. comp sales, without fuel, for the 13-week period ended July 29, were flat and negative 20 basis points for the 26-week period. You will hear more details on the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club comp sales from Bill and Brian. 
For the quarter, gross margin on sales was 24.7%, a 10 basis point reduction compared to last year. Sam's Club fuel sales were the primary contributor to the margin decline. Unallocated corporate overhead and other, which includes our ongoing investment in global e-commerce increased approximately 21.8% to $509 million for the second quarter. Excluding the $49 million loss on mark-to-market foreign currency derivative positions I mentioned earlier and our global e-commerce initiatives, our core corporate overhead expenses increased 2.9%.
Consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of sales were flat to last year at 19.5%. Operating expenses grew at the same rate of sales or 5.5%. Excluding the items affecting operating expenses that I previously mentioned, the company leveraged operating expenses for the second quarter. To reiterate what Mike said, the company is committed to leveraging operating expenses for the full year, and we have focused expense management initiatives in place throughout the company. 
Consolidated operating income, which included $110 million currency benefit was $6.4 billion, a 3.1% increase versus last year. Net interest expense for the quarter increased 19.2% to $578 million. The increase in interest expense was a result of higher debt levels as we opportunistically issued new debt over the last 12 months at historically low rates. The higher debt levels were partially offset by lower rates on outstanding debt. Going forward, we expect the percentage growth and net interest expense to moderate, but remain in low- to mid-teens through the balance of the year. 
The additional debt raised our debt-to-total capitalization ratio to 45.7% at the end of the second quarter compared to 43.2% last year. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 32.2%. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 to be at the lower end of our range of 33.5% to 34.5%, although we may see quarterly fluctuations. Our effective tax rate may be impacted by a number of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations. 
Income from continuing operations attributable to Walmart was $3.8 billion, an increase of 5.7% over last year. During the second quarter, the company repurchased $1.4 billion of shares, representing approximately 26.1 million shares which brings the year-to-date repurchase to $3.5 billion or 65.4 million shares. In June, the board approved a new $15 billion repurchase authorization, which has $14.1 billion remaining. In addition to the share purchases, Walmart returned to shareholders $1.3 billion in dividends during the quarter and $2.5 billion year-to-date. So in summary, Walmart returned $2.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share purchase during the second quarter with $6.1 billion year-to-date. 
Consolidated inventory grew 11.1% compared to last year. Walmart International was the main contributor to the increase, primarily driven by currency evaluation, acquisitions and significant international growth. Payables as a percentage of inventories were 90% versus 98% in the prior year. Last year's percentage received a benefit from the timing of payment cycles, which resulted in a higher-than-normal payables balance. Capital expenditures were approximately $3.3 billion for the second quarter compared to $3 billion in the prior year. We added growth in virtually every country with 176 net new units, excluding acquisitions of which 113 units were opened in Mexico. 
Free cash flow remained strong. We ended the quarter with a positive free cash flow of $4 billion compared to $4.5 billion last year. As I mentioned earlier, the increase in accounts payables from timing of payment cycles and hands-free cash flow last year. 
Return on investment or ROI for the trailing 12 months ended July 31, 2011, was 18.4% compared to 19% for the prior year. The majority of the decline in ROI is attributable to acquisitions in currency. We are always aware that acquisitions like Netto and Massmart can have a short-term impact on company ROI. On the other hand, these acquisitions added 462 new units and 18.4 million square feet this quarter. 
Now we'll turn to our operating segments. We'll start with Walmart U.S. Bill?"
313055,129808251,159092,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 16, 2011",2011-08-16,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jeff. The goal at Walmart U.S. remains clear, deliver positive comps by year end, and our plan is straightforward, and it's also working. We're expanding our assortment of merchandise back with Walmart's Every Day Low Price promise. Our custome",1888,"Thank you, Jeff. The goal at Walmart U.S. remains clear, deliver positive comps by year end, and our plan is straightforward, and it's also working. We're expanding our assortment of merchandise back with Walmart's Every Day Low Price promise. Our customer response is reflected in the improved results we saw in the second quarter. Walmart U.S. gained sales momentum throughout the quarter after a difficult May, which was impacted by high prices at the gas pump and severe spring weather. Our sales trend improved in June and again in July. In fact, our July $454 million comp was positive, and we improved both customer traffic and ticket as the quarter progressed. 
Our net sales rose approximately 40 basis points to $64.9 billion for the second quarter. Comp sales for the 13-week period ending July 29 was inside our guidance at negative 0.9% and the best quarterly comp performance in almost 2 years. Ticket was positive every month of the quarter. Traffic, which drove more than half of the comp improved sequentially each month. Better traffic was driven in part by the 90-day rollback program at the gas pump. This program, which is available in 18 states saves customers $0.10 a gallon on gas and diesel when using a reloadable Walmart gift card or credit card. 
Grocery and health and wellness, which represent 2/3 of our sales revenue, continue to deliver positive comps. We also saw trend improvements in all other businesses except entertainment. This improvement is attributable to our focus on expanding merchandise assortment, price leadership and an increase in stock levels. Weather trends across the country later in the quarter also helped. 
The economy remains challenging for our core customers. Customers are still consolidating trips due to higher year-over-year gas prices. The swings in sales due to paycheck cycles remain pronounced, and our stores must staff and stock for the volatility both up-and-down. We also have seen an increase in the number of customers relying on government assistance for food and necessities for their family. Our grocery business continued its positive trend and again delivered low single-digit positive comps for the period. Food remains a key traffic driver to our stores. The strong performance during the July 4 weekend offsets softness in the Memorial Day weekend. 
Sales across the dry grocery continue to accelerate from additional assortment. Sales of consumables also improved over the first quarter. We continue to see strength in our new modular programs that are bringing back assortment and had strong seasonal performance in pets and beauty, both of which delivered basis points comp improvement in the triple digits versus the first quarter. While we saw an increase in grocery inflation of approximately 3.5% during the quarter, customers remain under continued pressure and are trading down to lower-priced points and smaller pack sizes, as well as opting out our discretionary purchases. As a result, we're seeing minimal pass-through of inflation to sales. 
Food inflation has replaced gasoline price as the most important household expense concern. In addition, more than 15% of Walmart moms at our monthly survey have experienced a loss of a household wage earner's job in the last year. Almost 40% of these Walmart moms indicate they're holding off or eliminating items they would normally buy, reinforcing the need for us to drive Every Day Low Price. Moms of all income levels showed a drop in confidence over the last year, with middle-income moms showing the greatest drop. And health and wellness business again delivered a low single-digit positive comp driven by the strength of our prescription business. We continue to benefit from the additional traffic in our pharmacies as a result of the Humana program and our optical business benefited from the kick-off of our $29 back-to-school eyewear offering. We expect the momentum to continue in the third quarter as more parents get their children ready for school. 
Neighbored markets posted positive comps for 15 consecutive months now, delivering a comp of over 3% for the second quarter. This format reflects the ongoing strength of our food and health and wellness business. Overall, apparel comps declined in the mid-single digits during the second quarter, which includes approximately 300 basis points improvement in the first quarter. This performance was driven by ongoing business initiatives, especially in our basic apparel offering, an improvement in sales of summer merchandise tied to the warm weather. Men's, ladies and our baby apparel delivered the best comps for the period. Our children's apparel, shoes, intimate departments remain soft. 
We are well-positioned to gain sales and share for the important back-to-school season. We are expanding our offerings in important categories to regain customers, and we're adding back items and key brands. We're confident that the back half of the year will see ongoing improvement in apparel sales. 
Comp sales for home declined in the mid-single digits for the quarter. We remain committed to strengthening this important category. Better weather versus the first quarter drove customers to our Outdoor Living department. We were ready given our expanded assortments and innovation across that categories. However, there appears to have been a trade-off in indoor living categories. Customers are opting out of decor items for their homes or they're trading down. 
Entertainment had high-single digit negative comp sales for the quarter. As others have reported, media and gaming continue to experience significant headwinds. New movie releases from last year were also a headwind. However, customers do shop for value and our $5 movie bin continues to do very well. Double-digit deflation in TV prices still exist, but our unit sales were up again. Customers want innovation and tablets continue to sell very well. We continued to see strength in our prepaid wireless business, although as you know, we record this as a net commission in our comp sales as opposed to its full transactional value. 
Straight Talk remains a billion dollar plus brand for Walmart U.S. Within in toys, we gain momentum as the quarter progressed. Sales of licensed toys associated with new movie releases and seasonal items including pools, water toys and bikes improved significantly. 
Hardlines had low single-digit negative comp sales but improved over the first quarter. Favorable weather drove sales across sporting goods, especially hunting, fishing and camping and air movement-related products. New modulars and stationary and crafts helped push items in these categories. Tires sales continue to do well for automotive. 
We spoken often about multi-channel retailing, allowing customers to shop on their own terms. We're now moving towards a strategy called continuous channel shopping, recognizing the continued integration of customers using web-based devices to shop our stores and to research and shop online as well. Today, roughly 60% of walmart.com sales involve the stores through services such as Site to Store and Pick Up Today. In fact, some of our highest volume Site to Store sales come out of large metropolitan areas such as New York City and the San Francisco Bay Area. 
During second quarter, we also launched the delivery and installation service program for electronics. We're providing delivery, setup and installation for TVs. We also offer basic setup for home theater and wireless networks. The in-home service network has up to 50,000 technicians available who'll service our customers. Our prices are very competitive and this now puts us on par with other electronics retailers. 
Now I'll cover the remaining financial results. Our gross profit dollars were up 1.2% over last year second quarter, growing faster than the rate of sales. We lapped last year's deep rollback program in the second quarter, which we expected to impact our rate comparison this quarter. Additionally, our logistics team continues to drive routing and load efficiencies, allowing us to minimize the majority of the headwinds associated with rising diesel prices impacting the cost of goods. In fact, rising diesel costs were a headwind, 2/3 of which were mitigated by these transportation initiatives. 
SG&A was up approximately 70 basis points compared to last year, slightly higher payroll-related expenses, management incentive plan accruals, as well as the storm-related damages Jeff mentioned earlier were the primary drivers for the increase in SG&A. These increases were partially offset by lower advertising spend versus last year and a reduction in our accident costs related to store operations. Operating income grew faster than sales for the quarter. Operating income rose 2.1% over last year to almost $5 billion. 
Inventory was up 4.8% compared to this time last year, which on a year-over-year quarter comparable is 150 basis points lower than what I reported last quarter. Productivity gains offset inventory growth that was primarily driven by inflation, new stores and assortment add-back initiatives I mentioned. In short, inventories moving back in line with where we'd like it to be. We're focused on growing our business also through new stores and our priority remains supercenter growth. We added 18 supercenters this quarter, including new and converted stores. We're very pleased with the opening of the first 4 Walmart Express units and the initial results are positive. Let me remind you, these are still pilot stores, and we're testing different formats. 
Our Neighborhood Market format is delivering a return at the same level as our supercenters, which have the best ROI in the company. These results have encouraged us to move faster on expanding our grocery format. Our multi-year development pipeline has approved 180 Neighborhood Markets to our real estate committee, and we'll announce more details on this growth plans in October. 
We're moving forward with our remodel plan that we discussed last quarter. In addition to reducing the costs of remodels, we expect faster completions and significantly less customer disruption. In July, we entered into an agreement with the Nielsen company to share our point of sales data, which will provide deeper insights in the customer purchasing and unmet needs, both nationally and in key local markets. The data will cover grocery including food, consumables and health and wellness categories, except for prescriptions.
This agreement will better equip our merchant to evaluate their business and optimize assortment, pricing and promotion. It will enable our store operators to react and quickly make changes in their local stores. And the data's analysis puts us in a better position to identify category opportunities in the U.S. and collaborate with suppliers to develop customer-driven programs. 
Based on the start of August sales, we're confident that our plans are working, and we'll see ongoing sales improvement. We expect comp sales for the 13-week period from July 30 through October 28 to be between minus 1% and plus 1%. Last year's third quarter 13-week comp was negative 1.3%. Timing of our calendar ending on Friday means a large portion of the Halloween sales could fall into the fourth quarter period. We still remain concerned about the increased economic pressure on our customers and the uncertain impact it will have on their shopping behavior. With the ongoing economic volatility, it's important as ever to deliver on our one-stop shopping promise, a broad assortment of merchandise backed with Every Day Low Price. 
We remain committed to the productivity loop and our goal of leveraging operating expense. We will continue to invest in price to help our customers weather the economy, so gross profit should be flat to slightly down for the third quarter. 
Now I'll turn it over to Doug for the international update."

During our briefing following our Shareholder Meeting on June 3, I laid out our key initiatives for leveraging our scale and expertise in the Walmart International markets. They included: making progress on EDLP as a global pricing philosophy, enhancing the productivity loop to get costs down, further developing global talent and sharing ideas back-and-forth with the U.S. businesses, both Walmart and Sam's Club. It's only been a couple of months since then, and I'm happy to report that we have already made progress on each of these areas. I'm also proud to share some important milestones that Walmart International achieved in the second quarter. As you know, as to completed its acquisition of 147 Netto stores in the U.K., as is already converted more than 60 of these stores, which now have more than 4x the number of products than previously offered. This means customers can find what they need for the entire week just as they do in ASDA superstores. 
In addition, we completed our 51% acquisition of Massmart. Massmart is a leading general merchandise retailer and basics food wholesaler in sub-Saharan Africa and the second largest in consumer goods. As you heard, we will include the results from our countries in Africa in our third fiscal quarter. In terms of sharing ideas back and forth, South African suppliers offer an important opportunity for us to bring new and exciting merchandise to our other markets. Recently, we contracted with Ocean Fresh, a South African seafood supplier to export sustainably sourced wild hack of fish to our stores in the United States. This is helping to create 100 jobs in South Africa, and we believe this is the first indicator of even more opportunities on the continent. To recognize our new partnership with our customers in sub-Saharan Africa, we have launched our working together to save you money campaign, offering price reductions in Massmart stores for an extended period of time. 
Now let's get to the numbers. Walmart International reported second quarter net sales of $30.1 billion an increase of 16.2% over last year. Changes in currency rates increased our net sales by $2.3 billion. As a reminder, our markets benefited this fiscal quarter from Easter sales and in the United Kingdom, the royal wedding. Last year, second quarter results benefited from sales related to the World Cup. So in some cases, there were difficult comp sales comparisons. 
On a constant-currency basis, net sales were $27.8 billion, an increase of 7.1% over last year second quarter. All of our markets had constant currency sales growth, except in Japan, where sales were affected by the March 2011 natural disasters.  Mexico, the U.K., Canada, Brazil and China provided the strongest net sales growth in the second quarter. As a percentage of sales, Walmart International second quarter constant currency gross profit margin and other income was flat to last year. Second quarter reported operating expenses were $6 billion, which includes an increase of $500 million due to changes in currency exchange rates. Although Japan, Brazil, the U.K. and Chile had expense leverage in the second quarter, Walmart International's constant currency operating expenses grew faster than sales at 9.4%. 
Our second quarter reported operating income grew 8.9% from last year to $1.4 billion, and this includes a benefit of $110 million from changes in currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, operating income grew 50 basis points. Excluding the $53 million in charges that Jeff mentioned and the $14 million impact on costs associated with the integration of Netto, Walmart International grew constant currency operating income 5.6%. Inventory management continues to be a challenge as days on hand increased over last year in most of our markets. Our constant currency inventory, excluding Massmart, grew 11.1% as we added a significant number of stores in most of our markets. 
Now let's get into the results for several of our larger markets. Country management teams are held accountable for their results on a constant currency basis. The following discussion of country results excludes the impact of currency and unless otherwise stated, sales and comp sales are presented on a nominal basis. Comp sales are reported on a calendar basis. We'll kick off this quarter with the U.K. ASDA had a solid second quarter, growing sales excluding fuel ahead of last year. However, operating income declined due to $31 million of costs related to Netto. Adjusting for fuel sales and Netto ASDA grew operating income faster than sales. 
In the second quarter of this year, comparable sales, excluding fuel, increased 50 basis points. Traffic decreased by 120 basis points and average ticket increased 170 basis points. Customers are consolidating their trips in the face of high fuel prices. ASDA growth expenses lower than sales in the second quarter, leveraging on tight expense management. After excluding the Netto costs, ASDA's expenses declined from last year. ASDA continues to gain recognition for saving people money everyday, supported by the 10% online price guarantee and now more than 250,000 baskets are being checked online by customers each week. As a clear statement to the quality our customers can find, ASDA's private brands and other products have won more than 300 awards so far this year, including Retail Champion at the International Cheese Awards, Meat and Fish Retailer of the Year and numerous other wine awards. 
In June, ASDA was recognized as the price leader by the Grocer magazine as the lowest priced supermarket for the 14th year running. So it was no surprise that they were long lines of customers on grand opening day at our converted Netto stores. In these stores, customers will receive the same ASDA low prices, the 10% price guarantee and in-store pickup from online shopping. 
Including the stores from the Netto acquisition, ASDA's total store count was 536 at the end of the second quarter. Economic indicators suggest that 2011 will remain a challenging year for our U.K. consumers, and we're confident that ASDA and its Netto store conversions are entering the second half of the year with good momentum, delivering availability and Every Day Low Prices. 
Finally, Judith McKenna, who spent several years as ASDA's Chief Financial Officer has been promoted to Chief Operating Officer. Judith has a long track record of success, and we look forward to her experience in ASDA's operations. Congratulations, Judith. 
Let's move to the Americas. In previous earnings discussions, I discussed only the results of Mexico and Central America separately in this section. Now that one year's passed since our Central American operations have been combined into Walmex, we will discuss the results of the consolidated company going forward. While the following results are on a U.S. GAAP basis, Walmex separately reports its earnings under Mexican GAAP. So some numbers are different from the Walmex reported results. 
Overall, Walmex sales grew at a fast rate, but operating income declined from last year second quarter due to the noncash accounting charge mentioned earlier by Jeff. As we mentioned last quarter, our operations in Mexico went live with the SAP implementation during Q2. This effort increased the level of precision for inventory valuation and the result was a noncash accounting charge of $17 million. Walmex's consolidated net sales for the second quarter were up 9.1%. Comparable sales from Mexico were up 1.1%. Average ticket in Mexico increased 2.2%, and customer traffic declined 1.1%. Comp stores in Central America were up 6.2% on a constant-currency basis. 
As Walmex noted in its earnings call on July 19, our teams continues to strengthen its EDLP position in Mexico, and we've converted to EDLP in each of our 5 Central American countries, making permanent price reductions on more than 12,000 items. We've also converted all of our Central American supercenters to the Walmart brand. 
Mexico's second quarter consolidated comp store sales for the self-service formats grew by 1.9%, while ANTAD's comp store sales report for the rest of the industry, exuding Walmex, grew faster at 2.2%. In the second quarter, Walmex advanced its investment schedule for new stores and logistics modernization and opened 129 stores in this quarter as compared to 57 in the second quarter of last year. An aggressive, but steady, rate of new store openings is part of the new store growth plan. And Walmex has achieved 45% of planned floor expansion today. We will begin to see the sales from these new stores in our third fiscal quarter as the majority were opened at the end of June. 
Second quarter gross margin as a percentage of sales was flat to last year. Walmex's consolidated second quarter operating income declined 5.3% from last year and decreased 2.2% from last year after excluding the noncash inventory charge. Walmex's expenses grew faster than sales at 14.1% from last year, primarily due to the new stores. With 394 more stores than at the end of the second quarter of last year, Walmex is well-positioned for the rest of the year. 
Moving on to Brazil. Net sales grew in the second quarter, however, operating income declined from last year. As part of our progress in implementing EDLP as a global pricing philosophy, Brazil began its EDLP conversion earlier this year. The number of items converted to date represents a large portion of Brazil's overall sales. Brazil's second quarter net sales grew and comparable sales grew from last year. Average ticket increased 7.4% and customer traffic declined 4.6%. We believe that the investment in EDLP is right for our ultimate success in the marketplace and more important, best for our customers. 
Second quarter gross profit margin and expenses, both as a percentage of sales, declined slightly from last year. So in terms of enhancing the productivity loop, Brazil is making progress. Brazil has a long history of sustainability initiatives and this is an area where Walmart can make a big difference and contribute savings for the company and our customers as well. Walmart Brazil is partnered with 13 of the largest multinational suppliers to review end-to-end sustainability and reduce our impact on the environment. 
In the past 12 months, we have opened 42 net new stores in Brazil, bringing our total store count to 487. This includes 7 new stores in the second quarter of this year. And for Canada, Walmart Canada had solid sales growth in the second quarter of this year with operating income growing faster than sales. Net sales grew 5% in the second quarter compared to last year, primarily due to the supercenter expansion program and strong sales in many merchandise categories. Second quarter comparable sales increased 1.2% from last year. Average ticket increased 2.1% for the second quarter and traffic declined 0.9% for comparable stores. 
Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased 62 basis points from last year as Canada's merchants continues to be very focused on inventory management. Expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased only 31 basis points from last year, primarily from the increase in costs from growing Walmart Canada bank. Walmart Canada has been successful in managing its expenses by placing a significant focus on enhancing supercenter productivity. And this contributed to the 10% increase in operating income from last year. Canada's supercenter presence continues to grow at a faster rate. In addition to 9 store expansions and 9 in-box conversions this year, we expect to open about 40 new supercenters this year. Currently, just over 8 million customers a week visit our Canadian stores. Our goal is to have customer shop the entire store, and we're working on further strengthening all of our merchandise categories. In the past 12 months, we opened 10 new stores in Canada, bringing our store count to 329 stores. 
Moving to Asia, Japan's constant currency sales declined in the second fiscal quarter, but operating income grew when compared to last year. Japan's second quarter results include the effects of the March 2011 natural disasters, which continue to affect the entire country in many ways such as brownouts, food shortages and contamination fears. Three of our stores in Japan have yet to reopen. According to statistics released by the Japanese Ministry of the Economy Trade and Industry, or METI, overall supermarket comparable sales for the second quarter declined by 1.7% from last year. When comparing our performance to these METI's results, our comp performance continues to stay ahead of other large-scale retailers in Japan. 
Second quarter net sales declined 1.6% from last year and comparable sales declined 28 basis points, both in real terms. Walmart Japan's traffic declined 23 basis points last year, and the average ticket in real terms declined 5 basis points. Walmart Japan has recently announced permanent EDLP reductions on 1,000 items at a time when our customers need it the most. Sales and general merchandise had the strongest performance as customers prepare for energy shortages and restrictions. Sales of televisions were higher than normal as the exploration of analog television signals nears. 
Gross profit margin as a percentage of sales was flat to last year, and Japan leveraged expenses even in these trying times. Expenses as a percentage of sales declined 49 basis point from last year. Steve Dacus, who is serving as Chief Operating Officer, was promoted to CEO of Walmart Japan in June. His extensive experience in Japanese retail, combined with his time in our Sam's operations in the U.S. position him very well to lead our team. Congratulations, Steve. 
While Walmart China sales continue to grow in the second quarter, the sales growth was not enough to offset the increase in expenses. As a result, China had a small loss from operations. Net sales for the second quarter grew 9.7% over last year and comparable store growth was 1.8%. Average ticket grew 10% in China, but traffic declined 8.2%. The primary traffic decline was in our Trust-Mart Stores. In April, we obtained antitrust clearance to purchase the remaining interest in Trust-Mart. We began the rebranding of our Trust-Mart stores in the third quarter of this year, which provides us the first opportunity to communicate the new types of merchandise already being offered in our Trust-Mart stores. Expenses as a percentage of sales, grew 244 basis ponts, increasing from last year as result of additional government levies and new store growth. Second quarter gross margin increased to 103 basis points over last year as our Trust-Mart stores can now take advantage of leverage opportunities from our Walmart stores. 
In the past 12 months, we opened 53 new stores including 48 supercenters and that brings our China store count to 344 stores. I'd like to congratulate Sean Clarke on his promotion to Chief Operating Officer of Walmart China. Sean has spent several years as the Chief Financial Officer in Canada, and we look forward to leveraging his experience into our Chinese operations. 
In closing, all of our markets are focused on our key goals of delivering growth, leverage and returns with organic growth of 24 million square feet since the second quarter of last year and the acquisition of an additional 18.4 million square feet in the second quarter this year, we are well-positioned to drive growth for the balance of the year. 
Now I'll turn it over to Brian for the news on Sam's Club. Brian?"

I am very pleased to give the Sam's Club update today. We had an outstanding second quarter. Sam's Club posted its sixth quarter of sequential improvement as comp club sales, excluding fuel, increased 5% at the top of our range. We have the best momentum in membership we've seen in years, driven by strong renewals and growth in members joining at the plus level. Not only do we leverage expenses, but we also grew operating profit without fuel by 13.3%, much faster than the growth in sales. Similar to first quarter, our fuel business was strong during the quarter. We are pumping more gallons of fuel and generating more sales dollars per gallon this year versus last year. Fuel prices in this year's second quarter are approximately 43% higher than a year ago and gallons sold are up 16%. Fuel price is an important first price impression for our members, reminding them the value of their membership. 
Including fuel, second quarter net sales were $13.6 billion, a 9.5% increase over last year and operating income increased 50% to $492 million. Volatility and fuel prices can have a notable impact on our financial results. Our discussion today, therefore, is focused on our core business and excludes fuel for comparative purposes, unless otherwise noted. 
Now let's look at the financial results and our achievements for the quarter. Net sales for the second quarter were $12 billion, up 4.9% from last year. Comp club sales for the 13-week period increased 5%, and we're strong across all 3 geographic operating divisions. We are particularly pleased with the sales strength of our Western division, which includes 22 states located in the Western U.S. Recall that we have 3 divisions in Sam's Club, each headed by a seasoned SVP. Comp traffic and ticket increased for the 13-week period by 2.6 and 2.4 percentage points, respectively. Comp traffic and ticket increased for both advantage and business members. 
The quality of our sales growth in our core categories was very strong, despite the over 100 basis point headwind we have in the tobacco sales. We continued to face challenges in tobacco sales. The industry is softer than last year. In addition, since we changed the credit card rewards program, there is a greater impact on members who shop this category heavily. We anticipate tobacco being a headwind for the rest of the year. We continue to focus on categories our members tell us are most important to them such as fresh and health and wellness to optimize our growth. We also want to be the price leader in everyday needs items. This is contributing to strong ticket and traffic performance despite inflation pressure. Our fresh business delivered high single-digit comps for the quarter led by bakery, produce, meats, and home meal solutions. These results are driven by high-quality standards we have in place. 
Dry grocery and beverage comps were in the mid-single digits. In beverages, hot weather categories such as soda and sports drinks performed very well. Comps for our health and wellness area were in the mid-single digits. Sam's free in-club health screenings are driving traffic and pharmacies script growth. 
Despite the challenging economy, we continue to see good results in discretionary areas, including home and apparel, driven by very strong sales in men's, children's and basic areas. Apparel achieved a double-digit comp increase this quarter. Our home line area achieved a high-single digits comp as kitchen electrics, housewares and domestics were all strong. Even with average selling price deflation, our consumer electronics business delivered a mid single-digit comp sales increase. New products like tablets are driving greater sales in electronics. 
Overall, we believe that inflation impacts our comp sales by 200 to 250 basis points. We continue to see mid single-digit inflation in key food categories. However, we have managed through these price increases with little impact on margin. Despite the impact of inflation, we continue to see growth in units sold year-over-year. We continue to deliver on our commitment to quality and value, especially with our proprietary brands. These initiatives are important in giving our members choices. Here are a few highlights: since the beginning of the year, we have introduced 3 new brands, Artisan fresh in deli and bakery, Simply Right in baby and health and beauty aids and Daily Chef in frozen foods and refrigerated products. These new brands represent close to 100 items this month, with plans to roll out 400 more by the end of Q1 next year. 
Early sales and number feedback are overwhelmingly positive with results at or above expectations in all 3 brands. Our regional management structure and improved training programs continue to help our operations team focus on winning the weekend. This focus on weekend performers has yield a positive results, and we are pleased with our weekend traffic and comp sales results. Our most recent member satisfaction survey results tell us that our members think we're on the right track. The survey showed an improvement across all metrics, with strong improvement in overall member satisfaction. Our July 4 eValue savings celebration, which gave all our member a taste of our successful eValues program performed well. Compared to both last year's performance and the pre-event period, the savings celebration drew a higher percentage of member pricing, higher sales per member and an increase in members upgrading to Plus membership. Additionally, baskets that include eValues items at a higher value than those without an eValues items. 
Membership and other income was down 11 basis points as a percentage of sales when compared to the second quarter last year. It's important to explain what's driving this reduction in other income. Previously, we rented space to a third party for a portion of our wireless business. We are now running this business with Sam's Club associates. This means we no longer receive rental income from the third party as we have in prior years. The sales and expenses of our wireless business are now included directly in our operating results. While we are just a few months into the change, we're encouraged by the early results. Wireless sales performance in the back half of the quarter was better than expected, and we anticipate the overall effect of this change to be positive to our operating results. 
Membership income for the second quarter increased 1.2% versus last year. We continue to see a trend from the past several quarters of improving net membership results. Growth in membership income on a cash basis was strong. Renewals are increasing the rate that has exceeded our expectation and outpaced last year's performance. Our penetration of Plus members continues to grow at a healthy pace. 
We have seen new sign of growth overall even as small business members continue to struggle in this economy. Our proprietary credit program continues to be well received by our members, driven by in-club marketing initiatives and an overall bounce back in the utilization of credit. We find that among members who use their Sam's Club credit product, overall engagement and retention is higher. For the third quarter, we anticipate continued positive momentum in membership. Gross margin rate increased by 9 basis points compared to the second quarter last year, while gross profit dollars increased 5.6%. As I mentioned earlier, we are experiencing inflation in several categories, and we are managing this impact across the business. We believe that inflation will continue to be pressure point for the remainder of the year. 
I am very pleased with how our clubs manage expenses during the quarter, driven by strong wage cost control, we reduced expenses as a percentage of sales by 32 basis points. You may recall that last year in this call, we discussed the impact of higher interchange fees related to the Sam's rewards credit program. I'm happy to say that even when this expense is excluded from last year's comparison, we leverage expenses by 14 basis points. For the quarter, sales per labor hour increased 1.9%, and units per labor hour increased 69 basis points. 
Looking at the bottom line, our second quarter operating income, without fuel, increased to $467 million, a 13.3% increase over second quarter last year. At the end of the second quarter, inventory, including fuel inventory, was up 5.5% compared to last year. Overall, we were pleased with inventory levels in our clubs and distribution centers. Our inventory increase is primarily due to inflation and to a lesser extent, a change in the seasonal transition of holiday merchandise. 
Looking ahead, our sales momentum remains strong. Our growth rates were strong in the back half for the second quarter and as we enter the first few weeks of the third quarter, our momentum has continued. It's important to remember, that was in the third quarter last year that our comp performance began to accelerate, so our comparison for the back half will be more challenging. We expect comp club sales, without fuel, for the 13-week period from July 30 through October 28 to increase 3% to 5%. Last year, Sam's comp club sales excluding fuel increased 2.4% for the comparable 13-week period. 
Now I will turn the program over to Charles for a wrap up in guidance. Charles?"

As Mike said, we continue to be very focused on our financial priorities of growth, leverage and returns. I'm really proud of the way we continued to improve throughout the quarter despite the fragile global economy, which is obviously affecting consumers. I also want to note that Walmart's balance sheet and capacity continue to be an advantage, especially during the market volatility we have seen recently. Our ability to access short and long-term funding has never been better. This is a result of a strong Walmart business model. We still have many opportunities to improve around the world. 
In the second quarter, we had solid sales growth in international and Sam's, and we're progressing in Walmart U.S. We still have much work to do to drive top line growth, and we believe we are focused on the right initiatives. Despite the slowdown in the global economy, we continue to find very good growth opportunities for new stores across our global operations. We added 638 net units, with 315 units for Massmart, 147 units from Netto and 176 units through organic growth. Regarding acquisitions, we remain very thoughtful in acquiring new operations. Our focus will continue to be investing in companies that can deliver value to our customers and shareholders. 
Turning to leverage, our committee to productivity and cost containment remains high. Although we were flat on this metric on a reported basis, I remain encouraged with our expense management. The underlying SG&A rose less than the rate of sales when you exclude FX losses and acquisition-related costs. Bear in mind that our efforts are not just simply focused on cutting expenses but on the blend of expense management and technology leverage to improve productivity. I want to point out that productivity improvements also help our associates serve our customers and members better and improve our cost structure. If we can save 1 or 2 seconds in every cashier transaction around the world, the savings can truly add up. 
As an example of a productivity initiative in our Walmart U.S. stores, we have implemented more one-touch freight, which optimizes the pallette prior to arrival at the store. We're collaborating with suppliers to look at the entire supply chain as if it were vertically integrated to take unnecessary costs out of the system. We are also leveraging technology to enhance our workflow to make the work date more efficient for our store associates. 
As you have heard from our us before, we know that strengthening price leadership starts with being the low cost provider. As we continue to lower our cost, we will also be investing in price, helping our customers save money so they can live better. We will be relentless in widening the price gap, as Mike says, to pass savings along to our customers around the world. We believe that EDLP will lead to top line growth as customer traffic improves. 
And last, our priority of returns. On a rolling 12-month basis ending July 31, 2011, return on investment or ROI ended at 18.4%. ROI was impacted negatively by the acquisition in currency. It's important to know that our underlying operations remain solid. 
As you know, our company remains committed to share repurchase. We announced a new $15 billion share repurchase authorization on June 3 at our Annual Shareholders meeting. Given our acquisition activity in the second quarter, we had less money dedicated to share repurchase. The combination of our annual dividend and share repurchase program indicates the strength of our company and our continued commitment to returning value to Walmart's shareholders. Our investment in SAP throughout the company is ongoing, and it's designed to increase the consistency of our processes throughout the organization. While the majority of our businesses have converted or are underway, the effects of the conversion will continue until next year. The financial effect should be minimal. 
Now let's move on to guidance. Based on how we view our business relative to the economy and sales environment in the United States and throughout the world, we expect third quarter 2012 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $0.95 and $1, which compares to last year's third quarter earnings per share of $0.95. Last year's third quarter included $0.05 per share of tax benefits. We are narrowing the range of our full year earnings per share guidance and increasing it by $0.01. We now expect our full year earnings per share guidance to range between $4.41 and $4.51 versus our previously stated range of $4.35 to $4.50. All of the above EPS guidance assumes currency exchange rates remain at current levels. 
As I close, I'd like to summarize a few key points from today's call. First, our second quarter earnings per share of $1.09 was solidly within our guidance. Looking ahead, we are raising our full year EPS guidance. We continue to manage our business well despite a very tough global economy. Net sales increased 5.5% with contributions from all 3 operating segments. We are still on track to deliver our yearly sales growth target of 4% to 6%. We will use the productivity loop to deliver on our EDLC-EDLP model and are committed to leveraging expenses for the full year. Walmart has a very strong balance sheet that we believe is an important advantage as the global markets remain volatile. Last, we remain committed to delivering shareholder returns through a combination of share repurchase and dividends as we did in the second quarter. 
Thank you for your continued interest in Walmart and we look forward to seeing you in October for our investor meeting."

Thanks for joining us today for our earnings call to review the second quarter of fiscal year 2012. All information for this quarter, including our unit count, square feet and financial metrics is available on our website at walmartstores.com/investors. A full transcript of this call will be available on the website after 7:00 a.m. Central Time today on August 16, 2011. 
Mike Duke, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. will open the call with his thoughts and key highlights of the quarter. Jeff Davis, SVP of Finance and Treasurer, will cover the consolidated financial details, including information on certain items affecting our EPS. Then we'll go to the operating segments. Bill Simon, President and CEO of Walmart U.S. will begin our segment discussions. Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Walmart International, will follow Bill. Please note in his call, the clarifications on the impact of our acquisitions. We'll close the segment discussion with Brian Cornell, President and CEO of Sam's Club. And our CFO, Charles Holley, will wrap up with our financial report card and guidance. 
Before we discuss our second quarter performance, we do have a couple of reminders. You'll note in our press release that we have certain items affecting EPS this quarter, and Jeff will cover these shortly. As you know, we closed on the acquisitions of the 147 Netto stores in the U.K. and our majority interest in Massmart during this quarter. The Netto stores are fully consolidated into our financials but do not include any results from Massmart. The balance sheet from Massmart is consolidated using their fiscal year-end balance. Massmart continues to operate as a public company and closed their fiscal year on June 26. Massmart will report its year-end results on Thursday, August 25. 
Many of you often ask about what's included in the non-controlling or as we used to call minority interest line. This line primarily relates to non-controlling ownership interests in Mexico, which includes Central America, as well as Chile, Trust-Mart in China, India and now Massmart. Beginning in the third quarter, we will consolidate Massmart's operations in our consolidated financials on a 1-month lag, consistent with most of our international operations. Finally, let me remind you that our fiscal calendars for international differ from that of our corporate time line. All of our international countries, with the exception of Canada, end their fiscal year on December 31, while our U.S. and Canada operations end on January 31. 
Now Mike, let's get started with our Q2 results. Mike?"
313055,129808251,159268,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 16, 2011",2011-08-16,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Carol. Good morning, everyone. Today, Walmart is reporting second quarter earnings per share of $1.09 from continuing operations, which is a 12.4% increase over last year and near the top of our guidance. Let's get right to the key results. Net sa",1116,"Thanks, Carol. Good morning, everyone. Today, Walmart is reporting second quarter earnings per share of $1.09 from continuing operations, which is a 12.4% increase over last year and near the top of our guidance. Let's get right to the key results. Net sales increased 5.5% to $108.6 billion. Total U.S. comp sales, without fuel, were flat for the 13-week period. Sam's Club comps, without fuel, were up 5%, right at the top of the guidance for the period, and Walmart U.S. delivered comp sales within guidance at negative 0.9%. International reported net sales of $30 billion, a strong 16.2% increase. We also grew internationally through 2 significant acquisitions. 
Consolidated operating income increased 3.1%. Walmart ended the quarter with free cash flow of $4 billion. For the quarter, the company returned $2.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Operating expenses in the second quarter grew at the same rate as sales. We remain committed to the productivity loop and to strong expense management throughout the Walmart organization. We have the right initiatives in place to leverage for the full year. 
Let's move to the highlights of the individual segments. I'm encouraged by the sales improvements in our Walmart U.S. stores. Comps have improved sequentially month-to-month within the quarter. In fact, this was the best quarterly performance since the third quarter of fiscal 2010. The goal of the Walmart U.S. team remains positive comps by year end. In the second quarter, Bill Simon and the Walmart U.S. team completed the assortment add back in grocery for food and consumables, resulting in better customer traffic on this side of the store. We're making progress in expanding our general merchandise assortment and seeing positive comps in some categories such as sporting goods, but we still have work to do, and the team is focused on implementing the plan. 
I've recently observed several consumer focus groups, and it's clear that many consumers are still struggling. They're trading down to stretch their budgets, buying a lower-priced brand of detergent, moving from branded canned goods to private label and purchasing half gallons of milk instead of gallons. That's why we are laser-focused on investing in price to help our customers. There certainly are many reports on Walmart pricing and the fact is, that the gap has narrowed in some cases. We're committed to widening the gap on price, and we have a specific plan and timetable to deliver EDLP to every customer. 
Walmart U.S. also managed the business well in the second quarter, growing operating profit faster than sales to nearly $5 billion. Walmart International has strong growth again through a combination of comps and new stores. Second quarter sales grew 16.2% with sales growth in all markets except Japan, which is still recovering from the natural disasters. The international segment is an increasingly important part of our growth story and operating income improved nearly 9% in the second quarter. 
I am pleased that we closed on the acquisitions of Netto and Massmart, and integration is well underway in the U.K. and Africa. I'm excited about helping underserved customers in sub-Saharan Africa, and I'm also excited about the 15,000 jobs that we expect to create on the continent over the next 5 years. You'll hear more from Doug McMillon about the significant new store growth in Latin America this quarter led by Mexico. 
Every Day Low Price remains one of our strongest competitive advantages, and we continue to use this strategy in more of our international markets. We're transitioning to EDLP in Brazil and Central America. We recognize that it takes time to implement EDLP fully in a market, but we believe this is right for our customers over the long term. 
Sam's Club continued its strong momentum in the second quarter, delivering a 5% comp without fuel. This is the sixth straight quarter of comp improvement for Sam's, a testament to the team's execution to drive quality, value and savings for members. I'm also pleased with the momentum in membership income as Sam's improves its renewals and upgrades. Sam's also delivered strong operating income, driven in part by very good fuel sales and Sam's leveraged operating expenses. The strategy to win the weekend that Brian Cornell and his team have in place will position Sam's Club well for the back half of the year. 
In the second quarter, our global e-commerce team stepped-up its work on delivering a continuous shopping experience to customers from the store to the Web to their mobile devices. In mature markets, we're investing in multi-channel initiatives by integrating our stores with online services. We completed the rollout of Pick Up Today in all Walmart U.S. stores and within the last month, we announced that VUDU, our movie streaming technology, is now available on Walmart.com, as well as through any iPad browser. 
Walmart's brand and scale, coupled with consumers' need for value, also gives us opportunities in some of the fastest growing markets in the world today. In June, we established Walmart's China e-commerce headquarters in Shanghai, and we put in place the leadership team to quickly build this business. We are investing in the right talent and technology to pursue the growth in e-commerce. I believe that Walmart is the best positioned retailer to serve the needs of the next-generation customers who are striving to join the emerging global middle class. They're connected to the world through smartphones and social media. They have higher expectations of value, quality and a better life. We will continue to advocate for policies that make sense for our customers and our business. 
In the U.S., we're pleased by the momentum around e-fairness, legislation to eliminate the unfair advantage that online-only retailers currently have. Recently, we've seen the passage of laws in key states like California, Illinois and Texas, strong efforts from the small business community and a clearer call for reform from our nation's editorial pages. We're encouraged by the growing interest in a federal response to this issue as well. We will remain engaged in the debate in Washington. 
We've also called for modernizing our nation's corporate tax code. Last month, I testified before the U.S. Senate Finance Committee on reforming the tax code to drive job growth here at home and encourage America's competitiveness abroad. To achieve comprehensive reform, we've called for putting everything on the table including the existing incentives that benefit us. There are 3 key points that I emphasized to the committee: one, lower their corporate tax rate; two, get rid of existing incentives that benefit some industries over others; and three, level the international playing field with a territorial system. 
Now I'll turn it over to Jeff for the detailed financial report. Jeff?"
313055,129808251,159268,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 16, 2011",2011-08-16,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. For the second quarter of fiscal 2012, Walmart reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.09, which was within our guidance of $1.05 to $1.10. The $1.09 compares to $0.97 for the second quarter of last year. Inco",937,"Thank you, Mike. For the second quarter of fiscal 2012, Walmart reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.09, which was within our guidance of $1.05 to $1.10. The $1.09 compares to $0.97 for the second quarter of last year. Income from continuing operations included certain pretax items as follows: We recorded an approximate $49 million mark-to-market loss on certain foreign currency derivative positions related to the Massmart acquisition. We realized costs of approximately $36 million related to the acquisitions of Netto and Massmart. We recognized expenses of approximately $30 million related to the damages from tornadoes and floods in our United States operations. These items totaled $115 million and are included in our operating expenses. In addition, Walmart Mexico recorded an approximate $17 million revaluation charge from the implementation of the SAP financial system, which Doug will provide additional details later. The combination of these expense and gross margin items on EPS from continuing operations was approximately $0.03. 
Now let's move to the rest of the P&L. Consolidated net sales increased 5.5% or $5.6 billion to $108.6 billion for the quarter. The increase was driven primarily by Walmart International and Sam's Club and included a currency exchange benefit of $2.3 billion. Sales for Massmart were reported in our operating results starting in the third quarter. Total U.S. comp sales, without fuel, for the 13-week period ended July 29 were flat and negative 20 basis points for the 26-week period. You will hear more details on the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club comp sales from Bill and Brian. 
For the quarter, gross margin on sales was 24.7%, a 10-basis point reduction compared to last year. Sam's Club fuel sales were the primary contributor to the margin decline. Unallocated corporate overhead and other, which includes our ongoing investment in global e-commerce increased approximately 21.8% to $509 million for the second quarter. Excluding the $49 million loss on mark-to-market foreign currency derivative positions I mentioned earlier and our global e-commerce initiatives, our core corporate overhead expenses increased 2.9%.
Consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of sales were flat to last year at 19.5%. Operating expenses grew at the same rate as sales or 5.5%. Excluding the items affecting operating expenses that I previously mentioned, the company leveraged operating expenses for the second quarter. To reiterate what Mike said, the company is committed to leveraging operating expenses for the full year, and we have focused expense management initiatives in place throughout the company. 
Consolidated operating income, which included a $110 million currency benefit was $6.4 billion, a 3.1% increase versus last year. Net interest expense for the quarter increased 19.2% to $578 million. The increase in interest expense was a result of higher debt levels as we opportunistically issued new debt over the last 12 months at historically low rates. The higher debt levels were partially offset by lower rates on outstanding debt. Going forward, we expect the percentage growth and net interest expense to moderate, but remain in low- to mid-teens through the balance of the year. 
The additional debt raised our debt-to-total capitalization ratio to 45.7% at the end of the second quarter compared to 43.2% last year. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 32.2%. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 to be at the lower end of our range of 33.5% to 34.5%, although we may see quarterly fluctuations. Our effective tax rate may be impacted by a number of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations. 
Income from continuing operations attributable to Walmart was $3.8 billion, an increase of 5.7% over last year. During the second quarter, the company repurchased $1.4 billion of shares, representing approximately 26.1 million shares which brings the year-to-date repurchase to $3.5 billion or 65.4 million shares. In June, the board approved a new $15 billion repurchase authorization, which has $14.1 billion remaining. In addition to the share repurchases, Walmart returned to shareholders $1.3 billion in dividends during the quarter and $2.5 billion year-to-date. So in summary, Walmart returned $2.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase during the second quarter with $6.1 billion year-to-date. 
Consolidated inventory grew 11.1% compared to last year. Walmart International was the main contributor to the increase, primarily driven by currency evaluation, acquisitions and significant international growth. Payables as a percentage of inventories were 90% versus 98% in the prior year. Last year's percentage received a benefit from the timing of payment cycles, which resulted in a higher-than-normal payables balance. Capital expenditures were approximately $3.3 billion for the second quarter compared to $3 billion in the prior year. We added growth in virtually every country with 176 net new units, excluding acquisitions of which 113 units were opened in Mexico. 
Free cash flow remained strong. We ended the quarter with a positive free cash flow of $4 billion compared to $4.5 billion last year. As I mentioned earlier, the increase in accounts payables from the timing of payment cycles enhanced free cash flow last year. 
Return on investment or ROI for the trailing 12 months ended July 31, 2011, was 18.4% compared to 19% for the prior year. The majority of the decline in ROI is attributable to acquisitions in currency. We are always aware that acquisitions like Netto and Massmart can have a short-term impact on company ROI. On the other hand, these acquisitions added 462 new units and 18.4 million square feet this quarter. 
Now we'll turn to our operating segments. We'll start with Walmart U.S. Bill?"
313055,129808251,159268,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 16, 2011",2011-08-16,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jeff. The goal at Walmart U.S. remains clear.

Our custo",1889,"Thank you, Jeff. The goal at Walmart U.S. remains clear. Deliver positive comps by year end, and our plan is straightforward, and it's also working. We're expanding our assortment of merchandise backed with Walmart's Every Day Low Price promise. Our customer response is reflected in the improved results we saw in the second quarter. Walmart U.S. gained sales momentum throughout the quarter after a difficult May, which was impacted by high prices at the gas pump and severe spring weather. Our sales trend improved in June and again in July. In fact, our July $454 million comp was positive, and we improved in both customer traffic and ticket as the quarter progressed. 
Our net sales rose approximately 40 basis points to $64.9 billion for the second quarter. Comp sales for the 13-week period ending July 29 was inside our guidance at negative 0.9% and the best quarterly comp performance in almost 2 years. Ticket was positive every month of the quarter. Traffic, which drove more than half of the comp, improved sequentially each month. Better traffic was driven in part by the 90-day rollback program at the gas pump. This program, which is available in 18 states saves customers $0.10 a gallon on gas and diesel when using a reloadable Walmart gift card or credit card. 
Grocery and health and wellness, which represent 2/3 of our sales revenue, continue to deliver positive comps. We also saw trend improvements in all other businesses except entertainment. This improvement is attributable to our focus on expanding merchandise assortment, price leadership and increased in-stock levels. Weather trends across the country later in the quarter also helped. 
The economy remains challenging for our core customers. Customers are still consolidating trips due to higher year-over-year gas prices. The swings in sales due to paycheck cycles remain pronounced, and our stores must staff and stock for the volatility both up-and-down. We also have seen an increase in the number of customers relying on government assistance for food and necessities for their family. Our grocery business continued its positive trend and again delivered low-single digit positive comps for the period. Food remains a key traffic driver to our stores. The strong performance during the July 4 weekend offset softness in the Memorial Day weekend. 
Sales across dry grocery continue to accelerate from additional assortment. Sales of consumables also improved over the first quarter. We continue to see strength in our new modular programs that are bringing back assortment and had strong seasonal performance in pets and beauty, both of which delivered basis points comp improvement in the triple digits versus the first quarter. While we saw an increase in grocery inflation of approximately 3.5% during the quarter, customers remain under continued pressure and are trading down to lower price points and smaller pack sizes, as well as opting out of discretionary purchases. As a result, we're seeing minimal pass-through of inflation to sales. 
Food inflation has replaced gasoline price as the most important household expense concern. In addition, more than 15% of Walmart moms in our monthly survey have experienced the loss of a household wage earner's job in the last year. Almost 40% of these Walmart moms indicate they're holding off or eliminating items they would normally buy, reinforcing the need for us to drive Every Day Low Price. Moms of all income levels showed a drop in confidence over the last year, with middle-income moms showing the greatest drop. And our health and wellness business again delivered a low-single digit positive comp driven by the strength of our prescription business. We continue to benefit from the additional traffic in our pharmacies as a result of the Humana program and our optical business benefited from the kick-off of our $29 back-to-school eyewear offering. We expect the momentum to continue in the third quarter as more parents get their children ready for school. 
Neighborhood markets posted positive comps for 15 consecutive months now, delivering a comp of over 3% for the second quarter. This format reflects the ongoing strength of our food and health and wellness business. Overall, apparel comps declined in the mid-single digits during the second quarter, which includes approximately 300 basis points improvement from the first quarter. This performance was driven by ongoing business initiatives, especially in our basic apparel offering, an improvement in sales of summer merchandise tied to the warm weather. Men's, ladies and our baby apparel delivered the best comps for the period. Our children's apparel, shoes and intimate departments remain soft. 
We are well positioned to gain sales and share for the important back-to-school season. We are expanding our offerings in important categories to regain customers, and we're adding back items in key brands. We're confident that the back half of the year will see ongoing improvement in apparel sales. 
Comp sales for home declined in the mid-single digits for the quarter. We remain committed to strengthening this important category. Better weather versus the first quarter drove customers to our Outdoor Living department. We were ready, given our expanded assortments and innovation across the categories. However, there appears to have been a trade-off in indoor living categories. Customers are opting out of decor items for their homes or they're trading down. 
Entertainment had high-single digit negative comp sales for the quarter. As others have reported, media and gaming continue to experience significant headwinds. New movie releases from last year were also a headwind. However, customers do shop for value and our $5 movie bin continues to do very well. Double-digit deflation in TV prices still exist, but our unit sales were up again. Customers want innovation and tablets continue to sell very well. We continued to see strength in our prepaid wireless business, although as you know, we record this as a net commission in our comp sales as opposed to its full transactional value. 
Straight Talk remains a billion dollar plus brand for Walmart U.S. Within toys, we gained momentum as the quarter progressed. Sales of licensed toys associated with new movie releases and seasonal items including pools, water toys and bikes improved significantly. 
Hardlines had low-single digit negative comp sales but improved over the first quarter. Favorable weather drove sales across sporting goods, especially hunting, fishing and camping and air movement-related products. New modulars in stationery and crafts helped push items in these categories. Tires sales continue to do well for automotive. 
We’ve spoken often about multi-channel retailing, allowing customers to shop on their own terms. We're now moving towards a strategy called continuous channel shopping, recognizing the continued integration of customers using web-based devices to shop our stores and to research and shop online as well. Today, roughly 60% of walmart.com sales involve the stores through services such as Site to Store and Pick Up Today. In fact, some of our highest volume Site to Store sales come out of large metropolitan areas such as New York City and the San Francisco Bay Area. 
During second quarter, we also launched a delivery and installation service program for electronics. We're providing delivery, setup and installation for TVs. We also offer basic setup for home theater and wireless networks. The in-home service network has up to 50,000 technicians available who'll service our customers. Our prices are very competitive and this now puts us on par with other electronics retailers. 
Now I'll cover the remaining financial results. Our gross profit dollars were up 1.2% over last year second quarter, growing faster than the rate of sales. We lapped last year's deep rollback program in the second quarter, which we expected to impact our rate comparison this quarter. Additionally, our logistics team continues to drive routing and load efficiencies, allowing us to minimize the majority of the headwinds associated with rising diesel prices impacting the cost of goods. In fact, rising diesel costs were a headwind, 2/3 of which were mitigated by these transportation initiatives. 
SG&A was up approximately 70 basis points compared to last year. Slightly higher payroll-related expenses, management incentive plan accruals, as well as the storm-related damages Jeff mentioned earlier were the primary drivers for the increase in SG&A. These increases were partially offset by lower advertising spend versus last year and a reduction in our accident costs related to store operations. Operating income grew faster than sales for the quarter. Operating income rose 2.1% over last year to almost $5 billion. 
Inventory was up 4.8% compared to this time last year, which on a year-over-year quarter comparable is 150 basis points lower than what I reported last quarter. Productivity gains offset inventory growth that was primarily driven by inflation, new stores and assortment add-back initiatives I mentioned. In short, inventory is moving back in line with where we'd like it to be. We're focused on growing our business also through new stores and our priority remains supercenter growth. We added 18 supercenters this quarter, including new and converted stores. We're very pleased with the opening of the first 4 Walmart Express units and the initial results are positive. Let me remind you, these are still pilot stores, and we're testing different formats. 
Our Neighborhood Market format is delivering a return at the same level as our supercenters, which have the best ROI in the company. These results have encouraged us to move faster on expanding our grocery format. Our multi-year development pipeline has approved 180 Neighborhood Markets through our real estate committee, and we'll announce more details on these growth plans in October. 
We're moving forward with our remodel plan that we discussed last quarter. In addition to reducing the costs of remodels, we expect faster completions and significantly less customer disruption. In July, we entered into an agreement with the Nielsen company to share our point of sales data, which will provide deeper insights into customer purchasing and unmet needs, both nationally and in key local markets. The data will cover grocery including food, consumables and health and wellness categories, except for prescriptions.
This agreement will better equip our merchant to evaluate their business and optimize assortment, pricing and promotion. It will enable our store operators to react and quickly make changes in their local stores. And the data's analysis puts us in a better position to identify category opportunities in the U.S. and collaborate with suppliers to develop customer-driven programs. 
Based on the start of August sales, we're confident that our plans are working, and we'll see ongoing sales improvement. We expect comp sales for the 13-week period from July 30 through October 28 to be between minus 1% and plus 1%. Last year's third quarter 13-week comp was negative 1.3%. Timing of our calendar ending on Friday means a large portion of the Halloween sales could fall into the fourth quarter period. We still remain concerned about the increased economic pressure on our customers and the uncertain impact it will have on their shopping behavior. With the ongoing economic volatility, it's important as ever to deliver on our one-stop shopping promise, a broad assortment of merchandise backed with Every Day Low Price. 
We remain committed to the productivity loop and our goal of leveraging operating expense. We will continue to invest in price to help our customers weather the economy, so gross profit should be flat to slightly down for the third quarter. 
Now I'll turn it over to Doug for the international update."

During our briefing following our Shareholders Meeting on June 3, I laid out our key initiatives for leveraging our scale and expertise in the Walmart International markets. They included making progress on EDLP as a global pricing philosophy, enhancing the productivity loop to get costs down, further developing global talent and sharing ideas back-and-forth with the U.S. businesses, both Walmart and Sam's Club. It's only been a couple of months since then, and I'm happy to report that we have already made progress on each of these areas. I'm also proud to share some important milestones that Walmart International achieved in the second quarter. As you know, ASDA completed its acquisition of 147 Netto stores in the U.K. ASDA has already converted more than 60 of these stores, which now have more than 4x the number of products than previously offered. This means customers can find what they need for the entire week just as they do in ASDA superstores. 
In addition, we completed our 51% acquisition of Massmart. Massmart is a leading general merchandise retailer and basics foods wholesaler in sub-Saharan Africa and the second largest in consumer goods. As you heard, we will include the results from our countries in Africa in our third fiscal quarter. In terms of sharing ideas back and forth, South African suppliers offer an important opportunity for us to bring new and exciting merchandise to our other markets. Recently, we contracted with Ocean Fresh, a South African seafood supplier to export sustainably sourced wild hake, a fish, to our stores in the United States. This is helping to create 100 jobs in South Africa, and we believe this is the first indicator of even more opportunities on the continent. To recognize our new partnership with our customers in sub-Saharan Africa, we have launched our Working Together to Save You Money campaign, offering price reductions in Massmart’s stores for an extended period of time. 
Now let's get to the numbers. Walmart International reported second quarter net sales of $30.1 billion, an increase of 16.2% over last year. Changes in currency rates increased our net sales by $2.3 billion. As a reminder, our markets benefited this fiscal quarter from Easter sales and in the United Kingdom, the royal wedding. Last year, second quarter results benefited from sales related to the World Cup. So in some cases, there were difficult comp sales comparisons. 
On a constant-currency basis, net sales were $27.8 billion, an increase of 7.1% over last year’s second quarter. All of our markets had constant currency sales growth, except in Japan, where sales were affected by the March 2011 natural disasters. Mexico, the U.K., Canada, Brazil and China provided the strongest net sales growth in the second quarter. As a percentage of sales, Walmart International second quarter constant currency gross profit margin and other income was flat to last year. Second quarter reported operating expenses were $6 billion, which includes an increase of $500 million due to changes in currency exchange rates. Although Japan, Brazil, the U.K. and Chile had expense leverage in the second quarter, Walmart International's constant currency operating expenses grew faster than sales at 9.4%. 
Our second quarter reported operating income grew 8.9% from last year to $1.4 billion, and this includes a benefit of $110 million from changes in currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, operating income grew 50 basis points. Excluding the $53 million in charges that Jeff mentioned and the $14 million impact on costs associated with the integration of Netto, Walmart International grew constant currency operating income 5.6%. Inventory management continues to be a challenge as days on hand increased over last year in most of our markets. Our constant currency inventory, excluding Massmart, grew 11.1% as we added a significant number of stores in most of our markets. 
Now let's get into the results for several of our larger markets. Country management teams are held accountable for their results on a constant currency basis. The following discussion of country results excludes the impact of currency and unless otherwise stated, sales and comp sales are presented on a nominal basis. Comp sales are reported on a calendar basis. We'll kick off this quarter with the U.K. ASDA had a solid second quarter, growing sales excluding fuel ahead of last year. However, operating income declined due to $31 million of costs related to Netto. Adjusting for fuel sales and Netto, ASDA grew operating income faster than sales. 
In the second quarter of this year, comparable sales, excluding fuel, increased 50 basis points. Traffic decreased by 120 basis points and average ticket increased 170 basis points. Customers are consolidating their trips in the face of high fuel prices. ASDA grew expenses slower than sales in the second quarter, leveraging on tight expense management. After excluding the Netto costs, ASDA's expenses declined from last year. ASDA continues to gain recognition for saving people money everyday, supported by the 10% online price guarantee and now more than 250,000 baskets are being checked online by customers each week. As a clear statement to the quality our customers can find, ASDA's private brands and other products have won more than 300 awards so far this year, including Retail Champion at the International Cheese Awards, Meat and Fish Retailer of the Year and numerous other wine awards. 
In June, ASDA was recognized as the price leader by the Grocer magazine as the lowest priced supermarket for the 14th year running. So it was no surprise that there were long lines of customers on grand opening day at our converted Netto stores. In these stores, customers will receive the same ASDA low prices, the 10% price guarantee and in-store pickup from online shopping. 
Including the stores from the Netto acquisition, ASDA's total store count was 536 at the end of the second quarter. Economic indicators suggest that 2011 will remain a challenging year for our U.K. consumers, and we're confident that ASDA and its Netto store conversions are entering the second half of the year with good momentum, delivering availability and Every Day Low Prices. 
Finally, Judith McKenna, who spent several years as ASDA's Chief Financial Officer has been promoted to Chief Operating Officer. Judith has a long track record of success, and we look forward to her experience in ASDA's operations. Congratulations, Judith. 
Let's move to the Americas. In previous earnings discussions, I discussed only the results of Mexico and Central America separately in this section. Now that one year's passed since our Central American operations have been combined into Walmex, we will discuss the results of the consolidated company going forward. While the following results are on a U.S. GAAP basis, Walmex separately reports its earnings under Mexican GAAP. So some numbers are different from the Walmex reported results. 
Overall, Walmex sales grew at a fast rate, but operating income declined from last year second quarter due to the noncash accounting charge mentioned earlier by Jeff. As we mentioned last quarter, our operations in Mexico went live with the SAP implementation during Q2. This effort increased the level of precision for inventory valuation and the result was a noncash accounting charge of $17 million. Walmex's consolidated net sales for the second quarter were up 9.1%. Comparable sales from Mexico were up 1.1%. Average ticket in Mexico increased 2.2%, and customer traffic declined 1.1%. Comp stores in Central America were up 6.2% on a constant-currency basis. 
As Walmex noted in its earnings call on July 19, our teams continued to strengthen its EDLP position in Mexico, and we've converted to EDLP in each of our 5 Central American countries, making permanent price reductions on more than 12,000 items. We've also converted all of our Central American supercenters to the Walmart brand. 
Mexico's second quarter consolidated comp store sales for the self-service formats grew by 1.9%, while ANTAD's comp store sales report for the rest of the industry, exuding Walmex, grew faster at 2.2%. In the second quarter, Walmex advanced its investment schedule for new stores and logistics modernization and opened 129 stores in this quarter as compared to 57 in the second quarter of last year. An aggressive, but steady, rate of new store openings is part of the new store growth plan. And Walmex has achieved 45% of planned floor expansion to date. We will begin to see the sales from these new stores in our third fiscal quarter as the majority were opened at the end of June. 
Second quarter gross margin as a percentage of sales was flat to last year. Walmex's consolidated second quarter operating income declined 5.3% from last year and decreased 2.2% from last year after excluding the noncash inventory charge. Walmex's expenses grew faster than sales at 14.1% from last year, primarily due to the new stores. With 394 more stores than at the end of the second quarter of last year, Walmex is well positioned for the rest of the year. 
Moving on to Brazil. Net sales grew in the second quarter; however, operating income declined from last year. As part of our progress in implementing EDLP as a global pricing philosophy, Brazil began its EDLP conversion earlier this year. The number of items converted to date represents a large portion of Brazil's overall sales. Brazil's second quarter net sales grew and comparable sales grew from last year. Average ticket increased 7.4% and customer traffic declined 4.6%. We believe that the investment in EDLP is right for our ultimate success in the marketplace and more important, best for our customers. 
Second quarter gross profit margin and expenses, both as a percentage of sales, declined slightly from last year. So in terms of enhancing the productivity loop, Brazil is making progress. Brazil has a long history of sustainability initiatives and this is an area where Walmart can make a big difference and contribute savings for the company and our customers as well. Walmart Brazil is partnered with 13 of the largest multinational suppliers to review end-to-end sustainability and reduce our impact on the environment. 
In the past 12 months, we have opened 42 net new stores in Brazil, bringing our total store count to 487. This includes 7 new stores in the second quarter of this year. And for Canada, Walmart Canada had solid sales growth in the second quarter of this year with operating income growing faster than sales. Net sales grew 5% in the second quarter compared to last year, primarily due to the supercenter expansion program and strong sales in many merchandise categories. Second quarter comparable sales increased 1.2% from last year. Average ticket increased 2.1% for the second quarter and traffic declined 0.9% for comparable stores. 
Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased 62 basis points from last year as Canada's merchants continue to be very focused on inventory management. Expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased only 31 basis points from last year, primarily from the increase in costs from growing Walmart Canada Bank. Walmart Canada has been successful in managing its expenses by placing a significant focus on enhancing supercenter productivity. And this contributed to the 10% increase in operating income from last year. Canada's supercenter presence continues to grow at a faster rate. In addition to 9 store expansions and 9 in-box conversions this year, we expect to open about 40 new supercenters this year. Currently, just over 8 million customers a week visit our Canadian stores. Our goal is to have customer shop the entire store, and we're working on further strengthening all of our merchandise categories. In the past 12 months, we opened 10 new stores in Canada, bringing our store count to 329 stores. 
Moving to Asia, Japan's constant currency sales declined in the second fiscal quarter, but operating income grew when compared to last year. Japan's second quarter results include the effects of the March 2011 natural disasters, which continue to affect the entire country in many ways such as brownouts, food shortages and contamination fears. Three of our stores in Japan have yet to reopen. According to statistics released by the Japanese Ministry of the Economy Trade and Industry, or METI, overall supermarket comparable sales for the second quarter declined by 1.7% from last year. When comparing our performance to these METI results, our comp performance continues to stay ahead of other large-scale retailers in Japan. 
Second quarter net sales declined 1.6% from last year and comparable sales declined 28 basis points, both in real terms. Walmart Japan's traffic declined 23 basis points from last year, and the average ticket in real terms declined 5 basis points. Walmart Japan has recently announced permanent EDLP reductions on 1,000 items at a time when our customers need it the most. Sales and general merchandise had the strongest performance as customers prepared for energy shortages and restrictions. Sales of televisions were higher than normal as the expiration of analog television signals nears. 
Gross profit margin as a percentage of sales was flat to last year, and Japan leveraged expenses even in these trying times. Expenses as a percentage of sales declined 49 basis points from last year. Steve Dacus, who was serving as Chief Operating Officer, was promoted to CEO of Walmart Japan in June. His extensive experience in Japanese retail, combined with his time in our Sam's operations in the U.S. position him very well to lead our team. Congratulations, Steve. 
While Walmart China sales continue to grow in the second quarter, the sales growth was not enough to offset the increase in expenses. As a result, China had a small loss from operations. Net sales for the second quarter grew 9.7% over last year and comparable store growth was 1.8%. Average ticket grew 10% in China, but traffic declined 8.2%. The primary traffic decline was in our Trust-Mart Stores. In April, we obtained antitrust clearance to purchase the remaining interest in Trust-Mart. We began the rebranding of our Trust-Mart stores in the third quarter of this year, which provides us the first opportunity to communicate the new types of merchandise already being offered in our Trust-Mart stores. Expenses as a percentage of sales, grew 244 basis points, increasing from last year as result of additional government levies and new store growth. Second quarter gross margin increased 103 basis points over last year as our Trust-Mart stores can now take advantage of leverage opportunities from our Walmart stores. 
In the past 12 months, we opened 53 new stores including 48 supercenters and that brings our China store count to 344 stores. I'd like to congratulate Sean Clarke on his promotion to Chief Operating Officer of Walmart China. Sean has spent several years as the Chief Financial Officer in Canada, and we look forward to leveraging his experience into our Chinese operations. 
In closing, all of our markets are focused on our key goals of delivering growth, leverage and returns with organic growth of 24 million square feet since the second quarter of last year and the acquisition of an additional 18.4 million square feet in the second quarter of this year, we are well positioned to drive growth for the balance of the year. 
Now I'll turn it over to Brian for the news on Sam's Club. Brian?"

I am very pleased to give the Sam's Club update today. We had an outstanding second quarter. Sam's Club posted its sixth quarter of sequential improvement as comp club sales, excluding fuel, increased 5%, at the top of our range. We have the best momentum in membership we've seen in years, driven by strong renewals and growth in members joining at the Plus level. Not only did we leverage expenses, but we also grew operating profit without fuel by 13.3%, much faster than the growth in sales. Similar to first quarter, our fuel business was strong during the quarter. We are pumping more gallons of fuel and generating more sales dollars per gallon this year versus last year. Fuel prices in this year's second quarter are approximately 43% higher than a year ago and gallons sold are up 16%. Fuel price is an important first price impression for our members, reminding them the value of their membership. 
Including fuel, second quarter net sales were $13.6 billion, a 9.5% increase over last year and operating income increased 15% to $492 million. Volatility and fuel prices can have a notable impact on our financial results. Our discussion today, therefore, is focused on our core business and excludes fuel for comparative purposes, unless otherwise noted. 
Now let's look at the financial results and our achievements for the quarter. Net sales for the second quarter were $12 billion, up 4.9% from last year. Comp club sales for the 13-week period increased 5%, and we're strong across all 3 geographic operating divisions. We are particularly pleased with the sales strength of our Western division, which includes 22 states located in the Western U.S. Recall that we have 3 divisions in Sam's Club, each headed by a seasoned SVP. Comp traffic and ticket increased for the 13-week period by 2.6 and 2.4 percentage points, respectively. Comp traffic and ticket increased for both Advantage and Business members. 
The quality of our sales growth in our core categories was very strong, despite the over 100-basis point headwind we had from tobacco sales. We continue to face challenges in tobacco sales. The industry is softer than last year. In addition, since we changed the credit card rewards program, there is a greater impact on members who shop this category heavily. We anticipate tobacco being a headwind for the rest of the year. We continue to focus on categories our members tell us are most important to them such as fresh and health and wellness to optimize our growth. We also want to be the price leader in everyday needs items. This is contributing to strong ticket and traffic performance despite inflation pressure. Our fresh business delivered high-single digit comps for the quarter led by bakery, produce, meat and whole meal solutions. These results are driven by high-quality standards we have in place. 
Dry grocery and beverage comps were in the mid-single digits. In beverages, hot weather categories such as soda and sports drinks performed very well. Comps for our health and wellness area were in the mid-single digits. Sam's free in-club health screenings are driving traffic and pharmacies script growth. 
Despite the challenging economy, we continue to see good results in discretionary areas, including home and apparel. Driven by very strong sales in men's, children's and basic areas, apparel achieved a double-digit comp increase this quarter. Our home line area achieved a high-single digit comp as kitchen electrics, housewares and domestics were all strong. Even with average selling price deflation, our consumer electronics business delivered a mid-single digit comp sales increase. New products like tablets are driving greater sales in electronics. 
Overall, we believe that inflation impacted our comp sales by 200 to 250 basis points. We continue to see mid-single digit inflation in key food categories. However, we have managed through these price increases with little impact on margin. Despite the impact of inflation, we continue to see growth in units sold year-over-year. We continue to deliver on our commitment to quality and value, especially with our proprietary brands. These initiatives are important in giving our members choices. Here are a few highlights: since the beginning of the year, we have introduced 3 new brands, Artisan fresh in deli and bakery, Simply Right in baby and health and beauty aids and Daily Chef in frozen foods and refrigerated products. These new brands represent close to 100 items this month, with plans to roll out 400 more by the end of Q1 next year. 
Early sales and member feedback are overwhelmingly positive with results at or above expectations in all 3 brands. Our regional management structure and improved training programs continue to help our operations team focus on winning the weekend. This focus on weekend performers has yielded positive results, and we are pleased with our weekend traffic and comp sales results. Our most recent member satisfaction survey results tell us that our members think we're on the right track. The survey showed an improvement across all metrics, with strong improvement in overall member satisfaction. Our July 4 eValue savings celebration, which gave all our member a taste of our successful eValues program, performed well. Compared to both last year's performance and the pre-event period, the savings celebration drew a higher percentage of members shopping, higher sales per member and an increase in members upgrading to Plus membership. Additionally, baskets that include eValues items had a higher value than those without an eValues item. 
Membership and other income was down 11 basis points as a percentage of sales when compared to the second quarter last year. It's important to explain what's driving this reduction in other income. Previously, we rented space to a third party for a portion of our wireless business. We are now running this business with Sam's Club associates. This means we no longer receive rental income from the third party as we have in prior years. The sales and expenses of our wireless business are now included directly in our operating results. While we are just a few months into the change, we're encouraged by the early results. Wireless sales performance in the back half of the quarter was better than expected, and we anticipate the overall effect of this change to be positive to our operating results. 
Membership income for the second quarter increased 1.2% versus last year. We continue to see a trend from the past several quarters of improving net membership results. Growth in membership income on a cash basis was strong. Renewals are increasing at a rate that has exceeded our expectation and outpaced last year's performance. Our penetration of Plus members continues to grow at a healthy pace. 
We have seen new sign of growth overall even as small business members continue to struggle in this economy. Our proprietary credit program continues to be well received by our members, driven by in-club marketing initiatives and an overall bounce back in the utilization of credit. We find that among members who use their Sam's Club credit product, overall engagement and retention is higher. For the third quarter, we anticipate continued positive momentum in membership. Gross margin rate increased by 9 basis points compared to the second quarter last year, while gross profit dollars increased 5.6%. As I mentioned earlier, we are experiencing inflation in several categories, and we are managing this impact across the business. We believe that inflation will continue to be a pressure point for the remainder of the year. 
I am very pleased with how our clubs manage expenses during the quarter. Driven by strong wage cost control, we reduced expenses as a percentage of sales by 32 basis points. You may recall that last year in this call, we discussed the impact of higher interchange fees related to the Sam's rewards credit program. I'm happy to say that even when this expense is excluded from last year's comparison, we leverage expenses by 14 basis points. For the quarter, sales per labor hour increased 1.9%, and units per labor hour increased 69 basis points. 
Looking at the bottom line, our second quarter operating income, without fuel, increased to $467 million, a 13.3% increase over second quarter last year. At the end of the second quarter, inventory, including fuel inventory, was up 5.5% compared to last year. Overall, we were pleased with inventory levels in our clubs and distribution centers. Our inventory increase is primarily due to inflation and to a lesser extent, a change in the seasonal transition of holiday merchandise. 
Looking ahead, our sales momentum remains strong. Our growth rates were strong in the back half of the second quarter and as we enter the first few weeks of the third quarter, our momentum has continued. It's important to remember that it was in the third quarter last year that our comp performance began to accelerate, so our comparisons for the back half will be more challenging. We expect comp club sales, without fuel, for the 13-week period from July 30 through October 28 to increase 3% to 5%. Last year, Sam's comp club sales, excluding fuel, increased 2.4% for the comparable 13-week period. 
Now I will turn the program over to Charles for a wrap up and guidance. Charles?"

As Mike said, we continue to be very focused on our financial priorities of growth, leverage and returns. I'm really proud of the way we continued to improve throughout the quarter despite the fragile global economy, which is obviously affecting consumers. I also want to note that Walmart's balance sheet and capacity continue to be an advantage, especially during the market volatility we have seen recently. Our ability to access short and long-term funding has never been better. This is a result of a strong Walmart business model. We still have many opportunities to improve around the world. 
In the second quarter, we had solid sales growth in international and Sam's, and we're progressing in Walmart U.S. We still have much work to do to drive top line growth, and we believe we are focused on the right initiatives. Despite the slowdown in the global economy, we continue to find very good growth opportunities for new stores across our global operations. We added 638 net units, with 315 units for Massmart, 147 units from Netto and 176 units through organic growth. Regarding acquisitions, we remain very thoughtful in acquiring new operations. Our focus will continue to be investing in companies that can deliver value to our customers and shareholders. 
Turning to leverage, our commitment to productivity and cost containment remains high. Although we were flat on this metric on a reported basis, I remain encouraged with our expense management. The underlying SG&A rose less than the rate of sales when you exclude FX losses and acquisition-related costs. Bear in mind that our efforts are not just simply focused on cutting expenses but on a blend of expense management and technology leverage to improve productivity. I want to point out that productivity improvements also help our associates serve our customers and members better and improve our cost structure. If we can save 1 or 2 seconds in every cashier transaction around the world, the savings can truly add up. 
As an example of a productivity initiative in our Walmart U.S. stores, we have implemented more one-touch freight, which optimizes the palette prior to arrival at the store. We're collaborating with suppliers to look at the entire supply chain as if it were vertically integrated to take unnecessary costs out of the system. We are also leveraging technology to enhance our workflow to make the workday more efficient for our store associates. 
As you have heard from us before, we know that strengthening price leadership starts with being the low-cost provider. As we continue to lower our cost, we will also be investing in price, helping our customers save money so they can live better. We will be relentless in widening the price gap, as Mike says, to pass savings along to our customers around the world. We believe that EDLP will lead to top line growth as customer traffic improves. 
And last, our priority of returns. On a rolling 12-month basis ending July 31, 2011, return on investment or ROI ended at 18.4%. ROI was impacted negatively by the acquisitions and currency. It's important to know that our underlying operations remain solid. 
As you know, our company remains committed to share repurchase. We announced a new $15 billion share repurchase authorization on June 3 at our Annual Shareholders meeting. Given our acquisition activity in the second quarter, we had less money dedicated to share repurchase. The combination of our annual dividend and share repurchase program indicate the strength of our company and our continued commitment to returning value to Walmart's shareholders. Our investment in SAP throughout the company is ongoing, and is designed to increase the consistency of our processes throughout the organization. While the majority of our businesses have converted or are underway, the effects of the conversion will continue into next year. The financial effects should be minimal. 
Now let's move on to guidance. Based on how we view our business relative to the economy and sales environment in the United States and throughout the world, we expect third quarter 2012 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $0.95 and $1, which compares to last year's third quarter earnings per share of $0.95. Last year's third quarter included $0.05 per share of tax benefits. We are narrowing the range of our full year earnings per share guidance and increasing it by $0.01. We now expect our full year earnings per share guidance to range between $4.41 and $4.51 versus our previously stated range of $4.35 to $4.50. All of the above EPS guidance assumes currency exchange rates remain at current levels. 
As I close, I'd like to summarize a few key points from today's call. First, our second quarter earnings per share of $1.09 was solidly within our guidance. Looking ahead, we are raising our full year EPS guidance. We continue to manage our business well despite a very tough global economy. Net sales increased 5.5% with contributions from all 3 operating segments. We are still on track to deliver our yearly sales growth target of 4% to 6%. We will use the productivity loop to deliver on our EDLC-EDLP model and are committed to leveraging expenses for the full year. Walmart has a very strong balance sheet that we believe is an important advantage as the global markets remain volatile. Last, we remain committed to delivering shareholder returns through a combination of share repurchase and dividends as we did in the second quarter. 
Thank you for your continued interest in Walmart and we look forward to seeing you in October for our investor meeting."

Thanks for joining us today for our earnings call to review the second quarter of fiscal year 2012. All information for this quarter, including our unit count, square feet and financial metrics is available on our website at walmartstores.com/investors. A full transcript of this call will be available on the website after 7:00 a.m. Central Time today on August 16, 2011. 
Mike Duke, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. will open the call with his thoughts and key highlights of the quarter. Jeff Davis, SVP of Finance and Treasurer, will cover the consolidated financial details, including information on certain items affecting our EPS. Then we'll go to the operating segments. Bill Simon, President and CEO of Walmart U.S. will begin our segment discussions. Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Walmart International, will follow Bill. Please note in his call, the clarifications on the impact of our acquisitions. We'll close the segment discussion with Brian Cornell, President and CEO of Sam's Club. And our CFO, Charles Holley, will wrap up with our financial report card and guidance. 
Before we discuss our second quarter performance, we do have a couple of reminders. You'll note in our press release that we have certain items affecting EPS this quarter, and Jeff will cover these shortly. As you know, we closed on the acquisitions of the 147 Netto stores in the U.K. and our majority interest in Massmart during this quarter. The Netto stores are fully consolidated into our financials but do not include any results from Massmart. The balance sheet from Massmart is consolidated using their fiscal year-end balance. Massmart continues to operate as a public company and closed their fiscal year on June 26. Massmart will report its year-end results on Thursday, August 25. 
Many of you often ask about what's included in the non-controlling or as we used to call minority interest line. This line primarily relates to non-controlling ownership interests in Mexico, which includes Central America, as well as Chile, Trust-Mart in China, India and now Massmart. Beginning in the third quarter, we will consolidate Massmart's operations in our consolidated financials on a 1-month lag, consistent with most of our international operations. Finally, let me remind you that our fiscal calendars for international differ from that of our corporate time line. All of our international countries, with the exception of Canada, end their fiscal year on December 31, while our U.S. and Canada operations end on January 31. 
Now Mike, let's get started with our Q2 results. Mike?"
313055,129808251,160148,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 16, 2011",2011-08-16,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Carol. Good morning, everyone. Today, Walmart is reporting second quarter earnings per share of $1.09 from continuing operations, which is a 12.4% increase over last year and near the top of our guidance. Let's get right to the key results. Net sa",1116,"Thanks, Carol. Good morning, everyone. Today, Walmart is reporting second quarter earnings per share of $1.09 from continuing operations, which is a 12.4% increase over last year and near the top of our guidance. Let's get right to the key results. Net sales increased 5.5% to $108.6 billion. Total U.S. comp sales, without fuel, were flat for the 13-week period. Sam's Club comps, without fuel, were up 5%, right at the top of the guidance for the period, and Walmart U.S. delivered comp sales within guidance at negative 0.9%. International reported net sales of $30 billion, a strong 16.2% increase. We also grew internationally through 2 significant acquisitions. 
Consolidated operating income increased 3.1%. Walmart ended the quarter with free cash flow of $4 billion. For the quarter, the company returned $2.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Operating expenses in the second quarter grew at the same rate as sales. We remain committed to the productivity loop and to strong expense management throughout the Walmart organization. We have the right initiatives in place to leverage for the full year. 
Let's move to the highlights of the individual segments. I'm encouraged by the sales improvements in our Walmart U.S. stores. Comps have improved sequentially month-to-month within the quarter. In fact, this was the best quarterly performance since the third quarter of fiscal 2010. The goal of the Walmart U.S. team remains positive comps by year end. In the second quarter, Bill Simon and the Walmart U.S. team completed the assortment add back in grocery for food and consumables, resulting in better customer traffic on this side of the store. We're making progress in expanding our general merchandise assortment and seeing positive comps in some categories such as sporting goods, but we still have work to do, and the team is focused on implementing the plan. 
I've recently observed several consumer focus groups, and it's clear that many consumers are still struggling. They're trading down to stretch their budgets, buying a lower-priced brand of detergent, moving from branded canned goods to private label and purchasing half gallons of milk instead of gallons. That's why we are laser-focused on investing in price to help our customers. There certainly are many reports on Walmart pricing and the fact is, that the gap has narrowed in some cases. We're committed to widening the gap on price, and we have a specific plan and timetable to deliver EDLP to every customer. 
Walmart U.S. also managed the business well in the second quarter, growing operating profit faster than sales to nearly $5 billion. Walmart International has strong growth again through a combination of comps and new stores. Second quarter sales grew 16.2% with sales growth in all markets except Japan, which is still recovering from the natural disasters. The international segment is an increasingly important part of our growth story and operating income improved nearly 9% in the second quarter. 
I am pleased that we closed on the acquisitions of Netto and Massmart, and integration is well underway in the U.K. and Africa. I'm excited about helping underserved customers in sub-Saharan Africa, and I'm also excited about the 15,000 jobs that we expect to create on the continent over the next 5 years. You'll hear more from Doug McMillon about the significant new store growth in Latin America this quarter led by Mexico. 
Every Day Low Price remains one of our strongest competitive advantages, and we continue to use this strategy in more of our international markets. We're transitioning to EDLP in Brazil and Central America. We recognize that it takes time to implement EDLP fully in a market, but we believe this is right for our customers over the long term. 
Sam's Club continued its strong momentum in the second quarter, delivering a 5% comp without fuel. This is the sixth straight quarter of comp improvement for Sam's, a testament to the team's execution to drive quality, value and savings for members. I'm also pleased with the momentum in membership income as Sam's improves its renewals and upgrades. Sam's also delivered strong operating income, driven in part by very good fuel sales and Sam's leveraged operating expenses. The strategy to win the weekend that Brian Cornell and his team have in place will position Sam's Club well for the back half of the year. 
In the second quarter, our global e-commerce team stepped-up its work on delivering a continuous shopping experience to customers from the store to the Web to their mobile devices. In mature markets, we're investing in multi-channel initiatives by integrating our stores with online services. We completed the rollout of Pick Up Today in all Walmart U.S. stores and within the last month, we announced that VUDU, our movie streaming technology, is now available on Walmart.com, as well as through any iPad browser. 
Walmart's brand and scale, coupled with consumers' need for value, also gives us opportunities in some of the fastest growing markets in the world today. In June, we established Walmart's China e-commerce headquarters in Shanghai, and we put in place the leadership team to quickly build this business. We are investing in the right talent and technology to pursue the growth in e-commerce. I believe that Walmart is the best positioned retailer to serve the needs of the next-generation customers who are striving to join the emerging global middle class. They're connected to the world through smartphones and social media. They have higher expectations of value, quality and a better life. We will continue to advocate for policies that make sense for our customers and our business. 
In the U.S., we're pleased by the momentum around e-fairness, legislation to eliminate the unfair advantage that online-only retailers currently have. Recently, we've seen the passage of laws in key states like California, Illinois and Texas, strong efforts from the small business community and a clearer call for reform from our nation's editorial pages. We're encouraged by the growing interest in a federal response to this issue as well. We will remain engaged in the debate in Washington. 
We've also called for modernizing our nation's corporate tax code. Last month, I testified before the U.S. Senate Finance Committee on reforming the tax code to drive job growth here at home and encourage America's competitiveness abroad. To achieve comprehensive reform, we've called for putting everything on the table including the existing incentives that benefit us. There are 3 key points that I emphasized to the committee: one, lower their corporate tax rate; two, get rid of existing incentives that benefit some industries over others; and three, level the international playing field with a territorial system. 
Now I'll turn it over to Jeff for the detailed financial report. Jeff?"
313055,129808251,160148,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 16, 2011",2011-08-16,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. For the second quarter of fiscal 2012, Walmart reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.09, which was within our guidance of $1.05 to $1.10. The $1.09 compares to $0.97 for the second quarter of last year. Inco",937,"Thank you, Mike. For the second quarter of fiscal 2012, Walmart reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.09, which was within our guidance of $1.05 to $1.10. The $1.09 compares to $0.97 for the second quarter of last year. Income from continuing operations included certain pretax items as follows: We recorded an approximate $49 million mark-to-market loss on certain foreign currency derivative positions related to the Massmart acquisition. We realized costs of approximately $36 million related to the acquisitions of Netto and Massmart. We recognized expenses of approximately $30 million related to the damages from tornadoes and floods in our United States operations. These items totaled $115 million and are included in our operating expenses. In addition, Walmart Mexico recorded an approximate $17 million revaluation charge from the implementation of the SAP financial system, which Doug will provide additional details later. The combination of these expense and gross margin items on EPS from continuing operations was approximately $0.03. 
Now let's move to the rest of the P&L. Consolidated net sales increased 5.5% or $5.6 billion to $108.6 billion for the quarter. The increase was driven primarily by Walmart International and Sam's Club and included a currency exchange benefit of $2.3 billion. Sales for Massmart were reported in our operating results starting in the third quarter. Total U.S. comp sales, without fuel, for the 13-week period ended July 29 were flat and negative 20 basis points for the 26-week period. You will hear more details on the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club comp sales from Bill and Brian. 
For the quarter, gross margin on sales was 24.7%, a 10-basis point reduction compared to last year. Sam's Club fuel sales were the primary contributor to the margin decline. Unallocated corporate overhead and other, which includes our ongoing investment in global e-commerce increased approximately 21.8% to $509 million for the second quarter. Excluding the $49 million loss on mark-to-market foreign currency derivative positions I mentioned earlier and our global e-commerce initiatives, our core corporate overhead expenses increased 2.9%.
Consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of sales were flat to last year at 19.5%. Operating expenses grew at the same rate as sales or 5.5%. Excluding the items affecting operating expenses that I previously mentioned, the company leveraged operating expenses for the second quarter. To reiterate what Mike said, the company is committed to leveraging operating expenses for the full year, and we have focused expense management initiatives in place throughout the company. 
Consolidated operating income, which included a $110 million currency benefit was $6.4 billion, a 3.1% increase versus last year. Net interest expense for the quarter increased 19.2% to $578 million. The increase in interest expense was a result of higher debt levels as we opportunistically issued new debt over the last 12 months at historically low rates. The higher debt levels were partially offset by lower rates on outstanding debt. Going forward, we expect the percentage growth and net interest expense to moderate, but remain in low- to mid-teens through the balance of the year. 
The additional debt raised our debt-to-total capitalization ratio to 45.7% at the end of the second quarter compared to 43.2% last year. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 32.2%. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 to be at the lower end of our range of 33.5% to 34.5%, although we may see quarterly fluctuations. Our effective tax rate may be impacted by a number of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations. 
Income from continuing operations attributable to Walmart was $3.8 billion, an increase of 5.7% over last year. During the second quarter, the company repurchased $1.4 billion of shares, representing approximately 26.1 million shares which brings the year-to-date repurchase to $3.5 billion or 65.4 million shares. In June, the board approved a new $15 billion repurchase authorization, which has $14.1 billion remaining. In addition to the share repurchases, Walmart returned to shareholders $1.3 billion in dividends during the quarter and $2.5 billion year-to-date. So in summary, Walmart returned $2.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase during the second quarter with $6.1 billion year-to-date. 
Consolidated inventory grew 11.1% compared to last year. Walmart International was the main contributor to the increase, primarily driven by currency evaluation, acquisitions and significant international growth. Payables as a percentage of inventories were 90% versus 98% in the prior year. Last year's percentage received a benefit from the timing of payment cycles, which resulted in a higher-than-normal payables balance. Capital expenditures were approximately $3.3 billion for the second quarter compared to $3 billion in the prior year. We added growth in virtually every country with 176 net new units, excluding acquisitions of which 113 units were opened in Mexico. 
Free cash flow remained strong. We ended the quarter with a positive free cash flow of $4 billion compared to $4.5 billion last year. As I mentioned earlier, the increase in accounts payables from the timing of payment cycles enhanced free cash flow last year. 
Return on investment or ROI for the trailing 12 months ended July 31, 2011, was 18.4% compared to 19% for the prior year. The majority of the decline in ROI is attributable to acquisitions in currency. We are always aware that acquisitions like Netto and Massmart can have a short-term impact on company ROI. On the other hand, these acquisitions added 462 new units and 18.4 million square feet this quarter. 
Now we'll turn to our operating segments. We'll start with Walmart U.S. Bill?"
313055,129808251,160148,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 16, 2011",2011-08-16,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jeff. The goal at Walmart U.S. remains clear.

Our custo",1889,"Thank you, Jeff. The goal at Walmart U.S. remains clear. Deliver positive comps by year end, and our plan is straightforward, and it's also working. We're expanding our assortment of merchandise backed with Walmart's Every Day Low Price promise. Our customer response is reflected in the improved results we saw in the second quarter. Walmart U.S. gained sales momentum throughout the quarter after a difficult May, which was impacted by high prices at the gas pump and severe spring weather. Our sales trend improved in June and again in July. In fact, our July $454 million comp was positive, and we improved in both customer traffic and ticket as the quarter progressed. 
Our net sales rose approximately 40 basis points to $64.9 billion for the second quarter. Comp sales for the 13-week period ending July 29 was inside our guidance at negative 0.9% and the best quarterly comp performance in almost 2 years. Ticket was positive every month of the quarter. Traffic, which drove more than half of the comp, improved sequentially each month. Better traffic was driven in part by the 90-day rollback program at the gas pump. This program, which is available in 18 states saves customers $0.10 a gallon on gas and diesel when using a reloadable Walmart gift card or credit card. 
Grocery and health and wellness, which represent 2/3 of our sales revenue, continue to deliver positive comps. We also saw trend improvements in all other businesses except entertainment. This improvement is attributable to our focus on expanding merchandise assortment, price leadership and increased in-stock levels. Weather trends across the country later in the quarter also helped. 
The economy remains challenging for our core customers. Customers are still consolidating trips due to higher year-over-year gas prices. The swings in sales due to paycheck cycles remain pronounced, and our stores must staff and stock for the volatility both up-and-down. We also have seen an increase in the number of customers relying on government assistance for food and necessities for their family. Our grocery business continued its positive trend and again delivered low-single digit positive comps for the period. Food remains a key traffic driver to our stores. The strong performance during the July 4 weekend offset softness in the Memorial Day weekend. 
Sales across dry grocery continue to accelerate from additional assortment. Sales of consumables also improved over the first quarter. We continue to see strength in our new modular programs that are bringing back assortment and had strong seasonal performance in pets and beauty, both of which delivered basis points comp improvement in the triple digits versus the first quarter. While we saw an increase in grocery inflation of approximately 3.5% during the quarter, customers remain under continued pressure and are trading down to lower price points and smaller pack sizes, as well as opting out of discretionary purchases. As a result, we're seeing minimal pass-through of inflation to sales. 
Food inflation has replaced gasoline price as the most important household expense concern. In addition, more than 15% of Walmart moms in our monthly survey have experienced the loss of a household wage earner's job in the last year. Almost 40% of these Walmart moms indicate they're holding off or eliminating items they would normally buy, reinforcing the need for us to drive Every Day Low Price. Moms of all income levels showed a drop in confidence over the last year, with middle-income moms showing the greatest drop. And our health and wellness business again delivered a low-single digit positive comp driven by the strength of our prescription business. We continue to benefit from the additional traffic in our pharmacies as a result of the Humana program and our optical business benefited from the kick-off of our $29 back-to-school eyewear offering. We expect the momentum to continue in the third quarter as more parents get their children ready for school. 
Neighborhood markets posted positive comps for 15 consecutive months now, delivering a comp of over 3% for the second quarter. This format reflects the ongoing strength of our food and health and wellness business. Overall, apparel comps declined in the mid-single digits during the second quarter, which includes approximately 300 basis points improvement from the first quarter. This performance was driven by ongoing business initiatives, especially in our basic apparel offering, an improvement in sales of summer merchandise tied to the warm weather. Men's, ladies and our baby apparel delivered the best comps for the period. Our children's apparel, shoes and intimate departments remain soft. 
We are well positioned to gain sales and share for the important back-to-school season. We are expanding our offerings in important categories to regain customers, and we're adding back items in key brands. We're confident that the back half of the year will see ongoing improvement in apparel sales. 
Comp sales for home declined in the mid-single digits for the quarter. We remain committed to strengthening this important category. Better weather versus the first quarter drove customers to our Outdoor Living department. We were ready, given our expanded assortments and innovation across the categories. However, there appears to have been a trade-off in indoor living categories. Customers are opting out of decor items for their homes or they're trading down. 
Entertainment had high-single digit negative comp sales for the quarter. As others have reported, media and gaming continue to experience significant headwinds. New movie releases from last year were also a headwind. However, customers do shop for value and our $5 movie bin continues to do very well. Double-digit deflation in TV prices still exist, but our unit sales were up again. Customers want innovation and tablets continue to sell very well. We continued to see strength in our prepaid wireless business, although as you know, we record this as a net commission in our comp sales as opposed to its full transactional value. 
Straight Talk remains a billion dollar plus brand for Walmart U.S. Within toys, we gained momentum as the quarter progressed. Sales of licensed toys associated with new movie releases and seasonal items including pools, water toys and bikes improved significantly. 
Hardlines had low-single digit negative comp sales but improved over the first quarter. Favorable weather drove sales across sporting goods, especially hunting, fishing and camping and air movement-related products. New modulars in stationery and crafts helped push items in these categories. Tires sales continue to do well for automotive. 
We’ve spoken often about multi-channel retailing, allowing customers to shop on their own terms. We're now moving towards a strategy called continuous channel shopping, recognizing the continued integration of customers using web-based devices to shop our stores and to research and shop online as well. Today, roughly 60% of walmart.com sales involve the stores through services such as Site to Store and Pick Up Today. In fact, some of our highest volume Site to Store sales come out of large metropolitan areas such as New York City and the San Francisco Bay Area. 
During second quarter, we also launched a delivery and installation service program for electronics. We're providing delivery, setup and installation for TVs. We also offer basic setup for home theater and wireless networks. The in-home service network has up to 50,000 technicians available who'll service our customers. Our prices are very competitive and this now puts us on par with other electronics retailers. 
Now I'll cover the remaining financial results. Our gross profit dollars were up 1.2% over last year second quarter, growing faster than the rate of sales. We lapped last year's deep rollback program in the second quarter, which we expected to impact our rate comparison this quarter. Additionally, our logistics team continues to drive routing and load efficiencies, allowing us to minimize the majority of the headwinds associated with rising diesel prices impacting the cost of goods. In fact, rising diesel costs were a headwind, 2/3 of which were mitigated by these transportation initiatives. 
SG&A was up approximately 70 basis points compared to last year. Slightly higher payroll-related expenses, management incentive plan accruals, as well as the storm-related damages Jeff mentioned earlier were the primary drivers for the increase in SG&A. These increases were partially offset by lower advertising spend versus last year and a reduction in our accident costs related to store operations. Operating income grew faster than sales for the quarter. Operating income rose 2.1% over last year to almost $5 billion. 
Inventory was up 4.8% compared to this time last year, which on a year-over-year quarter comparable is 150 basis points lower than what I reported last quarter. Productivity gains offset inventory growth that was primarily driven by inflation, new stores and assortment add-back initiatives I mentioned. In short, inventory is moving back in line with where we'd like it to be. We're focused on growing our business also through new stores and our priority remains supercenter growth. We added 18 supercenters this quarter, including new and converted stores. We're very pleased with the opening of the first 4 Walmart Express units and the initial results are positive. Let me remind you, these are still pilot stores, and we're testing different formats. 
Our Neighborhood Market format is delivering a return at the same level as our supercenters, which have the best ROI in the company. These results have encouraged us to move faster on expanding our grocery format. Our multi-year development pipeline has approved 180 Neighborhood Markets through our real estate committee, and we'll announce more details on these growth plans in October. 
We're moving forward with our remodel plan that we discussed last quarter. In addition to reducing the costs of remodels, we expect faster completions and significantly less customer disruption. In July, we entered into an agreement with the Nielsen company to share our point of sales data, which will provide deeper insights into customer purchasing and unmet needs, both nationally and in key local markets. The data will cover grocery including food, consumables and health and wellness categories, except for prescriptions.
This agreement will better equip our merchant to evaluate their business and optimize assortment, pricing and promotion. It will enable our store operators to react and quickly make changes in their local stores. And the data's analysis puts us in a better position to identify category opportunities in the U.S. and collaborate with suppliers to develop customer-driven programs. 
Based on the start of August sales, we're confident that our plans are working, and we'll see ongoing sales improvement. We expect comp sales for the 13-week period from July 30 through October 28 to be between minus 1% and plus 1%. Last year's third quarter 13-week comp was negative 1.3%. Timing of our calendar ending on Friday means a large portion of the Halloween sales could fall into the fourth quarter period. We still remain concerned about the increased economic pressure on our customers and the uncertain impact it will have on their shopping behavior. With the ongoing economic volatility, it's important as ever to deliver on our one-stop shopping promise, a broad assortment of merchandise backed with Every Day Low Price. 
We remain committed to the productivity loop and our goal of leveraging operating expense. We will continue to invest in price to help our customers weather the economy, so gross profit should be flat to slightly down for the third quarter. 
Now I'll turn it over to Doug for the international update."

During our briefing following our Shareholders Meeting on June 3, I laid out our key initiatives for leveraging our scale and expertise in the Walmart International markets. They included making progress on EDLP as a global pricing philosophy, enhancing the productivity loop to get costs down, further developing global talent and sharing ideas back-and-forth with the U.S. businesses, both Walmart and Sam's Club. It's only been a couple of months since then, and I'm happy to report that we have already made progress on each of these areas. I'm also proud to share some important milestones that Walmart International achieved in the second quarter. As you know, ASDA completed its acquisition of 147 Netto stores in the U.K. ASDA has already converted more than 60 of these stores, which now have more than 4x the number of products than previously offered. This means customers can find what they need for the entire week just as they do in ASDA superstores. 
In addition, we completed our 51% acquisition of Massmart. Massmart is a leading general merchandise retailer and basics foods wholesaler in sub-Saharan Africa and the second largest in consumer goods. As you heard, we will include the results from our countries in Africa in our third fiscal quarter. In terms of sharing ideas back and forth, South African suppliers offer an important opportunity for us to bring new and exciting merchandise to our other markets. Recently, we contracted with Ocean Fresh, a South African seafood supplier to export sustainably sourced wild hake, a fish, to our stores in the United States. This is helping to create 100 jobs in South Africa, and we believe this is the first indicator of even more opportunities on the continent. To recognize our new partnership with our customers in sub-Saharan Africa, we have launched our Working Together to Save You Money campaign, offering price reductions in Massmart’s stores for an extended period of time. 
Now let's get to the numbers. Walmart International reported second quarter net sales of $30.1 billion, an increase of 16.2% over last year. Changes in currency rates increased our net sales by $2.3 billion. As a reminder, our markets benefited this fiscal quarter from Easter sales and in the United Kingdom, the royal wedding. Last year, second quarter results benefited from sales related to the World Cup. So in some cases, there were difficult comp sales comparisons. 
On a constant-currency basis, net sales were $27.8 billion, an increase of 7.1% over last year’s second quarter. All of our markets had constant currency sales growth, except in Japan, where sales were affected by the March 2011 natural disasters. Mexico, the U.K., Canada, Brazil and China provided the strongest net sales growth in the second quarter. As a percentage of sales, Walmart International second quarter constant currency gross profit margin and other income was flat to last year. Second quarter reported operating expenses were $6 billion, which includes an increase of $500 million due to changes in currency exchange rates. Although Japan, Brazil, the U.K. and Chile had expense leverage in the second quarter, Walmart International's constant currency operating expenses grew faster than sales at 9.4%. 
Our second quarter reported operating income grew 8.9% from last year to $1.4 billion, and this includes a benefit of $110 million from changes in currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, operating income grew 50 basis points. Excluding the $53 million in charges that Jeff mentioned and the $14 million impact on costs associated with the integration of Netto, Walmart International grew constant currency operating income 5.6%. Inventory management continues to be a challenge as days on hand increased over last year in most of our markets. Our constant currency inventory, excluding Massmart, grew 11.1% as we added a significant number of stores in most of our markets. 
Now let's get into the results for several of our larger markets. Country management teams are held accountable for their results on a constant currency basis. The following discussion of country results excludes the impact of currency and unless otherwise stated, sales and comp sales are presented on a nominal basis. Comp sales are reported on a calendar basis. We'll kick off this quarter with the U.K. ASDA had a solid second quarter, growing sales excluding fuel ahead of last year. However, operating income declined due to $31 million of costs related to Netto. Adjusting for fuel sales and Netto, ASDA grew operating income faster than sales. 
In the second quarter of this year, comparable sales, excluding fuel, increased 50 basis points. Traffic decreased by 120 basis points and average ticket increased 170 basis points. Customers are consolidating their trips in the face of high fuel prices. ASDA grew expenses slower than sales in the second quarter, leveraging on tight expense management. After excluding the Netto costs, ASDA's expenses declined from last year. ASDA continues to gain recognition for saving people money everyday, supported by the 10% online price guarantee and now more than 250,000 baskets are being checked online by customers each week. As a clear statement to the quality our customers can find, ASDA's private brands and other products have won more than 300 awards so far this year, including Retail Champion at the International Cheese Awards, Meat and Fish Retailer of the Year and numerous other wine awards. 
In June, ASDA was recognized as the price leader by the Grocer magazine as the lowest priced supermarket for the 14th year running. So it was no surprise that there were long lines of customers on grand opening day at our converted Netto stores. In these stores, customers will receive the same ASDA low prices, the 10% price guarantee and in-store pickup from online shopping. 
Including the stores from the Netto acquisition, ASDA's total store count was 536 at the end of the second quarter. Economic indicators suggest that 2011 will remain a challenging year for our U.K. consumers, and we're confident that ASDA and its Netto store conversions are entering the second half of the year with good momentum, delivering availability and Every Day Low Prices. 
Finally, Judith McKenna, who spent several years as ASDA's Chief Financial Officer has been promoted to Chief Operating Officer. Judith has a long track record of success, and we look forward to her experience in ASDA's operations. Congratulations, Judith. 
Let's move to the Americas. In previous earnings discussions, I discussed only the results of Mexico and Central America separately in this section. Now that one year's passed since our Central American operations have been combined into Walmex, we will discuss the results of the consolidated company going forward. While the following results are on a U.S. GAAP basis, Walmex separately reports its earnings under Mexican GAAP. So some numbers are different from the Walmex reported results. 
Overall, Walmex sales grew at a fast rate, but operating income declined from last year second quarter due to the noncash accounting charge mentioned earlier by Jeff. As we mentioned last quarter, our operations in Mexico went live with the SAP implementation during Q2. This effort increased the level of precision for inventory valuation and the result was a noncash accounting charge of $17 million. Walmex's consolidated net sales for the second quarter were up 9.1%. Comparable sales from Mexico were up 1.1%. Average ticket in Mexico increased 2.2%, and customer traffic declined 1.1%. Comp stores in Central America were up 6.2% on a constant-currency basis. 
As Walmex noted in its earnings call on July 19, our teams continued to strengthen its EDLP position in Mexico, and we've converted to EDLP in each of our 5 Central American countries, making permanent price reductions on more than 12,000 items. We've also converted all of our Central American supercenters to the Walmart brand. 
Mexico's second quarter consolidated comp store sales for the self-service formats grew by 1.9%, while ANTAD's comp store sales report for the rest of the industry, exuding Walmex, grew faster at 2.2%. In the second quarter, Walmex advanced its investment schedule for new stores and logistics modernization and opened 129 stores in this quarter as compared to 57 in the second quarter of last year. An aggressive, but steady, rate of new store openings is part of the new store growth plan. And Walmex has achieved 45% of planned floor expansion to date. We will begin to see the sales from these new stores in our third fiscal quarter as the majority were opened at the end of June. 
Second quarter gross margin as a percentage of sales was flat to last year. Walmex's consolidated second quarter operating income declined 5.3% from last year and decreased 2.2% from last year after excluding the noncash inventory charge. Walmex's expenses grew faster than sales at 14.1% from last year, primarily due to the new stores. With 394 more stores than at the end of the second quarter of last year, Walmex is well positioned for the rest of the year. 
Moving on to Brazil. Net sales grew in the second quarter; however, operating income declined from last year. As part of our progress in implementing EDLP as a global pricing philosophy, Brazil began its EDLP conversion earlier this year. The number of items converted to date represents a large portion of Brazil's overall sales. Brazil's second quarter net sales grew and comparable sales grew from last year. Average ticket increased 7.4% and customer traffic declined 4.6%. We believe that the investment in EDLP is right for our ultimate success in the marketplace and more important, best for our customers. 
Second quarter gross profit margin and expenses, both as a percentage of sales, declined slightly from last year. So in terms of enhancing the productivity loop, Brazil is making progress. Brazil has a long history of sustainability initiatives and this is an area where Walmart can make a big difference and contribute savings for the company and our customers as well. Walmart Brazil is partnered with 13 of the largest multinational suppliers to review end-to-end sustainability and reduce our impact on the environment. 
In the past 12 months, we have opened 42 net new stores in Brazil, bringing our total store count to 487. This includes 7 new stores in the second quarter of this year. And for Canada, Walmart Canada had solid sales growth in the second quarter of this year with operating income growing faster than sales. Net sales grew 5% in the second quarter compared to last year, primarily due to the supercenter expansion program and strong sales in many merchandise categories. Second quarter comparable sales increased 1.2% from last year. Average ticket increased 2.1% for the second quarter and traffic declined 0.9% for comparable stores. 
Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased 62 basis points from last year as Canada's merchants continue to be very focused on inventory management. Expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased only 31 basis points from last year, primarily from the increase in costs from growing Walmart Canada Bank. Walmart Canada has been successful in managing its expenses by placing a significant focus on enhancing supercenter productivity. And this contributed to the 10% increase in operating income from last year. Canada's supercenter presence continues to grow at a faster rate. In addition to 9 store expansions and 9 in-box conversions this year, we expect to open about 40 new supercenters this year. Currently, just over 8 million customers a week visit our Canadian stores. Our goal is to have customer shop the entire store, and we're working on further strengthening all of our merchandise categories. In the past 12 months, we opened 10 new stores in Canada, bringing our store count to 329 stores. 
Moving to Asia, Japan's constant currency sales declined in the second fiscal quarter, but operating income grew when compared to last year. Japan's second quarter results include the effects of the March 2011 natural disasters, which continue to affect the entire country in many ways such as brownouts, food shortages and contamination fears. Three of our stores in Japan have yet to reopen. According to statistics released by the Japanese Ministry of the Economy Trade and Industry, or METI, overall supermarket comparable sales for the second quarter declined by 1.7% from last year. When comparing our performance to these METI results, our comp performance continues to stay ahead of other large-scale retailers in Japan. 
Second quarter net sales declined 1.6% from last year and comparable sales declined 28 basis points, both in real terms. Walmart Japan's traffic declined 23 basis points from last year, and the average ticket in real terms declined 5 basis points. Walmart Japan has recently announced permanent EDLP reductions on 1,000 items at a time when our customers need it the most. Sales and general merchandise had the strongest performance as customers prepared for energy shortages and restrictions. Sales of televisions were higher than normal as the expiration of analog television signals nears. 
Gross profit margin as a percentage of sales was flat to last year, and Japan leveraged expenses even in these trying times. Expenses as a percentage of sales declined 49 basis points from last year. Steve Dacus, who was serving as Chief Operating Officer, was promoted to CEO of Walmart Japan in June. His extensive experience in Japanese retail, combined with his time in our Sam's operations in the U.S. position him very well to lead our team. Congratulations, Steve. 
While Walmart China sales continue to grow in the second quarter, the sales growth was not enough to offset the increase in expenses. As a result, China had a small loss from operations. Net sales for the second quarter grew 9.7% over last year and comparable store growth was 1.8%. Average ticket grew 10% in China, but traffic declined 8.2%. The primary traffic decline was in our Trust-Mart Stores. In April, we obtained antitrust clearance to purchase the remaining interest in Trust-Mart. We began the rebranding of our Trust-Mart stores in the third quarter of this year, which provides us the first opportunity to communicate the new types of merchandise already being offered in our Trust-Mart stores. Expenses as a percentage of sales, grew 244 basis points, increasing from last year as result of additional government levies and new store growth. Second quarter gross margin increased 103 basis points over last year as our Trust-Mart stores can now take advantage of leverage opportunities from our Walmart stores. 
In the past 12 months, we opened 53 new stores including 48 supercenters and that brings our China store count to 344 stores. I'd like to congratulate Sean Clarke on his promotion to Chief Operating Officer of Walmart China. Sean has spent several years as the Chief Financial Officer in Canada, and we look forward to leveraging his experience into our Chinese operations. 
In closing, all of our markets are focused on our key goals of delivering growth, leverage and returns with organic growth of 24 million square feet since the second quarter of last year and the acquisition of an additional 18.4 million square feet in the second quarter of this year, we are well positioned to drive growth for the balance of the year. 
Now I'll turn it over to Brian for the news on Sam's Club. Brian?"

I am very pleased to give the Sam's Club update today. We had an outstanding second quarter. Sam's Club posted its sixth quarter of sequential improvement as comp club sales, excluding fuel, increased 5%, at the top of our range. We have the best momentum in membership we've seen in years, driven by strong renewals and growth in members joining at the Plus level. Not only did we leverage expenses, but we also grew operating profit without fuel by 13.3%, much faster than the growth in sales. Similar to first quarter, our fuel business was strong during the quarter. We are pumping more gallons of fuel and generating more sales dollars per gallon this year versus last year. Fuel prices in this year's second quarter are approximately 43% higher than a year ago and gallons sold are up 16%. Fuel price is an important first price impression for our members, reminding them the value of their membership. 
Including fuel, second quarter net sales were $13.6 billion, a 9.5% increase over last year and operating income increased 15% to $492 million. Volatility and fuel prices can have a notable impact on our financial results. Our discussion today, therefore, is focused on our core business and excludes fuel for comparative purposes, unless otherwise noted. 
Now let's look at the financial results and our achievements for the quarter. Net sales for the second quarter were $12 billion, up 4.9% from last year. Comp club sales for the 13-week period increased 5%, and we're strong across all 3 geographic operating divisions. We are particularly pleased with the sales strength of our Western division, which includes 22 states located in the Western U.S. Recall that we have 3 divisions in Sam's Club, each headed by a seasoned SVP. Comp traffic and ticket increased for the 13-week period by 2.6 and 2.4 percentage points, respectively. Comp traffic and ticket increased for both Advantage and Business members. 
The quality of our sales growth in our core categories was very strong, despite the over 100-basis point headwind we had from tobacco sales. We continue to face challenges in tobacco sales. The industry is softer than last year. In addition, since we changed the credit card rewards program, there is a greater impact on members who shop this category heavily. We anticipate tobacco being a headwind for the rest of the year. We continue to focus on categories our members tell us are most important to them such as fresh and health and wellness to optimize our growth. We also want to be the price leader in everyday needs items. This is contributing to strong ticket and traffic performance despite inflation pressure. Our fresh business delivered high-single digit comps for the quarter led by bakery, produce, meat and whole meal solutions. These results are driven by high-quality standards we have in place. 
Dry grocery and beverage comps were in the mid-single digits. In beverages, hot weather categories such as soda and sports drinks performed very well. Comps for our health and wellness area were in the mid-single digits. Sam's free in-club health screenings are driving traffic and pharmacies script growth. 
Despite the challenging economy, we continue to see good results in discretionary areas, including home and apparel. Driven by very strong sales in men's, children's and basic areas, apparel achieved a double-digit comp increase this quarter. Our home line area achieved a high-single digit comp as kitchen electrics, housewares and domestics were all strong. Even with average selling price deflation, our consumer electronics business delivered a mid-single digit comp sales increase. New products like tablets are driving greater sales in electronics. 
Overall, we believe that inflation impacted our comp sales by 200 to 250 basis points. We continue to see mid-single digit inflation in key food categories. However, we have managed through these price increases with little impact on margin. Despite the impact of inflation, we continue to see growth in units sold year-over-year. We continue to deliver on our commitment to quality and value, especially with our proprietary brands. These initiatives are important in giving our members choices. Here are a few highlights: since the beginning of the year, we have introduced 3 new brands, Artisan fresh in deli and bakery, Simply Right in baby and health and beauty aids and Daily Chef in frozen foods and refrigerated products. These new brands represent close to 100 items this month, with plans to roll out 400 more by the end of Q1 next year. 
Early sales and member feedback are overwhelmingly positive with results at or above expectations in all 3 brands. Our regional management structure and improved training programs continue to help our operations team focus on winning the weekend. This focus on weekend performers has yielded positive results, and we are pleased with our weekend traffic and comp sales results. Our most recent member satisfaction survey results tell us that our members think we're on the right track. The survey showed an improvement across all metrics, with strong improvement in overall member satisfaction. Our July 4 eValue savings celebration, which gave all our member a taste of our successful eValues program, performed well. Compared to both last year's performance and the pre-event period, the savings celebration drew a higher percentage of members shopping, higher sales per member and an increase in members upgrading to Plus membership. Additionally, baskets that include eValues items had a higher value than those without an eValues item. 
Membership and other income was down 11 basis points as a percentage of sales when compared to the second quarter last year. It's important to explain what's driving this reduction in other income. Previously, we rented space to a third party for a portion of our wireless business. We are now running this business with Sam's Club associates. This means we no longer receive rental income from the third party as we have in prior years. The sales and expenses of our wireless business are now included directly in our operating results. While we are just a few months into the change, we're encouraged by the early results. Wireless sales performance in the back half of the quarter was better than expected, and we anticipate the overall effect of this change to be positive to our operating results. 
Membership income for the second quarter increased 1.2% versus last year. We continue to see a trend from the past several quarters of improving net membership results. Growth in membership income on a cash basis was strong. Renewals are increasing at a rate that has exceeded our expectation and outpaced last year's performance. Our penetration of Plus members continues to grow at a healthy pace. 
We have seen new sign of growth overall even as small business members continue to struggle in this economy. Our proprietary credit program continues to be well received by our members, driven by in-club marketing initiatives and an overall bounce back in the utilization of credit. We find that among members who use their Sam's Club credit product, overall engagement and retention is higher. For the third quarter, we anticipate continued positive momentum in membership. Gross margin rate increased by 9 basis points compared to the second quarter last year, while gross profit dollars increased 5.6%. As I mentioned earlier, we are experiencing inflation in several categories, and we are managing this impact across the business. We believe that inflation will continue to be a pressure point for the remainder of the year. 
I am very pleased with how our clubs manage expenses during the quarter. Driven by strong wage cost control, we reduced expenses as a percentage of sales by 32 basis points. You may recall that last year in this call, we discussed the impact of higher interchange fees related to the Sam's rewards credit program. I'm happy to say that even when this expense is excluded from last year's comparison, we leverage expenses by 14 basis points. For the quarter, sales per labor hour increased 1.9%, and units per labor hour increased 69 basis points. 
Looking at the bottom line, our second quarter operating income, without fuel, increased to $467 million, a 13.3% increase over second quarter last year. At the end of the second quarter, inventory, including fuel inventory, was up 5.5% compared to last year. Overall, we were pleased with inventory levels in our clubs and distribution centers. Our inventory increase is primarily due to inflation and to a lesser extent, a change in the seasonal transition of holiday merchandise. 
Looking ahead, our sales momentum remains strong. Our growth rates were strong in the back half of the second quarter and as we enter the first few weeks of the third quarter, our momentum has continued. It's important to remember that it was in the third quarter last year that our comp performance began to accelerate, so our comparisons for the back half will be more challenging. We expect comp club sales, without fuel, for the 13-week period from July 30 through October 28 to increase 3% to 5%. Last year, Sam's comp club sales, excluding fuel, increased 2.4% for the comparable 13-week period. 
Now I will turn the program over to Charles for a wrap up and guidance. Charles?"

As Mike said, we continue to be very focused on our financial priorities of growth, leverage and returns. I'm really proud of the way we continued to improve throughout the quarter despite the fragile global economy, which is obviously affecting consumers. I also want to note that Walmart's balance sheet and capacity continue to be an advantage, especially during the market volatility we have seen recently. Our ability to access short and long-term funding has never been better. This is a result of a strong Walmart business model. We still have many opportunities to improve around the world. 
In the second quarter, we had solid sales growth in international and Sam's, and we're progressing in Walmart U.S. We still have much work to do to drive top line growth, and we believe we are focused on the right initiatives. Despite the slowdown in the global economy, we continue to find very good growth opportunities for new stores across our global operations. We added 638 net units, with 315 units for Massmart, 147 units from Netto and 176 units through organic growth. Regarding acquisitions, we remain very thoughtful in acquiring new operations. Our focus will continue to be investing in companies that can deliver value to our customers and shareholders. 
Turning to leverage, our commitment to productivity and cost containment remains high. Although we were flat on this metric on a reported basis, I remain encouraged with our expense management. The underlying SG&A rose less than the rate of sales when you exclude FX losses and acquisition-related costs. Bear in mind that our efforts are not just simply focused on cutting expenses but on a blend of expense management and technology leverage to improve productivity. I want to point out that productivity improvements also help our associates serve our customers and members better and improve our cost structure. If we can save 1 or 2 seconds in every cashier transaction around the world, the savings can truly add up. 
As an example of a productivity initiative in our Walmart U.S. stores, we have implemented more one-touch freight, which optimizes the palette prior to arrival at the store. We're collaborating with suppliers to look at the entire supply chain as if it were vertically integrated to take unnecessary costs out of the system. We are also leveraging technology to enhance our workflow to make the workday more efficient for our store associates. 
As you have heard from us before, we know that strengthening price leadership starts with being the low-cost provider. As we continue to lower our cost, we will also be investing in price, helping our customers save money so they can live better. We will be relentless in widening the price gap, as Mike says, to pass savings along to our customers around the world. We believe that EDLP will lead to top line growth as customer traffic improves. 
And last, our priority of returns. On a rolling 12-month basis ending July 31, 2011, return on investment or ROI ended at 18.4%. ROI was impacted negatively by the acquisitions and currency. It's important to know that our underlying operations remain solid. 
As you know, our company remains committed to share repurchase. We announced a new $15 billion share repurchase authorization on June 3 at our Annual Shareholders meeting. Given our acquisition activity in the second quarter, we had less money dedicated to share repurchase. The combination of our annual dividend and share repurchase program indicate the strength of our company and our continued commitment to returning value to Walmart's shareholders. Our investment in SAP throughout the company is ongoing, and is designed to increase the consistency of our processes throughout the organization. While the majority of our businesses have converted or are underway, the effects of the conversion will continue into next year. The financial effects should be minimal. 
Now let's move on to guidance. Based on how we view our business relative to the economy and sales environment in the United States and throughout the world, we expect third quarter 2012 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $0.95 and $1, which compares to last year's third quarter earnings per share of $0.95. Last year's third quarter included $0.05 per share of tax benefits. We are narrowing the range of our full year earnings per share guidance and increasing it by $0.01. We now expect our full year earnings per share guidance to range between $4.41 and $4.51 versus our previously stated range of $4.35 to $4.50. All of the above EPS guidance assumes currency exchange rates remain at current levels. 
As I close, I'd like to summarize a few key points from today's call. First, our second quarter earnings per share of $1.09 was solidly within our guidance. Looking ahead, we are raising our full year EPS guidance. We continue to manage our business well despite a very tough global economy. Net sales increased 5.5% with contributions from all 3 operating segments. We are still on track to deliver our yearly sales growth target of 4% to 6%. We will use the productivity loop to deliver on our EDLC-EDLP model and are committed to leveraging expenses for the full year. Walmart has a very strong balance sheet that we believe is an important advantage as the global markets remain volatile. Last, we remain committed to delivering shareholder returns through a combination of share repurchase and dividends as we did in the second quarter. 
Thank you for your continued interest in Walmart and we look forward to seeing you in October for our investor meeting."

Thanks for joining us today for our earnings call to review the third quarter of fiscal year 2012. All information for this quarter, including our unit count, square feet footage and financial metrics is available on our website at www.walmartstores.com/investors. A full transcript of this call will be available on the website after 7:00 a.m. Central Time today, at November 15, 2011.
Mike Duke, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. will open the call with his thoughts about the quarter. Jeff Davis, SVP of Finance and Treasurer, will cover the consolidated financial details, then we'll go to the operating segments. First, Bill Simon, President and CEO of Walmart U.S. will begin our segment discussions. Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Walmart International will follow Bill and then we'll close with Brian Cornell, President and CEO of Sam's Club. Charles Holley, our CFO, will wrap up with his thoughts, as well as EPS guidance for the fourth quarter and the full year.
A few reminders. You are familiar with the fact that Walmart U.S. has made layaway services available to our customers beginning October 17. Please note, for financial reporting purposes, layaway transactions are included in revenue when the sale is completed and the merchandise is picked up. Customers are required to pick up merchandise by December 16. Therefore, the majority of revenue from layaway transactions will fall in the fourth quarter and our comps sales that are reported today do not include the effect of layaway sales. All comps discussions through the U.S. Business are on the 4-5-4 retail calendar. Details on comp sales for the countries within Walmart international are on a calendar basis. Our fiscal calendars for international differ from that of our corporate time line, with the exception of Canada and Massmart, our international operations and their fiscal year on December 31 to report on one-month lag. Canada like the U.S., reports results based on a fiscal year-end of January 31. Massmart currently reports on a June 30 fiscal year-end for this consolidated into our results on a calendar year basis with the one-month lag.
Please mark your calendars for next October. We're announcing today that the fiscal year 2013 Annual Meeting for the Investment Community, commonly referred to as Walmart's Analyst Meeting, will be on Wednesday, October 10, 2012. The meeting will kickoff with dinner with management on Tuesday, October 9, 2012. 
Now Mike, let's get started with our Q3 results. Mike?"
313055,129808285,192038,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 15, 2011",2011-11-15,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Carol. Good morning, everyone. Let me start with 3 key takeaways for the third quarter. First, Walmart reported earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.97 within our guidance.

First, Walmart reported earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.97 within our guidance. Second, both Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club exceeded comp guidance for the third quarter, with Walmart U.S. increasing comp sales 1.3% and Sam's Club posting a comp without fuel of 5.7%. Third, the company leveraged operating expenses with each of the 3 operating segments achieving this goal as well. We remain committed to leveraging expenses again this year.
Here are some additional third quarter highlights. Net sales increased 8.2% to $110.5 billion. International reported net sales of more than $32 billion, approximately a 20% increase over last year's third quarter. This includes our acquisitions and currency impact. Consolidated operating income grew 4.8%. Walmart ended the quarter with free cash flow of $3.4 billion, the company returned $2.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases for the quarter. These results continue to reinforce our strong financial position. Every business segment is stronger than it was a year ago and we delivered solid earnings growth. I'm really pleased with our top line performance and our momentum going into the fourth quarter. Our overall performance reflects the Walmart strategy of driving the productivity loop, leveraging expenses and investing in price leadership.
Now let's review our individual segments. Walmart U.S. has said consistently that its goal was positive comps by year end and the teams delivered on this goal in the third quarter. Operating income also grew faster than sales. The Walmart U.S. team has aggressively executed its plan to broaden assortment, improve merchandising and reaffirm Walmart's price leadership. The plan is working, customers are responding favorably and it's good to see [indiscernible] in our comp store sales improvement. 
While we feel good about the progress in our stores, our customers remain concerned about jobs and only one and 10 Walmart moms that we survey view the state of U.S. economy as good. They want to save money, they're juggling credit cards, using coupons and skipping restaurants and vacations. There is a real sense that the economics strain is taking its toll. To help ease that strain, the entire Walmart U.S. team is very focused on saving our customers during the holidays by continuing its price investment strategy. Beyond EDLP, we have a number of additional programs in place for the fourth quarter, including the Christmas price guarantee, holiday layaway and free online shipping options, the integration of our stores and online is a point of differentiation for customers, especially during the busy holiday season with more than 3,800 stores and 120 distribution centers serving those U.S. stores, Walmart can offer multichannel access in a way that no other retailer can. From our stores to online and mobile apps, customers can shop on their own terms.
Walmart international delivered strong sales in the third quarter. Operating income was up 14.2%. Like the U.S., our international markets are ready for the upcoming holidays. We continue to see strong consumer demand in emerging markets and our mission is relevant across all formats around the world. EDLP is becoming an even stronger competitive advantage for us as we integrate that positioning into more markets. Profitable growth is the top priority for the team. We have tons in place to improve operating profit and returns in international and support of vibrant growth engine for our company.
Sam's Club posted impressive results with another quarter of strong comp sales growth and greater momentum in membership. I continue to be really pleased with the merchandising and the operations improvements. Sam's is also very well-positioned for the holiday season, both for Advantage and Business members. We fully expect Sam's to surpass the $50 billion mark in net sales by year end and this will be a milestone for our clubs.
In the third quarter, we were also pleased with the response to our new global women's empowerment initiative. The program will expand economic operative for more women and help us attract and develop great talent. Walmart will keep doing what's right and what's good for business.
As I've said at the Investor Meeting in October, there is no doubt that Walmart is the best position global retailer. We have the rights plans in place to deliver for the fourth quarter and the long term. We will continue our U.S. comp sales momentum and we will improve the profitability of our international markets. We will reduce SG&A expenses further and use those savings to drive prices down for our customers. We will make visible progress in building our eCommerce and we will recruit and develop even stronger talent throughout the organization.
Looking ahead, we will be an even stronger company a year from now. These plans also will lead to greater shareholder value. Now before I hand the microphone over to Jeff, on behalf of everyone at Walmart, our best wishes to you for a happy and healthy holiday season and a prosperous new year. 
Now, Jeff will cover the details on our consolidated results. Jeff?"
313055,129808285,192038,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 15, 2011",2011-11-15,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. For the third quarter of fiscal 2012, Walmart reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations at $0.97 which was within our guidance of $0.95 to $1. This compares to $0.95 for the third quarter of last year which included a",944,"Thank you, Mike. For the third quarter of fiscal 2012, Walmart reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations at $0.97 which was within our guidance of $0.95 to $1. This compares to $0.95 for the third quarter of last year which included a $191 million tax benefit related to a favorable adjustment to transfer pricing policies after negotiations with a foreign tax jurisdiction. This benefit represented approximately $0.05 per share.
Consolidated net sales increased 8.2% or $8.3 billion to $109.5 billion for the quarter. The increase included $2.1 billion in sales from the acquisition of Netto stores in the U.K. and the Massmart operations in sub-Saharan Africa, and a currency exchange benefit of $1.3 billion. Excluding the effects of acquisitions and currency, consolidated net sales increased 4.8% over last year's third quarter sales of $101.2 billion.
Total U.S. comp sales without fuel for the 13-week period ended October 28 were 1.9%. This was driven by both Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club exceeding guidance for the reporting period. Pill and Brian will provide more details on Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club later in the call. 
For the third quarter, gross profit margin on net sales was 24.6%, a 52-basis point reduction compared to the same time last year. All 3 operating segments realized a decline in gross profit margin from the impact of price investments and cost inflation. You will hear more from our segment CEOs later in the call.
Now let's move our attention to leverage. We remain focused on growing operating expenses at a rate less than net sales growth and growing operating income at a rate greater than net sales growth. The company leveraged operating expenses as a percentage of sales by 40 basis points for the quarter. All 3 operating segments contributed to the leverage.  Operating expenses were 19.9% of sales compared to 20.3% last year.
Unallocated corporate overhead and other, which includes our global eCommerce area, increased approximately 40.7% to $536 million for the third quarter. Our global eCommerce initiatives contributed the majority of the increase as we continue to invest in our eCommerce platforms including at Walmart Labs. Depreciation expense increased year-over-year based on our financial system investments with the remainder of the increase driven by multiple items, none of which is individually significant.
As Mike stated, we continue to drive productivity and reduce costs. We expect to carry the leverage momentum into the fourth quarter.
Consolidated operating income $5.9 billion, a 4.8% increase versus last year. Operating income included a $48 million currency translation benefit. Net interest expense for the quarter increased 3% to $535 million which included a reduction in tax-related interest accruals.
For the fourth quarter, we are forecasting high-single digit growth in net interest. Debt-to-capitalization ratio at the end of the third quarter was 46.9% compared to 46.4% last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 34.5% versus 29.5% last year. Recall that last year's rate included a $191 million benefit from certain tax adjustments mentioned earlier. This year's effective tax rate was in line with our previous guidance and we expect the effect of tax rate for fiscal 2012 to be at the lower end of our range of 33.5% to 34.5%. However, our tax rate may be impacted by a number of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations. This leads us to income from continuing operations attributable to Walmart which was $3.3 billion. 
Now moving to returns. During the third quarter, the company repurchased approximately 27 million shares, representing $1.4 billion. This brings the year-to-date repurchase to $5 billion or 92.4 million shares. As of October 31, Walmart had $12.7 billion remaining under the current $15 billion share purchase authorization. In addition to share purchases, the company returned $1.3 billion and $3.8 billion to shareholders through dividends for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively. Combining share purchases and dividends, Walmart returned $2.7 billion to shareholders in the quarter and $8.8 billion so far this year. Consolidated inventory grew 7.5% driven primarily by Walmart international's growth through acquisitions, new stores and currency impact. Tables as a percentage of inventories were 85% in line with the prior year.
Capital expenditures were approximately $3.9 billion for the third quarter compared to $3.8 billion last year. In October, we updated our fiscal 2012 capital expenditure guidance to be between $13 billion and $14 billion, which includes approximately $500 million for acquisition-related capital expenditures for ASDA and Massmart.
We continue to identify great opportunities to open new stores globally. We added 159 net new rental units in the third quarter with 130 delivered by Walmart international. Walmart U.S. added nearly 5 million square feet, a large portion
[Audio Gap]
[Technical Difficulty] .
Walmart U.S. added nearly 5 million square feet, a large portion of the increase was a result of our increased emphasis on supercenters as we converted more discount stores and opened more new supercenters than in the past several years. Total company square footage expanded approximately 8.7 million square feet during the quarter.
Free cash flow was $3.4 billion at the end of the quarter, ahead of $2.9 billion last year. Year-to-date, our strong operating cash flow is more than offset the additional $225 million spent on capital expenditures versus last year.
Return on investment, or ROI, for the trailing 12 months ended October 31, 2011, was 18.2% compared to 18.6% for the previous year. As we had anticipated, majority of the decline was attributable to the impact from acquisitions.
Now let's turn over to our operating segments. We'll start with Walmart U.S. Bill?"

As Mike mentioned earlier, Walmart U.S. achieved a 1.3% comp in the third quarter, a full quarter ahead of our goal. We continue to diligent execute on our core initiatives and we see clear signs that our strategy is working. We're encouraged by the continued response we're receiving from our customers. Following a positive comp in July, we continue to gain momentum achieving positive comps for each successive month with the strongest results in October. Comp sales for the 13-week period ending October 28, were above our guidance and this comp increase represents more than $750 million in additional same-store sales for the third quarter over last year.
Net sales rose 2.7% to $63.8 billion in the third quarter versus the prior year year's comparable period. Clearly, upward momentum. The accomplished driven by growth and average ticket, our overall comp traffic was negative for the third quarter, our supercenters and discount stores had more than 125-basis point consecutive improvement in comp traffic in Q2. Neighborhood markets continued to post strong positive comp traffic for the quarter. In facts our overall Walmart comp traffic improved 160 basis points sequentially over the second quarter, with October traffic relatively flat.
Traffic also benefit from the extension of our gas rollback program, as well as our holiday layaway service which launched on October 17. 3 key element drove the third quarter improvement. First, merchandise initiatives focused on expanded assortments, product innovation and local relevance that are recapturing trips to the store. Customers are responding to our SKU add-back program, which is now almost complete. As you know, we are always working on our assortment so you'll continue to see ongoing improvement in our merchandise.
Second, our integration of technology with associate productivity programs has improved [indiscernible]. On sale availability continues to improve and is above the 93% we shared at the October Analyst Meeting. We're very well-positioned with inventory in both store and online for the fourth quarter. 
Third, Walmart's mission is Every Day Low Prices and we're communicating price throughout the store and with every kind of media from print to digital. Our price investment strategy makes a difference for our customers. Economic conditions in the third quarter remain largely unchanged. Our core customer was still impacted by high unemployment and continued uncertainty over the economy, leading to a declining consumer confidence. Although there remain higher than a year ago, gas prices which was positively affected customer trips moderated during the third quarter.
Among our business Units, grocery, health and wellness and hardlines all delivered positive comps in the third quarter. Our food business had positive traffic trend throughout the quarter and posted mid-single digit comps. Rising food costs continue to be a major concern for customers. We hear from some shoppers that they believe it will be more difficult than ever to afford holiday meals for their families. We understand their concern and we see it every month in our customers purchasing behavior. Some customers may difficult decisions to trade down the lower price points or trade out of certain categories completely.
As others in the industry reported, customers continue to see food prices rise in key categories such as produce, dairy and meat. Walmart continues to invest in absorbing some of these increases to ensure price leadership in our markets. During the quarter, grocery inflation was approximately 4%, in line with what's been seen throughout the industry. But given our price investment, the impact to our customers were substantially less, with deflation and other categories, trade down and other initiatives we have in place, inflation for the total box was approximately 70 basis points.
Sales of consumables continue to improve, increasing approximately 100 basis points sequentially from the second quarter. The improvements in on-shelf availability contributed to higher conversion and traffic. Consumables are also another area while our assortment initiatives in such categories as cosmetics and pets are making a large impact. Within pets, the dog food category improved approximately 300 basis points, benefiting from continued add-backs and strength in our value brands.
Grocery, which includes food and consumables, continue this positive trend and overall delivered a low-single digit positive comp for the quarter.
Health and wellness continue to perform well, delivering a low-single digit positive comp. Like many other areas, our over-the-counter business also benefited from improved nonshelf availability during the quarter. Partnership with Humana for the Medicare Part D program continues to drive traffic in our pharmacies. Looking ahead, we expect to see an increase in conversion from branded prescriptions to generics as strong such as Lipitor become available in the generic form.
General merchandisers has always been important to our sales growth and our renewed focus on improving assortment, presentation and price across GM categories is delivering sales improvement. It has been a matter of our merchants having the right assortment, delivering merchandising density and simplicity. We brought back brands and items that our customers want, especially in our Heritage categories like sporting goods and crafts. We improved our utilization in space, brands and presentation to ensure customers can find what they're looking for. And simply, we made Walmart easier to shop. 
Our comp for hardlines improved 300 basis point sequentially from the second quarter to a low-single digit positive comp for the third quarter. This improvement was primarily due to driven by our Heritage categories including sporting goods, stationery and crafts. We'll continue to add-back space and assortment across these important areas. Hunting continue to significantly outperform our sporting goods business, with strong double-digit comps in the quarter for categories such as hunting apparel and related merchandising accessories. Tire helped by special events also remained strong. As we've expanded assortment and updated modulars, sales increased in stationery and crafts.
Customer feedback on the return of the layaway has been overwhelmingly positive and layaway transaction volume continues to exceed plan. Our customers tell us that they appreciate that we've brought back this service and it's a great way to help families on a tight budget shop for Christmas. As a reminder, we've added service fees to reduce layaway cancellations in the fourth quarter.
During the third quarter, we had a major modular reset for our toy business and this help drive sales at the end of the period just as layaway began. It's not surprising that our top toy and layaway is the lead pad learning system along with bikes and ride-on vehicles. In electronics, top layaway products are tablets, TVs and laptops. As you know, electronics and toys make up our entertainment business and are critically important sales drivers for the fourth quarter.
Entertainment was 160 basis points better than last quarter and with layaway, we expect ongoing improvement for Q4. Our comp was Q3 was mid-single digit negative, reflecting the ongoing impact from electronics deflation.
A strong release schedule during the quarter with titles such as Captain America, Transformers, and the Lion King drove favorable sales performance. Shoppers are clearly aware of the pricing environment and more of them returning to Walmart for unbeatable price, leading to an overall increase in our units for the quarter. 
Straight Talk continues to sell well and the release of the Straight Talk Android phone in September drove sales even further. Customers are drawn to our value price offerings and catalog movie and music bins.
Apparel sales improved approximately 170 basis points over the previous quarter, leading to a low-single digit negative comp. Men's and ladies apparel had the strongest sales where our focus on core basics and assortment initiatives is paying off. We expanded both space in assortment in our shoe department, which was timely for back-to-school as that area achieved the first positive quarterly comp in more than 2 years. Total average temperature in October drove cold-weather apparel sales.
As we announced in October, we're relocating the apparel functions that have been based in New York back to Bentonville. Our customers expect high-quality basics and fashion basics with great prices. Roughly 40% of apparel associates had remained in Bentonville and we will unite our apparel efforts in one location. We expect a smooth transition and plan to complete the move by February 2012.
Home comp for the quarter was low-single digit negative, Outdoor Living including patio furniture was the strongest performer but economic pressure and slow housing sales continue to affect the discretionary categories. We're seeing solid improvement in functional kitchen categories such as single-serve coffee systems, microwaves and other food prep appliances. We're encouraged by the early results and seeing increase momentum from expansion in home basics and opening price point items as well as modular updates.
The sales trends I've outlined here are also reflected at dot-com sales with stronger performance in electronics, home and toy categories. As I mentioned earlier, our customers are still feeling pressure to reduce expenses wherever they can. Banking fees are the topic that's received a lot of attention recently and our core customers continue to see alternatives to paying account fees. Walmart money center provides those customers a low-cost alternative to access and control their money. Our customers see a clear benefit in this access to everyday life financial services and we're excited about the opportunity to continue to innovate in this area. Currently, we have money centers and service desks in all of our stores and we have additional self-service kiosks in many other locations throughout the store.
Now, let's move on to more of the specifics on financial results. As discussed at our October Investment Community Conference, we began our price investment during the third quarter. Additionally, cost increases in numerous categories were not passed on to our customers in the form of increased prices. Gross profit dollars were up 1.9% over last year's third quarter to $17.9 billion, growing slower than the rate of sales. Gross margin rate is down approximately 22 basis points from last year's third quarter. We leveraged expenses for the quarter. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses decreased 41 basis points. On a dollar basis, SG&A was up approximately 70 basis points compared to last year on a 2.7% increase in sales.
Operating income grew faster than sales for the quarter. Operating income rose to $4.6 billion versus $4.4 billion last year. As a percentage of sales, operating income increased to 5.1%, driven by expense leverage and the increase in gross profit dollars.
Inventory was up 5.1% compared to this time last year, principally due to our continued focus on product add-backs, inflation and the implementation of our new layaway program. We're well-positioned with inventory as we head into the holiday period.
We're focused on growing through new stores and our priority remains supercenter growth. During the third quarter, we added 63 supercenters, including new stores expansions and conversions. We expect gross profit rate for the fourth quarter to be down as we continue to execute our price investments strategy and see the mix change in the fourth quarter. Our focus on the productivity loop is paramount and we will continue to drive operating expense leverage.
We've worked diligently throughout the year on our assortment and availability initiatives. In addition, we've worked hard on our communication to customers. We've also stepped up our marketing campaign across multiple media platforms this holiday. Customers will see and hear Walmart everywhere this holiday season. We have brought a strong share voice nationally and in individual key markets. But we're also proud of our creative. We have seen commercials that are funny and some that will just make you feel good.
Programs like layaway and our special 0% financing offer on the Walmart credit card will make holiday shopping easier and more attractive. Our ad match and holiday price guarantee will leave no doubt that Walmart is the clear price leader this holiday season.
And we're aggressively going after the business this season, starting even before Black Friday. We've been open on Thanksgiving day for several years now. This year, at 10:00 p.m., we kicked off the event with outstanding prices in toys, home and apparel. Our electronics items follow at midnight, and we'll have rollback prices throughout the store all day on Black Friday.
We're reaching out to customers on social media. Store-specific maps on Facebook will help our customers plan their shopping trip. There will be no doubt that Walmart is ready for the holiday season.
We have the assortment our customers are looking for, both in-store and online. We have the inventory they need and we have the prices that can't be beaten. We're forecasting comp sales for the 13-week period from October 29, 2011, through January 27, 2012 to range from flat to positive 2%. Last year's fourth quarter 13-week comp was negative 1.8%. I hope to see you on our source. 
Now I'll turn it over to Doug for the international update."

We have good third quarter results to report but before I get into the numbers, let me begin with our plans for growing the business. Over the long term, we will drive aggressive, disciplined growth while reducing costs in the business to improve profitability. To help our markets achieve these goals, we have a 4-pronged approach. First, is growing comp sales. Our strategies across markets are delivering EDLP and developing strong merchants.. We're rolling out merchant academies throughout international to further develop their skills. 
The second pillar is new store growth and we have a strong new store development program. We've added 12.7 million square feet of organic growth since the beginning of this year and we're on track to meet our forecast of 24 million to 27 million square feet. 
The third pillar is eCommerce and multichannel and we're developing our skills in this area. We will leverage our brand and customer loyalty further in developed markets like Canada and U.K. as well as our emerging markets. In Brazil, eCommerce is growing at twice the pace of the market and we have an award-winning website for customer friendliness.
The fourth pillar is strategic acquisitions. We're encouraged by the successful integration work in Chile and now in South Africa and I'm very excited about the management teams in each of these markets. We continue to evaluate expansion opportunities around the world and within existing markets. 
Now let's get to the numbers. Walmart International reported third quarter net sales of $32.4 billion, an increase of 20.3% over last year. Changes in currency translation increased our reported net sales by $1.3 billion. On a constant currency basis, net sales were $31 billion, an increase of 15.3% over last year's third quarter and 7.5% excluding acquisitions. All of our markets have constant currency sales growth, with China, Mexico, and Argentina providing the strongest net sales growth in the third quarter. As a percentage of sales, Walmart International's third quarter gross profit declined 57 basis points on a reported basis and on a constant currency basis. After excluding acquisitions, constant currency gross profit margin was flat to last year.
Third quarter reported operating expenses were $6.4 billion, which includes an increase of $273 million due to changes in currency exchange rates. Walmart International leverage constant currency operating expenses, growing them slower than sales at 12.4%. When you exclude our recent acquisitions, constant currency operating expenses grew only 5.5% on expense leverage from the U.K., Japan, Chile and Brazil.
Our third quarter reported operating income grew 14.2% from last year to $1.4 billion and includes a benefit of $48 million from changes in currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, operating income grew 10.3%, excluding acquisitions, constant currency operating income grew faster than sales at 8.5%.
On a reported basis, Walmart International's inventory grew at 18.7%. On a constant currency basis, and excluding acquisitions, inventory grew at 11.9%, which is faster than our target. In many cases, our days payable exceeds our days on hand. In addition, it's a challenge to properly time our purchase commitments with new store growth and merchandising imports in international markets. We recognize we have ample opportunity to reduce inventory. Our goal remains to grow inventory at or less than half the rate of sales growth.
Now let's get into the results for several of our larger markets. Country management teams are held accountable for their results on a constant currency basis. The following discussion of country results excludes the impact of currency and unless otherwise stated, sales and comp sales are presented on a nominal basis. Comp sales are reported on a calendar basis. 
In the U.K., ASDA had a solid third quarter, growing sales and growing operating income faster than sales, excluding fuel. In the third quarter of this year, comparable sales excluding fuel, increased 1.3%. Traffic declined by 1.3% and average ticket increased 2.6% as customers continue to consolidate their trips in the face of high prices.
The U.K. grocery market is entering into what is traditionally a heavy promotional period in time for Christmas. ASDA, however, continues with a very simple promise to customers. Our prices are 10% cheaper than the competition on comparable baskets or we'll give you the difference. And ASDA's customers like it. Since this year, the prices of more than 13 million baskets have been checked online.
Expenses grew slower than sales in the third quarter. To deliver cost savings, sustainable productivity programs are embedded in our operations which help fund lower prices for customers. For example, the fewer, cheaper miles program is delivering cost savings within the distribution network by reducing fuel consumption and carbon emissions. That conversion of the Netto stores to ASDA supermarkets continues to progress on schedule and sales and profits are exceeding our expectations. More than 70% were trading as ASDA supermarkets by the end of September and today, we have only a few left to complete.
ASDA's online grocery sales continue to grow strongly in the third quarter and now customers can order groceries using a smartphone The on-time delivery rate has improved with 19 of 20 customers receiving their purchase within the allotted time slot. ASDA open a record number of stores this quarter for a total of 83, which includes 77 Netto conversions. This brings ASDA to a total of 542 stores, including 139 supermarkets. ASDA's customers are asking for great quality at great prices, so ASDA is extending its private brands ranges and the premium extra special range is now back by leading cookery school leaks. Just recently, ASDA receive recognition for both its quality products and being the lowest-priced supermarket.
Now for Canada. Walmart Canada continue to have solid sales growth. However, operating income grew slower than sales. Net sales grew 4.9% in the third quarter compared to last year, driven by food, consumables and health and wellness. For comparable stores, third quarter comparable sales increased 0.9% from last year. Average ticket increased 2.2% for the third quarter and traffic declined 1.3%. Both gross profit and expenses as a percentage of sales were flat to last year on continued successful expense management even with the increase in costs from Walmart Canada bank as it moves into its second year of operations.
Walmart Canada continues to have a robust supercenter expansion program opening 4 supercenters during the third quarter, including store conversions, and celebrated the opening of its 150th supercenter during the quarter. Over the past 12 months, we opened 41 supercenters including store conversions, bringing our store count to 329 stores.
Fiscal 2013 is a big growth year for Walmart Canada, with a goal to complete a record 73 store growth projects. This includes the renovation of the 39 Zellers store leases we recently acquired.
Let's move to the Americas. Unless stated otherwise, the following discussion includes the consolidated results of Mexico and Central America. While these results are on a U.S. GAAP basis, Walmex separately reports its earnings under Mexican GAAP. So some numbers are different from the Walmex reported results.
Walmex had strong consolidated sales and operating income growth from last year's third quarter. On a consolidated basis, Walmex's net sales for the third quarter were up 9.6%. Comparable sales for Mexico were up 3% and average ticket in Mexico increased to 3.4% as customers welcomed the nationwide strengthening of EDLP. During the third quarter, customer traffic in Mexico declined 0.4% and this includes the 1% increase we saw in September. In its October comp sales release, Walmex also cited traffic improvements for the first month of the fourth quarter.
Mexico's third quarter consolidated comp store sales for the self-service formats grew by 2.6%, while ANTAD's comp store sales report for the rest of the industry, excluding Walmex, grew faster at 3.3%. 
In Central America, overall sales increased 5.2% and comp sales were down 10 basis points on a constant currency basis. Walmex continues to work through the implementation of new strategies and formats, EDLP, and growth in our 5 Central American countries.
Third quarter consolidated gross profit margin and operating income as a percentage of sales were flat to last year. Walmex finished with 411 more stores than at the end of the third quarter last year. 
Moving on to Brazil. Net sales, comparable sales and average ticket all grew in the third quarter in nominal terms and I'm proud to say that expenses grew slower than sales. We've converted a meaningful number of items to EDLP and we have more than 80% of our grocery and consumables SKUs at Every Day Low Prices. 
In real terms, Brazil's third quarter net sales declined 1% and comparable sales declined 5.7%. Average ticket declined 0.8% in real terms and customer traffic was also down. We need to improve our reputation for price leadership in Brazil to increase our transactions.
Third quarter gross profit margins as a percentage of sales was flat to last year and Brazil successfully leveraged operating expenses through a continued progress in expense management and energizing the productivity loop but we still have a long way to go regarding Brazil's operating income.
Our Brazil team continues to find ways to combined being a better merchant with sustainability, including doubling the volume of local sourcing from our producers club. This program develops local farmers and reduces in-store food waste by 20%. In addition, Brazil offers customers a discount in exchange for not using plastic bags, which has reduced plastic bag waste by more than 40% since the program began. These efforts increased sales and drive customer loyalty because social and environmental issues are important to our customers. 
In the last 12 months, we've opened 44 net new stores in Brazil, bringing our total store count to 496. This includes 9 new stores in the third quarter of this year.
Moving to Asia. Japan's net sales, comparable sales and average ticket all grew in the third quarter in nominal terms but Japan's operating income ended with a loss when compared to last year's profit. Walmart Japan continues to outperform the market, growing sales and comp sales approximately 1.9% in real terms. Third quarter traffic grew 0.4% and ticket grew 1.5% in real terms.
According to statistics released by the Japanese Ministry of the Economy, Trade and Industry or METI, overall supermarket comparable sales for the third quarter declined by 1.7% from last year. Gross profit margin as a percentage of sales declined slightly on EDLP strengthening and Walmart Japan continue to trend of leveraging expenses with highly effective workforce management programs.
Walmart China had strong sales growth in the third quarter and positive operating income growth. Net sales for the third quarter grew 16.1% over last year and comparable store growth was 6%. Average ticket grew 14.1% in China, but traffic declined 7.1%. Gross margin as a percentage of sales was approximately flat to last year. China's expenses as a percentage of sales were flat to last year's third quarter, as the expense leverage achieved during the quarter was offset by the costs from new levies.
In the third quarter, we completed rebranding 56 Trust-Mart stores, which provided customers the same merchandise and shopping experience as the Walmart brand. We will continue to rebrand other Trust-Mart stores in the fourth quarter and early next year.
In October, we had 13 stores closed for 2 weeks in Chongqing as directed by the local regulator, the administration for industry and commerce. During that 2-week period, management invested in associate training, the physical remodels of the stores and in compliance matters. The financial impact of these closures is not expected to be significant to our fourth quarter results, as all of these stores reopened on October 25.
Following the reopening, traffic and sales were strong as customers reacted in a positive way to the changes made during the brief closure. As mentioned in various media reports, that Chongqing mayor approved of Walmart's actions and the government supports additional development by the company in China. We are now in the process of obtaining local registrations for the Trust-Mart stores and this is the last principle condition to completing the second closing of our Trust-Mart purchase. 
In the past 12 months, we opened 54 new stores, including 49 supercenters and that brings our China store count to 352 stores.
I'll close by covering some initiatives underway to improve the profitability in our emerging markets, including workforce management, logistics and shared services. Workforce management, for example, is our in-store productivity program in areas such as backroom receiving and on the sales floor. This is critical to the rollout of EDLP because we change how our store operates and reduce the volatility of operating cost. In fact, Japan's EDLC workforce management programs have reduced operating costs every year for the past 3 years. The Walmart Japan program is now the model for our other markets.
Our portfolio combines local relevance and global leverage. With our power by Walmart tools, the productivity loop, EDLP and EDLC, there is an even broader future for Walmart International. 
And now I turn it over to Brian for the news on Sam's Club. Brian?"
313055,129808285,192038,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 15, 2011",2011-11-15,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Doug. Consistent with the overall club channel, our top line performance this quarter was exceptional. Comp sales, excluding fuel, increased by 5.7%. This is our seventh quarter of sequentially increasing comps. Membership renewals and members joi",1627,"Thanks, Doug. Consistent with the overall club channel, our top line performance this quarter was exceptional. Comp sales, excluding fuel, increased by 5.7%. This is our seventh quarter of sequentially increasing comps. Membership renewals and members joining at the plus level continue to grow and we leverage expenses again this quarter.
We open a new club, expanded a club and relocated 3 clubs during the period. This added over 190,000 square feet to our footprint. Similar to the first half of the year, our third quarter fuel Business was wrong. Fuel provide Sam's Club a great first price impression and is clearly a traffic driver for existing and potential members. We continue to pump more gallons of fuel and generate more sales dollars per gallon this year when compared to last year. Fuel prices in this year's third quarter were approximately 34% higher than a year ago and gallons sold were up 11%.
Including fuel, third quarter net sales were $13.3 billion, a 9.5% increase over last year. Gross profit increased by 5%. SG&A expense as a percentage of sales decreased by 62 basis points and operating income increased 6.3% to $390 million for the quarter. Volatility in fuel prices can have a notable impact on our financial results. The remainder of our discussion today therefore is focused on our core business and excludes fuel for comparative purposes unless otherwise noted. 
Now let's look at the financial results and our performance for the quarter. Net sales for the third quarter were $11.8 billion, up 6.2% from last year. Comp club sales for the 13-week period increased 5.7% and we're strong across all 3 geographic operating divisions, led by the West division. Comp traffic and ticket increased for the 13-week period by 2.3% and 3.4%, respectively. Comp traffic and ticket increased for both Advantage and Business members.
We continue to see members visiting our clubs more frequently. During our Labor Day eValues savings celebration event, we had strong sales and solid membership performance. The quality of our comp sales growth in core categories remains very strong. Overall, we believe that inflation impacted our comp club sales by 325 to 375 basis points.
We continue to see mid-single digit inflation in food categories. Despite the inflation, units sold increased year-over-year. We continue to face challenges in tobacco sales, an important category to our convenience store business member. Our tobacco business has been impacted by declining industry consumption and the change in our credit rewards program that went into effect at the beginning of this year. The decline in tobacco comp sales had an impact of approximately 100 basis points on our total comp sales results. We anticipate tobacco being a headwind for the rest of the year.
Our focus on providing the best quality at a great value continues to drive strong performance in the Fresh food categories. For the third quarter, we delivered double-digit comps in categories like bakery and bread and high-single digit comps in categories like produce. More and more of our members are skipping the restaurant trip and eating at home. This trend is driving significant sales increases in categories such as a home-meal solutions and prepared meats.
Our members expect the best prices on our product they buy everyday and rewarded us in the third quarter with increased trips to the club. This led to double-digit comps in freezer cooler and oil, rice, canned, vegetables and food categories. Dry grocery and beverage categories delivered high-single digit comps, led by breakfast foods, coffee, and baking. While categories like snacks delivered mid-single digit comps.
Our pet supply business was strong, turning in high-single digit comps, impacted by deflation, laundry and home care comp sales were down. And in a tough competitive market, Baby care was down.
We remain focused on providing our members with the best quality, brands and value on apparel and seasonal products. Home and apparel delivered a mid-single digit comp increase for the period, driven by backyard recreation and family fun, our seasonal area recorded a high-single digit comp for the quarter. We recorded a mid-single digit comp in our apparel areas, led by strong sales in basic and men's which offset weakness in ladies apparel.
Comps for our health and wellness area were in the low-single digits, led by our growth in pharmacy and optical areas. Pharmacy growth was led by our focus efforts on driving script increases and building awareness of the great value and superior service provided by our pharmacist. Our investment in hearing centers continues to pay dividends, as memberships have responded to this unique service at our clubs. 
Deflation continues to negatively impact technology and entertainment categories, which had a low-single digit comp. Earlier this year, we made a decision to transition our lease wireless centers to an owned model. This change has enabled us to provide a more comprehensive service solution for our members and has driven solid sales performance for this category. Also our exclusive club channel relationship with Apple has expanded our presence in tablets and smartphones and delivered strong sales in these categories. We also had great performance in our battery category and we focused on branded item placement and updated pack sizes and display fixtures. In televisions, we continue to see a challenging deflationary environment, driving high-single digit negative comps for the quarter.
Technology is an important service for our members. Sam's Club just released its dividend update to our smartphone app. You can now purchase items available online or shop at your club through click-and-pull directly from your smartphone. Our mobile app and upgraded website allow members the ability to review and shop our online and in-club inventory, build customized shopping list and renew their membership straight from a smartphone. Also our iPad application is scheduled to be launched just in time for the key holiday season. We believe that these apps will be a tremendous benefit to our members and are very excited about making these channel-leading technology solutions available.
We continue to deliver on our commitment to quality and value, especially with our proprietary brands. These initiatives are important in giving our members choices. Here are a few highlights. Since the beginning of the year, we have introduced 3 new brands artisan fresh in the deli and bakery areas; Simply Right in baby and health and beauty aids; and Daily Chef in frozen foods and refrigerated products.
These new brands represented over 200 items to date, with plans to add 150 more by the end of Q1 next year. Early sales and member feedback are overwhelmingly positive, with results at or above expectations. Our upcoming holiday Taste Sam's event will feature artisan fresh and Daily Chef items.
Membership and other income were down 13 basis points as a percentage of sales when compared to the third quarter last year. This reduction is driven by decline in rental income. As I mentioned earlier, in prior years, we rented space to a third party for a portion of our wireless business and receive rental income. Now, we are running these businesses with Sam's Club associates and the sales and expenses of the wireless business are included directly in our operating results.
Membership income for the third quarter increased 1.7% versus last year. Remember, for reporting purposes, membership income is recognized over the membership period, rather than when its collected. Renewals continue to increase at a rate that has exceeded our expectations and outpaced last year's performance and our penetration of plus members continues to grow at a healthy pace.
This is sign of growth was stronger in the third quarter, both sequentially and versus last year. Sales attributed to our proprietary credit program have continued at a steady upward path. As we reported in our Q2 earnings communication, members who possess a Sam's Club branded credit card tend to have higher levels of engagement and loyalty. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate continued positive momentum in membership.
Our gross margin and rate decreased by 28 basis points compared to the third quarter last year, while gross profit dollars increased 4%. The highly competitive retail environment as well as cost inflation in several categories, impacted our gross margin performance. I continue to be pleased with how our clubs are managing expenses this year. Driven by strong wage cost control, we reduced third quarter expenses as a percentage of sales by 31 basis points. You may remember that in last year's call, we discussed the impact of higher interchange fees related to the Sam's reward credit program. I'm happy to say that even with this expense is excluded from last year's comparison, we leveraged expenses by 13 basis points.
These expense control results demonstrate how we're driving operational efficiencies. For the quarter, sales per labor hour increased 2.1%. However, units per labor hour decreased 1.5% impacted by additional associates running our now owned wireless business. 
Looking at the bottom line, our third quarter operating income increased to $378 million, a 3.3% increase over the third quarter last year.
At the end of the third quarter, inventory, including fuel inventory, was up 1% compared to last year. Overall, we are pleased with the inventory levels at our clubs and distribution centers. 
Looking ahead, we're ready for the upcoming holiday season. Our club associates are energized. We have many new and exciting items across the club from fresh to gifts. Going into the fourth quarter, our sales momentum remains strong and we expect comp club sales without fuel for the 13-week period from October 29, 2011, through January 27, 2012, to increase 4% to 6%. Last year, Sam's comp club sales, excluding fuel, increased 2.7% for the comparable 13-week period.
Now, I will turn the program over to Charles for a wrap up in guidance. Charles?"

We continue to be encouraged by the ongoing sales momentum at Sam's and by the Walmart U.S. improvement in comps during the last 4 months. We still have a lot of work to d",550,"Thanks, Brian. As Mike said, our business is stronger today than it was a year ago. We continue to be encouraged by the ongoing sales momentum at Sam's and by the Walmart U.S. improvement in comps during the last 4 months. We still have a lot of work to do to increase traffic in many of our international markets, but we are confident in the plans that the country management teams have in place.
We recognize that the global economy is still weak and consumers continue to behave conservatively.
Looking back over the last 5 years, comp store sales were relatively small contributor to our overall growth. It's important that comp sales growth is a priority for our company going forward. Investing in new stores is also important. Remember, these are future comp sales and profit generators which in turn add to future returns for shareholders.
One of the most important keys to growing our sales is to have the lowest possible price. Keeping our expenses low will allow us to invest in prices going forward. I'm proud of the progress that we're making in expense levered. At the end of this fiscal year, we will have leveraged SG&A expenses for 2 consecutive years. Throughout the company, we continue to be focused on improving processes and productivity and eliminating waste and reducing SG&A expenses.
Not only will leveraging expenses allow us to invest in prices, but it will help improve returns in our emerging markets like Brazil and China. Emerging markets provide great opportunities for Walmart to serve customers with assortment and prices they have never had access to before. These markets will also provide some great returns down the road for our company.
At our meeting for the investment community last month, I outlined our goal to reduce SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales by more than 100 basis points over the next 5 years. That goal may be affected with the start of our new fiscal year on February 1, but we are well on our way to having the right strategies and plans in place to reach it.
Our earnings performance continues to translate into strong free cash flow and I would expect that to continue in the future. Cash flow is the foundation of a company's balance sheet and Walmart's balance sheet remains strong. That is a real advantage in today's economic environment. We continue to maintain access to extensive short and long term funding sources at historically low rates.
Now let's move on to guidance. Based on our view of the business and the global economy, we expect fourth quarter fiscal 2012 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.42 and $1.48. Last year, we reported fourth quarter earnings per share of $1.41, which included $0.07 per share of tax benefit primarily due to the repatriation of certain non-U.S. earnings that increased U.S. foreign tax credits.
Our full year earnings per share guidance is now between $4.45 and $4.51. All guidance estimates assumed that currency exchange rates remain at current levels. This compares to last year's results of $4.18 or an underlying $4.07 due to the $0.11 of tax benefits.
Thank you for listening today. We really appreciate your continued interest in Walmart. We hope you all have a great holiday."

Mike Duke, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., will open the call with his thoughts about the quarter. Jeff Davis, SVP of Finance and Treasurer, will cover the consolidated financial details, then we'll go to the operating segments. 
First, Bill Simon, President and CEO of Walmart U.S., will begin our segment discussions. Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Walmart International, will follow Bill. And then we'll close with Brian Cornell, President and CEO of Sam's Club. Charles Holley, our CFO, will wrap up with his thoughts, as well as EPS guidance for the fourth quarter and the full year.
A few reminders. You're familiar with the fact that Walmart U.S. has made layaway services available to our customers beginning October 17. Please note, for financial reporting purposes, layaway transactions are included in revenue when the sale is completed and the merchandise is picked up. Customers are required to pick up merchandise by December 16. Therefore, the majority of revenue from layaway transactions will fall in the fourth quarter. And our comps sales that are reported today do not include the effect of layaway sales. 
All comp sales discussions for the U.S. businesses are on the 4-5-4 retail calendar. Details on comp sales for the countries within Walmart International are on a calendar basis. 
Our fiscal calendars for international differ from that of our corporate time line. With the exception of Canada and Massmart, our International operations end their fiscal year on December 31 to report on a one-month lag. Canada, like the U.S., reports results based on a fiscal year-end of January 31. Massmart currently reports on a June 30 fiscal year-end, but is consolidated into our results on a calendar year basis with a one-month lag.
Please mark your calendars for next October. We're announcing today that the fiscal year 2013 Annual Meeting for the Investment Community, commonly referred to as Walmart's Analyst Meeting, will be on Wednesday, October 10, 2012.

313055,129808285,192191,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 15, 2011",2011-11-15,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Carol. Good morning, everyone. Let me start with 3 key takeaways for the third quarter. First, Walmart reported earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.97 within our guidance. Second, both Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club exceeded comp gu",850,"Thanks, Carol. Good morning, everyone. Let me start with 3 key takeaways for the third quarter. 
First, Walmart reported earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.97 within our guidance. Second, both Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club exceeded comp guidance for the third quarter, with Walmart U.S. increasing comp sales 1.3% and Sam's Club posting a comp, without fuel, of 5.7%. Third, the company leveraged operating expenses with each of the 3 operating segments achieving this goal as well. We remain committed to leveraging expenses again this year.
Here are some additional third quarter highlights. Net sales increased 8.2% to $109.5 billion. International reported net sales of more than $32 billion, approximately a 20% increase over last year's third quarter. This includes our acquisitions and currency impact. Consolidated operating income grew 4.8%. Walmart ended the quarter with free cash flow of $3.4 billion. The company returned $2.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases for the quarter. These results continue to reinforce our strong financial position. Every business segment is stronger than it was a year ago and we delivered solid earnings growth. I'm really pleased with our top line performance and our momentum going into the fourth quarter. Our overall performance reflects the Walmart strategy of driving the productivity loop, leveraging expenses and investing in price leadership.
Now let's review our individual segments. Walmart U.S. has said consistently that its goal was positive comps by year end, and the team delivered on this goal in the third quarter. Operating income also grew faster than sales. The Walmart U.S. team has aggressively executed its plan to broaden assortment, improve merchandising and reaffirm Walmart's price leadership. The plan is working, customers are responding favorably and it's good to see that reflected in our comp store sales improvement. 
While we feel good about the progress in our stores, our customers remain concerned about jobs, and only 1 in 10 Walmart moms that we surveyed view the state of the U.S. economy as good. They want to save money. They're juggling credit cards, using coupons and skipping restaurants and vacations. There is a real sense that the economic strain is taking its toll. 
To help ease that strain, the entire Walmart U.S. team is very focused on saving our customers' money during the holidays by continuing its price investment strategy. Beyond EDLP, we have a number of additional programs in place for the fourth quarter, including the Christmas price guarantee, holiday layaway and free online shipping options. The integration of our stores and online is a point of differentiation for customers, especially during the busy holiday season. With more than 3,800 stores and 120 distribution centers serving those U.S. stores, Walmart can offer multichannel access in a way that no other retailer can. From our stores to online and mobile apps, customers can shop on their own terms.
Walmart International delivered strong sales in the third quarter. Operating income was up 14.2%. Like the U.S., our international markets are ready for the upcoming holidays. We continue to see strong consumer demand in emerging markets, and our mission is relevant across all formats around the world. EDLP is becoming an even stronger competitive advantage for us as we integrate that positioning into more markets. 
Profitable growth is the top priority for the team. We have plans in place to improve operating profit and returns in International and support of vibrant growth engine for our company.
Sam's Club posted impressive results, with another quarter of strong comp sales growth and greater momentum in membership. I continue to be really pleased with the merchandising and the operations improvements. Sam's is also very well positioned for the holiday season, both for Advantage and Business members. We fully expect Sam's to surpass the $50 billion mark in net sales by year end and this will be a milestone for our clubs.
In the third quarter, we were also pleased with the response to our new global women's empowerment initiative. The program will expand economic operative for more women and help us attract and develop great talent. Walmart will keep doing what's right and what's good for business.
As I've said at the Investor Meeting in October, there is no doubt that Walmart is the best positioned global retailer. We have the right plans in place to deliver for the fourth quarter and the long term. We will continue our U.S. comp sales momentum and we will improve the profitability of our international markets. We will reduce SG&A expenses further and use those savings to drive prices down for our customers. We will make visible progress in building our eCommerce business and we will recruit and develop even stronger talent throughout the organization.
Looking ahead, we will be an even stronger company a year from now. These plans also will lead to greater shareholder value. Now before I hand the microphone over to Jeff, on behalf of everyone at Walmart, our best wishes to you for a happy and healthy holiday season and a prosperous new year. 
Now Jeff will cover the details on our consolidated results. Jeff?"
313055,129808285,192191,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 15, 2011",2011-11-15,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. For the third quarter of fiscal 2012, Walmart reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations at $0.97, which was within our guidance of $0.95 to $1. This compares to $0.95 for the third quarter of last year, which included",943,"Thank you, Mike. For the third quarter of fiscal 2012, Walmart reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations at $0.97, which was within our guidance of $0.95 to $1. This compares to $0.95 for the third quarter of last year, which included a $191 million tax benefit related to a favorable adjustment to transfer pricing policies after negotiations with a foreign tax jurisdiction. This benefit represented approximately $0.05 per share.
Consolidated net sales increased 8.2%, or $8.3 billion, to $109.5 billion for the quarter. The increase included $2.1 billion in sales from the acquisitions of Netto stores in the U.K. and the Massmart operations in sub-Saharan Africa, and a currency exchange benefit of $1.3 billion. Excluding the effects of acquisitions and currency, consolidated net sales increased 4.8% over last year's third quarter sales of $101.2 billion.
Total U.S. comp sales, without fuel, for the 13-week period ended October 28 were 1.9%. This was driven by both Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club exceeding guidance for the reporting period. Bill and Brian will provide more details on Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club later in the call. 
For the third quarter, gross profit margin on net sales was 24.6%, a 52-basis point reduction compared to the same time last year. All 3 operating segments realized a decline in gross profit margin from the impact of price investment and cost inflation. You will hear more from our segment CEOs later in the call.
Now let's move our attention to leverage. We remain focused on growing operating expenses at a rate less than net sales growth and growing operating income at a rate greater than net sales growth. The company leveraged operating expenses as a percentage of sales by 40 basis points for the quarter. All 3 operating segments contributed to the leverage.  Operating expenses were 19.9% of sales compared to 20.3% last year.
Unallocated corporate overhead and other, which includes our Global eCommerce area, increased approximately 40.7% to $536 million for the third quarter. Our Global eCommerce initiatives contributed the majority of the increase as we continue to invest in our eCommerce platforms, including @WalmartLabs. Depreciation expense increased year-over-year based on our financial system investments, with the remainder of the increase driven by multiple items, none of which is individually significant.
As Mike stated, we continue to drive productivity and reduce costs. We expect to carry the leverage momentum into the fourth quarter.
Consolidated operating income was $5.9 billion, a 4.8% increase versus last year. Operating income included a $48 million currency translation benefit. Net interest expense for the quarter increased 3.7% to $535 million, which included a reduction in tax-related interest accruals. For the fourth quarter, we are forecasting high-single digit growth in net interest. 
Debt-to-capitalization ratio at the end of the third quarter was 46.9% compared to 46.4% last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 34.5% versus 29.5% last year. Recall that last year's rate included a $191 million benefit from certain tax adjustments mentioned earlier. This year's effective tax rate was in line with our previous guidance and we expect the effect of tax rate for fiscal 2012 to be at the lower end of our range of 33.5% to 34.5%. However, our tax rate may be impacted by a number of factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations. This leads us to income from continuing operations attributable to Walmart, which was $3.3 billion. 
Now moving to returns. During the third quarter, the company repurchased approximately 27 million shares representing $1.4 billion. This brings the year-to-date repurchase to $5 billion, or 92.4 million shares. As of October 31, Walmart had $12.7 billion remaining under the current $15 billion share repurchase authorization. 
In addition to share repurchases, the company returned $1.3 billion and $3.8 billion to shareholders through dividends for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively. Combining share repurchases and dividends, Walmart returned $2.7 billion to shareholders in the quarter and $8.8 billion so far this year. 
Consolidated inventory grew 7.5%, driven primarily by Walmart International's growth through acquisitions, new stores and currency impact. Payables as a percentage of inventories were 85%, in line with the prior year.
Capital expenditures were approximately $3.9 billion for the third quarter compared to $3.8 billion last year. In October, we updated our fiscal 2012 capital expenditure guidance to be between $13 billion and $14 billion, which includes approximately $500 million for acquisition-related capital expenditures for ASDA and Massmart.
We continue to identify great opportunities to open new stores globally. We added 159 net new rental units in the third quarter, with 130 delivered by Walmart International. Walmart U.S. added nearly 5 million square feet, a large portion
[Audio Gap]
[Technical Difficulty] .
Walmart U.S. added nearly 5 million square feet, a large portion of the increase was a result of our increased emphasis on supercenters as we converted more discount stores and opened more new supercenters than in the past several years. Total company square footage expanded approximately 8.7 million square feet during the quarter.
Free cash flow was $3.4 billion at the end of the quarter, ahead of $2.9 billion last year. Year-to-date, our strong operating cash flows more than offset the additional $225 million spent on capital expenditures versus last year.
Return on investment, or ROI, for the trailing 12 months ended October 31, 2011, was 18.2% compared to 18.6% for the previous year. As we had anticipated, the majority of the decline was attributable to the impact from acquisitions.
Now let's turn over to our operating segments. We'll start with Walmart U.S. Bill?"
313055,129808285,192191,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 15, 2011",2011-11-15,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jeff. Let's get right to the good news. As Mike mentioned earlier, Walmart U.S. achieved a 1.3% comp in the third quarter, a full quarter ahead of our goal.

As Mike mentioned earlier, Walmart U.S. achieved a 1.3% comp in the third quarter, a full quarter ahead of our goal. We continue to diligently execute on our core initiatives and we see clear signs that our strategy is working. We're encouraged by the continued response we're receiving from our customers. Following a positive comp in July, we continue to gain momentum, achieving positive comps for each successive month, with the strongest results in October. Comp sales for the 13-week period ending October 28 were above our guidance, and this comp increase represents more than $750 million in additional same-store sales for the third quarter over last year.
Net sales rose 2.7% to $63.8 billion in the third quarter versus the prior year year's comparable period. Clearly, upward momentum. The comp was driven by growth in average ticket. While overall comp traffic was negative for the third quarter, our supercenters and discount stores had more than 125-basis point consecutive improvement in comp traffic from Q2. Neighborhood markets continued to post strong positive comp traffic for the quarter. In fact, our overall Walmart comp traffic improved 160 basis points sequentially over the second quarter, with October traffic relatively flat.
Traffic also benefited from the extension of our gas rollback program, as well as our holiday layaway service, which launched on October 17. 
Three key element drove the third quarter improvement. First, merchandise initiatives focused on expanded assortments, product innovation and local relevance that are recapturing trips to the store. Customers are responding to our SKU add-back program, which is now almost complete. As you know, we're always working on our assortment so you'll continue to see ongoing improvement in our merchandise.
Second, our integration of technology with associate productivity programs has improved in-stock. On-shelf availability continues to improve and is above the 93% we shared at the October Analyst Meeting. We're very well positioned with inventory in both store and online for the fourth quarter. 
Third, Walmart's mission is everyday low prices and we're communicating price throughout the store and with every kind of media from print to digital. Our price investment strategy makes a difference for our customers. 
Economic conditions in the third quarter remained largely unchanged. Our core customer was still impacted by high unemployment and continued uncertainty over the economy, leading to declining consumer confidence. Although they remained higher than a year ago, gas prices, which positively affect customer trips, moderated during the third quarter.
Among our business units, grocery, health and wellness and hardlines all delivered positive comps in the third quarter. Our food business had positive traffic trends throughout the quarter and posted mid-single digit comp. Rising food costs continue to be a major concern for customers. We hear from some shoppers that they believe it will be more difficult than ever to afford holiday meals for their families. We understand their concern and we see it every month in our customers' purchasing behavior. Some customers make difficult decisions to trade down the lower price points or trade out of certain categories completely.
As others in the industry reported, customers continue to see food prices rise in key categories, such as produce, dairy and meat. Walmart continues to invest in absorbing some of these increases to ensure price leadership in our markets. During the quarter, grocery inflation was approximately 4%, in line with what's been seen throughout the industry. But given our price investment, the impact to our customers was substantially less. With deflation and other categories, trade down and other initiatives we have in place, inflation for the total box was approximately 70 basis points.
Sales of consumables continue to improve, increasing approximately 100 basis points sequentially from the second quarter. The improvements in on-shelf availability contributed to higher conversion in traffic. Consumables are also another area where our assortment initiatives in such categories as cosmetics and pets are making a large impact. Within pets, the dog food category improved approximately 300 basis points, benefitting from continued add-backs and strength in our value brands.
Grocery, which includes food and consumables, continued its positive trend, and overall, delivered a low-single digit positive comp for the quarter.
Health and wellness continue to perform well, delivering a low-single digit positive comp. Like many other areas, our over-the-counter business also benefited from improved on-shelf availability during the quarter. The partnership with Humana for the Medicare Part D program continues to drive traffic in our pharmacies. Looking ahead, we expect to see an increase in conversion from branded prescriptions to generics, as strong brands, such as Lipitor, become available in a generic form.
General merchandise has always been important to our sales growth, and our renewed focus on improving assortment, presentation and price across GM categories is delivering sales improvement. It has been a matter of our merchants having the right assortment, delivering merchandising density and simplicity. We brought back brands and items that our customers want, especially in our heritage categories like sporting goods and crafts. We improved our utilization in space, brands and presentation to ensure customers can find what they're looking for. And simply, we made Walmart easier to shop. 
Our comp for hardlines improved 300 basis points sequentially from the second quarter to a low-single digit positive comp for the third quarter. This improvement was primarily driven by our heritage categories, including sporting goods, stationery and crafts. We've continued to add back space and assortment across these important areas. Hunting continued to significantly outperform our sporting goods business, with strong double-digit comps in the quarter for categories such as hunting apparel and related merchandising accessories. Tire sales, helped by special events, also remained strong. As we've expanded assortment and updated modulars, sales increased in stationery and crafts.
Customer feedback on the return of layaway has been overwhelmingly positive and layaway transaction volume continues to exceed plan. Our customers tell us that they appreciate that we've brought back this service, and it's a great way to help families on a tight budget shop for Christmas. As a reminder, we've added service fees to reduce layaway cancellations in the fourth quarter.
During the third quarter, we had a major modular reset for our toy business, and this helped drive sales at the end of the period just as layaway began. It's not surprising that our top toy and layaway is the LeapPad learning system, along with bikes and ride-on vehicles. In electronics, top layaway products are tablets, TVs and laptops. As you know, electronics and toys make up our entertainment business and are critically important sales drivers for the fourth quarter.
Entertainment was 160 basis points better than last quarter, and with layaway, we expect ongoing improvement for Q4. Our comp for Q3 was mid-single digit negative, reflecting the ongoing impact from electronics deflation.
A strong release schedule during the quarter, with titles such as Captain America, Transformers, and the Lion King drove favorable sales performance. Shoppers are clearly aware of the pricing environment and more of them are turning to Walmart for unbeatable prices, leading to an overall increase in our units for the quarter. 
Straight Talk continues to sell well, and the release of the Straight Talk Android phone in September drove sales even further. Customers are drawn to our value price offerings and catalog movie and music bins.
Apparel sales improved approximately 170 basis points over the previous quarter, leading to a low-single digit negative comp. Men's and ladies apparel had the strongest sales, where our focus on core basics and assortment initiatives is paying off. We expanded both space and assortment in our shoe department, which was timely for back-to-school, as that area achieved the first positive quarterly comp in more than 2 years. Colder than average temperatures in October drove cold weather apparel sales.
As we announced in October, we're relocating the apparel functions that have been based in New York back to Bentonville. Our customers expect high-quality basics and fashion basics at great prices. Roughly 40% of our apparel associates had remained in Bentonville and we will unite our apparel efforts in one location. We expect a smooth transition and plan to complete the move by February 2012.
Home comp for the quarter was a low-single digit negative. Outdoor living, including patio furniture, was the strongest performer. But economic pressure and slow housing sales continue to affect discretionary categories. We're seeing solid improvement in functional kitchen categories, such as single-serve coffee systems, microwaves and other food prep appliances. We're encouraged by the early results and seeing an increased momentum from expansion in home basics and opening price point items, as well as modular updates. The sales trends I've outlined here are also reflected at dotcom sales, with stronger performance in electronics, home and toy categories. 
As I mentioned earlier, our customers are still feeling pressure to reduce expenses wherever they can. Banking fees are a topic that's received a lot of attention recently, and our core customers continue to see alternatives to paying account fees. Walmart MoneyCenter provides those customers a low-cost alternative to access and control their money. Our customers see a clear benefit in this access to ""everyday life"" financial services and we're excited about the opportunity to continue to innovate in this area. Currently, we have MoneyCenters and service desks in all of our stores, and we have additional self-service kiosks in many other locations throughout the store.
Now let's move on to more of the specifics on financial results. As discussed at our October Investment Community Conference, we began our price investment during the third quarter. Additionally, cost increases in numerous categories were not passed on to our customers in the form of increased prices. Gross profit dollars were up 1.9% over last year's third quarter to $17.9 billion, growing slower than the rate of sales. Gross margin rate is down approximately 22 basis points from last year's third quarter. We leveraged expenses for the quarter. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses decreased 41 basis points. On a dollar basis, SG&A was up approximately 70 basis points compared to last year, on a 2.7% increase in sales.
Operating income grew faster than sales for the quarter. Operating income rose to $4.6 billion versus $4.4 billion last year. As a percentage of sales, operating income increased to 5.1%, driven by expense leverage and the increase in gross profit dollars.
Inventory was up 5.1% compared to this time last year, principally due to our continued focus on product add-backs, inflation and the implementation of our new layaway program. We're well positioned  with inventory as we head into the holiday period.
We're focused on growing through new stores and our priority remains supercenter growth. During the third quarter, we added 63 supercenters, including new stores, expansions and conversions. We expect gross profit rate for the fourth quarter to be down as we continue to execute our price investment strategy and see the mix change in the fourth quarter. Our focus on the productivity loop is paramount, and we will continue to drive operating expense leverage.
We've worked diligently throughout the year on our assortment and availability initiatives. In addition, we've worked hard on our communication to customers. We've also stepped up our marketing campaign across multiple media platforms this holiday. Customers will see and hear Walmart everywhere this holiday season. We have bought a strong share of voice nationally and in individual key markets. But we're also proud of our creative. We have some commercials that are funny and some that will just make you feel good.
Programs like layaway and our special 0% financing offer on the Walmart credit card will make holiday shopping easier and more attractive. Our ad match and holiday price guarantee will leave no doubt that Walmart is the clear price leader this holiday season.
And we're aggressively going after the business this season, starting even before Black Friday. We've been open on Thanksgiving Day for several years now. This year, at 10:00 p.m., we kick off the event with outstanding prices in toys, home and apparel. Our electronics items follow at midnight, and we'll have rollback prices throughout the store all day on Black Friday.
We're reaching out to customers on social media. Store-specific maps on Facebook will help our customers plan their shopping trip. There will be no doubt that Walmart is ready for the holiday season.
We have the assortment our customers are looking for, both in-store and online. We have the inventory they need and we have the prices that can't be beaten. We're forecasting comp sales for the 13-week period from October 29, 2011, through January 27, 2012, to range from flat to positive 2%. Last year's fourth quarter 13-week comp was negative 1.8%. I hope to see you in our stores. 
Now I'll turn it over to Doug for the International update."

But before I get into the numbers, let me begin with our plans for growing the business. 
Over the long term, we will drive aggressive, disciplined growth while reducing costs in the business to improve profitability. To help our markets achieve these goals, we have a 4-pronged approach. First, is growing comp sales. Our strategies across markets are delivering EDLP and developing strong merchants.. We're rolling out merchant academies throughout International to further develop their skills. 
The second pillar is new store growth, and we have a strong new store development program. We've added 12.7 million square feet of organic growth since the beginning of this year and we're on track to meet our forecast of 24 million to 27 million square feet. 
The third pillar is eCommerce and multichannel, and we're developing our skills in this area. We will leverage our brand and customer loyalty further in developed markets like Canada and U.K., as well as our emerging markets. In Brazil, eCommerce is growing at twice the pace of the market, and we have an award-winning website for customer friendliness.
The fourth pillar is strategic acquisitions. We're encouraged by the successful integration work in Chile and now in South Africa, and I'm very excited about the management teams in each of these markets. We continue to evaluate expansion opportunities around the world and within existing markets. 
Now let's get to the numbers. Walmart International reported third quarter net sales of $32.4 billion, an increase of 20.3% over last year. Changes in currency translation increased our reported net sales by $1.3 billion. 
On a constant currency basis, net sales were $31 billion, an increase of 15.3% over last year's third quarter and 7.5% excluding acquisitions. All of our markets had constant currency sales growth, with China, Mexico, and Argentina providing the strongest net sales growth in the third quarter. As a percentage of sales, Walmart International's third quarter gross profit declined 57 basis points on a reported basis and on a constant currency basis. After excluding acquisitions, constant currency gross profit margin was flat to last year.
Third quarter reported operating expenses were $6.4 billion, which includes an increase of $273 million due to changes in currency exchange rates. Walmart International leveraged constant currency operating expenses, growing them slower than sales at 12.4%. When you exclude our recent acquisitions, constant currency operating expenses grew only 5.5% on expense leverage from the U.K., Japan, Chile and Brazil.
Our third quarter reported operating income grew 14.2% from last year to $1.4 billion, and includes a benefit of $48 million from changes in currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, operating income grew 10.3%. Excluding acquisitions, constant currency operating income grew faster than sales at 8.5%.
On a reported basis, Walmart International's inventory grew at 18.7%. On a constant currency basis, and excluding acquisitions, inventory grew at 11.9%, which is faster than our target. In many cases, our days payable exceeds our days on hand. In addition, it's a challenge to properly time our purchase commitments with new store growth and merchandising imports in international markets. We recognize that we have ample opportunity to reduce inventory. Our goal remains to grow inventory at or less than half the rate of sales growth.
Now let's get into the results for several of our larger markets. Country management teams are held accountable for their results on a constant currency basis. The following discussion of country results excludes the impact of currency, and unless otherwise stated, sales and comp sales are presented on a nominal basis. Comp sales are reported on a calendar basis. 
In the U.K., ASDA had a solid third quarter, growing sales and growing operating income faster than sales, excluding fuel. In the third quarter of this year, comparable sales, excluding fuel, increased 1.3%. Traffic declined by 1.3% and average ticket increased 2.6% as customers continue to consolidate their trips in the face of high prices.
The U.K. grocery market is entering into what is traditionally a heavy promotional period in time for Christmas. ASDA, however, continues with a very simple promise to customers: Our prices are 10% cheaper than the competition on comparable baskets or we'll give you the difference. And ASDA's customers like it. Since this year, the prices of more than 13 million baskets have been checked online.
Expenses grew slower than sales in the third quarter. To deliver cost savings, sustainable productivity programs are embedded in our operations, which help fund lower prices for customers. For example, the Fewer, Cheaper Miles program is delivering cost savings within the distribution network by reducing fuel consumption and carbon emissions. 
The conversion of the Netto stores to ASDA supermarkets continues to progress on schedule, and sales and profits are exceeding our expectations. More than 70% were trading as ASDA supermarkets by the end of September, and today, we have only a few left to complete.
ASDA's online grocery sales continued to grow strongly in the third quarter, and now customers can order groceries using a smartphone. The on-time delivery rate has improved, with 19 of 20 customers receiving their purchase within the allotted time slot. 
ASDA opened a record number of stores this quarter for a total of 83, which includes 77 Netto conversions. This brings ASDA to a total of 542 stores, including 139 supermarkets. ASDA's customers are asking for great quality at great prices, so ASDA is extending its private brand ranges, and the premium ""Extra Special"" range is now backed by leading cookery school Leiths. Just recently, ASDA received recognition for both its quality products and being the lowest-priced supermarket.
Now for Canada. Walmart Canada continued to have solid sales growth. However, operating income grew slower than sales. Net sales grew 4.9% in the third quarter compared to last year, driven by food, consumables and health and wellness. For comparable stores, third quarter comparable sales increased 0.9% from last year. Average ticket increased 2.2% for the third quarter and traffic declined 1.3%. Both gross profit and expenses as a percentage of sales were flat to last year on continued successful expense management, even with the increase in costs from Walmart Canada Bank as it moves into its second year of operations.
Walmart Canada continues to have a robust supercenter expansion program, opening 4 supercenters during the third quarter, including store conversions, and celebrated the opening of its 150th supercenter during the quarter. Over the past 12 months, we opened 41 supercenters, including store conversions, bringing our store count to 329 stores.
Fiscal 2013 is a big growth year for Walmart Canada, with a goal to complete a record 73 store growth projects. This includes the renovation of the 39 Zellers stores leases we recently acquired.
Let's move to the Americas. Unless stated otherwise, the following discussion includes the consolidated results of Mexico and Central America. While these results are on a U.S. GAAP basis, Walmex separately reports its earnings under Mexican GAAP. So some numbers are different from the Walmex reported results.
Walmex had strong consolidated sales and operating income growth from last year's third quarter. On a consolidated basis, Walmex's net sales for the third quarter were up 9.6%. Comparable sales for Mexico were up 3% and average ticket in Mexico increased to 3.4% as customers welcomed the nationwide strengthening of EDLP. During the third quarter, customer traffic in Mexico declined 0.4%, and this includes the 1% increase we saw in September. In its October comp sales release, Walmex also cited traffic improvements for the first month of the fourth quarter.
Mexico's third quarter consolidated comp store sales for the self-service formats grew by 2.6%, while ANTAD's comp store sales report for the rest of the industry, excluding Walmex, grew faster at 3.3%. 
In Central America, overall sales increased 5.2% and comp sales were down 10 basis points on a constant currency basis. Walmex continues to work through the implementation of new strategies in formats, EDLP, and growth in our 5 Central American countries.
Third quarter consolidated gross profit margin and operating income as a percentage of sales were flat to last year. Walmex finished with 411 more stores than at the end of the third quarter last year. 
Moving on to Brazil. Net sales, comparable sales and average ticket all grew in the third quarter in nominal terms, and I'm proud to say that expenses grew slower than sales. We've converted a meaningful number of items to EDLP and we have more than 80% of our grocery and consumables SKUs at Every Day Low Prices. 
In real terms, Brazil's third quarter net sales declined 1% and comparable sales declined 5.7%. Average ticket declined 0.8% in real terms and customer traffic was also down. We need to improve our reputation for price leadership in Brazil to increase our transactions.
Third quarter gross profit margin as a percentage of sales was flat to last year, and Brazil successfully leveraged operating expenses through continued progress on expense management and energizing the productivity loop. But we still have a long way to go regarding Brazil's operating income.
Our Brazil team continues to find ways to combine being a better merchant with sustainability, including doubling the volume of local sourcing from our Producers Club. This program develops local farmers and reduces in-store food waste by 20%. In addition, Brazil offers customers a discount in exchange for not using plastic bags, which has reduced plastic bag waste by more than 40% since the program began. These efforts increase sales and drive customer loyalty because social and environmental issues are important to our customers. 
In the last 12 months, we've opened 44 net new stores in Brazil, bringing our total store count to 496. This includes 9 new stores in the third quarter of this year.
Moving to Asia. Japan's net sales, comparable sales and average ticket all grew in the third quarter in nominal terms, but Japan's operating income ended with a loss when compared to last year's profit. Walmart Japan continues to outperform the market, growing sales and comp sales approximately 1.9% in real terms. Third quarter traffic grew 0.4% and ticket grew 1.5% in real terms.
According to statistics released by the Japanese Ministry of the Economy, Trade and Industry, or METI, overall supermarket comparable sales for the third quarter declined by 1.7% from last year. 
Gross profit margin as a percentage of sales declined slightly on EDLP strengthening, and Walmart Japan continued the trend of leveraging expenses with highly effective workforce management programs.
Walmart China had strong sales growth in the third quarter and positive operating income growth. Net sales for the third quarter grew 16.1% over last year and comparable store growth was 6%. Average ticket grew 14.1% in China but traffic declined 7.1%. 
Gross margin as a percentage of sales was approximately flat to last year. China's expenses as a percentage of sales were flat to last year's third quarter, as the expense leverage achieved during the quarter was offset by the costs from new levies.
In the third quarter, we completed rebranding 56 Trust-Mart stores, which provided customers the same merchandise and shopping experience as the Walmart brand. We will continue to rebrand other Trust-Mart stores in the fourth quarter and early next year.
In October, we had 13 stores closed for 2 weeks in Chongquing as directed by the local regulator, the Administration for Industry and Commerce. During that 2-week period, management invested in associate training, the physical remodels of the stores and in compliance matters. The financial impact of these closures is not expected to be significant to our fourth quarter results, as all of these stores reopened on October 25.
Following the reopening, traffic and sales were strong, as customers reacted in a positive way to the changes made during the brief closure. As mentioned in various media reports, the Chongquing mayor approved of Walmart's actions and the government supports additional development by the company in China. We are now in the process of obtaining the local registrations for the Trust-Mart stores and this is the last principle condition to completing the second closing of our Trust-Mart purchase. 
In the past 12 months, we opened 54 new stores, including 49 supercenters, and that brings our China store count to 352 stores.
I'll close by covering some initiatives underway to improve the profitability in our emerging markets, including workforce management, logistics and shared services. Workforce management, for example, is our in-store productivity program in areas such as backroom receiving and on the sales floor. This is critical to the rollout of EDLP because we change how our store operates and reduce the volatility of operating cost. In fact, Japan's EDLC workforce management programs have reduced operating costs every year for the past 3 years. The Walmart Japan program is now the model for our other markets.
Our portfolio combines local relevance and global leverage. With our ""powered by Walmart"" tools, the productivity loop, EDLP and EDLC, there is an even broader future for Walmart International. 
And now I turn it over to Brian for the news on Sam's Club. Brian?"

Consistent with the overall club channel, our top line performance this quarter was exceptional. Comp sales, excluding fuel, increased by 5.7%. This is our seventh quarter of sequentially increasing comps. Membership renewals and members joi",1619,"Thanks, Doug. Consistent with the overall club channel, our top line performance this quarter was exceptional. Comp sales, excluding fuel, increased by 5.7%. This is our seventh quarter of sequentially increasing comps. Membership renewals and members joining at the Plus level continue to grow and we leveraged expenses again this quarter. We opened a new club, expanded a club and relocated 3 clubs during the period. This added over 190,000 square feet to our footprint. 
Similar to the first half of the year, our third quarter fuel business was strong. Fuel provide Sam's Club a great first price impression and is clearly a traffic driver for existing and potential members. We continue to pump more gallons of fuel and generate more sales dollars per gallon this year when compared to last year. Fuel prices in this year's third quarter were approximately 34% higher than a year ago and gallons sold were up 11%.
Including fuel, third quarter net sales were $13.3 billion, a 9.5% increase over last year. Gross profit increased by 5%. SG&A expense as a percentage of sales decreased by 62 basis points and operating income increased 6.3% to $390 million for the quarter. Volatility in fuel prices can have a notable impact on our financial results. The remainder of our discussion today, therefore, is focused on our core business and excludes fuel for comparative purposes unless otherwise noted. 
Now let's look at the financial results and our performance for the quarter. Net sales for the third quarter were $11.8 billion, up 6.2% from last year. Comp club sales for the 13-week period increased 5.7% and were strong across all 3 geographic operating divisions, led by the west division. Comp traffic and ticket increased for the 13-week period by 2.3% and 3.4%, respectively. Comp traffic and ticket increased for both Advantage and Business members.
We continue to see members visiting our clubs more frequently. During our Labor Day eValues Savings Celebration event, we had strong sales and solid membership performance. The quality of our comp sales growth in core categories remains very strong. Overall, we believe that inflation impacted our comp club sales by 325 to 375 basis points.
We continue to see mid-single digit inflation in food categories. Despite the inflation, units sold increased year-over-year. We continue to face challenges in tobacco sales, an important category to our convenience store business member. Our tobacco business has been impacted by declining industry consumption and the change in our credit rewards program that went into effect at the beginning of this year. The decline in tobacco comp sales had an impact of approximately 100 basis points on our total comp sales results. We anticipate tobacco being a headwind for the rest of the year.
Our focus on providing the best quality at a great value continues to drive strong performance in the fresh food categories. For the third quarter, we delivered double-digit comps in categories like bakery and bread and high-single digit comps in categories like produce. More and more of our members are skipping the restaurant trip and eating at home. This trend is driving significant sales increases in categories such as a home meal solutions and prepared meats.
Our members expect the best prices on our product they buy everyday and rewarded us in the third quarter with increased trips to the club. This led to double-digit comps in freezer/cooler and oil/rice/canned vegetable and food categories. Dry grocery and beverage categories delivered high-single digit comps, led by breakfast foods, coffee, and baking, while categories like snacks delivered mid-single digit comps.
Our pet supply business was strong, turning in high-single digit comps. Impacted by deflation, laundry and home care comps were down. And in a tough competitive market, baby care was down.
We remain focused on providing our members with the best quality, brands and value on home apparel and seasonal products. Home and apparel delivered a mid-single digit comp increase for the period. Driven by backyard recreation and family fun, our seasonal area recorded a high-single digit comp for the quarter. We recorded a mid-single digit comp in our apparel areas, led by strong sales in basic and men's, which offset weakness in ladies apparel.
Comps for our health and wellness area were in the low-single digits, led by growth in our pharmacy and optical areas. Pharmacy growth was led by our focused effort on driving script increases and building awareness of the great value and superior service provided by our pharmacist. Our investment in hearing centers continues to pay dividends, as members have responded to this unique service in our clubs. 
Deflation continues to negatively impact technology and entertainment categories, which had a low-single digit comp. Earlier this year, we made a decision to transition our leased wireless centers to an owned model. This change had enabled us to provide a more comprehensive service solution for our members and has driven solid sales performance for this category. Also our exclusive club channel relationship with Apple has expanded our presence in tablets and smartphones and delivered strong sales in these categories. We also had great performance in our battery category and we focused on branded item placement and updated pack sizes and display fixtures. In televisions, we continue to see a challenging deflationary environment, driving high-single digit negative comps for the quarter.
Technology is an important service for our members. Sam's Club just released a dividend update to our smartphone app. You can now purchase items available online or shop your club through click-and-pull directly from your smartphone. Our mobile app and upgraded website allow members the ability to review and shop our online and in-club inventory, build customized shopping lists and renew their membership straight from a smartphone. Also our iPad application is scheduled to be launched just in time for the key holiday season. We believe that these apps will be a tremendous benefit to our members and are very excited about making these channel-leading technology solutions available.
We continue to deliver on our commitment to quality and value, especially with our proprietary brands. These initiatives are important in giving our members choices. Here are a few highlights. 
Since the beginning of the year, we've introduced 3 new brands: Artisan Fresh in the deli and bakery areas; Simply Right in baby and health and beauty aids; and Daily Chef in frozen foods and refrigerated products. These new brands represented over 200 items to date, with plans to add 150 more by the end of Q1 next year. Early sales and member feedback are overwhelmingly positive, with results at or above expectations. Our upcoming holiday, Taste of Sam's event, will feature Artisan Fresh and Daily Chef items.
Membership and other income were down 13 basis points as a percentage of sales when compared to the third quarter last year. This reduction is driven by decline in rental income. As I mentioned earlier, in prior years, we rented space to a third party for a portion of our wireless business and receive rental income. Now we are running these businesses with Sam's Club associates, and the sales and expenses of the wireless business are included directly in our operating results.
Membership income for the third quarter increased 1.7% versus last year. Remember, for reporting purposes, membership income is recognized over the membership period, rather than when its collected. Renewals continue to increase at a rate that has exceeded our expectations and outpaced last year's performance, and our penetration of Plus members continues to grow at a healthy pace.
Business sign-up growth was strong during the third quarter, both sequentially and versus last year. Sales attributed to our proprietary credit program have continued at a steady upward path. As we reported in our Q2 earnings communication, members who possess a Sam's Club-branded credit card tend to have higher levels of engagement and loyalty. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate continued positive momentum in membership.
Our gross margin rate decreased by 28 basis points compared to the third quarter last year, while gross profit dollars increased 4%. The highly competitive retail environment, as well as cost inflation in several categories, impacted our gross margin performance. I continue to be pleased with how our clubs are managing expenses this year. Driven by strong wage cost control, we reduced third quarter expenses as a percentage of sales by 31 basis points. You may remember that in last year's call, we discussed the impact of higher interchange fees related to the Sam's reward credit program. I'm happy to say that when with this expense is excluded from last year's comparison, we leveraged expenses by 13 basis points.
These expense control results demonstrate how we're driving operational efficiencies. For the quarter, sales per labor hour increased 2.1%. However, units per labor hour decreased 1.5%, impacted by additional associates running our now-owned wireless business. 
Looking at the bottom line, our third quarter operating income increased to $378 million, a 3.3% increase over the third quarter last year.
At the end of the third quarter, inventory, including fuel inventory, was up 1% compared to last year. Overall, we are pleased with the inventory levels in our clubs and distribution centers. 
Looking ahead, we're ready for the upcoming holiday season. Our club associates are energized. We have many new and exciting items across the club, from fresh to gifts. Going into the fourth quarter, our sales momentum remains strong and we expect comp club sales without fuel for the 13-week period from October 29, 2011, through January 27, 2012, to increase 4% to 6%. Last year, Sam's comp club sales, excluding fuel, increased 2.7% for the comparable 13-week period.
Now, I will turn the program over to Charles for a wrap up in guidance. Charles?"
313055,129808285,192191,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 15, 2011",2011-11-15,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brian.

We continue to be encouraged by the ongoing sales momentum at Sam's and by the Walmart U.S. improvement in comps during the last 4 months. We still have a lot of work to d",550,"Thanks, Brian. As Mike said, our business is stronger today than it was a year ago. We continue to be encouraged by the ongoing sales momentum at Sam's and by the Walmart U.S. improvement in comps during the last 4 months. We still have a lot of work to do to increase traffic in many of our international markets, but we are confident in the plans that the country management teams have in place. We recognize that the global economy is still weak and consumers continue to behave conservatively.
Looking back over the last 5 years, comp store sales were a relatively small contributor to our overall growth. It's important that comp sales growth is a priority for our company going forward. Investing in new stores is also important. Remember, these are future comp sales and profit generators, which in turn, add to future returns for shareholders.
One of the most important keys to growing our sales is to have the lowest possible price. Keeping our expenses low will allow us to invest in prices going forward. I'm proud of the progress that we're making in expense leverage. At the end of this fiscal year, we will have levered SG&A expenses for 2 consecutive years. Throughout the company, we continue to be focused on improving processes and productivity, eliminating waste and reducing SG&A expenses.
Not only will leveraging expenses allow us to invest in prices, but it will help improve returns in our emerging markets like Brazil and China. Emerging markets provide great opportunities for Walmart to serve customers with assortment and prices they have never had access to before. These markets will also provide some great returns down the road for our company.
At our meeting for the investment community last month, I outlined our goal to reduce SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales by more than 100 basis points over the next 5 years. That goal may be affected with the start of our new fiscal year on February 1, but we are well on our way to having the right strategies and plans in place to reach it.
Our earnings performance continues to translate into strong free cash flow, and I would expect that to continue in the future. Cash flow is the foundation of a company's balance sheet, and Walmart's balance sheet remains strong. That is a real advantage in today's economic environment. We continue to maintain access to extensive short and long term funding sources at historically low rates.
Now let's move on to guidance. Based on our view of the business and the global economy, we expect fourth quarter fiscal 2012 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.42 and $1.48. Last year, we reported fourth quarter earnings per share of $1.41, which included $0.07 per share of tax benefit primarily due to the repatriation of certain non-U.S. earnings that increased U.S. foreign tax credits.
Our full year earnings per share guidance is now between $4.45 and $4.51. All guidance estimates assumed that currency exchange rates remain at current levels. This compares to last year's results of $4.18, or an underlying $4.07 due to the $0.11 of tax benefits.
Thank you for listening today. We really appreciate your continued interest in Walmart. We hope you all have a great holiday."

Mike Duke, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., will open the call with his thoughts about the quarter. Jeff Davis, SVP of Finance and Treasurer, will cover the consolidated financial details, then we'll go to the operating segments. 
First, Bill Simon, President and CEO of Walmart U.S., will begin our segment discussions. Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart International, will follow Bill. And then we'll close with Brian Cornell, President and CEO of Sam's Club. Charles Holley, our CFO, will wrap up with his thoughts, as well as EPS guidance for the fourth quarter and the full year.
A few reminders. You're familiar with the fact that Wal-Mart U.S. has made layaway services available to our customers beginning October 17. Please note, for financial reporting purposes, layaway transactions are included in revenue when the sale is completed and the merchandise is picked up. Customers are required to pick up merchandise by December 16. Therefore, the majority of revenue from layaway transactions will fall in the fourth quarter. And our comp sales that are reported today do not include the effect of layaway sales. 
All comp sales discussions for the U.S. businesses are on the 4-5-4 retail calendar. Details on comp sales for the countries within Wal-Mart International are on a calendar basis. 
Our fiscal calendars for international differ from that of our corporate time line. With the exception of Canada and Massmart, our International operations end their fiscal year on December 31 and report on a one-month lag. Canada, like the U.S., reports results based on a fiscal year end of January 31. Massmart currently reports on a June 30 fiscal year end, but is consolidated into our results on a calendar year basis with a one-month lag.
Please mark your calendars for next October. We're announcing today that the fiscal year 2013 Annual Meeting for the Investment Community, commonly referred to as Walmart's Analyst Meeting, will be on Wednesday, October 10, 2012.

Let me start with 3 key takeaways for the third quarter. First, Walmart reported earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.97 within our guidance. Second, both Wal-Mart U.S. and Sam's Club exceeded comp g",850,"Thanks, Carol. Good morning, everyone. Let me start with 3 key takeaways for the third quarter. 
First, Walmart reported earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.97 within our guidance. Second, both Wal-Mart U.S. and Sam's Club exceeded comp guidance for the third quarter, with Wal-Mart U.S. increasing comp sales 1.3% and Sam's Club posting a comp, without fuel, of 5.7%. Third, the company leveraged operating expenses with each of the 3 operating segments achieving this goal as well. We remain committed to leveraging expenses again this year.
Here are some additional third quarter highlights. Net sales increased 8.2% to $109.5 billion. International reported net sales of more than $32 billion, approximately a 20% increase over last year's third quarter. This includes our acquisitions and currency impact. Consolidated operating income grew 4.8%. Walmart ended the quarter with free cash flow of $3.4 billion. The company returned $2.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases for the quarter. These results continue to reinforce our strong financial position. Every business segment is stronger than it was a year ago and we delivered solid earnings growth. I'm really pleased with our top line performance and our momentum going into the fourth quarter. Our overall performance reflects the Walmart strategy of driving the productivity loop, leveraging expenses and investing in price leadership.
Now let's review our individual segments. Wal-Mart U.S. has said consistently that its goal was positive comps by year end, and the team delivered on this goal in the third quarter. Operating income also grew faster than sales. The Wal-Mart U.S. team has aggressively executed its plan to broaden assortment, improve merchandising and reaffirm Walmart's price leadership. The plan is working, customers are responding favorably and it's good to see that reflected in our comp store sales improvement. 
While we feel good about the progress in our stores, our customers remain concerned about jobs, and only 1 in 10 Walmart moms that we surveyed view the state of the U.S. economy as good. They want to save money. They're juggling credit cards, using coupons and skipping restaurants and vacations. There is a real sense that the economic strain is taking its toll. 
To help ease that strain, the entire Wal-Mart U.S. team is very focused on saving our customers' money during the holidays by continuing its price investment strategy. Beyond EDLP, we have a number of additional programs in place for the fourth quarter, including the Christmas price guarantee, holiday layaway and free online shipping options. The integration of our stores and online is a point of differentiation for customers, especially during the busy holiday season. With more than 3,800 stores and 120 distribution centers serving those U.S. stores, Walmart can offer multichannel access in a way that no other retailer can. From our stores to online and mobile apps, customers can shop on their own terms.
Wal-Mart International delivered strong sales in the third quarter. Operating income was up 14.2%. Like the U.S., our international markets are ready for the upcoming holidays. We continue to see strong consumer demand in emerging markets, and our mission is relevant across all formats around the world. EDLP is becoming an even stronger competitive advantage for us as we integrate that positioning into more markets. 
Profitable growth is the top priority for the team. We have plans in place to improve operating profit and returns in International and support a vibrant growth engine for our company.
Sam's Club posted impressive results, with another quarter of strong comp sales growth and greater momentum in membership. I continue to be really pleased with the merchandising and the operations improvements. Sam's is also very well positioned for the holiday season, both for Advantage and Business members. We fully expect Sam's to surpass the $50 billion mark in net sales by year end and this will be a milestone for our clubs.
In the third quarter, we were also pleased with the response to our new global women's empowerment initiative. The program will expand economic operative for more women and help us attract and develop great talent. Walmart will keep doing what's right and what's good for business.
As I've said at the Investor Meeting in October, there is no doubt that Walmart is the best positioned global retailer. We have the right plans in place to deliver for the fourth quarter and the long term. We will continue our U.S. comp sales momentum and we will improve the profitability of our international markets. We will reduce SG&A expenses further and use those savings to drive prices down for our customers. We will make visible progress in building our eCommerce business and we will recruit and develop even stronger talent throughout the organization.
Looking ahead, we will be an even stronger company a year from now. These plans also will lead to greater shareholder value. Now before I hand the microphone over to Jeff, on behalf of everyone at Walmart, our best wishes to you for a happy and healthy holiday season and a prosperous new year. 
Now Jeff will cover the details on our consolidated results. Jeff?"

Total U.S. comp sales, without fuel, for the 13-week period ended October 28 were 1.9%. This was driven by both Wal-Mart U.S. and Sam's Club exceeding guidance for the reporting period. Bill and Brian will provide more details on Wal-Mart U.S. and Sam's Club later in the call. 
For the third quarter, gross profit margin on net sales was 24.6%, a 52-basis point reduction compared to the same time last year. All 3 operating segments realized a decline in gross profit margin from the impact of price investment and cost inflation. You will hear more from our segment CEOs later in the call.
Now let's move our attention to leverage. We remain focused on growing operating expenses at a rate less than net sales growth and growing operating income at a rate greater than net sales growth. The company leveraged operating expenses as a percentage of sales by 40 basis points for the quarter. All 3 operating segments contributed to the leverage.  Operating expenses were 19.9% of sales compared to 20.3% last year.
Unallocated corporate overhead and other, which includes our Global eCommerce area, increased approximately 40.7% to $536 million for the third quarter. Our Global eCommerce initiatives contributed the majority of the increase as we continue to invest in our eCommerce platforms, including @WalmartLabs. Depreciation expense increased year-over-year based on our financial system investments, with the remainder of the increase driven by multiple items, none of which is individually significant.
As Mike stated, we continue to drive productivity and reduce costs. We expect to carry the leverage momentum into the fourth quarter.
Consolidated operating income was $5.9 billion, a 4.8% increase versus last year. Operating income included a $48 million currency translation benefit. Net interest expense for the quarter increased 3.7% to $535 million, which included a reduction in tax-related interest accruals. For the fourth quarter, we are forecasting high-single digit growth in net interest. 
Debt-to-capitalization ratio at the end of the third quarter was 46.9% compared to 46.4% last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 34.5% versus 29.5% last year. Recall that last year's rate included a $191 million benefit from certain tax adjustments mentioned earlier. This year's effective tax rate was in line with our previous guidance and we expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 to be at the lower end of our range of 33.5% to 34.5%. However, our tax rate may be impacted by a number of factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations. This leads us to income from continuing operations attributable to Walmart, which was $3.3 billion. 
Now moving to returns. During the third quarter, the company repurchased approximately 27 million shares representing $1.4 billion. This brings the year-to-date repurchase to $5 billion, or 92.4 million shares. As of October 31, Walmart had $12.7 billion remaining under the current $15 billion share repurchase authorization. 
In addition to share repurchases, the company returned $1.3 billion and $3.8 billion to shareholders through dividends for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively. Combining share repurchases and dividends, Walmart returned $2.7 billion to shareholders in the quarter and $8.8 billion so far this year. 
Consolidated inventory grew 7.5%, driven primarily by Wal-Mart International's growth through acquisitions, new stores and currency impact. Payables as a percentage of inventories were 85%, in line with the prior year.
Capital expenditures were approximately $3.9 billion for the third quarter compared to $3.8 billion last year. In October, we updated our fiscal 2012 capital expenditure guidance to be between $13 billion and $14 billion, which includes approximately $500 million for acquisition-related capital expenditures for ASDA and Massmart.
We continue to identify great opportunities to open new stores globally. We added 159 net new retail units in the third quarter, with 130 delivered by Wal-Mart International. Wal-Mart U.S. added nearly 5 million square feet. A large portion of the increase was a result of our increased emphasis on Supercenters as we converted more discount stores and opened more new Supercenters than in the past several years. Total company square footage expanded approximately 8.7 million square feet during the quarter.
Free cash flow was $3.4 billion at the end of the quarter, ahead of $2.9 billion last year. Year-to-date, our strong operating cash flows more than offset the additional $225 million spent on capital expenditures versus last year.
Return on investment, or ROI, for the trailing 12 months ended October 31, 2011, was 18.2% compared to 18.6% for the previous year. As we had anticipated, the majority of the decline was attributable to the impact from acquisitions.
Now let's turn over to our operating segments. We'll start with Wal-Mart U.S., Bill?"

As Mike mentioned earlier, Wal-Mart U.S. achieved a 1.3% comp in the third quarter, a full quarter ahead of our goal. We continue to diligently execute on our core initiatives and we see clear signs that our strategy is working. We're encouraged by the continued response we're receiving from our customers. Following a positive comp in July, we continue to gain momentum, achieving positive comps for each successive month, with the strongest results in October. Comp sales for the 13-week period ending October 28 were above our guidance, and this comp increase represents more than $750 million in additional same-store sales for the third quarter over last year.
Net sales rose 2.7% to $63.8 billion in the third quarter versus the prior year's comparable period. Clearly, upward momentum. The comp was driven by growth in average ticket. While overall comp traffic was negative for the third quarter, our Supercenters and discount stores had more than 125-basis point consecutive improvement in comp traffic from Q2. Neighborhood Markets continued to post strong positive comp traffic for the quarter. In fact, our overall Walmart comp traffic improved 160 basis points sequentially over the second quarter, with October traffic relatively flat.
Traffic also benefited from the extension of our gas rollback program, as well as our holiday layaway service, which launched on October 17. 
Three key elements drove the third quarter improvement. First, merchandise initiatives focused on expanded assortments, product innovation and local relevance that are recapturing trips to the store. Customers are responding to our SKU add-back program, which is now almost complete. As you know, we're always working on our assortment so you'll continue to see ongoing improvement in our merchandise.
Second, our integration of technology with associate productivity programs has improved in-stock. On-shelf availability continues to improve and is above the 93% we shared at the October Analyst Meeting. We're very well positioned with inventory in both store and online for the fourth quarter. 
Third, Walmart's mission is Every Day Low Prices and we're communicating price throughout the store and with every kind of media from print to digital. Our price investment strategy makes a difference for our customers. 
Economic conditions in the third quarter remained largely unchanged. Our core customer was still impacted by high unemployment and continued uncertainty over the economy, leading to declining consumer confidence. Although they remained higher than a year ago, gas prices, which positively affect customer trips, moderated during the quarter.
Among our business units, grocery, health and wellness and Hardlines all delivered positive comps in the third quarter. Our food business had positive traffic trends throughout the quarter and posted mid-single digit comp. Rising food costs continue to be a major concern for customers. We hear from some shoppers that they believe it will be more difficult than ever to afford holiday meals for their families. We understand their concern and we see it every month in our customers' purchasing behavior. Some customers make difficult decisions to trade down to lower price points or trade out of certain categories completely.
As others in the industry reported, customers continue to see food prices rise in key categories, such as produce, dairy and meat. Walmart continues to invest in absorbing some of these increases to ensure price leadership in our markets. During the quarter, grocery inflation was approximately 4%, in line with what's been seen throughout the industry. But given our price investment, the impact to our customers was substantially less. With deflation and other categories, trade down and other initiatives we have in place, inflation for the total box was approximately 70 basis points.
Sales of consumables continue to improve, increasing approximately 100 basis points sequentially from the second quarter. The improvements in on-shelf availability contributed to higher conversion in traffic. Consumables are also another area where our assortment initiatives in such categories as cosmetics and pets are making a large impact. Within pets, the dog food category improved approximately 300 basis points, benefitting from continued add-backs and strength in our value brands.
Grocery, which includes food and consumables, continued its positive trend, and overall, delivered a low-single digit positive comp for the quarter.
Health and wellness continued to perform well, delivering a low-single digit positive comp. Like many other areas, our over-the-counter business also benefited from improved on-shelf availability during the quarter. The partnership with Humana for the Medicare Part D program continues to drive traffic in our pharmacies. Looking ahead, we expect to see an increase in conversion from branded prescriptions to generics, as strong brands, such as Lipitor, become available in a generic form.
General merchandise has always been important to our sales growth, and our renewed focus on improving assortment, presentation and price across GM categories is delivering sales improvement. It has been a matter of our merchants having the right assortment, delivering merchandising density and simplicity. We brought back brands and items that our customers want, especially in our heritage categories like sporting goods and crafts. We improved our utilization of space, brands and presentation to ensure customers can find what they're looking for. And simply, we made Walmart easier to shop. 
Our comp for Hardlines improved 300 basis points sequentially from the second quarter to a low-single digit positive comp for the third quarter. This improvement was primarily driven by our heritage categories, including sporting goods, stationery and crafts. We've continued to add back space and assortment across these important areas. Hunting continued to significantly outperform our sporting goods business, with strong double-digit comps in the quarter for categories such as hunting apparel and related merchandising accessories. Tire sales, helped by special events, also remained strong. As we've expanded assortment and updated modulars, sales increased in stationery and crafts.
Customer feedback on the return of layaway has been overwhelmingly positive and layaway transaction volume continues to exceed plan. Our customers tell us that they appreciate that we've brought back this service, and it's a great way to help families on a tight budget shop for Christmas. As a reminder, we've added service fees to reduce layaway cancellations in the fourth quarter.
During the third quarter, we had a major modular reset for our toy business, and this helped drive sales at the end of the period just as layaway began. It's not surprising that our top toy on layaway is the LeapPad learning system, along with bikes and ride-on vehicles. In electronics, top layaway products are tablets, TVs and laptops. As you know, electronics and toys make up our entertainment business and are critically important sales drivers for the fourth quarter.
Entertainment was 160 basis points better than last quarter, and with layaway, we expect ongoing improvement for Q4. Our comp for Q3 was mid-single digit negative, reflecting the ongoing impact from electronics deflation.
A strong release schedule during the quarter, with titles such as Captain America, Transformers, and the Lion King drove favorable sales performance. Shoppers are clearly aware of the pricing environment and more of them are turning to Walmart for unbeatable prices, leading to an overall increase in our units for the quarter. 
Straight Talk continues to sell well, and the release of the Straight Talk Android phone in September drove sales even further. Customers are drawn to our value price offerings and catalog movie and music bins.
Apparel sales improved approximately 170 basis points over the previous quarter, leading to a low-single digit negative comp. Men's and ladies apparel had the strongest sales, where our focus on core basics and assortment initiatives is paying off. We expanded both space and assortment in our shoe department, which was timely for back-to-school, as that area achieved the first positive quarterly comp in more than 2 years. Colder than average temperatures in October drove cold weather apparel sales.
As we announced in October, we're relocating the apparel functions that have been based in New York back to Bentonville. Our customers expect high-quality basics and fashion basics at great prices. Roughly 40% of our apparel associates had remained in Bentonville and we will unite our apparel efforts in one location. We expect a smooth transition and plan to complete the move by February 2012.
Home comp for the quarter was a low-single digit negative. Outdoor living, including patio furniture, was the strongest performer. But economic pressure and slow housing sales continue to affect discretionary categories. We're seeing solid improvement in functional kitchen categories, such as single-serve coffee systems, microwaves and other food prep appliances. We're encouraged by the early results and seeing an increased momentum from expansion in home basics and opening price point items, as well as modular updates. The sales trends I've outlined here are also reflected at our dotcom sales, with stronger performance in electronics, home and toy categories. 
As I mentioned earlier, our customers are still feeling pressure to reduce expenses wherever they can. Banking fees are a topic that's received a lot of attention recently, and our core customers continue to see alternatives to paying account fees. Walmart MoneyCenter provides those customers a low-cost alternative to access and control their money. Our customers see a clear benefit in this access to ""everyday life"" financial services and we're excited about the opportunity to continue to innovate in this area. Currently, we have MoneyCenters and service desks in all of our stores, and we have additional self-service kiosks in many other locations throughout the store.
Now let's move on to more of the specifics on financial results. As discussed at our October Investment Community Conference, we began our price investment during the third quarter. Additionally, cost increases in numerous categories were not passed on to our customers in the form of increased prices. Gross profit dollars were up 1.9% over last year's third quarter to $17.9 billion, growing slower than the rate of sales. Gross margin rate is down approximately 22 basis points from last year's third quarter. We leveraged expenses for the quarter. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses decreased 41 basis points. On a dollar basis, SG&A was up approximately 70 basis points compared to last year, on a 2.7% increase in sales.
Operating income grew faster than sales for the quarter. Operating income rose to $4.6 billion versus $4.4 billion last year. As a percentage of sales, operating income increased to 5.1%, driven by expense leverage and the increase in gross profit dollars.
Inventory was up 5.1% compared to this time last year, principally due to our continued focus on product add-backs, inflation and the implementation of our new layaway program. We're well positioned with inventory as we head into the holiday period.
We're focused on growing through new stores and our priority remains Supercenter growth. During the third quarter, we added 63 supercenters, including new stores, expansions and conversions. We expect gross profit rate for the fourth quarter to be down as we continue to execute our price investment strategy and see the mix change in the fourth quarter. Our focus on the productivity loop is paramount, and we will continue to drive operating expense leverage.
We've worked diligently throughout the year on our assortment and availability initiatives. In addition, we've worked hard on our communication to customers. We've also stepped up our marketing campaign across multiple media platforms this holiday. Customers will see and hear Walmart everywhere this holiday season. We have bought a strong share of voice nationally and in individual key markets. But we're also proud of our creative. We have some commercials that are funny and some that will just make you feel good.
Programs like layaway and our special 0% financing offer on the Walmart credit card will make holiday shopping easier and more attractive. Our ad match and holiday price guarantee will leave no doubt that Walmart is the clear price leader this holiday season.
And we're aggressively going after the business this season, starting even before Black Friday. We've been open on Thanksgiving Day for several years now. This year, at 10:00 p.m., we kick off the event with outstanding prices in toys, home and apparel. Our electronics items follow at midnight, and we'll have rollback prices throughout the store all day on Black Friday.
We're reaching out to customers on social media. Store-specific maps on Facebook will help our customers plan their shopping trip. There will be no doubt that Walmart is ready for the holiday season.
We have the assortment our customers are looking for, both in-store and online. We have the inventory they need and we have the prices that can't be beaten. We're forecasting comp sales for the 13-week period from October 29, 2011, through January 27, 2012, to range from flat to positive 2%. Last year's fourth quarter 13-week comp was negative 1.8%. I hope to see you in our stores. 
Now I'll turn it over to Doug for the International update."

But before I get into the numbers, let me begin with our plans for growing the business. 
Over the long term, we will drive aggressive, disciplined growth while reducing costs in the business to improve profitability. To help our markets achieve these goals, we have a 4-pronged approach. First, is growing comp sales. Our strategies across markets are delivering EDLP and developing strong merchants. We're rolling out merchant academies throughout International to further develop their skills. 
The second pillar is new store growth, and we have a strong new store development program. We've added 12.7 million square feet of organic growth since the beginning of this year and we're on track to meet our forecast of 24 million to 27 million square feet. 
The third pillar is eCommerce and multichannel, and we're developing our skills in this area. We will leverage our brand and customer loyalty further in developed markets like Canada and U.K., as well as our emerging markets. In Brazil, eCommerce is growing at twice the pace of the market, and we have an award-winning website for customer friendliness.
The fourth pillar is strategic acquisitions. We're encouraged by the successful integration work in Chile and now in South Africa, and I'm very excited about the management teams in each of these markets. We continue to evaluate expansion opportunities around the world and within existing markets. 
Now let's get to the numbers. Wal-Mart International reported third quarter net sales of $32.4 billion, an increase of 20.3% over last year. Changes in currency translation increased our reported net sales by $1.3 billion. 
On a constant currency basis, net sales were $31 billion, an increase of 15.3% over last year's third quarter and 7.5% excluding acquisitions. All of our markets had constant currency sales growth, with China, Mexico, and Argentina providing the strongest net sales growth in the third quarter. As a percentage of sales, Wal-Mart International's third quarter gross profit declined 57 basis points on a reported basis and on a constant currency basis. After excluding acquisitions, constant currency gross profit margin was flat to last year.
Third quarter reported operating expenses were $6.4 billion, which includes an increase of $273 million due to changes in currency exchange rates. Wal-Mart International leveraged constant currency operating expenses, growing them slower than sales at 12.4%. When you exclude our recent acquisitions, constant currency operating expenses grew only 5.5% on expense leverage from the U.K., Japan, Chile and Brazil.
Our third quarter reported operating income grew 14.2% from last year to $1.4 billion, and includes a benefit of $48 million from changes in currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, operating income grew 10.3%. Excluding acquisitions, constant currency operating income grew faster than sales at 8.5%.
On a reported basis, Wal-Mart International's inventory grew at 18.7%. On a constant currency basis, and excluding acquisitions, inventory grew at 11.9%, which is faster than our target. In many cases, our days payable exceeds our days on hand. In addition, it's a challenge to properly time our purchase commitments with new store growth and merchandising imports in international markets. We recognize that we have ample opportunity to reduce inventory. Our goal remains to grow inventory at or less than half the rate of sales growth.
Now let's get into the results for several of our larger markets. Country management teams are held accountable for their results on a constant currency basis. The following discussion of country results excludes the impact of currency, and unless otherwise stated, sales and comp sales are presented on a nominal basis. Comp sales are reported on a calendar basis. 
In the U.K., ASDA had a solid third quarter, growing sales and growing operating income faster than sales, excluding fuel. In the third quarter of this year, comparable sales, excluding fuel, increased 1.3%. Traffic declined by 1.3% and average ticket increased 2.6% as customers continue to consolidate their trips in the face of high prices.
The U.K. grocery market is entering into what is traditionally a heavy promotional period in time for Christmas. ASDA, however, continues with a very simple promise to customers: Our prices are 10% cheaper than the competition on comparable baskets or we'll give you the difference. And ASDA's customers like it. Since this year, the prices of more than 13 million baskets have been checked online.
Expenses grew slower than sales in the third quarter. To deliver cost savings, sustainable productivity programs are embedded in our operations, which help fund lower prices for customers. For example, the Fewer, Cheaper Miles program is delivering cost savings within the distribution network by reducing fuel consumption and carbon emissions. 
The conversion of the Netto stores to ASDA supermarkets continues to progress on schedule, and sales and profits are exceeding our expectations. More than 70% were trading as ASDA supermarkets by the end of September, and today, we have only a few left to complete.
ASDA's online grocery sales continued to grow strongly in the third quarter, and now customers can order groceries using a smartphone. The on-time delivery rate has improved, with 19 of 20 customers receiving their purchase within the allotted time slot.  
ASDA opened a record number of stores this quarter for a total of 83, which includes 77 Netto conversions. This brings ASDA to a total of 542 stores, including 139 supermarkets. ASDA's customers are asking for great quality at great prices, so ASDA is extending its private brand ranges, and the premium ""Extra Special"" range is now backed by leading cookery school Leiths. Just recently, ASDA received recognition for both its quality products and being the lowest-priced supermarket.
Now for Canada. Walmart Canada continued to have solid sales growth. However, operating income grew slower than sales. Net sales grew 4.9% in the third quarter compared to last year, driven by food, consumables and health and wellness. For comparable stores, third quarter comparable sales increased 0.9% from last year. Average ticket increased 2.2% for the third quarter and traffic declined 1.3%. Both gross profit and expenses as a percentage of sales were flat to last year on continued successful expense management, even with the increase in costs from Walmart Canada Bank as it moves into its second year of operations.
Walmart Canada continues to have a robust Supercenter expansion program, opening 4 Supercenters during the third quarter, including store conversions, and celebrated the opening of its 150th Supercenter during the quarter. Over the past 12 months, we opened 41 Supercenters, including store conversions, bringing our store count to 329 stores.
Fiscal 2013 is a big growth year for Walmart Canada, with a goal to complete a record 73 store growth projects. This includes the renovation of the 39 Zellers stores leases we recently acquired.
Let's move to the Americas. Unless stated otherwise, the following discussion includes the consolidated results of Mexico and Central America. While these results are on a U.S. GAAP basis, Walmex separately reports its earnings under Mexican GAAP. So some numbers are different from the Walmex reported results.
Walmex had strong consolidated sales and operating income growth from last year's third quarter. On a consolidated basis, Walmex's net sales for the third quarter were up 9.6%. Comparable sales for Mexico were up 3% and average ticket in Mexico increased 3.4% as customers welcomed the nationwide strengthening of EDLP. During the third quarter, customer traffic in Mexico declined 0.4%, and this includes the 1% increase we saw in September. In its October comp sales release, Walmex also cited traffic improvements for the first month of the fourth quarter.
Mexico's third quarter consolidated comp store sales for the self-service formats grew by 2.6%, while ANTAD's comp store sales report for the rest of the industry, excluding Walmex, grew faster at 3.3%. 
In Central America, overall sales increased 5.2% and comp sales were down 10 basis points on a constant currency basis. Walmex continues to work through the implementation of new strategies and formats, EDLP, and growth in our 5 Central American countries. 
Third quarter consolidated gross profit margin and operating income as a percentage of sales were flat to last year. Walmex finished with 411 more stores than at the end of the third quarter last year. 
Moving on to Brazil. Net sales, comparable sales and average ticket all grew in the third quarter in nominal terms, and I'm proud to say that expenses grew slower than sales. We've converted a meaningful number of items to EDLP and we have more than 80% of our grocery and consumables SKUs at Every Day Low Prices. 
In real terms, Brazil's third quarter net sales declined 1% and comparable sales declined 5.7%. Average ticket declined 0.8% in real terms and customer traffic was also down. We need to improve our reputation for price leadership in Brazil to increase our transactions.
Third quarter gross profit margin as a percentage of sales was flat to last year, and Brazil successfully leveraged operating expenses through continued progress on expense management and energizing the productivity loop. But we still have a long way to go regarding Brazil's operating income.
Our Brazil team continues to find ways to combine being a better merchant with sustainability, including doubling the volume of local sourcing from our Producers Club. This program develops local farmers and reduces in-store food waste by 20%. In addition, Brazil offers customers a discount in exchange for not using plastic bags, which has reduced plastic bag waste by more than 40% since the program began. These efforts increase sales and drive customer loyalty because social and environmental issues are important to our customers. 
In the last 12 months, we've opened 44 net new stores in Brazil, bringing our total store count to 496. This includes 9 new stores in the third quarter of this year.
Moving to Asia. Japan's net sales, comparable sales and average ticket all grew in the third quarter in nominal terms, but Japan's operating income ended with a loss when compared to last year's profit. Walmart Japan continues to outperform the market, growing sales and comp sales approximately 1.9% in real terms. Third quarter traffic grew 0.4% and ticket grew 1.5% in real terms.
According to statistics released by the Japanese Ministry of the Economy, Trade and Industry, or METI, overall supermarket comparable sales for the third quarter declined by 1.7% from last year. 
Gross profit margin as a percentage of sales declined slightly on EDLP strengthening, and Walmart Japan continued the trend of leveraging expenses with highly effective workforce management programs.
Walmart China had strong sales growth in the third quarter and positive operating income growth. Net sales for the third quarter grew 16.1% over last year and comparable store growth was 6%. Average ticket grew 14.1% in China but traffic declined 7.1%. 
Gross margin as a percentage of sales was approximately flat to last year. China's expenses as a percentage of sales were flat to last year's third quarter, as the expense leverage achieved during the quarter was offset by the costs from new levies.
In the third quarter, we completed rebranding 56 Trust-Mart stores, which provided customers the same merchandise and shopping experience as the Walmart brand. We will continue to rebrand other Trust-Mart stores in the fourth quarter and early next year.
In October, we had 13 stores closed for 2 weeks in Chongquing as directed by the local regulator, the Administration for Industry and Commerce. During that 2-week period, management invested in associate training, the physical remodels of the stores and in compliance matters. The financial impact of these closures is not expected to be significant to our fourth quarter results, as all of these stores reopened on October 25.
Following the reopening, traffic and sales were strong, as customers reacted in a positive way to the changes made during the brief closure. As mentioned in various media reports, the Chongquing mayor approved of Walmart's actions and the government supports additional development by the company in China. We are now in the process of obtaining the local registrations for the Trust-Mart stores and this is the last principle condition to completing the second closing of our Trust-Mart purchase. 
In the past 12 months, we opened 54 new stores, including 49 Supercenters, and that brings our China store count to 352 stores.
I'll close by covering some initiatives underway to improve the profitability in our emerging markets, including workforce management, logistics and shared services. Workforce management, for example, is our in-store productivity program in areas such as backroom receiving and on the sales floor. This is critical to the rollout of EDLP because we change how our store operates and reduce the volatility of operating cost. In fact, Japan's EDLC workforce management programs have reduced operating costs every year for the past 3 years. The Walmart Japan program is now the model for our other markets.
Our portfolio combines local relevance and global leverage. With our ""powered by Walmart"" tools, the productivity loop, EDLP and EDLC, there is an even broader future for Walmart International. 
And now I turn it over to Brian for the news on Sam's Club. Brian?"

Consistent with the overall club channel, our top line performance this quarter was exceptional. Comp sales, excluding fuel, increased by 5.7%. This is our seventh quarter of sequentially increasing comps. Membership renewals and members joining at the Plus level continue to grow and we leveraged expenses again this quarter. We opened a new club, expanded a club and relocated 3 clubs during the period. This added over 190,000 square feet to our footprint. 
Similar to the first half of the year, our third quarter fuel business was strong. Fuel provides Sam's Club a great first price impression and is clearly a traffic driver for existing and potential members. We continue to pump more gallons of fuel and generate more sales dollars per gallon this year when compared to last year. Fuel prices in this year's third quarter were approximately 34% higher than a year ago and gallons sold were up 11%.
Including fuel, third quarter net sales were $13.3 billion, a 9.5% increase over last year. Gross profit increased by 5%. SG&A expense as a percentage of sales decreased by 62 basis points and operating income increased 6.3% to $390 million for the quarter. Volatility in fuel prices can have a notable impact on our financial results. The remainder of our discussion today, therefore, is focused on our core business and excludes fuel for comparative purposes unless otherwise noted. 
Now let's look at the financial results and our performance for the quarter. Net sales for the third quarter were $11.8 billion, up 6.2% from last year. Comp club sales for the 13-week period increased 5.7% and were strong across all 3 geographic operating divisions, led by the west division. Comp traffic and ticket increased for the 13-week period by 2.3% and 3.4%, respectively. Comp traffic and ticket increased for both Advantage and Business members.
We continue to see members visiting our clubs more frequently. During our Labor Day eValues Savings Celebration event, we had strong sales and solid membership performance. The quality of our comp sales growth in core categories remains very strong. Overall, we believe that inflation impacted our comp club sales by 325 to 375 basis points.
We continue to see mid-single digit inflation in food categories. Despite the inflation, units sold increased year-over-year. We continue to face challenges in tobacco sales, an important category to our convenience store business member. Our tobacco business has been impacted by declining industry consumption and the change in our credit rewards program that went into effect at the beginning of this year. The decline in tobacco comp sales had an impact of approximately 100 basis points on our total comp sales results. We anticipate tobacco being a headwind for the rest of the year.
Our focus on providing the best quality at a great value continues to drive strong performance in the fresh food categories. For the third quarter, we delivered double-digit comps in categories like bakery and bread and high-single digit comps in categories like produce. More and more of our members are skipping the restaurant trip and eating at home. This trend is driving significant sales increases in categories such as a home meal solutions and prepared meats.
Our members expect the best prices on our product they buy every day and rewarded us in the third quarter with increased trips to the club. This led to double-digit comps in freezer/cooler and oil/rice/canned vegetable and fruit categories. Dry grocery and beverage categories delivered high-single digit comps, led by breakfast foods, coffee, and baking, while categories like snacks delivered mid-single digit comps.
Our pet supply business was strong, turning in high-single digit comps. Impacted by deflation, laundry and home care comps were down. And in a tough competitive market, baby care was down.
We remain focused on providing our members with the best quality, brands and value on home apparel and seasonal products. Home and apparel delivered a mid-single digit comp increase for the period. Driven by backyard recreation and family fun, our seasonal area recorded a high-single digit comp for the quarter. We recorded a mid-single digit comp in our apparel areas, led by strong sales in basic and men's, which offset weakness in ladies apparel.
Comps for our health and wellness area were in the low-single digits, led by growth in our pharmacy and optical areas. Pharmacy growth was led by our focused effort on driving script increases and building awareness of the great value and superior service provided by our pharmacist. Our investment in hearing centers continues to pay dividends, as members have responded to this unique service in our clubs. 
Deflation continues to negatively impact technology and entertainment categories, which had a low-single digit comp. Earlier this year, we made a decision to transition our leased wireless centers to an owned model. This change had enabled us to provide a more comprehensive service solution for our members and has driven solid sales performance for this category. Also our exclusive club channel relationship with Apple has expanded our presence in tablets and smartphones and delivered strong sales in these categories. We also had great performance in our battery category and we focused on branded item placement and updated pack sizes and display fixtures. In televisions, we continue to see a challenging deflationary environment, driving high-single digit negative comps for the quarter.
Technology is an important service for our members. Sam's Club just released a dividend update to our smartphone app. You can now purchase items available online or shop your club through click-and-pull directly from your smartphone. Our mobile app and upgraded website allow members the ability to review and shop our online and in-club inventory, build customized shopping lists and renew their membership straight from a smartphone. Also our iPad application is scheduled to be launched just in time for the key holiday season. We believe that these apps will be a tremendous benefit to our members and are very excited about making these channel-leading technology solutions available.
We continue to deliver on our commitment to quality and value, especially with our proprietary brands. These initiatives are important in giving our members choices. Here are a few highlights. 
Since the beginning of the year, we've introduced 3 new brands: Artisan Fresh in the deli and bakery areas; Simply Right in baby and health and beauty aids; and Daily Chef in frozen foods and refrigerated products. These new brands represent over 200 items to date, with plans to add 150 more by the end of Q1 next year. Early sales and member feedback are overwhelmingly positive, with results at or above expectations. Our upcoming holiday, Taste of Sam's event, will feature Artisan Fresh and Daily Chef items.
Membership and other income were down 13 basis points as a percentage of sales when compared to the third quarter last year. This reduction is driven by a decline in rental income. As I mentioned earlier, in prior years, we rented space to a third party for a portion of our wireless business and receive rental income. Now we are running these businesses with Sam's Club associates, and the sales and expenses of the wireless business are included directly in our operating results.
Membership income for the third quarter increased 1.7% versus last year. Remember, for reporting purposes, membership income is recognized over the membership period, rather than when it's collected. Renewals continue to increase at a rate that has exceeded our expectations and outpaced last year's performance, and our penetration of Plus members continues to grow at a healthy pace.
Business sign-up growth was strong during the third quarter, both sequentially and versus last year. Sales attributed to our proprietary credit program have continued at a steady upward path. As we reported in our Q2 earnings communication, members who possess a Sam's Club-branded credit card tend to have higher levels of engagement and loyalty. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate continued positive momentum in membership.
Our gross margin rate decreased by 28 basis points compared to the third quarter last year, while gross profit dollars increased 4%. The highly competitive retail environment, as well as cost inflation in several categories, impacted our gross margin performance. I continue to be pleased with how our clubs are managing expenses this year. Driven by strong wage cost control, we reduced third quarter expenses as a percentage of sales by 31 basis points. You may remember that in last year's call, we discussed the impact of higher interchange fees related to the Sam's reward credit program. I'm happy to say that even when with this expense is excluded from last year's comparison, we leveraged expenses by 13 basis points.
These expense control results demonstrate how we're driving operational efficiencies. For the quarter, sales per labor hour increased 2.1%. However, units per labor hour decreased 1.5%, impacted by additional associates running our now-owned wireless business. 
Looking at the bottom line, our third quarter operating income increased to $378 million, a 3.3% increase over the third quarter last year.
At the end of the third quarter, inventory, including fuel inventory, was up 1% compared to last year. Overall, we are pleased with the inventory levels in our clubs and distribution centers. 
Looking ahead, we're ready for the upcoming holiday season. Our club associates are energized. We have many new and exciting items across the club, from fresh to gifts. Going into the fourth quarter, our sales momentum remains strong and we expect comp club sales without fuel for the 13-week period from October 29, 2011, through January 27, 2012, to increase 4% to 6%. Last year, Sam's comp club sales, excluding fuel, increased 2.7% for the comparable 13-week period.
Now, I will turn the program over to Charles for a wrap up and guidance. Charles?"

As Mike said, our business is stronger today than it was a year ago. We continue to be encouraged by the ongoing sales momentum at Sam's and by the Wal-Mart U.S. improvement in comps during the last 4 months. We still have a lot of work to do to increase traffic in many of our international markets, but we are confident in the plans that the country management teams have in place. We recognize that the global economy is still weak and consumers continue to behave conservatively.
Looking back over the last 5 years, comp store sales were a relatively small contributor to our overall growth. It's important that comp sales growth is a priority for our company going forward. Investing in new stores is also important. Remember, these are future comp sales and profit generators, which in turn, add to future returns for shareholders.
One of the most important keys to growing our sales is to have the lowest possible price. Keeping our expenses low will allow us to invest in prices going forward. I'm proud of the progress that we're making in expense leverage. At the end of this fiscal year, we will have levered SG&A expenses for 2 consecutive years. Throughout the company, we continue to be focused on improving processes and productivity, eliminating waste and reducing SG&A expenses.
Not only will leveraging expenses allow us to invest in prices, but it will help improve returns in our emerging markets like Brazil and China. Emerging markets provide great opportunities for Walmart to serve customers with assortment and prices they have never had access to before. These markets will also provide some great returns down the road for our company.
At our meeting for the investment community last month, I outlined our goal to reduce SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales by more than 100 basis points over the next 5 years. That goal may be affected with the start of our new fiscal year on February 1, but we are well on our way to having the right strategies and plans in place to reach it.
Our earnings performance continues to translate into strong free cash flow, and I would expect that to continue in the future. Cash flow is the foundation of a company's balance sheet, and Walmart's balance sheet remains strong. That is a real advantage in today's economic environment. We continue to maintain access to extensive short- and long-term funding sources at historically low rates.
Now let's move on to guidance. Based on our view of the business and the global economy, we expect fourth quarter fiscal 2012 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.42 and $1.48. Last year, we reported fourth quarter earnings per share of $1.41, which included $0.07 per share of tax benefit primarily due to the repatriation of certain non-U.S. earnings that increased U.S. foreign tax credits.
Our full year earnings per share guidance is now between $4.45 and $4.51. All guidance estimates assumed that currency exchange rates remain at current levels. This compares to last year's results of $4.18, or an underlying $4.07 due to the $0.11 of tax benefits.
Thank you for listening today. We really appreciate your continued interest in Walmart. We hope you all have a great holiday."
