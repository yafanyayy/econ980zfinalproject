Overall, w",1114,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2011 results call. As Chris said, I'd like to review our business and operating results, and then Chris will cover a few additional details of our performance for the quarter. 
Overall, we were really quite pleased with our start for fiscal 2011. The economic environment remains somewhat uncertain, but the stability and signs of improvement we saw emerging late in 2010 had continued into our first fiscal quarter. Our efforts in recent quarters on driving operating efficiencies and more effectively managing our cost structure, together with benefits we're seeing from our sales new sales wins over the past 12 months, have helped us get off to a solid start for the year.
While we remain cautious in our expectations for future economic growth and are not yet seeing signs of material improvement and employment levels, our ballast portfolio has and should continue to provide. 
So now let me turn to our consolidated results for the quarter. We achieved sales of $3.3 billion, up 4% from the prior year quarter on both an as-reported and organic growth basis. Operating income, which is adjusted to exclude the items Chris described earlier, increased 10% to $205 million. The impact of currency translation was minimal in the quarter. 
In our North American Food and Support Services segment, first quarter sales were up 4% also on a reported and organic basis to $2.3 billion, led primary higher education, K-12 and our business and industry group.
Our business and industry sector had sales increase at a mid-single-digit rate, primarily from a solid base business growth in both food and facility services. During the first quarter, we did see a continuation of improved discretionary spending on the part of our corporate clients that started in late fiscal 2010, while employee population levels in most of our accounts remained relatively flat. While this transaction will a positive, we would likely need to have increasing employee populations withing our client locations another to generate sustain improvement in organic sales in the sector.
The education sector had low double-digit growth led by strong base business growth in the Higher Education, Food and Facilities business and excellent new business growth in K-12 Food as a result of strong new sales year for the business in fiscal 2010.
In the healthcare sector, sales grew in the low single digits, primarily as a result of solid base and new business growth in our Clinical Technology Services business. Our sports and entertainment sector had a sales decline at a high single-digit rate, primarily due to the impact of prior year lost business and as well as significantly fewer Major League baseball play off games this year versus last year. Across our portfolio of stadiums and arenas, we have, in general, seemed somewhat improve levels of attendance and per capita spending in comparison to the prior year, although the results are, as always, further affected by individual team performance.
Adjusted operating income in the North American Food and Support Services segment increased 14% to $156 million, with higher education and healthcare delivering strong profit growth in the quarter. Results for the quarter include other income recognized related to a compensation agreement signed with the National Park Service, under which they agreed to pay down a portion of our investment in one of our concession contracts. And this other income contributed approximately six percentage points of the segment's growth for the quarter.
As of this other income, profit and margin performance were still very solid in the quarter, reflecting the improve levels organic sales growth, the strength of our Higher Education business, which has particular prominence in our first fiscal quarter, as well as our efforts to continue to efficiently manage our cost structure. 
Now turning to our International Food and Support Services segment. First quarter sales of $672 million were up 6% on both a reported and organic basis. Strong sales growth in many of our countries, particularly Germany and in South America, more than offset negative organic growth in the U.K. and Ireland. We also saw especially strong sales growth in China, which benefited from our operations at the Asian games during the quarter.
First quarter adjusted operating income was $15.4 million compared to $24.4 million in the prior year, with Germany and Japan delivering solid profit performance in the quarter. 
Now included in the results for the quarter was approximately $7 million of expenses related to efficiency and cost-reduction initiatives, including severance charges taken across several of our country operations. The comparison to the prior year is also negatively affected by, as we mentioned last year, the continuing challenging operating environment in the U.K., as well as approximately $2.6 million in VAT income that was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2010.
In our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, first quarter sales of $384 million were up 1% from a year ago, primarily driven by improved sales performance at Galls. The segment's overall organic sales growth was comparable to the reported increase. 
The Uniform business which, as you know, is sensitive to employment levels, and while we are continuing to see headcount stability among our clients, we ultimately need to see growth in employment amount our clients for this segment to begin to generate materially improved levels of sales performance. Therefore, our sales outlook for the segment will remain cautious until we see signs of meaningful and sustained employment growth.
In the meantime, our team is focused to continue to drive efficiencies throughout the business and aggressively manage our cost structure while delivering quality service to our clients and customers. Price competition remains difficult but we will continue to be disciplined as we sign new business and seek to retain profitable business.
Uniform segment adjusted operating income was $42 million, up 30% from $32.4 million in the year-ago quarter. About half of the year-over-year profit increase was due to a reduction in insurance reserves due to favorable claims experience resulting from our strong safety programs and improving safety performance. Adjusting for this item, profit results were still strong, reflecting the full realization of operating efficiencies from the integration of our Direct Marketing business, which we completed last year, our continued focus and driving cost efficiencies across the Rental operations and improved profit performance at Galls.
Corporate expenses, adjusted to exclude the items that Chris described earlier, were $8.2 million in the quarter compared to $7.1 million in the year-ago quarter, primarily as a result of expenses associated with cost reduction and efficiency initiatives which will benefit future quarters.
So at this point, let me turn it back over to Chris from some additional details."

I'd like to make a few comments on our capital structure and cash flow. We are pleased that for the trailing 12 months ending December 31, 2010, our adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.051 billion, up from $1.036 billion at October 1, 2010. In",451,"Thanks, Fred. I'd like to make a few comments on our capital structure and cash flow. 
We are pleased that for the trailing 12 months ending December 31, 2010, our adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.051 billion, up from $1.036 billion at October 1, 2010. Interest and other financing costs were $109.1 million for the first quarter, level with the year-ago quarter's expense. 
Approximately 75% of our debt portfolio is at fixed interest rates, and our overall weighted average cost of debt at quarter end was approximately 6.5%. Total reported debt at the end of the quarter was $5.779 billion. Our secured debt, as defined in our credit agreement, totaled $3.47 billion, including a term loan balance of $3.296 billion and a revolver balance of $129 million. Our $250 million accounts receivable securitization facility was also fully utilized as of quarter end. 
Beginning in fiscal 2011, new accounting guidance changes the way we report our accounts receivable facility on a prospective basis. The funding under this facility is now accounted for as a secured borrowing and not a sale of receivables and, as such, is reflected in our total reported debt balance of $5.779 billion. The funding has always been included as part of our secured and total debt calculations under our senior secured credit agreement and as described in prior quarterly calls and various analyst conference presentations, so there's no change to any of these calculations. While this change is cash flow-neutral, it is reflected on the cash flow statement as a use of cash and operating activities and a source of cash and financing activities during fiscal 2011.
We continue to enjoy a strong liquidity position. And as of quarter end, we had approximately $450 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. Based on our growth and trailing EBITDA and lowered debt levels compared to the same quarter last year, our secured debt ratio improved to 3.47x as of December 31, compared to 3.70x at the end of the year-ago quarter.
Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $54 million compared to $58 million in the prior year quarter, as we continue to maintain a disciplined approach as we evaluate and invest in new opportunities. For the full year, we would expect that net capital expenditures would be somewhat higher than prior year calls. 
And finally, consistent with historical patterns, working capital was a use of cash for us during the first quarter and was in line with our expectations. As we have previously mentioned, for the full year of fiscal 2011, we anticipate that working capital will be a more typical use of cash for us overall. 
Now let me turn the call back to Fred."

Considering there's still uncertain economic environment, we are pleased with our solid overall performance during the first quarter and with our start to fiscal 2011. Both our top and bottom line performance has improved sequentially as we continue to see stability in our cyclical businesses and more typically solid performance in our other sectors. While we remain cautious given the still unclear outlook from implement growth, we are benefiting from a portfolio of sectors geographies and clients that provide us with a good balance overall. We also have and will maintain a heightened focus on managing our costs and cash flow as we move through 2011.
Having come to a very challenging environment in recent years, we continue to be quite excited about the longer-term growth opportunities we see as we look across our portfolio of businesses and sectors. In addition, we also have a more efficient cost structure now, and we are continuing to look for ways to further improve the efficiency and the effectiveness of our operations.

Let me answer that business separately, with respect to the Facilities business and the Uniform business. In the Food and Facilities business, we actually have a fair amount of flexibility in the menus that we offer and how we move items on the menu from one week to the next. And we can do that in response to differential increases in various food items. The overall food cost inflation that we're seeing right now year-over-year is in the range of about 3%. So while it's clearly up from where it was a while ago, it's still very manageable. And increasingly, in the Food business, greater and greater percentage of our sales are really direct to the consumer, to the user, so we typically have pricing flexibility there. And it doesn't involve negotiation with client. With respect to the Uniform business, we are seeing increases in raw material prices, fabric prices, particular cotton. And I think everybody has read about that. It's been written about with respect to the retail clothing industry. And there again, just as we did with fuel cost a few years ago, which are also up somewhat year-over-year by the way, it's something that's generally known throughout the markets in which we compete. We've developed a pretty specific pricing increase strategies so that we can recapture a good portion, if not all of those, cost increases. And we go and talk to our customers. They certainly understand what we're talking about and don't disagree with the issue. So we think that both of those are things that we can navigate or hopeful that we can."

Because that overall function increasingly is led by a central operation in terms of menu engineering and planning. And of course, we've always had a centralized supply chain function. So I'd say those tools are just as effective as they were before. And of course before, we were seeing at one point I think it peaked out inflation rates were probably high single digits. Year-over-year. So as I mentioned earlier, our inflation is up clearly over the last three to six months, but it's way short of where it was a few years ago, as you point out."

And that fruit for us in fiscal '10. We has a very strong sales year and that certainly contributed to the growth we saw in Q1. K-12, it was a very nice quarter.

As we discuss the results for the quarter, you may want to refer to the Form 10-Q we filed earlier today, which contains our first quarter results for fiscal 2011. This Form 10-Q can be found on our website at www.aramark.com. In today's discussions of results, we mentioned certain non-GAAP financial measures. The Form 10-Q, as well as schedules we posted to our website earlier today, include reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures as required by SEC rules.
Our discussion of operating income during today's call will, in each instance, exclude the incremental intangibles amortization and property and equipment depreciation expense, resulting from the going-private transaction and the impact of stock option expense. These items are detailed in the schedules posted to our website before the call.
Various remarks that we may make in this call relating to matters that are not historical facts, including remarks about future expectations, anticipation, beliefs, estimates, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in the Risk Factors, MD&A and other sections of our Form 10-K and the Form 10-Q filed earlier today.

As Chris said, I'd like to review our business and operating results, and then Chris will cover a few additional details of our performance for the quarter. 
Overall, we were really quite pleased with our start for fiscal 2011. The economic environment remains somewhat uncertain, but the stability and signs of improvement we saw emerging late in 2010 had continued into our first fiscal quarter. Our efforts in recent quarters on driving operating efficiencies and more effectively managing our cost structure, together with benefits we're seeing from our new sales wins over the past 12 months, have helped us get off to a solid start for the year. While we remain cautious in our expectations for future economic growth and are not yet seeing signs of material improvement in employment levels, our balanced portfolio has and should continue to provide additional [indiscernible]. 
So now let me turn to our consolidated results for the quarter. We achieved sales of $3.3 billion, up 4% from the prior-year quarter on both in as-reported and organic growth basis. Operating income, which is adjusted to exclude the items Chris described earlier, increased 10% to $205 million. The impact of currency translation was minimal in the quarter. In our North American Food and Support Services segment, first quarter sales were up 4% also on a reported and organic basis to $2.3 billion, led primarily by Higher Education, K-12 and our Business and Industry group.
Our Business and Industry sector had sales increase at a mid-single digit rate, primarily from a solid base business growth in both food and facility services. During the first quarter, we did see a continuation of improved discretionary spending on the part of our corporate clients that started in late fiscal 2010, while employee population levels in most of our accounts remain relatively flat. While these trends are generally positive, we will likely need to have increasing employee populations within our client locations in order to generate sustained improvements on organic sales in the sector. The Education sector had low double digit growth, led by strong base business growth in the Higher Education, Food and Facilities business and excellent new business growth in K-12 food as a result of strong new sales year for the business in fiscal 2010.
In the Healthcare sector, sales grew in the low single digits, primarily as a result of solid base and new business growth in our Clinical Technology Services business. Our Sports and Entertainment sector had a sales decline at a high single digit rate, primarily due to the impact of prior year lost business and as well as significantly fewer Major League Baseball playoff games this year versus last year. Across our portfolio of stadiums and arenas, we have, in general, seemed somewhat improved levels of attendance and per capita spending in comparison to the prior year, although the results are, as always, further affected by individual team performance.
Adjusted operating income in the North American Food and Support Services segment increased 14% to $156 million, with higher Education and Healthcare delivering strong profit growth in the quarter. Results for the quarter include other income recognized related to a compensation agreement signed with the National Park Service, under which they agreed to pay down a portion of our investment in one of our concession contracts. And this other income contributed approximately six percentage points of the segment's growth for the quarter. As of this other income, profit and margin performance were still very solid in the quarter, reflecting the improved levels of organic sales growth, the strength of our Higher Education business, which has particular prominence in our first fiscal quarter, as well as our efforts to continue to efficiently manage our cost structure. 
Now turning to our International Food and Support Services segment. First quarter sales of $672 million were up 6% on both a reported and organic basis. Strong sales growth in many of our countries, particularly Germany and in South America, more than offset negative organic growth in the U.K. and Ireland. We also saw especially strong sales growth in China, which benefited from our operations at the Asian Games during the quarter. First quarter adjusted operating income was $15.4 million compared to $24.4 million in the prior year, with Germany and Japan delivering solid profit performance in the quarter. 
Now included in the results for the quarter was approximately $7 million of expenses related to efficiency and cost-reduction initiatives, including severance charges taken across several of our country operations. The comparison to the prior year is also negatively affected by, as we mentioned last year, the continuing challenging operating environment in the U.K., as well as approximately $2.6 million in VAT income that was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2010.
In our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, first quarter sales of $384 million were up 1% from a year ago, primarily driven by improved sales performance at Galls. The segment's overall organic sales growth was comparable to the reported increase. The Uniform business which, as you know, is sensitive to employment levels, and while we are continuing to see headcount stability among our clients, we ultimately need to see growth in employment among our clients for this segment to begin to generate materially improved levels of sales performance. Therefore, our sales outlook for this segment will remain cautious until we see signs of meaningful and sustained employment growth.
In the meantime, our team is focused to continue to drive efficiencies throughout the business and aggressively manage our cost structure while delivering quality service to our clients and customers. Price competition remains difficult, but we will continue to be disciplined as we sign new business and seek to retain profitable business.
Uniform segment adjusted operating income was $42 million, up 30% from $32.4 million in the year-ago quarter. About half of the year-over-year profit increase was due to a reduction in insurance reserves due to favorable claims experienced, resulting from our strong safety programs and improving safety performance. Adjusting for this item, profit results were still strong, reflecting the full realization of operating efficiencies from the integration of our Direct Marketing business, which we completed last year, our continued focus and driving cost efficiencies across the rental operations and improved profit performance at Galls.
Corporate expenses, adjusted to exclude the items that Chris described earlier, were $8.2 million in the quarter compared to $7.1 million in the year-ago quarter, primarily as a result of expenses associated with cost reduction and efficiency initiatives, which will benefit future quarters.
So at this point, let me turn it back over to Chris from some additional details."

I'd like to make a few comments on our capital structure and cash flow. We are pleased that for the trailing 12 months ending December 31, 2010, our adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.051 billion, up from $1.036 billion at October 1, 2010. Inte",450,"Thanks, Fred. I'd like to make a few comments on our capital structure and cash flow. We are pleased that for the trailing 12 months ending December 31, 2010, our adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.051 billion, up from $1.036 billion at October 1, 2010. Interest and other financing costs were $109.1 million for the first quarter level with the year-ago quarter's expense. 
Approximately 75% of our debt portfolio is at fixed interest rates, and our overall weighted average cost of debt at quarter end was approximately 6.5%. Total reported debt at the end of the quarter was $5.779 billion. Our secured debt, as defined in our credit agreement, totaled $3.47 billion, including a term loan balance of $3.296 billion and a revolver balance of $129 million. Our $250 million accounts receivable securitization facility was also fully utilized as of quarter end. 
Beginning in fiscal 2011, new accounting guidance changed the way we record our accounts receivable facility on a prospective basis. The funding under this facility is now accounted for as a secured borrowing and not a sale of receivables and, as such, is reflected in our total reported debt balance of $5.779 billion. The funding has always been included as part of our secured and total debt calculations under our senior secured credit agreement and as described in prior quarterly calls and various analyst conference presentations, so there's no change to any of these calculations. While this change is cash flow neutral, it is reflected on the cash flow statement as a use of cash in operating activities and a source of cash in financing activities during fiscal 2011.
We continue to enjoy a strong liquidity position. And as of quarter end, we had approximately $450 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. Based on our growth and trailing EBITDA and lowered debt levels compared to the same quarter last year, our secured debt ratio improved to 3.47x as of December 31 compared to 3.70x at the end of the year-ago quarter.
Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $54 million compared to $58 million in the prior-year quarter, as we continue to maintain a disciplined approach as we evaluate and invest in new opportunities. For the full year, we would expect that net capital expenditures would be somewhat higher than prior-year levels. 
And finally, consistent with historical patterns, working capital was a use of cash for us during the first quarter and was in line with our expectations. As we have previously mentioned, for the full year of fiscal 2011, we anticipate that working capital will be a more typical use of cash for us overall. 
Now let me turn the call back to Fred."

Considering the still uncertain economic environment, we are pleased with our solid overall performance during the first quarter and with our start to fiscal 2011. Both our top and bottom line performance has improved sequentially as we continue to see stability in our cyclical businesses and more typically solid performance in our other sectors. While we remain cautious given the still unclear outlook for employment growth, we are benefiting from a portfolio of sectors, geographies and clients that provides us with a good balance overall. We also have and will maintain a heightened focus on managing our cost and cash flow as we move through 2011.
Having come to a very challenging environment in recent years, we continue to be quite excited about the longer-term growth opportunities we see as we look across our portfolio of businesses and sectors. In addition, we also have a more efficient cost structure now, and we are continuing to look for ways to further improve the efficiency and the effectiveness of our operations. 
So thank you, again, for your time this afternoon and for your continued support of ARAMARK. And at this point, we'd be happy to take your questions."

Let me answer that business separately, with respect to the Food and Facilities business and the Uniform business. In the Food and Facilities business, we actually have a fair amount of flexibility in the menus that we offer and how we move items on the menu from one week to the next, and we can do that in response to differential increases in various food items. The overall food cost inflation that we're seeing right now year-over-year is in the range of about 3%. So while it's clearly up from where it was a while ago, it's still very manageable. And increasingly, in the Food business, greater and greater percentage of our sales are really direct to the consumer, to the user, so we typically have pricing flexibility there and it doesn't involve negotiation with the client. With respect to the Uniform business, we are seeing increases in raw material prices, fabric prices, particularly cotton. And I think everybody has read about that. It's been written about with respect to the retail clothing industry. And there again, just as we did with fuel cost a few years ago, which are also up somewhat year-over-year by the way, I mean something that's generally known throughout the markets in which we compete. And we've developed a pretty specific pricing increase strategies so that we can recapture a good portion, if not all of those, cost increases and we go and talk to our customers. They certainly understand what we're talking about and don't disagree with the issue. So we think that both of those are things that we can navigate or we're hopeful that we can."

And of course before, we were saying at one point I think it peaked out inflation rates were probably high single digits year-over-year. So as I mentioned earlier, our inflation is up clearly over the last three to six months, but it's way short of where it was a few years ago, as you point out."

Again, we've had terrific performance really over the long period of time in the Higher Ed business, growing, as we talked a lot about, just growing in the base within the existing accounts by capturing more and more of the spend from that on-campus population. We've continued to do that. I think over the last 12 or 18 months, we've had a renewed focus and an increased investment in the new sales resources within the business and that paid fruit for us in fiscal '10. We had a very strong sales year and that's certainly contributed to the growth we saw in Q1. K-12, it was a very nice quarter. We've talked about K-12 over the last couple of years as having some retention challenges. It had a strong retention year in 2010 and a very strong new sales year, and so it's very nice to see it contributing to the education sector's growth.

As we discuss the results for the quarter, you may want to refer to the Form 10-Q we filed earlier today, which contains our first quarter results for fiscal 2011. This Form 10-Q can be found on our website at www.aramark.com. In today's discussions of results, we mentioned certain non-GAAP financial measures. The Form 10-Q, as well as schedules we posted to our website earlier today, include reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures as required by SEC rules. 
Our discussion of operating income during today's call will, in each instance, exclude the incremental intangibles amortization and property and equipment depreciation expense, resulting from the going-private transaction and the impact of stock option expense. These items are detailed in the schedules posted to our website before the call.
Various remarks that we may make in this call relating to matters that are not historical facts, including remarks about future expectations, anticipation, beliefs, estimates, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in the Risk Factors, MD&A and other sections of our Form 10-K and the Form 10-Q filed earlier today.

As Chris said, I'd like to review our business and operating results, and then Chris will cover a few additional details on our performance for the quarter. 
Overall, we were really quite pleased with our start for fiscal 2011. The economic environment remains somewhat uncertain, but the stability and signs of improvement we saw emerging late in 2010 had continued into our first fiscal quarter. Our efforts in recent quarters on driving operating efficiencies and more effectively managing our cost structure, together with benefits we're seeing from our new sales wins over the past 12 months, have helped us get off to a solid start for the year. While we remain cautious in our expectations for future economic growth and are not yet seeing signs of material improvement in employment levels, our balanced portfolio has and should continue to provide a strong foundation [ph] (19:05). 
So now let me turn to our consolidated results for the quarter. We achieved sales of $3.3 billion, up 4% from the prior-year quarter on both an as-reported and organic growth basis. Operating income, which is adjusted to exclude the items Chris described earlier, increased 10% to $205 million. The impact of currency translation was minimal in the quarter. In our North American Food and Support Services segment, first quarter sales were up 4% also on a reported and organic basis to $2.3 billion, led primarily by Higher Education, K-12 and our Business and Industry group.
Our Business and Industry sector had sales increase at a mid-single digit rate, primarily from a solid base business growth in both food and facility services. During the first quarter, we did see a continuation of improved discretionary spending on the part of our corporate clients that started in late fiscal 2010, while employee population levels in most of our accounts remain relatively flat. While these trends are generally positive, we will likely need to have increasing employee populations within our client locations in order to generate sustained improvements on organic sales in the sector. The Education sector had low double digit growth, led by strong base business growth in the Higher Education, Food and Facilities business and excellent new business growth in K-12 food as a result of a strong new sales year for the business in fiscal 2010.
In the Healthcare sector, sales grew in the low single digits, primarily as a result of solid base and new business growth in our Clinical Technology Services business. Our Sports and Entertainment sector had a sales decline at a high single digit rate, primarily due to the impact of prior year lost business and as well as significantly fewer Major League Baseball playoff games this year versus last year. Across our portfolio of stadiums and arenas, we have, in general, seen somewhat improved levels of attendance and per capita spending in comparison to the prior year, although the results are, as always, further affected by individual team performance.
Adjusted operating income in the North American Food and Support Services segment increased 14% to $156 million, with higher Education and Healthcare delivering strong profit growth in the quarter. Results for the quarter include other income recognized related to a compensation agreement signed with the National Park Service, under which they agreed to pay down a portion of our investment in one of our concession contracts. And this other income contributed approximately six percentage points of the segment's growth for the quarter. Absent this other income, profit and margin performance were still very solid in the quarter, reflecting the improved levels of organic sales growth, the strength of our Higher Education business, which has particular prominence in our first fiscal quarter, as well as our efforts to continue to efficiently manage our cost structure. 
Now turning to our International Food and Support Services segment. First quarter sales of $672 million were up 6% on both a reported and organic basis. Strong sales growth in many of our countries, particularly Germany and in South America, more than offset negative organic growth in the U.K. and Ireland. We also saw especially strong sales growth in China, which benefited from our operations at the Asian Games during the quarter. First quarter adjusted operating income was $15.4 million compared to $24.4 million in the prior year, with Germany and Japan delivering solid profit performance in the quarter. 
Now included in the results for the quarter was approximately $7 million of expenses related to efficiency and cost-reduction initiatives, including severance charges taken across several of our country operations. The comparison to the prior year is also negatively affected by, as we mentioned last year, the continuing challenging operating environment in the U.K., as well as approximately $2.6 million in VAT income that was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2010.
In our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, first quarter sales of $384 million were up 1% from a year ago, primarily driven by improved sales performance at Galls. The segment's overall organic sales growth was comparable to the reported increase. The Uniform business, which, as you know, is sensitive to employment levels, and while we are continuing to see headcount stability among our clients, we ultimately need to see growth in employment among our clients for this segment to begin to generate materially improved levels of sales performance. Therefore, our sales outlook for this segment will remain cautious until we see signs of meaningful and sustained employment growth.
In the meantime, our team is focused to continue to drive efficiencies throughout the business and aggressively manage our cost structure while delivering quality service to our clients and customers. Price competition remains difficult, but we will continue to be disciplined as we sign new business and seek to retain profitable business.
Uniform segment adjusted operating income was $42 million, up 30% from $32.4 million in the year-ago quarter. About half of the year-over-year profit increase was due to a reduction in insurance reserves due to favorable claims experience, resulting from our strong safety programs and improving safety performance. Adjusting for this item, profit results were still strong, reflecting the full realization of operating efficiencies from the integration of our Direct Marketing business, which we completed last year, a continued focus on driving cost efficiencies across the rental operations and improved profit performance at Galls.
Corporate expenses, adjusted to exclude the items that Chris described earlier, were $8.2 million in the quarter compared to $7.1 million in the year-ago quarter, primarily as a result of expenses associated with cost reduction and efficiency initiatives, which will benefit future quarters.
So at this point, let me turn it back over to Chris from some additional details."

I'd like to make a few comments on our capital structure and cash flow. We are pleased that for the trailing 12 months ending December 31, 2010, our adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.051 billion, up from $1.036 billion at October 1, 2010. Inte",450,"Thanks, Fred. I'd like to make a few comments on our capital structure and cash flow. We are pleased that for the trailing 12 months ending December 31, 2010, our adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.051 billion, up from $1.036 billion at October 1, 2010. Interest and other financing costs were $109.1 million for the first quarter, level with the year-ago quarter's expense. 
Approximately 75% of our debt portfolio is at fixed interest rates, and our overall weighted average cost of debt at quarter end was approximately 6.5%. Total reported debt at the end of the quarter was $5.779 billion. Our secured debt, as defined in our credit agreement, totaled $3.47 billion, including a term loan balance of $3.296 billion and a revolver balance of $129 million. Our $250 million accounts receivable securitization facility was also fully utilized as of quarter end. 
Beginning in fiscal 2011, new accounting guidance changed the way we record our accounts receivable facility on a prospective basis. The funding under this facility is now accounted for as a secured borrowing and not a sale of receivables and, as such, is reflected in our total reported debt balance of $5.779 billion. The funding has always been included as part of our secured and total debt calculations under our senior secured credit agreement and as described in prior quarterly calls and various analyst conference presentations, so there's no change to any of these calculations. While this change is cash flow neutral, it is reflected on the cash flow statement as a use of cash in operating activities and a source of cash in financing activities during fiscal 2011.
We continue to enjoy a strong liquidity position. And as of quarter end, we had approximately $450 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. Based on our growth and trailing EBITDA and lower debt levels compared to the same quarter last year, our secured debt ratio improved to 3.47x as of December 31 compared to 3.70x at the end of the year-ago quarter.
Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $54 million compared to $58 million in the prior-year quarter, as we continue to maintain a disciplined approach as we evaluate and invest in new opportunities. For the full year, we would expect that net capital expenditures would be somewhat higher than prior-year levels. 
And finally, consistent with historical patterns, working capital was a use of cash for us during the first quarter and was in line with our expectations. As we have previously mentioned, for the full year of fiscal 2011, we anticipate that working capital will be a more typical use of cash for us overall. 
Now let me turn the call back to Fred."

Considering the still uncertain economic environment, we are pleased with our solid overall performance during the first quarter and with our start to fiscal 2011. Both our top and bottom line performance has improved sequentially as we continue to see stability in our cyclical businesses and more typically solid performance in our other sectors. While we remain cautious given the still unclear outlook for employment growth, we are benefiting from a portfolio of sectors, geographies and clients that provides us with a good balance overall. We also have and will maintain a heightened focus on managing our cost and cash flow as we move through 2011.
Having come to a very challenging environment in recent years, we continue to be quite excited about the longer-term growth opportunities we see as we look across our portfolio of businesses and sectors. In addition, we also have a more efficient cost structure now, and we are continuing to look for ways to further improve the efficiency and the effectiveness of our operations. 
So thank you, again, for your time this afternoon and for your continued support of ARAMARK. And at this point, we'd be happy to take your questions."

Let me answer that business separately with respect to the Food and Facilities business and the Uniform business. In the Food and Facilities business, we actually have a fair amount of flexibility in the menus that we offer and how we move items on the menu from one week to the next, and we can do that in response to differential increases in various food items. The overall food cost inflation that we're seeing right now year-over-year is in the range of about 3%. So while it's clearly up from where it was a while ago, it's still very manageable. And increasingly, in the Food business, a greater and greater percentage of our sales are really direct to the consumer, to the user, so we typically have pricing flexibility there, and it doesn't involve negotiation with the client. With respect to the Uniform business, we are seeing increases in raw material prices, fabric prices, particularly cotton. And I think everybody has read about that. It's been written about with respect to the retail clothing industry. And there again, just as we did with fuel cost a few years ago, which are also up somewhat year-over-year by the way, I mean it’s something that's generally known throughout the markets in which we compete. And we've developed pretty specific pricing increase strategies so that we can recapture a good portion, if not all, of those cost increases and we go and talk to our customers. They certainly understand what we're talking about and don't disagree with the issue. So we think that both of those are things that we can navigate or we're hopeful that we can."

So I'd say those tools are just as effective as they were before. And of course before, we were saying at one point I think it peaked out. Inflation rates were probably high single digits year-over-year. So as I mentioned earlier, our inflation is up clearly over the last three to six months, but it's way short of where it was a few years ago, as you point out."

Again, we've had terrific performance really over a long period of time in the Higher Ed business, growing, as we talked a lot about, just growing the base within the existing accounts by capturing more and more of the spend from that on-campus population. We've continued to do that. I think over the last 12 or 18 months, we've had a renewed focus and an increased investment in the new sales resources within the business, and that paid fruit for us in fiscal '10. We had a very strong sales year, and that's certainly contributed to the growth we saw in Q1. K-12, it was a very nice quarter. We've talked about K-12 over the last couple of years as having some retention challenges. It had a strong retention year in 2010 and a very strong new sales year, and so it's very nice to see it contributing to the education sector's growth.

As in prior quarters, I'd like to review our business and operating performance first. And then have Chris cover a few additional details on our overall performance. 
The economic climate continue to slowly improve in our second fiscal quarter and we're pleased that our results reflect this strength. Our sales growth so far this year reflects an improving base business growth environment as well as the benefits of our solid new sales wins over the past year. And our many efforts over the past 24 months to improve our operational efficiencies and effectively manage our cost structure are allowing us to leverage the sales growth we are generating into quite solid earnings performance. 
Our first half client retention rates were consistent with recent trends and our expectations and our pipeline of new business opportunities remain robust. Now turning to our overall results for the second quarter. We reported sales of $3.3 billion, up 5% from the prior year quarter. Organic sales growth, which as you know excludes the impact of currency translation and acquisitions and divestitures was up 4% in the quarter. 
Adjusted operating income of $165 million was up 15% from the prior year level with currency contributing approximately two percentage points of this growth. For the first half of fiscal 2011, sales were $6.6 billion, up 5% over the prior year period and up 4% on an organic growth basis. Our adjusted operating income of $370 million was up 12% versus prior year about with currency contributions of about one percentage point.
Now turning to our North American Food and Support Services segment, second quarter reported sales were up 5% to $2.2 billion with positive growth reported in most sectors led by Healthcare and our Education business. Organic sales growth for the segment was 4% in the quarter. For the first half, reported and organic sales were up 4% to $4.5 billion with the overall sales performance again being led by solid growth in Healthcare and Education. 
So now let's turn to the sectors within the North American business. Our Business and Industry sector had a low single-digit sales increase for the quarter and for the half, reflecting growth in both our Café and Catering sales. The improvement in discretionary spending we saw earlier in the year has continued and we are seeing some pockets of population growth in certain client sectors.
The Education sector had a high single-digit sales growth rate for the second quarter and the first half. Growth in Higher Education for both periods was led by a combination of base business growth driven in part by increased demand for meal plans and the impact of new business we signed last year. 
K-12 sales growth continues to reflect the stronger new sales wins from fiscal 2010, as well as solid base business growth. In our Healthcare sector, sales grew in the mid-single digits for the quarter and in the low single digits for the first half. Growth in the sector was primarily led by a combination of base business growth across the sector and new business growth particularly in our Clinical Technology Services. 
Our Sports and Entertainment sector had low single-digit sales decline in the quarter and a mid-single digit sales decline for the first half. The sales decline in the quarter reflected in part the positive impact from the Winter Olympics in last year's second quarter and a negative impact of this year due to exited venues. In part offset by solid base business growth in the NHL and in convention centers. 
In general, across our stadium and arena operations during the first half, we have seen improved per capita spending and stable attendance levels in comparison to prior year. These trends are also generally consistent with what we are seeing so far with Major League Baseball. Of course, as always, individual team performance further affects venue specific results. Adjusted operating income in the North American Food and Support Services segment was up 9% in the quarter to $117 million, led by solid year-over-year growth in Healthcare and Higher Education. For the first half, segment adjusted operating income grew 12% to $273 million, again led by strong profits performance in Healthcare and Higher Ed.
Turning to the International Food and Support Services segment, second quarter reported sales of $677 million were up 9% from the prior year period of organic growth of about 7%. Organic growth in the quarter was led by solid performance in South America, Germany, Ireland, China and Spain, offset somewhat by an organic sales decline in the U.K. and in Korea. 
For the first half, reported sales were up 7% to $1.3 billion with organic growth of 6% and with solid sales growth in most of our countries and particularly strong performance in South America, Germany, Ireland and China.
Second quarter adjusted operating income was $22.5 million, up from $18.8 million in the prior year's quarter. Results this quarter benefited from a gain on the sale of a small, non-core subsidiary in Chile and the receipt of VAT income in the U.K., partly offset by some severance charges in Chile related to the divestiture and a write down of a goodwill and other intangible assets related to relatively minor operations in India. 
Adjusting for these items and the effect of currency, international income was down slightly for the quarter. For the first half, adjusted operating income was $38 million compared to $43 million in the prior year period.
The lower first half results were primarily driven by expenses recorded in the first quarter which we discussed before, related to efficiency and cost reduction initiatives including severance charges taken across several of our country operations as well as profit declines in the U.K. and Chile. In our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, second quarter sales of $372 million were up 3% from the year-ago quarter on both a reported and organic basis. With our Uniform rental business sales growth in the low single digits and solid growth in our Galls direct sale business. For the first half, segment sales of $756 million were up 2% from the prior year period on both an as reported and organic growth basis. 
The Uniform business, as you know, is quite sensitive to employment levels and while we have seen some modest signs of headcount improvement amongst our clients, we have yet to see strong indications of robust levels of employment growth. While we're working on generating improved a base in new sales growth across all programs, higher selling productivity for our sales reps and higher sales headcount, our team is also continuing to systematically drive efficiencies throughout the operations while delivering high-quality service and reliable service to our clients.
Price competition for new business remains quite challenging but we are working to maintain discipline as we seek to sign new business and retain profitable business. The segment's second quarter adjusted operating income was $33.4 million compared to $25.5 million in the prior year's quarter. As our cost and operating efficiency efforts, including the improved performance of our now integrated Direct Marketing business, are providing significant bottom-line leverage as sales have begun to grow again. 
Income in the quarter also includes $2.6 million resulting from the successful settlement of an eminent domain claim. For the first half, adjusted operating income was $75 million, up strongly from $58 million reported in the same period last year, again reflected the benefit of our cost production and efficiency efforts across the segment. 
A portion of the year-over-year profit increase also reflects, as we mentioned in the first quarter, first quarter reduction in insurance reserves due to very favorable claims experience resulting from the business's very strong safety programs and resulting improved safety performance.
Corporate expenses, excluding the items that Chris mentioned earlier, were $8.2 million in the quarter compared to $8 million in the year-ago quarter. And for the first half, expenses were $16.5 million compared to $15.1 million in the prior year period. So at this point, let me turn it back to Chris for some additional details on the quarter and on the half."

I'd like to make a few comments on our financing capital structure and cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending April 1 increased to $1.079 billion from $1.051 billion at December 31, 2010, and up from $1.036 billion",790,"Thanks, Fred. I'd like to make a few comments on our financing capital structure and cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending April 1 increased to $1.079 billion from $1.051 billion at December 31, 2010, and up from $1.036 billion at October 312010. Interest and other financing costs were $93 million for the second quarter compared to $118 million in the prior year period. 
In the second quarter, we recorded interest income of approximately $14 million related to the settlement of U.K. VAT claims from prior years. Last year second quarter total also included approximately $8 million of expenses related to the credit agreement amendment and term loan extension we completed in March of 2010.
For the first half, interest and other financing costs were $202 million, down from $227 million in the prior year including the impact of interest rate hedges, a significant portion of which mature in March of 2012, approximately 75% of our total debt portfolio is at fixed interest rates and our overall weighted average cost of debt is approximately 6.50%.
Total reported debt at the end of the second quarter was $5.739 billion, down from $5.995 billion at the end of last year's second quarter, when also including utilization of our accounts receivable securitization facility in the year ago total. Our secured debt as defined in our credit agreement totaled $3.666 billion, including a term loan balance of $3.307 billion and a revolver balance of $74 million. Our debt balance at the end of the quarter reflects the impact of the funding of the acquisition of Masterplan in March of 2011, an attractive and strategic addition to our Healthcare Clinical Technology Services portfolio.
The acquisition was funded with a combination of excess cash and revolver borrowings. Our accounts receivable securitization facility had $246 million utilized at quarter-end. We continue to enjoy a strong liquidity position overall and at quarter end, had approximately $510 million of available borrowing capacity under our $600 million revolving credit facility and $89 million on balance sheet cash. 
Based on our trailing adjusted EBITDA, our secured debt ratio improved to 3.33x as of April 1 compared to 3.47x as of December 31, 2010, and 3.70x as of April 2, 2010.
Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $66 million compared to $49 million in the prior year quarter. For the year-to-date, net capital expenditures total $120 million compared to $107 million in the first half of last year. While we anticipate full year net expenditures to be somewhat higher than the prior year level, we continue to maintain a disciplined approach in managing our use of capital. As expected and consistent with our historical patterns, working capital was a use of cash for us during the first half of our fiscal year. However, we are pleased that our year-to-date working capital performance has exceeded our expectations so far this year.
While some reinvestment of working capital is required as certain sectors begin to grow again, we will continue to maintain a sharp focus on working capital management as we move through the balance of fiscal 2011. 
For the year-to-date, we spent a total of $155 million on acquisitions compared to $81 million in the prior year period. This year spending relates primarily to the acquisition of Masterplan, which I just mentioned. We continue to evaluate strategic investment opportunities in certain sectors and geographies but we'll continue to maintain a prudent and disciplined approach in pursuit of these opportunities.
As you know, during April, we successfully completed a $600 million HoldCo Notes financing, which many of you participated in. The funds were used to pay dividend to all of our shareholders, the first we have dividend we have paid since going private in January of 2007. We believe this dividend is not impact our ability to continue to grow and reinvest in our business while still pursuing appropriate strategic opportunities as well. 
After the transaction our leverage ratios remain nicely below the initial levels of the time of our going private transaction and absent further acquisitions over the balance of this fiscal year, we expect our leverage ratios to further improve as we enter our seasonal cash generation period. 
In conjunction with the notes offering, we also extended from January 26, 2013 to January 26, 2015, the maturity of the U.S. dollar-denominated portion of our existing revolving credit facility. As a result, we now enjoy access to a $665 million revolving credit facility through January of 2013, which will then step down to $500 million of capacity through January of 2015.
We'd like to thank you for your support of his recent financing and for your ongoing support of ARAMARK. Now let me turn back it to Fred."

We are pleased with our solid overall of performance during the first half of 2011. We are seeing importantly typically more solid performance than our less cyclical sectors such as Healthcare and Education. 
But are also beginning to see low single-digit sales growth in our more cyclical businesses. As our growth ramps up, we are also seeing the benefit of the significant operating efficiencies that we have generated over the past 24 months. And we should continue to benefit from these as the economy continues to strengthen. 
We're also excited about the number of additional opportunities we have identified to further improve the efficiency and effectiveness across our operations. And we are well into a number of initiatives that we anticipate will deliver additional benefits in the coming quarters in years. We do expect to face increasing but manageable headwinds in the second half of fiscal 2011 as a result of rising gasoline and commodity cost. 
But our teams are and will be focused on aggressively addressing these challenges as we move through the back half of the year. Longer term, we continue to be quite excited about the growth opportunities we see as we look across our portfolio of businesses and sectors. And we are properly focusing our resources and investments to best exploit these opportunities. 
So in conclusion, thank you again for your time this afternoon of for your continued support of ARAMARK. And at this point, we'd be happy to take any questions."

And there've been some we've looked at pretty closely with IBM have concluded that either the value is not there or the price is not the right. And so we've been pretty disciplined. But I believe that we'll continue to look pretty actively at acquisitions as we go forward. And we mentioned and as you mentioned, we've got plenty of horsepower to make the right acquisitions."

Some of which looking at those discrete wins was taking share because those were by and large already outsourced. But we continue to have and see very good base business growth opportunities within our existing accounts. And so when you think about Higher Ed, Q1, which is a big quarter for our Higher Ed business and as you know it delivered 10% organic growth, that was a very nice mix of base and new. And we continue to have that base business growth opportunity squarely in front of us. So on the margin, I think over time you'll continue to see more conversion of self Operations, which we're certainly seeing especially as I said in K-12 corrections and also Healthcare. So I think as Fred said we're holding our own again our competition head-to-head, so some quarters we may take share, some quarters we may lose a little share. But given the base business growth opportunities in our net new overtime, there's good ability to continue to grow at nice rates."

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2011 results call. As in prior quarters, I'd like to review our business and operating performance first, and then have Chris cover a few additional details on our overall performance. 
The economic climate continue to slowly improve in our second fiscal quarter, and we're pleased that our results reflect this strength. Our sales growth so far this year reflects an improving base business growth environment as well as the benefits of our solid new sales wins over the past year. And our many efforts over the past 24 months to improve our operational efficiencies and effectively manage our cost structure are allowing us to leverage the sales growth we are generating into quite solid earnings performance. 
Our first half client retention rates were consistent with recent trends and our expectations and our pipeline of new business opportunities remain robust. Now turning to our overall results for the second quarter. We reported sales of $3.3 billion, up 5% from the prior year quarter. Organic sales growth, which as you know excludes the impact of currency translation and acquisitions and divestitures, was up 4% in the quarter. 
Adjusted operating income of $165 million was up 15% in the prior year level with currency contributing approximately 2 percentage points of this growth. For the first half of fiscal 2011, sales were $6.6 billion, up 5% over the prior year period and up 4% on an organic growth basis. Our adjusted operating income of $370 million was up 12% versus prior year with currency contributions of about 1 percentage point.
Now turning to our North American Food and Support Services segment. Second quarter reported sales were up 5% to $2.2 billion with positive growth reported in most sectors led by Healthcare and our Education business. Organic sales growth for the segment was 4% in the quarter. For the first half, reported and organic sales were up 4% to $4.5 billion with the overall sales performance again being led by solid growth in Healthcare and Education. 
So now let's turn to the sectors within the North American business. Our Business and Industry sector had a low single-digit sales increase for the quarter and for the half, reflecting growth in both our cafe and catering sales. The improvement in discretionary spending we saw earlier in the year has continued, and we are seeing some pockets of population growth in certain client sectors.
The Education sector had a high single-digit sales growth rate for the first quarter -- or for the second quarter and for the first half. Growth in Higher Education for both periods was led by a combination of base business growth driven in part by increased demand for meal plans and the impact of new business we signed last year. 
K-12 sales growth continues to reflect the stronger new sales wins from fiscal 2010, as well as solid base business growth. In our Healthcare sector, sales grew in the mid-single digits for the quarter and in the low-single digits for the first half. Growth in the sector was primarily led by a combination of base business growth across the sector and new business growth particularly in our Clinical Technology Services. 
Our Sports and Entertainment sector had low single-digit sales decline in the quarter and a mid-single digit sales decline for the first half. The sales decline in the quarter reflected in part the positive impact from the Winter Olympics in last year's second quarter and a negative impact for this year due to exited venues, in part offset by solid base business growth in the NHL and in convention centers. 
In general, across our stadium and arena operations during the first half, we have seen improved per capita spending and stable attendance levels in comparison to prior year. These trends are also generally consistent with what we are seeing so far with Major League Baseball. Of course, as always, individual team performance further affects venue specific results. Adjusted operating income in the North American Food and Support Services segment was up 9% in the quarter to $117 million, led by solid year-over-year growth in Healthcare and Higher Education. For the first half, segment adjusted operating income grew 12% to $273 million, again led by strong profits performance in Healthcare and Higher Ed.
Turning to the International Food and Support Services segment. Second quarter reported sales of $677 million were up 9% from the prior year period with organic growth of about 7%. Organic growth in the quarter was led by solid performance in South America, Germany, Ireland, China and Spain, offset somewhat by an organic sales decline in the U.K. and in Korea. 
For the first half, reported sales were up 7% to $1.3 billion with organic growth of 6% and with solid sales growth in most of our countries and particularly strong performance in South America, Germany, Ireland and China.
Second quarter adjusted operating income was $22.5 million, up from $18.8 million in the prior year's quarter. Results this quarter benefited from a gain on the sale of a small, non-core subsidiary in Chile and the receipt of VAT income in the U.K., partly offset by some severance charges in Chile related to the divestiture and a write down of a goodwill and other intangible assets related to our relatively minor operations in India. 
Adjusting for these items and the effect of currency, international income was down slightly for the quarter. For the first half, adjusted operating income was $38 million compared to $43 million in the prior year period.
The lower first-half results were primarily driven by expenses recorded in the first quarter which we discussed before, related to efficiency and cost reduction initiatives including severance charges taken across several of our country operations as well as profit declines in the U.K. and Chile. In our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, second quarter sales of $372 million were up 3% from the year-ago quarter on both a reported and organic basis. With our Uniform Rental business sales growth in the low-single digits and solid growth in our Galls direct sale business. For the first half, segment sales of $756 million were up 2% from the prior year period on both and as reported and on organic growth basis. 
The Uniform business, as you know, is quite sensitive to employment levels and while we have seen some modest signs of headcount improvement amongst our clients, we have yet to see strong indications of robust levels of employment growth. While we are working on generating improved base and new sales growth through across selling programs, higher selling productivity for our sales reps and higher sales headcounts, our team is also continuing to systematically drive efficiencies throughout the operations while delivering high-quality service and reliable service to our clients.
Price competition for new business remains quite challenging, but we are working to maintain discipline as we seek to sign new business and retain profitable business. The segment's second quarter adjusted operating income was $33.4 million compared to $25.5 million in the prior year's quarter. As our cost and operating efficiency efforts, including the improved performance of our now integrated Direct Marketing business, are providing significant bottom-line leverage as sales have begun to grow again. 
Income in the quarter also includes $2.6 million resulting from the successful settlement of an eminent domain claim. For the first half, adjusted operating income was $75 million, up strongly from $58 million reported in the same period last year, again reflected the benefit of our cost reduction and efficiency efforts across the segment. 
A portion of the year-over-year profit increase also reflects, as we mentioned in the first quarter, our first quarter reduction in insurance reserves due to very favorable claims experience resulting from the business' very strong safety programs and resulting improved safety performance.
Corporate expenses, excluding the items that Chris mentioned earlier, were $8.2 million in the quarter compared to $8 million in the year-ago quarter. And for the first half, expenses were $16.5 million compared to $15.1 million in the prior period. So at this point, let me turn it back to Chris for some additional details on the quarter and on the half."

I'd like to make a few comments on our financing capital structure and cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending April 1 increased to $1.079 billion from $1.051 billion at December 31, 2010, and up from $1.036 billion",789,"Thanks, Fred. I'd like to make a few comments on our financing capital structure and cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending April 1 increased to $1.079 billion from $1.051 billion at December 31, 2010, and up from $1.036 billion at October 1, 2010. Interest and other financing costs were $93 million for the second quarter compared to $118 million in the prior year period. 
In the second quarter, we recorded interest income of approximately $14 million related to the settlement of U.K. VAT claims from prior years. Last year second quarter total also included approximately $8 million of expenses related to the credit agreement, amendment and term loan extension we completed in March of 2010.
For the first half, interest and other financing costs were $202 million, down from $227 million in the prior year including the impact of interest rate hedges, a significant portion of which mature in March of 2012, approximately 75% of our total debt portfolio is at fixed interest rates and our overall weighted average cost of debt is approximately 6.50%.
Total reported debt at the end of the second quarter was $5.739 billion, down from $5.995 billion at the end of last year's second quarter, when also including utilization of our accounts receivable securitization facility in the year ago total. Our secured debt as defined in our credit agreement totaled $3.666 billion, including a term loan balance of $3.307 billion and a revolver balance of $74 million. Our debt balance at the end of the quarter reflects the impact of the funding of the acquisition of Masterplan in March of 2011, an attractive and strategic addition to our Healthcare Clinical Technology Services portfolio.
The acquisition was funded with a combination of excess cash and revolver borrowings. Our accounts receivable securitization facility had $246 million utilized at quarter-end. We continue to enjoy a strong liquidity position overall and at quarter end, had approximately $510 million of available borrowing capacity under our $600 million revolving credit facility and $89 million on balance sheet cash. 
Based on our trailing adjusted EBITDA, our secured debt ratio improved to 3.33x as of April 1 compared to 3.47x as of December 31, 2010, and 3.70x as of April 2, 2010.
Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $66 million compared to $49 million in the prior year quarter. For the year-to-date, net capital expenditures total $120 million compared to $107 million in the first half of last year. While we anticipate full year net expenditures to be somewhat higher than the prior year level, we continue to maintain a disciplined approach in managing our use of capital. As expected and consistent with our historical patterns, working capital was a use of cash for us during the first half of our fiscal year. However, we are pleased that our year-to-date working capital performance has exceeded our expectations so far this year.
While some reinvestment in working capital is required as certain sectors begin to grow again, we will continue to maintain a sharp focus on working capital management as we move through the balance of fiscal 2011. 
For the year-to-date, we spent a total of $155 million on acquisitions compared to $81 million in the prior year period. This year spending relates primarily to the acquisition of Masterplan, which I just mentioned. We continue to evaluate strategic investment opportunities in certain sectors and geographies, but we'll continue to maintain a prudent and disciplined approach in pursuit of these opportunities.
As you know, during April, we successfully completed a $600 million HoldCo Notes financing, which many of you participated in. The funds were used to pay dividend to all of our shareholders, the first dividend we have paid since going private in January of 2007. We believe this dividend is not impact our ability to continue to grow and reinvest in our business while still pursuing appropriate strategic opportunities as well. 
After the transaction, our leverage ratios remain nicely below the initial levels of the time of our going private transaction and absent further acquisitions over the balance of this fiscal year, we expect our leverage ratios to further improve as we enter our seasonal cash generation period. 
In conjunction with the notes offering, we also extended from January 26, 2013 to January 26, 2015, the maturity of the U.S. dollar-denominated portion of our existing revolving credit facility. As a result, we now enjoy access to a $665 million revolving credit facility through January of 2013, which will then step down to $500 million of capacity through January of 2015.
We'd like to thank you for your support of this recent financing and for your ongoing support of ARAMARK. Now let me turn it back to Fred."

We are pleased with our solid overall performance during the first half of 2011. We are seeing importantly typically more solid performance than our less cyclical sectors such as Healthcare and Education, but are also beginning to see low single-digit sales growth in our more cyclical businesses. As our growth ramps up, we are also seeing the benefit of the significant operating efficiencies that we have generated over the past 24 months. And we should continue to benefit from these as the economy continues to strengthen. 
We're also excited about the number of additional opportunities we have identified to further improve the efficiency and effectiveness across our operations. And we are well into a number of initiatives that we anticipate will deliver additional benefits in the coming quarters and years. We do expect to face increasing but manageable headwinds in the second half of fiscal 2011 as a result of rising gasoline and commodity cost. 
But our teams are and will be focused on aggressively addressing these challenges as we move through the back half of the year. Longer term, we continue to be quite excited about the growth opportunities we see as we look across our portfolio of businesses and sectors. And we are properly focusing our resources and investments to best exploit these opportunities. 
So in conclusion, thank you again for your time this afternoon and for your continued support of ARAMARK. And at this point, we'd be happy to take any questions."

Some of which looking at those discrete wins was taking share because those were, by and large, already outsourced. But we continue to have and see very good base business growth opportunities within our existing accounts. And so when you think about Higher Ed, Q1, which is a big quarter for our Higher Ed business and as you know, it delivered 10% organic growth, that was a very nice mix of base and new. And we continue to have that base business growth opportunity squarely in front of us. So on the margin, I think over time, you'll continue to see more conversion of self operations, which we're certainly seeing especially as I said in K-12 corrections and also Healthcare. So I think as Fred said, we're holding our own against our competition head-to-head, so some quarters we may take share, some quarters we may lose a little share. But given the base business growth opportunities in our net new overtime, there's good ability to continue to grow at nice rates."

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2011 results call.

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2011 results call. As in prior quarters, I'd like to review our business and operating performance first, and then have Chris cover a few additional details on our overall performance. 
The economic climate continue to slowly improve in our second fiscal quarter, and we're pleased that our results reflect this trend. Our sales growth so far this year reflects an improving base business growth environment as well as the benefits of our solid new sales wins over the past year. And our many efforts over the past 24 months to improve our operational efficiencies and effectively manage our cost structure are allowing us to leverage the sales growth we are generating into quite solid earnings performance. 
Our first half client retention rates were consistent with recent trends and our expectations and our pipeline of new business opportunities remain robust. Now turning to our overall results for the second quarter. We reported sales of $3.3 billion, up 5% from the prior year quarter. Organic sales growth, which as you know excludes the impact of currency translation and acquisitions and divestitures, was up 4% in the quarter. 
Adjusted operating income of $165 million was up 15% in the prior year level with currency contributing approximately 2 percentage points of this growth. For the first half of fiscal 2011, sales were $6.6 billion, up 5% over the prior year period and up 4% on an organic growth basis. Our adjusted operating income of $370 million was up 12% versus prior year with currency contributions of about 1 percentage point.
Now turning to our North American Food and Support Services segment. Second quarter reported sales were up 5% to $2.2 billion with positive growth reported in most sectors led by Healthcare and our Education business. Organic sales growth for the segment was 4% in the quarter. For the first half, reported and organic sales were up 4% to $4.5 billion with the overall sales performance again being led by solid growth in Healthcare and Education. 
So now let's turn to the sectors within the North American business. Our Business and Industry sector had a low single-digit sales increase for the quarter and for the half, reflecting growth in both our cafe and catering sales. The improvement in discretionary spending we saw earlier in the year has continued, and we are seeing some pockets of population growth in certain client sectors.
The Education sector had a high single-digit sales growth rate for the first quarter -- or for the second quarter and for the first half. Growth in Higher Education for both periods was led by a combination of base business growth driven in part by increased demand for meal plans and the impact of new business we signed last year. 
K-12 sales growth continues to reflect the stronger new sales wins from fiscal 2010, as well as solid base business growth. In our Healthcare sector, sales grew in the mid-single digits for the quarter and in the low-single digits for the first half. Growth in the sector was primarily led by a combination of base business growth across the sector and new business growth particularly in our Clinical Technology Services. 
Our Sports and Entertainment sector had low single-digit sales decline in the quarter and a mid-single digit sales decline for the first half. The sales decline in the quarter reflected in part the positive impact from the Winter Olympics in last year's second quarter and a negative impact this year due to exited venues, in part offset by solid base business growth in the NHL and in convention centers. 
In general, across our stadium and arena operations during the first half, we have seen improved per capita spending and stable attendance levels in comparison to prior year. These trends are also generally consistent with what we are seeing so far with Major League Baseball. Of course, as always, individual team performance further affects venue specific results. Adjusted operating income in the North American Food and Support Services segment was up 9% in the quarter to $117 million, led by solid year-over-year growth in Healthcare and Higher Education. For the first half, segment adjusted operating income grew 12% to $273 million, again led by strong profits performance in Healthcare and Higher Ed.
Turning to the International Food and Support Services segment. Second quarter reported sales of $677 million were up 9% from the prior year period with organic growth of about 7%. Organic growth in the quarter was led by solid performance in South America, Germany, Ireland, China and Spain, offset somewhat by an organic sales decline in the U.K. and in Korea. 
For the first half, reported sales were up 7% to $1.3 billion with organic growth of 6% and with solid sales growth in most of our countries and particularly strong performance in South America, Germany, Ireland and China.
Second quarter adjusted operating income was $22.5 million, up from $18.8 million in the prior year's quarter. Results this quarter benefited from a gain on the sale of a small, non-core subsidiary in Chile and the receipt of VAT income in the U.K., partly offset by some severance charges in Chile related to the divestiture and a write down of a goodwill and other intangible assets related to our relatively minor operations in India. 
Adjusting for these items and the effect of currency, international income was down slightly for the quarter. For the first half, adjusted operating income was $38 million compared to $43 million in the prior year period.
The lower first-half results were primarily driven by expenses recorded in the first quarter which we discussed before, related to efficiency and cost reduction initiatives including severance charges taken across several of our country operations as well as profit declines in the U.K. and Chile. In our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, second quarter sales of $372 million were up 3% from the year-ago quarter on both a reported and organic basis. With our Uniform Rental business sales growth in the low-single digits and solid growth in our Galls direct sale business. For the first half, segment sales of $756 million were up 2% from the prior year period on both an as reported and on organic growth basis. 
The Uniform business, as you know, is quite sensitive to employment levels and while we have seen some modest signs of headcount improvement amongst our clients, we have yet to see strong indications of robust levels of employment growth. While we are working on generating improved base and new sales growth through across selling programs, higher selling productivity for our sales reps and higher sales headcounts, our team is also continuing to systematically drive efficiencies throughout the operations while delivering high-quality service and reliable service to our clients.
Price competition for new business remains quite challenging, but we are working to maintain discipline as we seek to sign new business and retain profitable business. The segment's second quarter adjusted operating income was $33.4 million compared to $25.5 million in the prior year's quarter. As our cost and operating efficiency efforts, including the improved performance of our now integrated Direct Marketing business, are providing significant bottom-line leverage as sales have begun to grow again. 
Income in the quarter also includes $2.6 million resulting from the successful settlement of an eminent domain claim. For the first half, adjusted operating income was $75 million, up strongly from $58 million reported in the same period last year, again reflected the benefit of our cost reduction and efficiency efforts across the segment. 
A portion of the year-over-year profit increase also reflects, as we mentioned in the first quarter, our first quarter reduction in insurance reserves due to very favorable claims experience resulting from the business' very strong safety programs and resulting improved safety performance.
Corporate expenses, excluding the items that Chris mentioned earlier, were $8.2 million in the quarter compared to $8 million in the year-ago quarter. And for the first half, expenses were $16.5 million compared to $15.1 million in the prior period. So at this point, let me turn it back to Chris for some additional details on the quarter and on the half."

I'd like to make a few comments on our financing capital structure and cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending April 1 increased to $1.079 billion from $1.051 billion at December 31, 2010, and up from $1.036 billion",790,"Thanks, Fred. I'd like to make a few comments on our financing capital structure and cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending April 1 increased to $1.079 billion from $1.051 billion at December 31, 2010, and up from $1.036 billion at October 1, 2010. Interest and other financing costs were $93 million for the second quarter compared to $118 million in the prior year period. 
In the second quarter, we recorded interest income of approximately $14 million related to the settlement of U.K. VAT claims from prior years. Last year's second quarter total also included approximately $8 million of expenses related to the credit agreement, amendment and term loan extension we completed in March of 2010.
For the first half, interest and other financing costs were $202 million, down from $227 million in the prior year including the impact of interest rate hedges, a significant portion of which mature in March of 2012, approximately 75% of our total debt portfolio is at fixed interest rates and our overall weighted average cost of debt is approximately 6.50%.
Total reported debt at the end of the second quarter was $5.739 billion, down from $5.995 billion at the end of last year's second quarter, when also including utilization of our accounts receivable securitization facility in the year ago total. Our secured debt as defined in our credit agreement totaled $3.666 billion, including a term loan balance of $3.307 billion and a revolver balance of $74 million. Our debt balance at the end of the quarter reflects the impact of the funding of the acquisition of Masterplan in March of 2011, an attractive and strategic addition to our Healthcare Clinical Technology Services portfolio.
The acquisition was funded with a combination of excess cash and revolver borrowings. Our accounts receivable securitization facility had $246 million utilized at quarter-end. We continue to enjoy a strong liquidity position overall and at quarter end, had approximately $510 million of available borrowing capacity under our $600 million revolving credit facility and $89 million of balance sheet cash. 
Based on our trailing adjusted EBITDA, our secured debt ratio improved to 3.33x as of April 1 compared to 3.47x as of December 31, 2010, and 3.70x as of April 2, 2010.
Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $66 million compared to $49 million in the prior year quarter. For the year-to-date, net capital expenditures total $120 million compared to $107 million in the first half of last year. While we anticipate full year net expenditures to be somewhat higher than the prior year level, we continue to maintain a disciplined approach in managing our use of capital. As expected and consistent with our historical patterns, working capital was a use of cash for us during the first half of our fiscal year. However, we are pleased that our year-to-date working capital performance has exceeded our expectations so far this year.
While some reinvestment in working capital is required as certain sectors begin to grow again, we will continue to maintain a sharp focus on working capital management as we move through the balance of fiscal 2011. 
For the year-to-date, we spent a total of $155 million on acquisitions compared to $81 million in the prior year period. This year's spending relates primarily to the acquisition of Masterplan, which I just mentioned. We continue to evaluate strategic investment opportunities in certain sectors and geographies, but we'll continue to maintain a prudent and disciplined approach in pursuit of these opportunities.
As you know, during April, we successfully completed a $600 million HoldCo Notes financing, which many of you participated in. The funds were used to pay a dividend to all of our shareholders, the first dividend we have paid since going private in January of 2007. We believe this dividend does not impact our ability to continue to grow and reinvest in our business while still pursuing appropriate strategic opportunities as well. 
After the transaction, our leverage ratios remain nicely below the initial levels at the time of our going private transaction and absent further acquisitions over the balance of this fiscal year, we expect our leverage ratios to further improve as we enter our seasonal cash generation period. 
In conjunction with the notes offering, we also extended from January 26, 2013 to January 26, 2015, the maturity of the U.S. dollar-denominated portion of our existing revolving credit facility. As a result, we now enjoy access to a $665 million revolving credit facility through January of 2013, which will then step down to $500 million of capacity through January of 2015.
We'd like to thank you for your support of this recent financing and for your ongoing support of ARAMARK. Now let me turn it back to Fred."

We are pleased with our solid overall performance during the first half of 2011. We are seeing importantly typically more solid performance than our less cyclical sectors such as Healthcare and Education, but are also beginning to see low single-digit sales growth in our more cyclical businesses. As our growth ramps up, we are also seeing the benefit of the significant operating efficiencies that we have generated over the past 24 months. And we should continue to benefit from these as the economy continues to strengthen. 
We're also excited about the number of additional opportunities we have identified to further improve the efficiency and effectiveness across our operations. And we are well into a number of initiatives that we anticipate will deliver additional benefits in the coming quarters and years. We do expect to face increasing but manageable headwinds in the second half of fiscal 2011 as a result of rising gasoline and commodity cost. 
But our teams are and will be focused on aggressively addressing these challenges as we move through the back half of the year. Longer term, we continue to be quite excited about the growth opportunities we see as we look across our portfolio of businesses and sectors.

And so when you think about Higher Ed, Q1, which is a big quarter for our Higher Ed business and as you know, it delivered 10% organic growth, that was a very nice mix of base and new. And we continue to have that base business growth opportunity squarely in front of us. So on the margin, I think over time, you'll continue to see more conversion of self operations, which we're certainly seeing especially as I said in K-12 corrections and also Healthcare. So I think as Fred said, we're holding our own against our competition head-to-head, so some quarters we may take share, some quarters we may lose a little share. But given the base business growth opportunities in our net new overtime, there's good ability to continue to grow at nice rates."

Good afternoon and thanks to all of you for joining us for our third quarter 2011 results call. As in prior quarters, I'd like to review our business and operating results and then Chris will cover a few additional details on our perform",1271,"Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon and thanks to all of you for joining us for our third quarter 2011 results call. As in prior quarters, I'd like to review our business and operating results and then Chris will cover a few additional details on our performance. We're quite pleased with our results for the third quarter and for the year-to-date, as our businesses are delivering solid overall growth with improving margins. During the quarter, we generally saw the economic climate remain relatively stable but with a still somewhat cautious outlook. In this environment, our less economically sensitive businesses have delivered solid overall sales performance. Our growth in our more cyclical businesses has been generally more modest. We continue to see positive growth trends in certain of our sectors as a result of contributions from both base business and new business wins and our pipeline of new business opportunities remains robust across the portfolio. We remain focused on efficiently managing our operations and cost structure and as evidenced by this quarter's solid margin improvement, we continue to successfully drive for opportunities to further enhance our operational efficiencies.
Now turning to our overall results for the third quarter. We achieved sales of $3.3 billion, up 7% from the prior-year quarter. Organic sales growth, which as you know, excludes the impact of currency translations as well as acquisitions and divestitures, was up 3% in the quarter. Adjusted operating income was $153 million, up 17% from the prior year level. For the first 9 months of fiscal 2011, sales were $9.9 billion, up 5% over the prior year period and up 4% on an organic growth basis. Our adjusted operating income of $523 million was up 13% from the prior year.
Now turning to our North American food support services segment. Third quarter reported sales were up 4% to $2.3 billion but primarily by growth in the education and healthcare sectors, which offset sales declines in the business and industry in sports and entertainment sectors. Organic sales growth was 2% in the quarter, partly reflecting the normal seasonal change in our sales mix between our higher growing education and healthcare sectors and our typically lower growing sports and entertainment sectors. For the 9 months, reported sales were up 4% to $6.7 billion with organic growth of 3%. Year-to-date performance was also led by solid growth in education and in healthcare.
Turning now to the sectors within North America. Our business and industry sector had low single-digit sales decline for the quarter and a low single-digit sales increase for the 9 months. Now the sector's quarterly sales decline was primarily due to the positive impact in last year's third quarter from our contract to provide support services for the Canadian security detail that served both the G-8 and G-20 meetings. Our business operations continue to extend the trends seen in the first part of the year, with low single-digit topline growth. We've seen some firming and volume despite limited deployment growth and catering activity remains positive on a year-to-year basis. The Education sector had high single-digit sales growth for the quarter and for the 9 months, with growth in our higher education food business resulting from a good combination of solid base business growth and solid new sales from contract wins in prior periods.
In our Healthcare sector, we realized low double-digit sales growth for the quarter and mid- single-digit sales growth for the 9 months, driven both by the acquisition and Masterplan within our clinical Technology Services business as well as by solid base business growth across the sector. Our Sports and Entertainment sector had a low single-digit sales for the quarter and a mid- single-digit sales decline for the 9 months. The solid base business growth in our NHL venues and in our stadiums was more than offset by the impact of prior year lost business, a reduced number of shows in our amphitheaters and sales in the prior year related to the Winter Olympics. Major League Baseball performance has been quite solid overall and somewhat higher per capita spending and attendance so far this year.
Adjusted operating income in the North American Food and Support Services segment increased by 17% in the quarter to $98 million, led by strong profit growth in education and healthcare, partially offset by modest declines in our business and industry and sports and entertainment sectors, with the G-8 and G-20 event in the prior year negative negatively affecting the profit comparison for the business and industry group in the quarter.
For the 9 months, segment adjusted operating income grew 13% to $371 million, again led by strong profit growth in education and in healthcare.
Now turning to the international food and support services segment, third quarter reported sales of $698 million were up 18% from the prior year period, with organic sales growth of about 8%. Organic growth in the quarter was generally positive in most of our country operations. For the 9 months, reported sales were up 11% to $2 billion. Organic growth was 7%, led primarily by solid growth in Ireland, Germany, Chile, Argentina and China, which more than offset the sales decline in the U.K. and Korea. Third quarter adjusted operating income was $26 million, up 20% from the prior year, with currency translation contributing more than half the growth.
Results in the quarter primarily reflects solid performance in Germany and improving profit performance in the U.K., offsetting a profit decline in Chile. For the 9 months, adjusted operating income was $64 million, down modestly on a reported basis. Currency translation contributed approximately $3 million of the growth in comparison to the prior year, offset by a profit decline in Chile partly reflecting the impact of lost or closed business earlier in the year. In addition, a number of other items, including the gain on the sale of a noncore subsidiary in Chile, the receipt of VAT income in the U.K., a gain on the sale of land in Chile, severance related charges on the write-down of goodwill related to our operations in India, all net to a reduction of approximately $3 million for the 9-month period. 
In our uniform and crew apparel segment, third quarter sales of $373 million were up 1% from the year-ago quarter and both on a reported and organic basis. For the 9-month period, segment sales of $1.1 billion were up 2% from the prior year on both the reported and organic basis. We're balancing at investment and additional sales resources to support and improve new sales growth with continuing to maintain discipline in the pricing for new and retained uniform rental business and we were pleased that the volume of new sales delivered in the quarter by our sales force exceeded the prior year's quarter results for the first time this year.
The segment's third quarter adjusted operating income was $37 million, up 9% compared to last year and for the 9 months, adjusted operating income was $112 million, up 22% compared to last year. We're continuing to see the benefit of our consistent focus on improving operating efficiencies and our cost profile on this business. As previously disclosed, the year-to-date results also reflect a reduction in insurance reserves and the first quarter of the year due to favorable claims experience. Corporate expenses, excluding the items that Chris mentioned earlier, were $7.7 million in the quarter compared to $7.7 million a year ago. For the 9 months, expenses were $23.7 million compared to $22.8 million in the prior year. Now let it me turn it back to Chris for some additional details on the quarter and the year-to-date performance."

I'd like to comment on our capital structure and the cash flow.

I'd like to comment on our capital structure and the cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending July 1 was $1.083 billion, up from $1.079 billion at April 1, and up from $1.036 billion at October 1, 2010. It's worth pointing out that in conjunction with the successful sale in June of a noncontrolling interest in SeamlessWeb, we classified Seamless as an unrestricted subsidiary and therefore it is not be included in our July 1 adjusted EBITDA. We are very excited about the opportunities for Seamless in this new ownership structure along with our partners from this year equity investors and business continues to grow quite rapidly particularly in the consumer segment and we expect total total Madison Williams this year to reach nearly $400 million. Interest and other financing costs were $113 million for the third quarter compared to $109 million in the prior year, with this year's number including $2 million of expenses related to the revolver amendment and extension we completed in April. For the 9 months, interest and other financing costs were $315 million compared to $336 million in the prior year. The decrease is primarily driven by interest income of approximately $14 million recorded last quarter related to the settlement of U.K. VAT claims from prior years as well as the $8 million of expense recorded in the second quarter of 2010 related to the credit agreement amendment and the term loan extension that we completed in March of 2010.
Total reported debt at the end of the third quarter was $5.851 billion. Our secured debt, as defined in our credit agreement, totaled $3.772 billion including a term loan balance of $3.310 billion and a revolver balance of $214 million. Our accounts assumable securitization facility had $211 million utilized at quarter end. We continue to enjoy a strong liquidity position with approximately $430 million off available capacity under our revolving credit facility as of quarter end. Based on our trailing adjusted EBITDA, our secured debt ratio was 3.41x as of July 1, up modestly from 3.33x as of April 1, 2011 and 3.37x as of October 1, 2010. The slight increase in the ratio reflects utilization of the revolver to fund a portion of the dividend we paid in April as well as the reclassification of the seamless adjusted EBITDA.
Overall, we are pleased with our EBITDA growth and our ratio improved momentum and we anticipate further ratio improvement over time. Net capital expenditures for the quarter was $60 million compared to $45 million in the prior year quarter. For the year to date, net capital expenditures totaled $180 million compared to $152 million last year as we make prudent investments in growth opportunities and in our infrastructure.
As expected and consistent with historical patterns, working capital was the use of cash for us during the first 9 months of the fiscal year. We are continuing to maintain a focus on working capital management as we move through the fourth quarter, which is our strongest seasonal period from a working capital and free cash flow standpoint.
For the year-to-date, we spend a total of $157 million acquisition compared to $84 million in the prior year period. This year's spending related primarily to the acquisition of Masterplan within our North American healthcare business in March. We continue to evaluate and seek to make strategic investments in certain sectors and geographies but we will be prudent and disciplined in the pursuit of these opportunities.
As previously mentioned, during the quarter, we sold a noncontrolling interest in our seamless subsidiary, the leading provider of online and mobile food ordering to consumers and corporations in the U.S.. Proceeds from the sales were used to reduce revolver borrowings in the quarter.
Now let me turn it back over to Fred."

As we look forward, we'll be working to deliver improving organic growth rates and continued margin improvement. The economic environment remains somewhat unsettled as everyone knows, and we would likely pose a challenge to certain sectors and countries more than others.
Overall, we continue to benefit from our portfolio of sectors, geographies and clients, which provide us with good balance and we remain excited about the growth opportunities we see as we look across our businesses.

And I think in the current structure, we're now much better positioned to attract and retain the kind of talent that a rapidly growing eCommerce business needs to be successful in terms of motivating and incenting the management team. And also, I think we are just much more nimble in terms of being able to make decisions and have people around the table now with an expertise to really help the business continue to succeed and move to the next level.

Good afternoon, and thanks to all of you for joining us for our third quarter 2011 results call. As in prior quarters, I'd like to review our business and operating results, and then Chris will cover a few additional details on our performance. We're quite pleased with our results for the third quarter and for the year-to-date, as our businesses are delivering solid overall growth with improving margins. During the quarter, we generally saw the economic climate remain relatively stable but with a still somewhat cautious outlook. In this environment, our less economically sensitive businesses have delivered solid overall sales performance. Our growth in our more cyclical businesses has been generally more modest. We continue to see positive growth trends in certain of our sectors as a result of contributions from both base business and new business wins, and our pipeline of new business opportunities remains robust across the portfolio. We've remained focused on efficiently managing our operations and cost structure, and as evidenced by this quarter's solid margin improvement, we continue to successfully drive for opportunities to further enhance our operational efficiencies.
Now turning to our overall results for the third quarter. We achieved sales of $3.3 billion, up 7% from the prior year quarter. Organic sales growth, which as you know, excludes the impact of currency translations as well as acquisitions and divestitures, was up 3% in the quarter. Adjusted operating income was $153 million, up 17% from the prior year level. For the first 9 months of fiscal 2011, sales were $9.9 billion, up 5% over the prior year period and up 4% on an organic growth basis. Our adjusted operating income of $523 million was up 13% from the prior year.
Now turning to our North American Food and Support Services segment, third quarter reported sales were up 4% to $2.3 billion, but primarily by growth in the Education and Healthcare sectors, which offset sales declines in the Business and Industry and Sports and Entertainment sectors. Organic sales growth was 2% in the quarter, partly reflecting the normal seasonal change in our sales mix between our higher growing Education and Healthcare sectors and our typically lower growing business in Sports and Entertainment sectors. For the 9 months, reported sales were up 4% to $6.7 billion with organic growth of 3%. Year-to-date, performance was also led by solid growth in Education and in Healthcare.
Turning now to the sectors within North America. Our Business and Industry sector had low single-digit sales decline for the quarter and a low single-digit sales increase for the 9 months. Now the sector's quarterly sales decline was primarily due to the positive impact in last year's third quarter from our contract to provide support services for the Canadian security detail that served both the G8 and G20 meetings. Our Business Dining operations continued to extend the trends seen in the first part of the year, with low single-digit top line growth. We've seen some firming in volume despite limited employment growth and catering activity remains positive on a year-to-year basis. The Education sector had high single-digit sales growth for the quarter and for the 9 months, with growth in our Higher Education food business resulting from a good combination of solid base business growth and solid new sales from contract wins in prior periods.
In our Healthcare sector, we realized low double-digit sales growth for the quarter and mid- single-digit sales growth for the 9 months, driven both by the acquisition in March of Masterplan within our Clinical Technology Services business, as well as by solid base business growth across the sector. Our Sports and Entertainment sector had a low single-digit sales decline for the quarter and a mid-single-digit sales decline for the 9 months, as solid business -- base business growth in our NHL venues and in our stadiums was more than offset by the impact of prior year lost business, a reduced number of shows in our amphitheaters and sales in the prior year related to the Winter Olympics. Major League Baseball performance has been quite solid overall and somewhat higher per capita spending and attendance so far this year.
Adjusted operating income in the North American Food and Support Services segment increased by 17% in the quarter to $98 million, led by strong profit growth in Education and Healthcare, partially offset by modest declines in our Business and Industry and Sports and Entertainment sectors, with the G8 and G20 event in the prior year negatively affecting the profit comparison for the Business and Industry group in the quarter.
For the 9 months, segment adjusted operating income grew 13% to $371 million, again led by strong profit growth in Education and in Healthcare.
Now turning to the international Food and Support Services segment, third quarter reported sales of $698 million were up 18% from the prior year period, with organic sales growth of about 8%. Organic growth in the quarter was generally positive in most of our country operations. For the 9 months, reported sales were up 11% to $2 billion. Organic growth was 7%, led primarily by solid growth in Ireland, Germany, Chile, Argentina and China, which more than offset the sales decline in the U.K. and Korea. Third quarter adjusted operating income was $26 million, up 20% from the prior year, with currency translation contributing more than half the growth.
Results in the quarter primarily reflect solid performance in Germany and improving profit performance in the U.K., offsetting a profit decline in Chile. For the 9 months, adjusted operating income was $64 million, down modestly on a reported basis. Currency translation contributed approximately $3 million of the growth in comparison to the prior year, offset by a profit decline in Chile partly reflecting the impact of lost or closed business earlier in the year. In addition, a number of other items, including the gain on the sale of a noncore subsidiary in Chile, the receipt of VAT income in the U.K., a gain on the sale of land in Chile, severance-related charges on the write-down of goodwill related to our operations in India, all net to a reduction of approximately $3 million for the 9-month period. 
In our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, third quarter sales of $373 million were up 1% from the year-ago quarter on both on a reported and on an organic basis. For the 9-months period, segment sales of $1.1 billion were up 2% from the prior year on both the reported and organic basis. We are balancing an investment and additional sales resources to support and prove new sales growth with continuing to a maintained discipline in the pricing for new and retained Uniform Rental business. And we were pleased that the volume of new sales delivered in the quarter by our sales force exceeded the prior year's quarter result for the first time this year.
The segment's third quarter adjusted operating income was $37 million, up 9% compared to last year. And for the 9 months, adjusted operating income was $112 million, up 22% compared to last year. We are continuing to see the benefit of our consistent focus on improving operating efficiencies and our cost profile on this business. As previously disclosed, the year-to-date results also reflect a reduction on insurance reserves in the first quarter of the year due to favorable claims experience. Corporate expenses, excluding the items that Chris mentioned earlier, were $7.2 million in the quarter compared to $7.7 million a year ago. For the 9 months, expenses were $23.7 million compared to $22.8 million in the prior year. 
Now let me turn it back to Chris for some additional details on the quarter and the year-to-date performance."

I'd like to comment on our financing capital structure and cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending July 1 was $1.083 billion, up from $1.079 billion at April 1, 2011 and up from $1.036 billion at October 1, 2010. It'",634,"Thanks, Fred. I'd like to comment on our financing capital structure and cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending July 1 was $1.083 billion, up from $1.079 billion at April 1, 2011 and up from $1.036 billion at October 1, 2010. It's worth pointing out that in conjunction with the successful sale in June of a noncontrolling interest in SeamlessWeb, we've classified Seamless as an unrestricted subsidiary, and therefore it is not being included in our July 1 adjusted EBITDA. We are very excited about the opportunities for Seamless in this new ownership structure, along with our partners from Spectrum Equity Investors. The business continues to grow quite rapidly, particularly in the consumer segment, and we expect total managed volume this year to reach nearly $400 million. Interest and other financing costs were $113 million for the third quarter compared to $109 million in the prior year, with this year's number including $2 million of expenses related to the revolver amendment and extension we completed in April. For the 9 months, interest and other financing costs were $315 million compared to $336 million in the prior year. The decrease is primarily driven by interest income of approximately $14 million recorded last quarter related to the settlement of U.K. VAT claims from prior years, as well as the $8 million of expense recorded in the second quarter of 2010 related to the credit agreement amendment and the term loan extension that we completed in March of 2010.
Total reported debt at the end of the third quarter was $5.851 billion. Our secured debt, as defined in our credit agreement, totaled $3.772 billion including a term loan balance of $3.310 billion and a revolver balance of $214 million. Our accounts receivable securitization facility had $211 million utilized at quarter end. We're continuing to enjoy a strong liquidity position with approximately $430 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility as of quarter end. Based on our trailing adjusted EBITDA, our secured debt ratio was 3.41x as of July 1, up modestly from 3.33x as of April 1, 2011 and 3.37x as of October 1, 2010. The slight increase in the ratio reflects utilization of the revolver to fund a portion of the dividend we paid in April, as well as the reclassification of the Seamless adjusted EBITDA.
Overall, we are pleased with our EBITDA growth and our ratio improved momentum, and we anticipate further ratio improvement over time. Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $60 million compared to $45 million in the prior year quarter. For the year-to-date net capital expenditures totaled $180 million compared to $152 million last year as we make prudent investments in growth opportunities and in our infrastructure.
As expected and consistent with historical patterns, working capital was a use of cash for us during the first 9 months of our fiscal year. We are continuing to maintain a focus on working capital management as we move through the fourth quarter, which is our strongest seasonal period from a working capital and free cash flow standpoint.
For the year-to-date, we spent a total of $157 million on acquisitions compared to $84 million in the prior year period. This year's spending related primarily to the acquisition of Masterplan within our North American Healthcare business in March. We continue to evaluate and seek to make strategic investments in certain sectors and geographies, but we will be prudent and disciplined in the pursuit of these opportunities.
As previously mentioned, during the quarter, we sold a noncontrolling interest in our Seamless subsidiary, the leading provider of online and mobile food ordering to consumers and corporations in the U.S.. Proceeds from the sale were used to reduce revolver borrowings in the quarter.
Now let me turn it back over to Fred."

As we look forward, we'll be working to deliver improving organic growth rates and continued margin improvement. The economic environment remains somewhat unsettled as everyone knows, and we'll likely pose a challenge to certain sectors and countries more than others.
Overall, we continue to benefit from our portfolio of sectors, geographies and clients, which provide us with good balance, and we remain excited about the growth opportunities we see as we look across our businesses. We will continue to invest appropriately in the pursuit of these many opportunities in the months and years ahead while still managing our cost structure and cash flow on a disciplined manner.

Sometimes frankly, we're a bit timid to do that in view of the client relationship even when we have the contractual right to do that, and so we're spending a lot of time focusing on that. And then thirdly, and as we mentioned in earlier calls and as you saw in the quarter, we really believe we can -- that we will continue to have margin improvement opportunities, particularly in the food cost line and in the labor cost line, just through programs that drive more efficiency in both of those categories. And as I think we've mentioned earlier, we've undertaken a food and facility's wide initiative in both of those areas involving lots of folks and are in the process of rolling out programs that we think will continue to benefit us in the quarters to come."

Good afternoon, and thanks to all of you for joining us for our third quarter 2011 results call. As in prior quarters, I'd like to review our business and operating results, and then Chris will cover a few additional details on our performance. We're quite pleased with our results for the third quarter and for the year-to-date, as our businesses are delivering solid overall growth with improving margins. During the quarter, we generally saw the economic climate remain relatively stable but with a still somewhat cautious outlook. In this environment, our less economically sensitive businesses have delivered solid overall sales performance. Our growth in our more cyclical businesses has been generally more modest. We continue to see positive growth trends in certain of our sectors as a result of contributions from both base business and new business wins, and our pipeline of new business opportunities remains robust across the portfolio. We've remained focused on efficiently managing our operations and cost structure, and as evidenced by this quarter's solid margin improvement, we continue to successfully drive for opportunities to further enhance our operational efficiencies.
Now turning to our overall results for the third quarter. We achieved sales of $3.3 billion, up 7% from the prior year quarter. Organic sales growth, which as you know, excludes the impact of currency translations as well as acquisitions and divestitures, was up 3% in the quarter. Adjusted operating income was $153 million, up 17% from the prior year level. For the first 9 months of fiscal 2011, sales were $9.9 billion, up 5% over the prior year period and up 4% on an organic growth basis. Our adjusted operating income of $523 million was up 13% from the prior year.
Now turning to our North American Food and Support Services segment, third quarter reported sales were up 4% to $2.3 billion, but primarily by growth in the Education and Healthcare sectors, which offset sales declines in the Business and Industry and Sports and Entertainment sectors. Organic sales growth was 2% in the quarter, partly reflecting the normal seasonal change in our sales mix between our higher growing Education and Healthcare sectors and our typically lower growing business in Sports and Entertainment sectors. For the 9 months, reported sales were up 4% to $6.7 billion with organic growth of 3%. Year-to-date, performance was also led by solid growth in Education and in Healthcare.
Turning now to the sectors within North America. Our Business and Industry sector had low single-digit sales decline for the quarter and a low single-digit sales increase for the 9 months. Now the sector's quarterly sales decline was primarily due to the positive impact in last year's third quarter from our contract to provide support services for the Canadian security detail that served both the G8 and G20 meetings. Our Business Dining operations continued to extend the trends seen in the first part of the year, with low single-digit top line growth. We've seen some firming in volume despite limited employment growth and catering activity remains positive on a year-to-year basis. The Education sector had high single-digit sales growth for the quarter and for the 9 months, with growth in our Higher Education food business resulting from a good combination of solid base business growth and solid new sales from contract wins in prior periods.
In our Healthcare sector, we realized low double-digit sales growth for the quarter and mid-single-digit sales growth for the 9 months, driven both by the acquisition in March of Masterplan within our Clinical Technology Services business, as well as by solid base business growth across the sector. Our Sports and Entertainment sector had a low single-digit sales decline for the quarter and a mid-single-digit sales decline for the 9 months, as solid business -- base business growth in our NHL venues and in our stadiums was more than offset by the impact of prior year lost business, a reduced number of shows in our amphitheaters and sales in the prior year related to the Winter Olympics. Major League Baseball performance has been quite solid overall and somewhat higher per capita spending and attendance so far this year.
Adjusted operating income in the North American Food and Support Services segment increased by 17% in the quarter to $98 million, led by strong profit growth in Education and Healthcare, partially offset by modest declines in our Business and Industry and Sports and Entertainment sectors, with the G8 and G20 event in the prior year negatively affecting the profit comparison for the Business and Industry group in the quarter.
For the 9 months, segment adjusted operating income grew 13% to $371 million, again led by strong profit growth in Education and in Healthcare.
Now turning to the international Food and Support Services segment, third quarter reported sales of $698 million were up 18% from the prior year period, with organic sales growth of about 8%. Organic growth in the quarter was generally positive in most of our country operations. For the 9 months, reported sales were up 11% to $2 billion. Organic growth was 7%, led primarily by solid growth in Ireland, Germany, Chile, Argentina and China, which more than offset the sales decline in the U.K. and Korea. Third quarter adjusted operating income was $26 million, up 20% from the prior year, with currency translation contributing more than half the growth.
Results in the quarter primarily reflect solid performance in Germany and improving profit performance in the U.K., offsetting a profit decline in Chile. For the 9 months, adjusted operating income was $64 million, down modestly on a reported basis. Currency translation contributed approximately $3 million of the growth in comparison to the prior year, offset by a profit decline in Chile partly reflecting the impact of lost or closed business earlier in the year. In addition, a number of other items, including the gain on the sale of a noncore subsidiary in Chile, the receipt of VAT income in the U.K., a gain on the sale of land in Chile, severance-related charges on the write-down of goodwill related to our operations in India, all net to a reduction of approximately $3 million for the 9-month period. 
In our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, third quarter sales of $373 million were up 1% from the year-ago quarter on both on a reported and on an organic basis. For the 9-months period, segment sales of $1.1 billion were up 2% from the prior year on both the reported and organic basis. We are balancing an investment and additional sales resources to support and prove new sales growth with continuing to a maintained discipline in the pricing for new and retained Uniform Rental business. And we were pleased that the volume of new sales delivered in the quarter by our sales force exceeded the prior year's quarter result for the first time this year.
The segment's third quarter adjusted operating income was $37 million, up 9% compared to last year. And for the 9 months, adjusted operating income was $112 million, up 22% compared to last year. We are continuing to see the benefit of our consistent focus on improving operating efficiencies and our cost profile on this business. As previously disclosed, the year-to-date results also reflect a reduction on insurance reserves in the first quarter of the year due to favorable claims experience. Corporate expenses, excluding the items that Chris mentioned earlier, were $7.2 million in the quarter compared to $7.7 million a year ago. For the 9 months, expenses were $23.7 million compared to $22.8 million in the prior year. 
Now let me turn it back to Chris for some additional details on the quarter and the year-to-date performance."
1004106,138928660,157083,"ARAMARK Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 11, 2011",2011-08-11,"Earnings Calls","Aramark","Executives","Thanks, Fred. I'd like to comment on our financing capital structure and cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending July 1 was $1.083 billion, up from $1.079 billion at April 1, 2011 and up from $1.036 billion at October 1, 2010. It'",634,"Thanks, Fred. I'd like to comment on our financing capital structure and cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending July 1 was $1.083 billion, up from $1.079 billion at April 1, 2011 and up from $1.036 billion at October 1, 2010. It's worth pointing out that in conjunction with the successful sale in June of a noncontrolling interest in SeamlessWeb, we've classified Seamless as an unrestricted subsidiary, and therefore it is not being included in our July 1 adjusted EBITDA. We are very excited about the opportunities for Seamless in this new ownership structure, along with our partners from Spectrum Equity Investors. The business continues to grow quite rapidly, particularly in the consumer segment, and we expect total managed volume this year to reach nearly $400 million. Interest and other financing costs were $113 million for the third quarter compared to $109 million in the prior year, with this year's number including $2 million of expenses related to the revolver amendment and extension we completed in April. For the 9 months, interest and other financing costs were $315 million compared to $336 million in the prior year. The decrease is primarily driven by interest income of approximately $14 million recorded last quarter related to the settlement of U.K. VAT claims from prior years, as well as the $8 million of expense recorded in the second quarter of 2010 related to the credit agreement amendment and the term loan extension that we completed in March of 2010.
Total reported debt at the end of the third quarter was $5.851 billion. Our secured debt, as defined in our credit agreement, totaled $3.772 billion including a term loan balance of $3.310 billion and a revolver balance of $214 million. Our accounts receivable securitization facility had $211 million utilized at quarter end. We're continuing to enjoy a strong liquidity position with approximately $430 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility as of quarter end. Based on our trailing adjusted EBITDA, our secured debt ratio was 3.41x as of July 1, up modestly from 3.33x as of April 1, 2011 and 3.37x as of October 1, 2010. The slight increase in the ratio reflects utilization of the revolver to fund a portion of the dividend we paid in April, as well as the reclassification of the Seamless adjusted EBITDA.
Overall, we are pleased with our EBITDA growth and our ratio improved momentum, and we anticipate further ratio improvement over time. Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $60 million compared to $45 million in the prior year quarter. For the year-to-date, net capital expenditures totaled $180 million compared to $152 million last year as we make prudent investments in growth opportunities and in our infrastructure.
As expected and consistent with historical patterns, working capital was a use of cash for us during the first 9 months of our fiscal year. We are continuing to maintain a focus on working capital management as we move through the fourth quarter, which is our strongest seasonal period from a working capital and free cash flow standpoint.
For the year-to-date, we spent a total of $157 million on acquisitions compared to $84 million in the prior year period. This year's spending related primarily to the acquisition of Masterplan within our North American Healthcare business in March. We continue to evaluate and seek to make strategic investments in certain sectors and geographies, but we will be prudent and disciplined in the pursuit of these opportunities.
As previously mentioned, during the quarter, we sold a noncontrolling interest in our Seamless subsidiary, the leading provider of online and mobile food ordering to consumers and corporations in the U.S. Proceeds from the sale were used to reduce revolver borrowings in the quarter.
Now let me turn it back over to Fred."

Summing up our performance so far this fiscal year, our global Food and Support Services business has delivered solid organic growth with strong profit growth and improving margins. Our Uniform Rental business has also delivered strong profit growth in what is still a challenging pricing and unemployment environment. 
As we look forward, we'll be working to deliver improving organic growth rates and continued margin improvement. The economic environment remains somewhat unsettled as everyone knows, and will likely pose a challenge to certain sectors and countries more than others.
Overall, we continue to benefit from our portfolio of sectors, geographies and clients, which provide us with good balance, and we remain excited about the growth opportunities we see as we look across our businesses. We will continue to invest appropriately in the pursuit of these many opportunities in the months and years ahead while still managing our cost structure and cash flow in a disciplined manner.

One, as I mentioned, is we have an awful lot of flexibility in how we change our menu mix. And while we're seeing high single-digit growth overall, that growth is quite different by category, by product category. So we're taking advantage of that, number one. Number two, we are even more disciplined in an environment like this in making sure that we appropriately pass through price increases. Sometimes frankly, we're a bit timid to do that in view of the client relationship even when we have the contractual right to do that, and so we're spending a lot of time focusing on that. And then thirdly, and as we mentioned in earlier calls and as you saw in the quarter, we really believe we can -- that we will continue to have margin improvement opportunities, particularly in the food cost line and in the labor cost line, just through programs that drive more efficiency in both of those categories. And as I think we've mentioned earlier, we've undertaken a food and facility's wide initiative in both of those areas involving lots of folks and are in the process of rolling out programs that we think will continue to benefit us in the quarters to come."

Good afternoon, and thanks to all of you for joining us for our third quarter 2011 results call. As in prior quarters, I'd like to review our business and operating results, and then Chris will cover a few additional details on our performance. We're quite pleased with our results for the third quarter and for the year-to-date, as our businesses are delivering solid overall growth with improving margins. During the quarter, we generally saw the economic climate remain relatively stable but with a still somewhat cautious outlook. In this environment, our less economically sensitive businesses have delivered solid overall sales performance. Our growth in our more cyclical businesses has been generally more modest. We continue to see positive growth trends in certain of our sectors as a result of contributions from both base business and new business wins, and our pipeline of new business opportunities remains robust across the portfolio. We've remained focused on efficiently managing our operations and cost structure, and as evidenced by this quarter's solid margin improvement, we continue to successfully drive for opportunities to further enhance our operational efficiencies.
Now turning to our overall results for the third quarter. We achieved sales of $3.3 billion, up 7% from the prior year quarter. Organic sales growth, which as you know, excludes the impact of currency translations as well as acquisitions and divestitures, was up 3% in the quarter. Adjusted operating income was $153 million, up 17% from the prior year level. For the first 9 months of fiscal 2011, sales were $9.9 billion, up 5% over the prior year period and up 4% on an organic growth basis. Our adjusted operating income of $523 million was up 13% from the prior year.
Now turning to our North American Food and Support Services segment, third quarter reported sales were up 4% to $2.3 billion, but primarily by growth in the Education and Healthcare sectors, which offset sales declines in the Business and Industry and Sports and Entertainment sectors. Organic sales growth was 2% in the quarter, partly reflecting the normal seasonal change in our sales mix between our higher growing Education and Healthcare sectors and our typically lower growing business in Sports and Entertainment sectors. For the 9 months, reported sales were up 4% to $6.7 billion with organic growth of 3%. Year-to-date, performance was also led by solid growth in Education and in Healthcare.
Turning now to the sectors within North America. Our Business and Industry sector had low single-digit sales decline for the quarter and a low single-digit sales increase for the 9 months. Now the sector's quarterly sales decline was primarily due to the positive impact in last year's third quarter from our contract to provide support services for the Canadian security detail that served both the G8 and G20 meetings. Our Business Dining operations continued to extend the trends seen in the first part of the year, with low single-digit top line growth. We've seen some firming in volume despite limited employment growth and catering activity remains positive on a year-to-year basis. The Education sector had high single-digit sales growth for the quarter and for the 9 months, with growth in our Higher Education food business resulting from a good combination of solid base business growth and solid new sales from contract wins in prior periods.
In our Healthcare sector, we realized low double-digit sales growth for the quarter and mid-single-digit sales growth for the 9 months, driven both by the acquisition in March of Masterplan within our Clinical Technology Services business, as well as by solid base business growth across the sector. Our Sports and Entertainment sector had a low single-digit sales decline for the quarter and a mid-single-digit sales decline for the 9 months, as solid business -- base business growth in our NHL venues and in our stadiums was more than offset by the impact of prior year lost business, a reduced number of shows in our amphitheaters and sales in the prior year related to the Winter Olympics. Major League Baseball performance has been quite solid overall and somewhat higher per capita spending and attendance so far this year.
Adjusted operating income in the North American Food and Support Services segment increased by 17% in the quarter to $98 million, led by strong profit growth in Education and Healthcare, partially offset by modest declines in our Business and Industry and Sports and Entertainment sectors, with the G8 and G20 event in the prior year negatively affecting the profit comparison for the Business and Industry group in the quarter.
For the 9 months, segment adjusted operating income grew 13% to $371 million, again led by strong profit growth in Education and in Healthcare.
Now turning to the international Food and Support Services segment, third quarter reported sales of $698 million were up 18% from the prior year period, with organic sales growth of about 8%. Organic growth in the quarter was generally positive in most of our country operations. For the 9 months, reported sales were up 11% to $2 billion. Organic growth was 7%, led primarily by solid growth in Ireland, Germany, Chile, Argentina and China, which more than offset the sales decline in the U.K. and Korea. Third quarter adjusted operating income was $26 million, up 20% from the prior year, with currency translation contributing more than half the growth.
Results in the quarter primarily reflect solid performance in Germany and improving profit performance in the U.K., offsetting a profit decline in Chile. For the 9 months, adjusted operating income was $64 million, down modestly on a reported basis. Currency translation contributed approximately $3 million of the growth in comparison to the prior year, offset by a profit decline in Chile partly reflecting the impact of lost or closed business earlier in the year. In addition, a number of other items, including the gain on the sale of a noncore subsidiary in Chile, the receipt of VAT income in the U.K., a gain on the sale of land in Chile, severance-related charges on the write-down of goodwill related to our operations in India, all net to a reduction of approximately $3 million for the 9-month period. 
In our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, third quarter sales of $373 million were up 1% from the year-ago quarter on both on a reported and on an organic basis. For the 9-months period, segment sales of $1.1 billion were up 2% from the prior year on both the reported and organic basis. We are balancing an investment and additional sales resources to support and prove new sales growth with continuing to a maintained discipline in the pricing for new and retained Uniform Rental business. And we were pleased that the volume of new sales delivered in the quarter by our sales force exceeded the prior year's quarter result for the first time this year.
The segment's third quarter adjusted operating income was $37 million, up 9% compared to last year. And for the 9 months, adjusted operating income was $112 million, up 22% compared to last year. We are continuing to see the benefit of our consistent focus on improving operating efficiencies and our cost profile on this business. As previously disclosed, the year-to-date results also reflect a reduction on insurance reserves in the first quarter of the year due to favorable claims experience. Corporate expenses, excluding the items that Chris mentioned earlier, were $7.2 million in the quarter compared to $7.7 million a year ago. For the 9 months, expenses were $23.7 million compared to $22.8 million in the prior year. 
Now let me turn it back to Chris for some additional details on the quarter and the year-to-date performance."

I'd like to comment on our financing capital structure and cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending July 1 was $1.083 billion, up from $1.079 billion at April 1, 2011 and up from $1.036 billion at October 1, 2010. It'",634,"Thanks, Fred. I'd like to comment on our financing capital structure and cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending July 1 was $1.083 billion, up from $1.079 billion at April 1, 2011 and up from $1.036 billion at October 1, 2010. It's worth pointing out that in conjunction with the successful sale in June of a noncontrolling interest in SeamlessWeb, we've classified Seamless as an unrestricted subsidiary, and therefore it is not being included in our July 1 adjusted EBITDA. We are very excited about the opportunities for Seamless in this new ownership structure, along with our partners from Spectrum Equity Investors. The business continues to grow quite rapidly, particularly in the consumer segment, and we expect total managed volume this year to reach nearly $400 million. Interest and other financing costs were $113 million for the third quarter compared to $109 million in the prior year, with this year's number including $2 million of expenses related to the revolver amendment and extension we completed in April. For the 9 months, interest and other financing costs were $315 million compared to $336 million in the prior year. The decrease is primarily driven by interest income of approximately $14 million recorded last quarter related to the settlement of U.K. VAT claims from prior years, as well as the $8 million of expense recorded in the second quarter of 2010 related to the credit agreement amendment and the term loan extension that we completed in March of 2010.
Total reported debt at the end of the third quarter was $5.851 billion. Our secured debt, as defined in our credit agreement, totaled $3.772 billion including a term loan balance of $3.310 billion and a revolver balance of $214 million. Our accounts receivable securitization facility had $211 million utilized at quarter end. We're continuing to enjoy a strong liquidity position with approximately $430 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility as of quarter end. Based on our trailing adjusted EBITDA, our secured debt ratio was 3.41x as of July 1, up modestly from 3.33x as of April 1, 2011 and 3.37x as of October 1, 2010. The slight increase in the ratio reflects utilization of the revolver to fund a portion of the dividend we paid in April, as well as the reclassification of the Seamless adjusted EBITDA.
Overall, we are pleased with our EBITDA growth and our ratio improved momentum, and we anticipate further ratio improvement over time. Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $60 million compared to $45 million in the prior year quarter. For the year-to-date, net capital expenditures totaled $180 million compared to $152 million last year as we make prudent investments in growth opportunities and in our infrastructure.
As expected and consistent with historical patterns, working capital was a use of cash for us during the first 9 months of our fiscal year. We are continuing to maintain a focus on working capital management as we move through the fourth quarter, which is our strongest seasonal period from a working capital and free cash flow standpoint.
For the year-to-date, we spent a total of $157 million on acquisitions compared to $84 million in the prior year period. This year's spending related primarily to the acquisition of Masterplan within our North American Healthcare business in March. We continue to evaluate and seek to make strategic investments in certain sectors and geographies, but we will be prudent and disciplined in the pursuit of these opportunities.
As previously mentioned, during the quarter, we sold a noncontrolling interest in our Seamless subsidiary, the leading provider of online and mobile food ordering to consumers and corporations in the U.S. Proceeds from the sale were used to reduce revolver borrowings in the quarter.
Now let me turn it back over to Fred."

Summing up our performance so far this fiscal year, our global Food and Support Services business has delivered solid organic growth with strong profit growth and improving margins. Our Uniform Rental business has also delivered strong profit growth in what is still a challenging pricing and unemployment environment. 
As we look forward, we'll be working to deliver improving organic growth rates and continued margin improvement. The economic environment remains somewhat unsettled as everyone knows, and will likely pose a challenge to certain sectors and countries more than others.
Overall, we continue to benefit from our portfolio of sectors, geographies and clients, which provide us with good balance, and we remain excited about the growth opportunities we see as we look across our businesses. We will continue to invest appropriately in the pursuit of these many opportunities in the months and years ahead while still managing our cost structure and cash flow in a disciplined manner.

We ran a very discrete process with really talking to a leading group of growth equity investors, Spectrum being one of them, and through that process determined that Spectrum was the right partner for us given their experience and capabilities. And I think in the current structure, we're now much better positioned to attract and retain the kind of talent that a rapidly growing e-commerce business needs to be successful in terms of motivating and incenting the management team.

I'll begin broadly by discussing our 2011 performance and accomplishments before turning the call over to Fred and Chris who will detail our operating and financial results for you for the quarter and for the year.
I am pleased to report that during fiscal 2011, we delivered balanced growth in sales and profits, improved margins and produced another year of robust cash flow. And I would also like to thank all of our 250,000 team members around the world for their important contributions to these results.
Throughout the year, we continue to see somewhat uncertain economic climate in which less economically sensitive businesses delivered strong results, while growth in our most cyclical business was more modest. 
We also have another year of solid client retention, with 94% retention rates overall including a 95% rate in North America, which was consistent with our 2010 levels and our targets long term.  I am proud of our teams accomplishments throughout 2011.
In addition to our solid financial performance in our business momentum, we continue to position ARAMARK for future growth with important strategic investments in several of our higher growth and higher margin sectors in which we enjoy leadership positions.
In March, we acquired Masterplan, a large independent provider of clinical technology services and medical equipment parts to add to our Healthcare Clinical Technology Services business.  Further enhancing our position is the leading independent Clinical Technology Services provider in this attractive Healthcare segment. 
Later in the year, we also announced the acquisition of Filterfresh, which further broadens our service capabilities and solidifies our leading position in the national office refreshment services sector with this attractive growth and margin opportunities.
During the year, we also successfully repositioned Seamless, the leading online food ordering business in the U.S. by selling minority position to Spectrum Equity Investors, a leading player in the digital media and e-commerce sectors. 
This better positions Seamless to pursue continued robust growth and the rapidly expanding consumer segments for online and mobile phone ordering.
In September, we completed the repositioning of our Uniform segment with the divestiture of our non-core Galls subsidiary, streamlining our organizational structure and focusing on our core uniform business. 
In addition to other business accomplishments, we're also able to responsibly return cash to our shareholders for the first time since going private back in 2007 with minimal year-end effect on our capital structure.
Now a couple of comments on the 2011 financial results. For the full year fiscal 2011, reported sales was $13.1 billion, a 5% increase from 2010 with organic growth of 4%. 
Our adjusted operating income for the year was $719 million, up 12% versus 2010. Our global Food and Support Services business delivered solid organic growth with a strong profit growth and improving margins. 
Our Uniform Rental business also delivered strong profit growth in what continues to be a challenging pricing and unemployment environment.
I am pleased, but not yet satisfied, with these results and proud of the team for delivering them. As you can imagine, we have more to do in this year 2012. 
And now let me turn the call over to Fred for additional details on the quarter, as well as the year."

I'd like to first take you through our consolidated financial performance and then I'll discuss our business segments. 
We reported fiscal 2011 fourth quarter sales of $3.3 billion, which was up 6% from the prior year quarter results. Organic sales growth, which as you know excludes the impact of currency translation, acquisitions and divestitures, was up 3% for the quarter. Adjusted operating income was $196 million, up 11% for the prior year level. 
For the full year of fiscal 2011, sales were $13.1 billion, up 5% over the prior year period and up 4% on an organic growth basis. Our adjusted operating income of $719 million was up 12% from the prior year.
Now turning to our North America Food Support Services segment. Fourth quarter reported sales were up 4% to $2.3 billion, led primarily by growth in the Education and Healthcare sectors while sales in the Business and Industry and Sports and Entertainment sector were broadly flat versus the prior year-over-year. 
Organic sales growth was 2% in the quarter, partly reflecting in comparison to earlier quarters this year, the normal seasonal change in sales mix between our higher growing and lower growing sectors. 
For the full year, reported sales were up 4% to $9 billion with organic growth of 3%. Sales growth for the year was also led by solid growth in Education and Healthcare.
Turning now to the sectors within North America. Our business and industry overall sectors sales were somewhat up for the quarter and for the full year. This sector was led by our business dining operations which finished the year very much in line with the trends we've seen in recent quarters with low single-digit top line growth, driven primarily by base business growth. 
Our Refreshment Services business, led by office coffee services, also delivered solid growth in the quarter. 
The education sector had mid-single-digit sales growth for the quarter and high single-digit sales growth for the full year with strong growth in our higher education food and facilities business resulting from a good combination of base business growth and new sales from contract wins in the prior year.
In our Healthcare sector, we realized low double-digit sales growth for the quarter and high single-digit sales growth for the year, driven both by the acquisition in March of Masterplan within our Clinical Technology Services business as Joe mentioned earlier, as well as by solid base business growth across the sector. 
Sales in our Sports and Entertainment sector for the quarter were about equal the prior year while we saw low single-digit sales decline for the full year as solid base business growth in our NHL venues and then in our stadiums was more than offset by the impact of prior year loss business, a reduced number of shows in our amphitheaters and sales in the prior year related to the winter Olympics. 
In general, we have seen increased per capita spending and stable attendance level of this year across our stadiums and arenas.
Adjusted operating income in the North American food and Support Services segment was up 14% in the quarter to $143 million, led by strong profit growth in our Education and Healthcare sectors and solid profit growth of Sports and Entertainment. 
For the full year, our segment adjusted operating income grew 13% to $514 million, again led by strong profit growth in Education and Healthcare.
Now turning to the International Food Support Services segment. Fourth quarter reported sales of $676 million were up 15% from the prior year period, with organic sales growth of 9%. Organic growth in the quarter was generally positive in most of our country operations, with particularly strong contributions from Chile, Germany and Spain. 
For the full year, reported sales were up 12% to $2.7 billion. Organic growth was 8%, led primarily by strong growth in Chile, Germany, China, Ireland and Spain which more than offset sales decline in U.K. and Korea. 
Fourth quarter adjusted operating income was $27 million, up 41% from the prior year-over-year with currency translation contributing about 7 percentage points of growth.
Results from the quarter primary reflects strong turnaround in the U.K. and Ireland, along with solid profit growth in Chile, Germany and Spain. 
For the full year, adjusted operating income was $91 million, up 8% on a reported basis from $84 million in the prior year, led by solid profit growth in Germany.
Currency translation contributed approximately $4 million of the profit increase in the year, and in addition, as we mentioned in previous quarters, a number of other unusual items contributed the net reduction of approximately $3 million in income for the year. 
In our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, fourth quarter sales of $332 million were up 1% from the year-ago quarter as reported and about flat with our organic basis.  For the full year, segment sales of $1.3 billion were up 1% from the prior year on both a reported and organic basis. 
We're continuing to balance an investment and additional sales personnel resources to support future improved sales growth while maintaining discipline in pricing. We aren't gaining approved traction in our new sales efforts. During the fourth quarter, the volume of new sales delivered by our sales force significantly exceeded the prior year's quarter results.
The segment's fourth quarter adjusted operating income of $34 million was down 11% compared to last year, primarily as a result of restructuring expenses following our successful divestiture of our Galls subsidiary in September, which allowed us to further streamline our uniform group organizational structure and permanently reduce certain overhead costs. 
The profit in the quarter was also affected by the additional investments we made in growing our sales force, as well as year-over-year increases in fuel and fabric costs. 
For the full year, adjusted operating income was $146 million, up 10% compared to last year, reflecting our consistent long term focus on improving operating efficiencies and efficiency efforts in this business, allowing us to drive ongoing margin improvements.
Corporate expenses, which excludes the items Chris mentioned earlier, were $8.5 million in the quarter, compared to $7 million a year ago. For the year, expenses were $32.2 million compared to $29.8 million in the prior year. 
As we look at fiscal 2012, we anticipate another year of solid overall financial performance although we do expect some variability in quarter-to-quarter results. 
Now let me turn it back to Chris for some additional details in the quarter and the full year."

I'd like to comment on our financing capital structure and cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending September 30 was $1.10 billion, up from $1.083 billion at July 1, 2011, and up from $1.036 billion at October 1, 2010.",740,"Thanks Fred. I'd like to comment on our financing capital structure and cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending September 30 was $1.10 billion, up from $1.083 billion at July 1, 2011, and up from $1.036 billion at October 1, 2010. 
Interest and other financing costs were $111 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $109 million in the prior year. 
For the year, interest and other financing costs were $426 million, compared to $445 million in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by interest income of approximately $14 million recorded in the second quarter related to the settlement of U.K. VAT claims from prior years and the $8 million of expense recorded in the second quarter of 2010 related to that credit agreement amendment and term loan extension we completed in March of 2010.
Total ARAMARK Corp. reported debt at the end of the fourth quarter was $5.638 billion. Our secured debt, as defined in our credit agreement, totaled $3.565 billion including a term loan balance of $3.294 billion with no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. 
Our accounts receivable securitization facility had $226 million utilized at quarter end. We continue to enjoy a strong liquidity position with approximately $645 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility as of quarter end, as well as approximately $125 million in excess cash on hand, which we have utilized to help fund the Filterfresh acquisition and our seasonal working capital needs during the first quarter of fiscal 2012.
Based on our trailing adjusted EBITDA, our secured debt ratio was 3.17x as of September 30, down nicely from 3.41x as of July 1, 2011, and down from 3.37x as of October 1, 2010. 
Overall, we are pleased with our EBITDA growth during the quarter and the year and our resulting ratio improvement. And we anticipate continued ratio momentum over time.
Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $92 million, compared to $112 million in the prior year quarter. 
For the full year, net capital expenditures totaled $272 million, compared to $264 million last year as we continue to prudently manage investments and growth opportunities and in our infrastructure.
Given certain investment priorities in our infrastructure and our sales growth objectives in 2012, we do anticipate somewhat more of an increase in net capital expenditures this coming fiscal year.
Consistent with our expectations and historical patterns, working capital was a significant source of cash for us during the fourth quarter, allowing us to end the year as expected with working capital as a relatively moderate use of cash overall when excluding the effect of related to certain divestiture transactions. We would anticipate a similar moderate level of investment in working capital during fiscal 2012.
For the full year, we are pleased with our solid free cash flow performance before acquisitions and divestitures as we generated approximately $250 million of free cash flow in fiscal 2011 at ARAMARK Corp. A total that exceeded our plan and reflects solid growth in operating income, as well as our CapEx and working capital discipline. 
For the full year, we spent a total of $157 million on acquisitions, compared to $86 million in the prior year. This year's spending related primarily to the acquisition of Masterplan within our North American Healthcare sector in March. 
We continue to evaluate and seek to make strategic investments in certain sectors and geographies, such as the previously disclosed acquisition of the Filterfresh Office Coffee Service business, but we will be prudent and disciplined in the pursuit of these opportunities.
As Joe mentioned, during the fourth quarter, we also completed the sale of our non-core Galls subsidiary using the proceeds to reduce our net debt at year end. 
As we have previously committed, it's very important to us that ARAMARK maintains a strong financial position and the various acquisitions we have made recently along with the dividend earlier this year needed to fit within these guidelines. We are pleased that our operating and cash flow performance in 2011 has allowed us as intended to end the year with a total debt ratio when including the debt of that holdings that is only slightly above the prior year's level. And as a mentioned earlier, our cash on hand at year-end covered a significant majority of the Filterfresh purchase, which we closed in early October. 
Now let me turn the call over to Joe to wrap up."

While certain businesses and countries will be more challenged than others, the diversity of our sectors, clients and geographies provide us with a good balance to continue to mitigate those challenges and grow our company.
Finally, we would look to build on the momentum of 2011 and the efforts of our teams around the globe as we work towards our ambition of making one ARAMARK the most valued client partner, the most efficient operator and the company with the most engaged team of people. As we pursuit of these worthy goals, you can be sure that we will continue to invest prudently in pursuit of growth while managing our cost structure and cash flow in a disciplined manner.
Thank you again for your time this afternoon and for your continued support of ARAMARK. We'll now be happy to take any questions that you might have."

I think and we talked about the portfolios and the sectors having a different fundamentals in terms of level outsourcing and just the rate of growth achievable in each and so we've been continuing to increase the level of new sales resources, for example, in Healthcare and Education because in both food and facilities, large portions of these markets continue to be self operated compared to business, which is largely considered fully outsourced, really on the food side. And the same thing, broadly speaking, with respect to major league sports. So both the underlying fundamentals, demographics and level of outsourcing I think will continue to drive disparities between growth in Education and Healthcare versus growth in BNI and SNE over time. Obviously, if we do at some point see a stronger economic tailwind, but we would certainly anticipate BNI and SNE to benefit from that, but we are not counting on it."

We've streamlined the business through the integration of WearGuard, our direct sales operations into our larger ARAMARK uniform services rental business and we have divested Galls, so we have one streamlined monolithic rental in sales organization that competes nationally, competes very well. So the outlook for the business actually is we think is bright. We think our growth rates will improve as we move through the year as I mentioned earlier because we have successfully ramping up our sales force. We have a number of profitability initiatives underway in that business similar to what was referred to by Joe in the Food and Facilities business and we think there's more efficiencies to be gained over the next 12 to 18 months through those programs and the management there is very focused on driving both improved rate of new sales and continuing efficiency. And so we feel very good about the business and we think the outlook is foreign and bright."

I'll begin broadly by discussing our 2011 performance and accomplishments before turning the call over to Fred and Chris, who will detail our operating and financial results for you for the quarter and for the year.
I'm pleased to report that during fiscal 2011, we delivered balanced growth in sales and profits, improved margins and produced another year of robust cash flow. And I would also like to thank all of our 250,000 team members around the world for their important contributions to these results.
Throughout the year, we continue to see a somewhat uncertain economic climate in which our less economically sensitive businesses delivered strong results, while growth in our more cyclical business was more modest. We also have another year of solid client retention, with 94% retention rate overall, including a 95% rate in North America, which was consistent with our 2010 levels and our targets long-term. I'm proud of our teams accomplishments throughout 2011.
In addition to our solid financial performance in our business momentum, we continue to position ARAMARK for future growth with important tradition -- strategic investments in several of our higher growth and higher margin sectors in which we enjoy leadership positions. 
In March, we acquired Masterplan, a large independent provider of clinical technology services and medical equipment parts to add to our Healthcare Clinical Technology Services business.  Further enhancing our position is the leading independent Clinical Technology Services provider in this attractive Healthcare segment. 
Later in the year, we also announced the acquisition of Filterfresh, which further broadens our service capabilities and solidifies our leading position in the national office refreshment services sector with this attractive growth and margin opportunities.
During the year, we also successfully repositioned Seamless, the leading online food ordering business in the U.S. by selling minority position to Spectrum Equity Investors, a leading player in the digital media and e-commerce sectors. This better positions Seamless to pursue continued robust growth in the rapidly expanding consumer segments for online and mobile phone ordering.
In September, we completed the repositioning of our Uniform segment, with the divestiture of our non-core Galls subsidiary, streamlining our organizational structure and focusing on our core Uniform business. 
In addition to other business accomplishments, we're also able to responsibly return cash to our shareholders for the first time since going private back in 2007, with minimal year end effect on our capital structure.
Now a couple of comments on the 2001 (sic) [2011] financial results. For the full year fiscal 2011, reported sales were $13.1 billion, a 5% increase from 2010, with organic growth of 4%. Our adjusted operating income for the year was $719 million, up 12% versus 2010. 
Our Global Food and Support Services business delivered solid organic growth, with a strong profit growth and improving margins. Our Uniform Rental business also delivered strong profit growth in what continues to be a challenging pricing and unemployment environment.
I am pleased, but not yet satisfied, with these results and proud of the teams for delivering them. As you can imagine, we have more to do in this year 2012. 
And now, let me turn the call over to Fred for additional details on the quarter, as well as the year."

I'd like to first take you through our consolidated financial performance, and then I'll discuss our business segments. 
We reported fiscal 2011 fourth quarter sales of $3.3 billion, which was up 6% from the prior year quarter results. Organic sales growth which, as you know, excludes the impact of currency translation, acquisitions and divestitures, was up 3% for the quarter. Adjusted operating income was $196 million, up 11% for the prior year level. 
For the full year of fiscal 2011, sales were $13.1 billion, up 5% over the prior year period and up 4% on an organic growth basis. Our adjusted operating income of $719 million was up 12% from the prior year.
Now turning to our North American Food and Support Services segment. Fourth quarter reported sales were up 4% to $2.3 billion, led primarily by growth to the Education and Healthcare sectors, while sales in the Business and Industry and Sports and Entertainment sector were broadly flat versus the prior year. Organic sales growth was 2% in the quarter, partly reflecting in comparison to earlier quarters this year the normal seasonal change in sales mix between our higher growing and lower growing sectors. For the full year, reported sales were up 4% to $9 billion, with organic growth of 3%. Sales growth for the year was also led by solid growth in Education and Healthcare.
Turning now to the sectors within North America. Our Business and Industry overall sector sales were somewhat up for the quarter and for the full year. This sector was led by our business dining operations, which finished the year very much in line with the trends we've seen in recent quarters with low single-digit top line growth, driven primarily by base business growth. 
Our Refreshment Services business, led by office coffee services, also delivered solid growth in the quarter. 
The Education sector had mid single-digit sales growth for the quarter and high single-digit sales growth for the full year, with strong growth in our higher education food and facilities business, resulting from a good combination of base business growth and new sales from contract wins in the prior year.
In our Healthcare sector, we realized low double-digit sales growth for the quarter and high single-digit sales growth for the year, driven both by the acquisition in March of Masterplan within our Clinical Technology Services business, as Joe mentioned earlier, as well as by solid base business growth across the sector. 
Sales in our Sports and Entertainment sector for the quarter were about equal to prior year, while we saw low single-digit sales decline for the full year as solid base business growth in our NHL venues and in our stadiums was more than offset by the impact of prior year loss business, a reduced number of shows in our amphitheaters and sales in the prior year related to the Winter Olympics. In general, we have seen increased per capita spending and stable attendance level for this year across our stadiums and arenas.
Adjusted operating income in the North American Food and Support Services segment was up 14% in the quarter to $143 million, led by strong profit growth in our Education and Healthcare sectors, and solid profit growth for the Sports and Entertainment. For the full year, our segment adjusted operating income grew 13% to $514 million, again led by strong profit growth in Education and Healthcare.
Now turning to the International Food and Support Services segment. Fourth quarter reported sales of $676 million were up 15% from the prior year period, with organic sales growth of 9%. Organic growth in the quarter was generally positive in most of our country operations, with particularly strong contributions from Chile, Germany and Spain. 
For the full year, reported sales were up 12% to $2.7 billion. Organic growth was 8%, led primarily by strong growth in Chile, Germany, China, Ireland and Spain, which more than offset sales decline in U.K. and Korea. 
Fourth quarter adjusted operating income was $27 million, up 41% from the prior year, with currency translation contributing about 7 percentage points of growth. Results from the quarter primary reflects strong turnaround performance in the U.K. and Ireland, along with solid profit growth in Chile, Germany and Spain. For the full year, adjusted operating income was $91 million, up 8% on a reported basis from $84 million in the prior year, led by solid profit growth in Germany.
Currency translation contributed approximately $4 million to the profit increase in the year. And in addition, as we mentioned in previous quarters, a number of other unusual items contributed the net reduction of approximately $3 million in income for the year. 
In our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, fourth quarter sales of $332 million were up 1% from the year ago quarter as reported, and about flat on organic basis.  For the full year, segment sales of $1.3 billion were up 1% from the prior year on both a reported and organic basis. 
We're continuing to balance an investment and additional sales personnel resources to support future improved sales growth while maintaining discipline in pricing. We are gaining improved traction in our new sales efforts. During the fourth quarter, the volume of new sales delivered by our sales force significantly exceeded the prior year's quarter results.
The segment's fourth quarter adjusted operating income of $34 million was down 11% compared to last year, primarily as a result of restructuring expenses following our successful divestiture of our Galls subsidiary in September, which allowed us to further streamline our Uniform group organizational structure and permanently reduce certain overhead costs. The profit in the quarter was also affected by the additional investments we made in growing our sales force, as well as year-over-year increases in fuel and fabric costs. 
For the full year, adjusted operating income was $146 million, up 10% compared to last year, reflecting our consistent long-term focus on improving operating efficiencies and our efficiency efforts in this business, allowing us to drive ongoing margin improvements.
Corporate expenses, which exclude the items Chris mentioned earlier, were $8.5 million in the quarter compared to $7 million a year ago. For the year, expenses were $32.2 million compared to $29.8 million in the prior year. 
As we look at fiscal 2012, we anticipate another year of solid overall financial performance, although we do expect some variability in quarter-to-quarter results. 
Now let me turn it back over to Chris for some additional details in the quarter and the full year."

I'd like to comment on our financing capital structure and cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending September 30 was $1.10 billion, up from $1.083 billion at July 1, 2011, and up from $1.036 billion at October 1, 2010",741,"Thanks, Fred. I'd like to comment on our financing capital structure and cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending September 30 was $1.10 billion, up from $1.083 billion at July 1, 2011, and up from $1.036 billion at October 1, 2010. 
Interest and other financing costs were $111 million for the fourth quarter compared to $109 million in the prior year. For the year, interest and other financing costs were $426 million compared to $445 million in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by interest income of approximately $14 million recorded in the second quarter related to the settlement of U.K. VAT claims from prior years, and the $8 million of expense recorded in the second quarter of 2010 related to the credit agreement amendment and term loan extension we completed in March of 2010.
Total ARAMARK Corp. reported debt at the end of the fourth quarter was $5.638 billion. Our secured debt, as defined in our credit agreement, totaled $3.565 billion, including a term loan balance of $3.294 billion with no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Our accounts receivable securitization facility had $226 million utilized at quarter end. 
We continue to enjoy a strong liquidity position, with approximately $645 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility as of quarter end, as well as approximately $125 million in excess cash on hand, which we have utilized to help fund the Filterfresh acquisition and our seasonal working capital needs during the first quarter of fiscal 2012.
Based on our trailing adjusted EBITDA, our secured debt ratio was 3.17x as of September 30, down nicely from 3.41x as of July 1, 2011, and down from 3.37x as of October 1, 2010. Overall, we are pleased with our EBITDA growth during the quarter and the year and our resulting ratio improvement. And we anticipate continued ratio momentum over time.
Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $92 million compared to $112 million in the prior year quarter. For the full year, net capital expenditures totaled $272 million compared to $264 million last year, as we continue to prudently manage investments and growth opportunities and in our infrastructure. Given certain investment priorities in our infrastructure and our sales growth objectives in 2012, we do anticipate somewhat more of an increase in net capital expenditures this coming fiscal year.
Consistent with our expectations and historical patterns, working capital was a significant source of cash for us during the fourth quarter, allowing us to end the year as expected with working capital as a relatively moderate use of cash overall when excluding the effect of related to certain divestiture transactions. We would anticipate a similar moderate level of investment in working capital during fiscal 2012.
For the full year, we are pleased with our solid free cash flow performance before acquisitions and divestitures as we generated approximately $250 million of free cash flow in fiscal 2011 at ARAMARK Corp. -- a total that exceeded our plan and reflects our solid growth in operating income, as well as our CapEx and working capital discipline. 
For the full year, we spent a total of $157 million on acquisitions compared to $86 million in the prior year. This year's spending related primarily to the acquisition of Masterplan within our North American Healthcare sector in March. 
We continue to evaluate and seek to make strategic investments in certain sectors and geographies, such as the previously disclosed acquisition of the Filterfresh office coffee service business, but we will be prudent and disciplined in the pursuit of these opportunities. As Joe mentioned, during the fourth quarter, we also completed the sale of our non-core Galls subsidiary, using the proceeds to reduce our net debt at year end. 
As we have previously committed, it's very important to us that ARAMARK maintains a strong financial position, and the various acquisitions we have made recently along with the dividend earlier this year needed to fit within these guideline. We are pleased that our operating and cash flow performance in 2011 has allowed us, as intended, to end the year with a total debt ratio, when including the debt of Holdings that is only slightly above the prior year's level. And as I mentioned earlier, our cash on hand at year end covered a significant majority of the Filterfresh purchase, which we closed in early October. 
Now let me turn the call back to Joe to wrap-up."

I think and we talked about the portfolio and the sectors having really different fundamentals in terms of level of outsourcing and just the rate of growth achievable in each.

So both the underlying fundamentals, demographics and level of outsourcing, I think, will continue to drive disparities between growth in Education and Healthcare versus growth in B&I and S&E over time.

And the growth -- if you look overall at our growth in the fourth quarter in international, it was really driven outside of the traditional countries, traditional European countries. So we're seeing very high growth rates in Chile, Argentina, Peru, Colombia. Much of that is tied to mining.

As you know, we're the second largest company in the business. It's been a great business for us. I think if you look at the results for 2011, you'll see that we've improved the profitability in the business quite a bit. We've streamlined the business through the integration of WearGuard, direct sale operations into our larger ARAMARK uniform services rental business and we've divested Galls. So we have one streamlined monolithic rental in sales organization that competes nationally, competes very well. So the outlook for the business actually is we think is bright. We think our growth rates will improve as we move through the year, as I mentioned earlier, because we have -- are successfully ramping up our sales force. We have a number of profitability initiatives underway in that business similar to what was referred to by Joe in the food and facilities business, and we think there's more efficiencies to be gained over the next 12 to 18 months through those programs. And the management there is very focused on driving both improved rate of new sales and continuing efficiency. And so we feel very good about the business always [ph] and you think the outlook is -- for it is bright."

I'll begin broadly by discussing our 2011 performance and accomplishments before turning the call over to Fred and Chris, who will detail our operating and financial results for you for the quarter and for the year.
I'm pleased to report that during fiscal 2011, we delivered balanced growth in sales and profits, improved margins and produced another year of robust cash flow. And I would also like to thank all of our 250,000 team members around the world for their important contributions to these results.
Throughout the year, we continue to see a somewhat uncertain economic climate in which our less economically sensitive businesses delivered strong results, while growth in our more cyclical business was more modest. We also had another year of solid client retention, with 94% retention rate overall, including a 95% rate in North America, which was consistent with our 2010 levels and our targets long-term. I'm proud of our teams accomplishments throughout 2011.
In addition to our solid financial performance and our business momentum, we continue to position ARAMARK for future growth with important tradition -- strategic investments in several of our higher growth and higher margin sectors in which we enjoy leadership positions. 
In March, we acquired Masterplan, a large independent provider of clinical technology services and medical equipment parts to add to our Healthcare Clinical Technology Services business.  Further enhancing our position is the leading independent Clinical Technology Services provider in this attractive Healthcare segment. 
Later in the year, we also announced the acquisition of Filterfresh, which further broadens our service capabilities and solidifies our leading position in the national office refreshment services sector with this attractive growth in margin opportunities.
During the year, we also successfully repositioned Seamless, the leading online food ordering business in the U.S. by selling minority position to Spectrum Equity Investors, a leading player in the digital media and e-commerce sectors. This better positions Seamless to pursue continued robust growth in the rapidly expanding consumer segments for online and mobile phone ordering.
In September, we completed the repositioning of our Uniform segment, with the divestiture of our non-core Galls subsidiary, streamlining our organizational structure and focusing on our core Uniform business. 
In addition to other business accomplishments, we're also able to responsibly return cash to our shareholders for the first time since going private back in 2007, with minimal year end effect on our capital structure.
Now a couple of comments on the 2001 (sic) [2011] financial results. For the full year fiscal 2011, reported sales were $13.1 billion, a 5% increase from 2010, with organic growth of 4%. Our adjusted operating income for the year was $719 million, up 12% versus 2010. 
Our Global Food and Support Services business delivered solid organic growth, with a strong profit growth and improving margins. Our Uniform Rental business also delivered strong profit growth in what continues to be a challenging pricing and unemployment environment.
I am pleased, but not yet satisfied, with these results and proud of the teams for delivering them. As you can imagine, we have more to do in this year 2012. 
And now, let me turn the call over to Fred for additional details on the quarter, as well as the year."

I'd like to first take you through our consolidated financial performance, and then I'll discuss our business segments. We reported fiscal 2011 fourth quarter sales of $3.3 billion, which was up 6% from the prior year quarter results. Organ",1082,"Thanks, Joe. I'd like to first take you through our consolidated financial performance, and then I'll discuss our business segments. 
We reported fiscal 2011 fourth quarter sales of $3.3 billion, which was up 6% from the prior year quarter results. Organic sales growth which, as you know, excludes the impact of currency translation, acquisitions and divestitures, was up 3% for the quarter. Adjusted operating income was $196 million, up 11% from the prior year level. 
For the full year of fiscal 2011, sales were $13.1 billion, up 5% over the prior year period and up 4% on an organic growth basis. Our adjusted operating income of $719 million was up 12% from the prior year.
Now turning to our North American Food and Support Services segment. Fourth quarter reported sales were up 4% to $2.3 billion, led primarily by growth in the Education and Healthcare sectors, while sales in the Business and Industry and Sports and Entertainment sector were broadly flat versus the prior year. Organic sales growth was 2% in the quarter, partly reflecting in comparison to earlier quarters this year the normal seasonal change in sales mix between our higher growing and lower growing sectors. For the full year, reported sales were up 4% to $9 billion, with organic growth of 3%. Sales growth for the year was also led by solid growth in Education and Healthcare.
Turning now to the sectors within North America. Our Business and Industry overall sector sales were somewhat up for the quarter and for the full year. This sector was led by our Business Dining operations, which finished the year very much in line with the trends we've seen in recent quarters with low single-digit top line growth, driven primarily by base business growth. 
Our Refreshment Services business, led by office coffee services, also delivered solid growth in the quarter. 
The Education sector had mid single-digit sales growth for the quarter and high single-digit sales growth for the full year, with strong growth in our higher education food and facilities business, resulting from a good combination of base business growth and new sales from contract wins in the prior year.
In our Healthcare sector, we realized low double-digit sales growth for the quarter and high single-digit sales growth for the year, driven both by the acquisition in March of Masterplan within our Clinical Technology Services business, as Joe mentioned earlier, as well as by solid base business growth across the sector. 
Sales in our Sports and Entertainment sector for the quarter were about equal to prior year, while we saw low single-digit sales decline for the full year as solid base business growth in our NHL venues and in our stadiums was more than offset by the impact of prior year loss business, a reduced number of shows in our amphitheaters and sales in the prior year related to the Winter Olympics. In general, we have seen increased per capita spending and stable attendance level this year across our stadiums and arenas.
Adjusted operating income in the North American Food and Support Services segment was up 14% in the quarter to $143 million, led by strong profit growth in our Education and Healthcare sectors, and solid profit growth in Sports and Entertainment. For the full year, our segment adjusted operating income grew 13% to $514 million, again led by strong profit growth in Education and Healthcare.
Now turning to the International Food and Support Services segment. Fourth quarter reported sales of $676 million were up 15% from the prior year period, with organic sales growth of 9%. Organic growth in the quarter was generally positive in most of our country operations, with particularly strong contributions from Chile, Germany and Spain. 
For the full year, reported sales were up 12% to $2.7 billion. Organic growth was 8%, led primarily by strong growth in Chile, Germany, China, Ireland and Spain, which more than offset a sales decline in U.K. and Korea. 
Fourth quarter adjusted operating income was $27 million, up 41% from the prior year, with currency translation contributing about 7 percentage points of growth. Results in the quarter primary reflects strong turnaround performance in the U.K. and Ireland, along with solid profit growth in Chile, Germany and Spain. For the full year, adjusted operating income was $91 million, up 8% on a reported basis from $84 million in the prior year, led by solid profit growth in Germany.
Currency translation contributed approximately $4 million of the profit increase in the year. And in addition, as we mentioned in previous quarters, a number of other unusual items contributed a net reduction of approximately $3 million in income for the year. 
In our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, fourth quarter sales of $332 million were up 1% from the year ago quarter as reported, and about flat on an organic basis.  For the full year, segment sales of $1.3 billion were up 1% from the prior year on both a reported and organic basis. 
We're continuing to balance an investment and additional sales personnel resources to support future improved sales growth while maintaining discipline in pricing. We are gaining improved traction in our new sales efforts. During the fourth quarter, the volume of new sales delivered by our sales force significantly exceeded the prior year's quarter results.
The segment's fourth quarter adjusted operating income of $34 million was down 11% compared to last year, primarily as a result of restructuring expenses following our successful divestiture of our Galls subsidiary in September, which allowed us to further streamline our Uniform group organizational structure and permanently reduce certain overhead costs. The profit in the quarter was also affected by the additional investments we made in growing our sales force, as well as year-over-year increases in fuel and fabric costs. 
For the full year, adjusted operating income was $146 million, up 10% compared to last year, reflecting our consistent long-term focus on improving operating efficiencies and our efficiency efforts in this business, allowing us to drive ongoing margin improvements.
Corporate expenses, which exclude the items Chris mentioned earlier, were $8.5 million in the quarter compared to $7 million a year ago. For the year, expenses were $32.2 million compared to $29.8 million in the prior year. 
As we look at fiscal 2012, we anticipate another year of solid overall financial performance, although we do expect some variability in quarter-to-quarter results. 
Now let me turn it back over to Chris for some additional details in the quarter and the full year."

I'd like to comment on our financing capital structure and cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending September 30 was $1.10 billion, up from $1.083 billion at July 1, 2011, and up from $1.036 billion at October 1, 2010",740,"Thanks, Fred. I'd like to comment on our financing capital structure and cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending September 30 was $1.10 billion, up from $1.083 billion at July 1, 2011, and up from $1.036 billion at October 1, 2010. 
Interest and other financing costs were $111 million for the fourth quarter compared to $109 million in the prior year. For the year, interest and other financing costs were $426 million compared to $445 million in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by interest income of approximately $14 million recorded in the second quarter related to the settlement of U.K. VAT claims from prior years, and the $8 million of expense recorded in the second quarter of 2010 related to the credit agreement amendment and term loan extension we completed in March of 2010.
Total ARAMARK Corp. reported debt at the end of the fourth quarter was $5.638 billion. Our secured debt, as defined in our credit agreement, totaled $3.565 billion, including a term loan balance of $3.294 billion with no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Our accounts receivable securitization facility had $226 million utilized at quarter end. 
We continue to enjoy a strong liquidity position, with approximately $645 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility as of quarter end, as well as approximately $125 million in excess cash on hand, which we have utilized to help fund the Filterfresh acquisition and our seasonal working capital needs during the first quarter of fiscal 2012.
Based on our trailing adjusted EBITDA, our secured debt ratio was 3.17x as of September 30, down nicely from 3.41x as of July 1, 2011, and down from 3.37x as of October 1, 2010. Overall, we are pleased with our EBITDA growth during the quarter and the year and our resulting ratio improvement. And we anticipate continued ratio momentum over time.
Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $92 million compared to $112 million in the prior year quarter. For the full year, net capital expenditures totaled $272 million compared to $264 million last year, as we continue to prudently manage investments in growth opportunities and in our infrastructure. Given certain investment priorities in our infrastructure and our sales growth objectives in 2012, we do anticipate somewhat more of an increase in net capital expenditures this coming fiscal year.
Consistent with our expectations and historical patterns, working capital was a significant source of cash for us during the fourth quarter, allowing us to end the year as expected with working capital as a relatively moderate use of cash overall when excluding the effect related to certain divestiture transactions. We would anticipate a similar moderate level of investment in working capital during fiscal 2012.
For the full year, we are pleased with our solid free cash flow performance before acquisitions and divestitures as we generated approximately $250 million of free cash flow in fiscal 2011 at ARAMARK Corp. -- a total that exceeded our plan and reflects our solid growth in operating income, as well as our CapEx and working capital discipline. 
For the full year, we spent a total of $157 million on acquisitions compared to $86 million in the prior year. This year's spending related primarily to the acquisition of Masterplan within our North American Healthcare sector in March. 
We continue to evaluate and seek to make strategic investments in certain sectors and geographies, such as the previously disclosed acquisition of the Filterfresh office coffee service business, but we will be prudent and disciplined in the pursuit of these opportunities. As Joe mentioned, during the fourth quarter, we also completed the sale of our non-core Galls subsidiary, using the proceeds to reduce our net debt at year end. 
As we have previously committed, it's very important to us that ARAMARK maintains a strong financial position, and the various acquisitions we have made recently along with the dividend earlier this year needed to fit within this guideline. We are pleased that our operating and cash flow performance in 2011 has allowed us, as intended, to end the year with a total debt ratio, when including the debt at Holdings that is only slightly above the prior year's level. And as I mentioned earlier, our cash on hand at year end covered a significant majority of the Filterfresh purchase, which we closed in early October. 
Now let me turn the call back to Joe to wrap-up."

We believe we still have significant opportunities to enhance and standardize our processes across the business, bringing efficiencies, clarity and improved effectiveness to how we serve our clients and customers every day around the world.
During 2012, we are planning to make further progress along this journey of process standardization, which we believe will help us to drive ongoing growth and margin improvements. 
Despite a persistently uncertain economic environment, we continue to remain excited about the growth opportunities we see across our portfolio businesses. While certain businesses and countries will be more challenged than others, the diversity of our sectors, clients and geographies provide us with a good balance to continue to mitigate those challenges and grow our company.
Finally, we will look to build on the momentum of 2011 and the efforts of our teams around the globe as we work towards our ambition of making one ARAMARK the most valued client partner, the most efficient operator and the company with the most engaged team of people.

As you know, we're the second largest company in the business. It's been a great business for us. I think if you look at the results for 2011, you'll see that we've improved the profitability in the business quite a bit. We've streamlined the business through the integration of WearGuard, direct sale operations into our larger ARAMARK uniform services rental business and we've divested Galls. So we have one streamlined monolithic rental and sales organization that competes nationally, competes very well. So the outlook for the business actually is, we think is bright. We think our growth rates will improve as we move through the year, as I mentioned earlier, because we have -- are successfully ramping up our sales force. We have a number of profitability initiatives underway in that business similar to what was referred to by Joe in the food and facilities business, and we think there's more efficiencies to be gained over the next 12 to 18 months through those programs. And the management there is very focused on driving both improved rate of new sales and continuing efficiency. And so we feel very good about the business always [ph] and you think the outlook is -- for it is bright."
