Please turn to Slide #4. 
We are off to a great start for fiscal 2011. For the quarter, sales of $2.4 billion were $10% higher versus prior year on growth in our Electronics and Performance Materials, Tonnage and Merchant segments. Underlying sales increased 11% on 10% higher volumes and 1% higher pricing. Sequentially, sales were higher 2%. Underlying sales were up 1% on higher pricing in Merchant Gases and our Electronics and Performance Materials segments. Volumes were flat mainly due to seasonality. Operating income of $404 million increased 17% from prior year on higher volumes. Our operating margin improved to 16.9%, up 100 basis points versus prior year. We are on track to deliver on our 70% goal for fiscal 2011.
Equity affiliate income was up slightly versus prior year. Improved volumes and cost performance were partially offset by a charge for the anticipated sale of a plant in one of our affiliates. Absent this loss, sequential equity affiliate income would have been slightly higher. 
As we've seen in prior years, our tax rate in quarter one was lower than our expected average rate for the full year due to the timing of certain tax credits and adjustments. We still expect our full year tax rate to be consistent with the 25% and 26% guidance range given last quarter.
For the quarter, net income increased 17% and diluted earnings per share increased by 16%, each versus prior year. Return on capital employed for the quarter improved to 13.2%, up 140 basis points.
Turning to Slide 5 for a review of the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.19. Higher volumes in electronics and Performance Materials, tonnage and merchant segments increased earnings per share by $0.25, year-on-year. The impact of pricing combined with energy and raw material costs netted to zero. Costs were $0.02 unfavorable as our productivity gains were more than offset by higher operating and distribution costs. Currency translation and foreign exchange netted to a $0.02 unfavorable impact. And higher non-controlling interest and shares outstanding cost us $0.01 each. In summary, a very good start to the year at the top end of our expectations. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Simon to review our business segment results. Simon?"

Underlying sales improved by 8% on increased volumes and higher pricing. Currency reduced sales by 2%. Year-on-year sales improvement was driven by very strong Asia growth and improving volumes in North America and Europe liquid bulk products. Sequentially, sales were up 4%, primarily due to currency. Underlying sales were up 1%. 
Merchant Gases operating income of $201 million was up 6% versus prior year and up 8% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 20.3% was flat versus prior year and up 80 basis points sequentially. Sequential margins expanded driven by improved pricing across all regions.
During the quarter, we announced the construction of four new projects in India through our INOX Air Products joint venture. Three new merchant air separation units will provide efficient and reliable supply for the strong growth opportunities we are seeing in India. The fourth project will be a piggyback ASU and hydrogen plant to supply glasses to St. Cobain's India and liquid products for the merchant market. This investment strengthened INOX's the margin prices throughout India. Also during the quarter, we brought China's first air separation unit utilizing LNG coal energy on stream. This JV with Chinook, the China national offshore oil company will provide a low-cost supplier of over 600 tons of oxygen, nitrogen and argon to supply a fast-growing industrial gases market in Fujian. 
Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to Slide 7.
In North America, sales improved 6% versus prior year, the largest increase we have seen in over two years. Volumes were up 3% in growth and liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon. Pricing was up 3% with increases across the portfolio. This was the highest increase in the last seven quarters. plant loading remained in the mid-70s. 
In Europe, underlying sales increased 2%, but negative 6% currency reduced overall sales to a negative 4%. Volumes were up 3% with stronger liquid bulk growth tempered by lower packaged gas improvement and lower healthcare volumes. Pricing was down 1% with positive packaged gas pricing, offset by unfavorable healthcare and liquid bulk pricing. Our Europe plant loading remained in the low 80s. 
In Asia, sales were up 35% versus last year with underlying sales up 30%. Volumes were up 25% with strength across all products. Pricing was also strong, up 5%. Pricing was stronger in part due to the spot argon in China, has rolling power curtailments reduced steel companies' self-generated argon. pricing across Asia was up 2%. These sales and volume increases were the highest in over four years. Plant loadings remained in the high 80s. We will continue to bring new capacity onstream over the next few quarters.
Please turn to Slide 8, Tonnage Gases. Tonnage Gases sales of $766 million increased 10% versus last year with volumes up 12%. Higher volumes came from loading existing assets and new brands put on stream for the last year. Sequentially, sales were up 2% with volumes up 5% and energy and raw material pass-through increasing sales by 4%. Volume growth was driven by new plants. 
Operating income of $116 million was up 15% versus prior year, primarily due to higher volumes from new plant startups, reduced maintenance costs and improved plant efficiency. Operating margin of 15.1% increased 70 basis points versus prior year due to the lower costs mentioned previously and lower natural gas costs pass-through. Sequentially, operating income was down 1%, and margins declined due to higher maintenance costs. 
Earlier in the quarter, we announced that our heartland hydrogen pipeline in Alberta, Canada has been commercialized. And we announced two new pipelines hydrogen supply contracts with Dow Chemical Canada and Canada. We also announced the new nitrogen plant at the Isle of LNG terminal in the United Kingdom. This is our third plant to the facility and will support the expansion of the terminal having the capacity to process the equivalent of 20% of Britain's natural gas demand.
Please turn to Slide 9, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $526 million were up 21% compared to last year on volume increases with that pricing. Sequentially, sales were up slightly on positive pricing and slightly lower seasonal volumes. Electronic sales were up 30% compared to last year and up 4% sequentially, as the industry pushed well beyond 2008 peak production. We also saw less seasonal decline particularly at our industry-leading customers. Electronic Specialty Materials sales increased 13% versus prior year and were down 1% sequentially. Ongoing tonnage sales were up 16% versus prior year and up 7% sequentially. And our Equipment business was up significantly versus prior year and also up versus prior quarter.
Electronics specialty materials pricing was flat sequentially. Performance Materials sales increased 11% versus last year with strength across all markets. Sales were down 4% sequentially due to normal seasonality. Segment operating income of $69 million was up 42% versus prior year due to volume leverage and the benefit of the 2010 electronics restructuring actions. Income was down 18% sequentially due to volume seasonality and an inventory revaluation. Margins improved to 190 basis points from last year due to higher volumes and lower costs. They were down sequentially due to seasonally lower low volumes and the inventory revaluation.  We are on track to deliver the 15% target margin for the segment for FY '11. 
In terms of new business, in December, we announced the new air separation unit and pipeline at the Korea site to supply Samsung's mobile displays newest active-matrix organic LED fab. In earlier in January, we announced the supply of nitrogen and bulk gases to UMC's new fab 12 Phase 3 and 4 in the Science Park in Taiwan. And just last week, we announced the formation of our production joint venture to produce high purity and hydrochloric acid in Freeport, Texas. Air Products will market our share of the output from this facility, which will provide a reliable supply of HCL, primary for our electronics customers.
Please turn to Slide 10, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $112 million were up 3% versus prior year and down 13% sequentially, reflecting lower ASU activity. Operating income of $20 million increased significantly versus prior year due to higher LNG activity. Income was flat sequentially. Our backlog is lower both versus prior year and sequentially. But it is expected to improve by the end of the year. 
Now, I'll turn the call back over to Paul."

Our guidance for quarter two is for earnings per share of $1.36 to $1.40 based on the following factors. On the positive side, we expect to see increased earnings sequentially from the following areas: new plants onstream, including the clean energy gas-fired project and the Xingtai Steel will add to next quarter's results. We also expect the global manufacturing economy to continue its gradual recovery. And equity affiliate income should be higher. 
Partially offsetting these sequential improvements, in Asia, we expect some slowing around the Lunar New Year holidays and we anticipate a higher tax rate in quarter two. For fiscal year 2011, the underlying assumptions that we shared on last quarter's call remain unchanged. Our capital expenditure also remains unchanged at $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, up from last year's $1.3 billion. With one quarter completed, we're raising the lower end of our earnings per share guidance by $0.05, revising our full-year guidance range to $5.55 to $5.70 a share. 
Now let me give everyone a brief update on our Airgas offer. in December 9, we announced our best and final offer of $70 per share. As we stated in that announcement, it is time to bring this matter to a conclusion. We are disappointed that the Air Gas board continues to ignore the will of its shareholders. Air Gas shareholders deserve the opportunity to decide for themselves whether they want to accept our $0.70 per share in cash offer. 
Now let me wrap up.  We are off to a great start in fiscal 2011, with growing sales and earnings. We also continue to make significant improvement in our operating margin and our return on capital. We remain committed to delivering returns for our shareholders that will make us the best investment in the industry. The whole team at Air Products is excited by other opportunities and is focused on driving increasing shareholder value in the future.

I don't think there was anything on the inventory side which played a factor. I think as we look at this and look at the Electronics business, we've said this before, is that coming out of the recession, people preferentially spend their money on consumer electronics. And so people had an extra $200, $500, $1 000 to spend, that money more often found its way into the consumer electronics area than it found its sounded way into other markets. Also being helped are some of the other new devices. The success of the iPhone during this time period, the iPad tablet computers has driven a lot of that. I think the other thing which has proven to be a good thing is that the large screen TVs, the LCD TVs continue to sell well. We sold very well at Christmas. There were a lot of concerns with people about what sort of things would happen. Was there too much inventory, too much production capacity? We have not seen that. We've seen our customers run very well throughout that, a good back-to-school season, a good holiday season. All that said, there's always going to be some slowing. And there was a slowing for us. The growth sequentially was not as strong as it has been in other quarters. And we would expect, as I said, in the Lunar New Year impact will have a small impact on us there too in the quarter two. But a very solid market. Inventories appear to be in line very well. Customers seem to be operating extremely well, and we're seeing expansions. We're seeing new orders works. You saw the announcements which Simon talked about here."

It involves the accounting and the way we account for inventory for us. First off, one of the things what you want to understand is that overall to the company, the impact of this was about zero. So it was not a negative impact for us as far as the company is concerned, right? In quarter one, what happens is we take our standards and we change our standards. So we take the value which we put to the inventory on 30 September, and we go out and we adjust it to a new value which we're going to use for standard cost in fiscal year 11. For products which are in LIFO, we're going to reverse that at corporate, that impact. So you write the standard up, you get a gain. If you write the standard down, you get a loss on that. What we had in Electronics and Performance Materials area is we had a loss. That probably cost us about 100 basis points in margin overall in that segment for us. So if you're looking at the ongoing impact. But actually, what you're not going to see going forward is you're not going to see that impact anymore. So it happened. It's a onetime adjustment. And now the cost going through the P&L will be at the lower standard, So it should have impact of raising margins for us."

One of the things that you see the business here within the U.S. is that you see the economic growth is moderating also. So in 2010 in fiscal year for us, we saw the economy within the U.S. which probably grew around 5% on the manufacturing side. We're predicting growth of 3% to 4% in 2011. And the reason why it grew stronger in 2010 was that the inventory pipeline refilled during that time period. But you've seen it -- another example of an industry which has seen some of this is on the steel industry. Steel industry rebuilt their pipeline and then they brought their operating rates back down. So as we look forward, our basic assumption of a long, slow recovery in manufacturing seems to be holding well. Everyone, I think was hoping for more of the V-shape. We did not see a V. We did see some inventory rebuild in 2010. But as far as the dynamics in the U.S. economy, we're still dealing with high unemployment; consumer confidence which is getting better, albeit it still isn't great with things. So everyone is still doing what they think is the right thing, including us, watching our cost, pay attention to it, going after the business, in which we're advantaged and which we have opportunities for in the future. But as far as a very strong recovery within the United States, I just don't think it's in the cards until consumer confidence and employment get a lot better for us. We have too much of our economy on the consumer end of things. All that said, I don't see it double-dip either. So I see long, good, steady, solid growth going forward for the economy."

As far as the order patterns are concerned, we have not seen that. There's still a lot of bids which needed to be decided and awards which needed to be happen, which should happen. We would expect that in 2011, that award activity, it will pick up in the industry because of those factors, because of the energy, I think as the uncertainty starts to come out of the economy, I think that's also something which is actually important. So as people grow less concerned with a double-dip both here in the United States or Europe or worldwide, order patterns and demand, people will get more confident around that. So I think that leads to improving orders in 2011 for things. If you take a look at the tonnage operating margins, one other things that you talked about for a long time as we invest in this business on return and not upon margin of the business. The margin of the business is impacted by a number of factors. First off on the hydrogen end, a hydrogen plant with the same type of contract as an oxygen plant is going to have a lower margin in this business, because what happens is the energy passes through and then the cost of the gas is higher. Whether it's a hydrogen plant or an oxygen plant, we make our money by investing money in these plants and running them while for our customers and building them wall and good operations and getting efficiencies in the future. We don't care. And so we try not to establish really targets. All that said, higher margins are better with those things. And so what we try to pay attention to is the efficiencies of the plants and how we're doing there. And so the efficiencies of the plants, that is something which we have made good and steady progress on. It's helped in the margins of this business over time and improved things for us with things. But we don't actually set a margin target, is the important thing which have you to understand, Lawrence. And so we do try to drive the efficiencies and the returns higher. And that was is occurring in the business for us as we go forward here."

We've paid attention to what's happening in our contracts and what's happening to our costs in this business. So I think within the U.S., the business is operating very well. Remember, the U.S. is spread out a lot with things. And Europe tends to be concentrated more. Around the plants, it's just not as big as a land area to deal with in that area. And so as far as our concerns are, we think that the U.S. is in fine shape. There's lots of loading capacity and loading of the capacity to occur. We think that offers a great opportunity for us to grow earnings and grow returns within the U.S. Within Europe, I believe we need to get some of our prices higher with our customers. We would like to see the margins in our European business better and the returns better for us. And I think a market which is tighter actually helps us in that thing."

Compensation year-on-year, inflation for us year-on-year at any point in time probably runs anywhere from $0.04 to $0.05 a quarter for us, if you take a look at that over the whole fixed-costs base. Offsetting that is the productivity for us overall. A thing which we watch very closely is what's happening to SG&A as a percent of sales. SG&A as a percent of sales was 11.2% last year. This year, it's 10%. So what that says which is as a big area of the fixed costs, is we're not growing our fixed costs at the same rate as the volumes are growing."

Please turn to Slide #4. 
We are off to a great start to fiscal 2011. For the quarter, sales of $2.4 billion were 10% higher versus prior year on growth in our Electronics and Performance Materials, Tonnage and Merchant segments. Underlying sales increased 11% on 10% higher volumes and 1% higher pricing. Sequentially, sales were higher 2%. Underlying sales were up 1% on higher pricing in Merchant Gases and our Electronics and Performance Materials segments. Volumes were flat mainly due to seasonality. Operating income of $404 million increased 17% from prior year on higher volumes. Our operating margin improved to 16.9%, up 100 basis points versus prior year. We are on track to deliver on our 70% goal for fiscal 2011.
Equity affiliate income was up slightly versus prior year. Improved volumes and cost performance were partially offset by a charge for the anticipated sale of a plant in one of our affiliates. Absent this loss, sequential equity affiliate income would have been slightly higher. 
As we've seen in prior years, our tax rate in quarter one was lower than our expected average rate for the full year due to the timing of certain tax credits and adjustments. We still expect our full year tax rate to be consistent with the 25% and 26% guidance range given last quarter.
For the quarter, net income increased 17% and, diluted earnings per share increased by 16%, each versus prior year. Return on capital employed for the quarter improved to 13.2%, up 140 basis points.
Turning to Slide 5 for a review of the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.19. Higher volumes in Electronics and Performance Materials, Tonnage and Merchant segments increased earnings per share by $0.25, year-on-year. The impact of pricing, combined with energy and raw material costs, netted to zero. Costs were $0.02 unfavorable as our productivity gains were more than offset by higher operating and distribution costs. Currency translation and foreign exchange netted to a $0.02 unfavorable impact. And higher non-controlling interest and shares outstanding cost us $0.01 each. In summary, a very good start to the year at the top end of our expectations.

Underlying sales improved by 8% on increased volumes and higher pricing. Currency reduced sales by 2%. Year-on-year sales improvement was driven by very strong Asia growth and improving volumes in North America and Europe liquid bulk products. Sequentially, sales were up 4%, primarily due to currency. Underlying sales were up 1%. 
Merchant Gases operating income of $201 million was up 6% versus prior year and up 8% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 20.3% was flat versus prior year and up 80 basis points sequentially. Sequential margins expanded driven by improved pricing across all regions.
During the quarter, we announced the construction of four new projects in India through our INOX Air Products joint venture. Three new merchant air separation units will provide efficient and reliable supply for the strong growth opportunities we are seeing in India. The fourth project will be a piggyback ASU and hydrogen plant to supply gasses to St. Gobain Glass India and liquid products for the merchant market. These investments strengthen INOX's Air Products' leading merchant presence throughout India. Also during the quarter, we brought China's first air separation unit utilizing LNG cold energy on stream. This JV with CNOOC, the China National Offshore Oil Company (sic) [Corporation] will provide a low-cost supply of over 600 tons of oxygen, nitrogen and argon to supply the fast-growing industrial gases market in Fujian Province. 
Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to Slide 7.
In North America, sales improved 6% versus prior year, the largest increase we have seen in over two years. Volumes were up 3% on growth and liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon. Pricing was up 3% with increases across the portfolio. This was the highest increase in the last seven quarters. LOX/LIN plant loading remained in the mid-70s. 
In Europe, underlying sales increased 2%, but negative 6% currency reduced overall sales to a negative 4%. Volumes were up 3% with stronger liquid bulk growth tempered by modest packaged gas improvement and lower healthcare volumes. Pricing was down 1% with positive packaged gas pricing, offset by unfavorable healthcare and liquid bulk pricing. Our Europe LOX/LIN plant loading remained in the low 80s. 
In Asia, sales were up 35% versus last year, with underlying sales up 30%. Volumes were up 25% with strength across all products. Pricing was also strong, up 5%. Pricing was stronger in part due to spot argon in China, as rolling power curtailments reduced steel companies' self-generated argon. LOX/LIN pricing across Asia was up 2%. These sales and volume increases were the highest in over four years. Plant loadings remained in the high 80s. We will continue to bring new capacity onstream over the next few quarters.
Please turn to Slide 8, Tonnage Gases. Tonnage Gases sales of $766 million increased 10% versus last year with volumes up 12%. Higher volumes came from loading existing assets and new plants brought onstream in the last year. Sequentially, sales were up 2% with volumes up 5% and energy and raw material pass-through increasing sales by 4%. Volume growth was driven by new plants. 
Operating income of $116 million was up 15% versus prior year, primarily due to higher volumes from new plant startups, reduced maintenance costs and improved plant efficiency. Operating margin of 15.1% increased 70 basis points versus prior year due to the lower costs mentioned previously and lower natural gas costs pass-through. Sequentially, operating income was down 1%, and margins declined due to higher maintenance costs. 
Earlier in the quarter, we announced that our Heartland Hydrogen Pipeline in Alberta, Canada, has been commercialized. And we announced two new pipeline hydrogen supply contracts with Dow Chemical Canada and Evonik Degussa Canada. We also announced a new nitrogen plant of the Isle of Grain LNG terminal in the United Kingdom. This is our third plant to the facility and will support the expansion of the terminal having the capacity to process the equivalent of 20% of Britain's natural gas demand.
Please turn to Slide 9, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $526 million were up 21% compared to last year on volume increases with flat pricing. Sequentially, sales were up slightly on positive pricing and slightly lower seasonal volumes. Electronics sales were up 30% compared to last year and up 4% sequentially, as the industry pushed well beyond 2008 peak production. We also saw less seasonal decline, particularly at our industry-leading customers. Electronics specialty materials sales increased 13% versus prior year and were down 1% sequentially. Ongoing Tonnage sales were up 16% versus prior year and up 7% sequentially. And our Equipment business was up significantly versus prior year and also up versus prior quarter.
Electronics specialty materials pricing was flat sequentially. Performance Materials sales increased 11% versus last year with strength across all markets. Sales were down 4% sequentially due to normal seasonality. Segment operating income of $69 million was up 42% versus prior year due to volume leverage and the benefit of the 2010 electronics restructuring actions. Income was down 18% sequentially due to volume seasonality and an inventory revaluation. Margins improved 190 basis points from last year due to higher volumes and lower costs. They were down sequentially due to seasonally lower low volumes and the inventory revaluation.  We are on track to deliver the 15% target margin for the segment for FY '11. 
In terms of new business, in December, we announced the new air separation unit and pipeline at the Tanjeong, Korea site to supply Samsung Mobile Display's newest Active-matrix Organic LED fab. Earlier in January, we announced the supply of nitrogen and bulk gases to UMC's new fab 12 phase 3 and 4 in the Tainan Science Park in Taiwan. And just last week, we announced the formation of our production joint venture to produce high-purity anhydrous hydrochloric acid in Freeport, Texas. Air Products will market our share of the output from this facility, which will provide a reliable supply of HCL, primarily for our Electronics customers.
Please turn to Slide 10, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $112 million were up 3% versus prior year and down 13% sequentially, reflecting lower ASU activity. Operating income of $20 million increased significantly versus prior year due to higher LNG activity. Income was flat sequentially. Our backlog is lower both versus prior year and sequentially, but it is expected to improve by the end of the year. 
Now, I'll turn the call back over to Paul."

Our guidance for quarter two is for earnings per share of $1.36 to $1.40 based on the following factors. On the positive side, we expect to see increased earnings sequentially from the following areas: new plant onstreams, including the Weihe Clean Energy Gasifier project and the Xingtai Steel will add to next quarter's results. We also expect the global manufacturing economy to continue its gradual recovery. And equity affiliate income should be higher. 
Partially offsetting these sequential improvements, in Asia, we expect some slowing around the Lunar New Year holidays, and we anticipate a higher tax rate in quarter two. For fiscal year 2011, the underlying assumptions that we shared on last quarter's call remain unchanged. Our capital expenditure guidance also remains unchanged at $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, up from last year's $1.3 billion. With one quarter completed, we're raising the lower end of our earnings per share guidance by $0.05, revising our full-year guidance range to $5.55 to $5.70 a share. 
Now let me give everyone a brief update on our Airgas offer. On December 9, we announced our best and final offer of $70 per share. As we stated in that announcement, it is time to bring this matter to a conclusion. We are disappointed that the Airgas board continues to ignore the will of its shareholders. Air Gas shareholders deserve the opportunity to decide for themselves whether they want to accept our $0.70 per share in cash offer. 
Now let me wrap up.  We are off to a great start in fiscal 2011, with growing sales and earnings. We also continue to make significant improvements in our operating margin and our return on capital.

I don't think that there was anything on the inventory side which played a factor. I think as we look at this and we look at the Electronics business, we've said this before, is that coming out of the recession, people preferentially spent their money on consumer electronics. And so if people had an extra $200, $500, $1,000 to spend, that money more often found its way into the consumer electronics area than it found its way into other markets. Also being helped are some of the new devices. The success of the iPhone during this time period, the success of the iPad tablet computers has driven a lot of that. I think the other thing which has proven to be a good thing is that the large-screen TVs, the LCD TVs continue to sell well. They sold very well at Christmas. There were a lot of concerns with people about what sort of things would happen. Was there too much inventory, too much production capacity? We have not seen that. We've seen our customers run very well throughout that, a good back-to-school season, a good holiday season. All that said, there's always going to be some slowing. And there was some slowing for us. The growth sequentially was not as strong as it had been in other quarters. And we would expect, as I said, in the Lunar New Year impact will have a small impact on us there, too, in the quarter, two, but a very solid market. Inventories appear to be in line very well. Customers seem to be operating extremely well, and we're seeing expansions. We're seeing new orders. You saw the announcements which Simon talked about here."

It involves the accounting and the way you account for inventory for us. First off, one of the things which you want to understand is that overall to the company, the impact of this was about zero. So it was not a negative impact for us as the company is concerned, right? In quarter one, what happens is we take our standards and we change our standards. So we take the value which we put to the inventory on 30 September, and we go out and we adjust it to a new value which we're going to use for standard cost in fiscal year '11. For products which are on LIFO, we're going to reverse that at corporate, that impact. So if you write the standard up, you get a gain. If you write the standard down, you get a loss on that. And what we had in Electronics and Performance Materials area is we had a loss. That probably cost us about 100 basis points in margin overall in that segment for us, so if you're looking at the ongoing impact. But actually, what you're not going to see, going forward, is you're not going to see that impact anymore. So it happened. It's a one-time adjustment. And now the cost going through the P&L will be at the lower standard, so it should have impact of raising margins for us."

One of the things which you see in the business here within the U.S. is that you see the economic growth is moderating also. So in 2010 in fiscal year for us, we saw the economy within the U.S., which probably grew around 5% on the manufacturing side. We're predicting growth of 3% to 4% in 2011. And the reason why it grew stronger in 2010 was that the inventory pipeline refilled during that time period. But you've seen it -- another example of an industry which has seen some of those is on the steel industry. Steel industry rebuilt their pipeline and then they brought their operating rates back down. So as we look forward, our basic assumptions of a long, slow recovery in manufacturing seems to be holding well. Everyone, I think, was hoping for more of the V-shape. We did not see a V. We did see some inventory rebuild in 2010. But as far as the dynamics in the U.S. economy, we're still dealing with a high unemployment; consumer confidence, which is getting better, albeit it still isn't great with things. And so everyone is doing what I think is the right thing, including us, watching our cost, paying attention to it, going after the business, at which we're advantaged and which we have opportunities for in the future. But as far as a very strong recovery within the United States, I just don't think it's in the cards until consumer confidence and employment get a lot better for us. We have too much of our economy on the consumer end of things. All that said, I don't see it double-dip either. So I see long, good, steady, solid growth going forward year for the economy."

There's still a lot of bids which needed to be decided and awards which should happen. We would expect that in 2011, that award activity, it will pick up in the industry because of those factors, because of the energy. I think as uncertainty starts to come out of the economy, I think that's also something which is actually important. So as people grow less concerned with a double-dip, both here in the United States or Europe or worldwide, order patterns and demand, people will get more confident around that. So I think that leads to improving orders in 2011 for things. If you take a look at the tonnage operating margins, one of the things which we've talked about for a long time is we invest in this business on return and not upon margin of the business. The margin of the business is impacted by a number of factors. First off on the hydrogen end, a hydrogen plant with the same type of contract as an oxygen plant is going to have a lower margin in this business because what happens is the energy passes through and then the cost of the gas is higher. Whether it's a hydrogen plant or an oxygen plant, we make our money by investing money in these plants and running them well for our customers and building them well and good operations and getting efficiencies in the future. We don't care. And so we try not to establish, really, targets. All that said, higher margins are better with those things. And so what we try to pay attention to is the efficiencies of the plants and how we're doing there. And so with the efficiencies of the plants, that is something which we have made good and steady progress on. It's helped in the margins of this business over time and improved things for us with things. But we don't actually set a margin target is the important thing which have you to understand, Laurence. And so we do try to drive the efficiencies and the returns higher. And that's is what is occurring in the business for us as we go forward here."

Please turn to Slide #4. 
We are off to a great start to fiscal 2011. For the quarter, sales of $2.4 billion were 10% higher versus prior year on growth in our Electronics and Performance Materials, Tonnage and Merchant segments. Underlying sales increased 11% on 10% higher volumes and 1% higher pricing. Sequentially, sales were higher 2%. Underlying sales were up 1% on higher pricing in Merchant Gases and our Electronics and Performance Materials segments. Volumes were flat mainly due to seasonality. Operating income of $404 million increased 17% from prior year on higher volumes. Our operating margin improved to 16.9%, up 100 basis points versus prior year. We are on track to deliver on our 17% goal for fiscal 2011.
Equity affiliate income was up slightly versus prior year. Improved volumes and cost performance were partially offset by a charge for the anticipated sale of a plant in one of our affiliates. Absent this loss, sequential equity affiliate income would have been slightly higher. 
As we've seen in prior years, our tax rate in quarter one was lower than our expected average rate for the full year due to the timing of certain tax credits and adjustments. We still expect our full year tax rate to be consistent with the 25% and 26% guidance range given last quarter.
For the quarter, net income increased 17% and, diluted earnings per share increased by 16%, each versus prior year. Return on capital employed for the quarter improved to 13.2%, up 140 basis points.
Turning to Slide 5 for a review of the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.19. Higher volumes in Electronics and Performance Materials, Tonnage and Merchant segments increased earnings per share by $0.25, year-on-year. The impact of pricing, combined with energy and raw material costs, netted to zero. Costs were $0.02 unfavorable as our productivity gains were more than offset by higher operating and distribution costs. Currency translation and foreign exchange netted to a $0.02 unfavorable impact. And higher non-controlling interest and shares outstanding cost us $0.01 each. In summary, a very good start to the year at the top end of our expectations. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Simon to review our business segment results. Simon?"

Currency reduced sales by 2%. Year-on-year sales improvement",1090,"Thanks, Paul. Please turn to Slide 6, Merchant Gases. Merchant Gases sales of $988 million were up 6% versus prior year. Underlying sales improved by 8% on increased volumes and higher pricing. Currency reduced sales by 2%. Year-on-year sales improvement was driven by very strong Asia growth and improving volumes in North America and Europe liquid bulk products. Sequentially, sales were up 4%, primarily due to currency. Underlying sales were up 1%. 
Merchant Gases operating income of $201 million was up 6% versus prior year and up 8% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 20.3% was flat versus prior year and up 80 basis points sequentially. Sequential margins expanded driven by improved pricing across all regions.
During the quarter, we announced the construction of four new projects in India through our INOX Air Products joint venture. Three new merchant air separation units will provide efficient and reliable supply for the strong growth opportunities we are seeing in India. The fourth project will be a piggyback ASU and hydrogen plant to supply gasses to Saint Gobain Glass India and liquid products for the merchant market. These investments strengthen INOX's Air Products' leading merchant presence throughout India. Also during the quarter, we brought China's first air separation unit utilizing LNG cold energy on stream. This JV with CNOOC, the China National Offshore Oil Company (sic) [Corporation] will provide a low-cost supply of over 600 tons of oxygen, nitrogen and argon to supply the fast-growing industrial gases market in Fujian Province. 
Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to Slide 7.
In North America, sales improved 6% versus prior year, the largest increase we have seen in over two years. Volumes were up 3% on growth and liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon. Pricing was up 3% with increases across the portfolio. This was the highest increase in the last seven quarters. LOX/LIN plant loading remained in the mid-70s. 
In Europe, underlying sales increased 2%, but negative 6% currency reduced overall sales to a negative 4%. Volumes were up 3% with stronger liquid bulk growth tempered by modest packaged gas improvement and lower healthcare volumes. Pricing was down 1% with positive packaged gas pricing, offset by unfavorable healthcare and liquid bulk pricing. Our Europe LOX/LIN plant loading remained in the low 80s. 
In Asia, sales were up 35% versus last year, with underlying sales up 30%. Volumes were up 25% with strength across all products. Pricing was also strong, up 5%. Pricing was stronger in part due to spot argon in China, as rolling power curtailments reduced steel companies' self-generated argon. LOX/LIN pricing across Asia was up 2%. These sales and volume increases were the highest in over four years. Plant loadings remained in the high 80s. We will continue to bring new capacity onstream over the next few quarters.
Please turn to Slide 8, Tonnage Gases. Tonnage Gases sales of $766 million increased 10% versus last year with volumes up 12%. Higher volumes came from loading existing assets and new plants brought onstream in the last year. Sequentially, sales were up 2% with volumes up 5% and energy and raw material pass-through decreasing sales by 4%. Volume growth was driven by new plants. 
Operating income of $116 million was up 15% versus prior year, primarily due to higher volumes from new plant startups, reduced maintenance costs and improved plant efficiency. Operating margin of 15.1% increased 70 basis points versus prior year due to the lower costs mentioned previously and lower natural gas costs pass-through. Sequentially, operating income was down 1%, and margins declined due to higher maintenance costs. 
Earlier in the quarter, we announced that our Heartland Hydrogen Pipeline in Alberta, Canada, has been commercialized. And we announced two new pipeline hydrogen supply contracts with Dow Chemical Canada and Evonik Degussa Canada. We also announced a new nitrogen plant of the Isle of Grain LNG terminal in the United Kingdom. This is our third plant to the facility and will support the expansion of the terminal having the capacity to process the equivalent of 20% of Britain's natural gas demand.
Please turn to Slide 9, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $526 million were up 21% compared to last year on volume increases with flat pricing. Sequentially, sales were up slightly on positive pricing and slightly lower seasonal volumes. Electronics sales were up 30% compared to last year and up 4% sequentially, as the industry pushed well beyond 2008 peak production. We also saw less seasonal decline, particularly at our industry-leading customers. Electronics specialty materials sales increased 13% versus prior year and were down 1% sequentially. Ongoing Tonnage sales were up 16% versus prior year and up 7% sequentially. And our Equipment business was up significantly versus prior year and also up versus prior quarter.
Electronics specialty materials pricing was flat sequentially. Performance Materials sales increased 11% versus last year with strength across all markets. Sales were down 4% sequentially due to normal seasonality. Segment operating income of $69 million was up 42% versus prior year due to volume leverage and the benefit of the 2010 electronics restructuring actions. Income was down 18% sequentially due to volume seasonality and an inventory revaluation. Margins improved 190 basis points from last year due to higher volumes and lower costs. They were down sequentially due to seasonally lower volumes and the inventory revaluation.  We are on track to deliver the 15% target margin for the segment for FY '11. 
In terms of new business, in December, we announced the new air separation unit and pipeline at the Tanjeong, Korea site to supply Samsung Mobile Display's newest Active-matrix Organic LED fab. Earlier in January, we announced the supply of nitrogen and bulk gases to UMC's new fab 12 phase 3 and 4 in the Tainan Science Park in Taiwan. And just last week, we announced the formation of our production joint venture to produce high-purity anhydrous hydrochloric acid in Freeport, Texas. Air Products will market our share of the output from this facility, which will provide a reliable supply of HCL, primarily for our Electronics customers.
Please turn to Slide 10, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $112 million were up 3% versus prior year and down 13% sequentially, reflecting lower ASU activity. Operating income of $20 million increased significantly versus prior year due to higher LNG activity. Income was flat sequentially. Our backlog is lower both versus prior year and sequentially, but it is expected to improve by the end of the year. 
Now, I'll turn the call back over to Paul."

Our guidance for quarter two is for earnings per share of $1.36 to $1.40 based on the following factors. On the positive side, we expect to see increased earnings sequentially from the following areas: new plant onstreams, including the Weihe Clean Energy Gasifier project and the Xingtai Steel will add to next quarter's results. We also expect the global manufacturing economy to continue its gradual recovery. And equity affiliate income should be higher. 
Partially offsetting these sequential improvements, in Asia, we expect some slowing around the Lunar New Year holidays, and we anticipate a higher tax rate in quarter two. For fiscal year 2011, the underlying assumptions that we shared on last quarter's call remain unchanged. Our capital expenditure guidance also remains unchanged at $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, up from last year's $1.3 billion. With one quarter completed, we're raising the lower end of our earnings per share guidance by $0.05, revising our full-year guidance range to $5.55 to $5.70 a share. 
Now let me give everyone a brief update on our Airgas offer. On December 9, we announced our best and final offer of $70 per share. As we stated in that announcement, it is time to bring this matter to a conclusion. We are disappointed that the Airgas board continues to ignore the will of its shareholders. Airgas shareholders deserve the opportunity to decide for themselves whether they want to accept our $0.70 per share in cash offer. 
Now let me wrap up.  We are off to a great start in fiscal 2011, with growing sales and earnings. We also continue to make significant improvements in our operating margin and our return on capital. We remain committed to delivering returns for our shareholders that will make us the best investment in the industry. The whole team at Air Products is excited by our opportunities and is focused on driving increasing shareholder value in the future.

I don't think that there was anything on the inventory side which played a factor. I think as we look at this and we look at the Electronics business, we've said this before, is that coming out of the recession, people preferentially spent their money on consumer electronics. And so if people had an extra $200, $500, $1,000 to spend, that money more often found its way into the consumer electronics area than it found its way into other markets.
Also being helped are some of the new devices. The success of the iPhone during this time period, the success of the iPad, tablet computers has driven a lot of that. I think the other thing which has proven to be a good thing is that the large-screen TVs, the LCD TVs continue to sell well. They sold very well at Christmas. There were a lot of concerns with people about what sort of things would happen. Was there too much inventory, too much production capacity? We have not seen that. We've seen our customers run very well throughout that, a good back-to-school season, a good holiday season. All that said, there's always going to be some slowing. And there was some slowing for us. The growth sequentially was not as strong as it had been in other quarters. And we would expect, as I said, in the Lunar New Year impact will have a small impact on us there, too, in the quarter, two, but a very solid market. Inventories appear to be in line very well. Customers seem to be operating extremely well, and we're seeing expansions. We're seeing new orders. You saw the announcements which Simon talked about here."

It involves the accounting and the way you account for inventory for us. First off, one of the things which you want to understand is that overall to the company, the impact of this was about zero. So it was not a negative impact for us as the company is concerned, right? In quarter one, what happens is we take our standards and we change our standards. So we take the value which we put to the inventory on 30 September, and we go out and we adjust it to a new value which we're going to use for standard cost in fiscal year '11. For products which are on LIFO, we're going to reverse that at corporate, that impact. So if you write the standard up, you get a gain. If you write the standard down, you get a loss on that. And what we had in Electronics and Performance Materials area is we had a loss. That probably cost us about 100 basis points in margin overall in that segment for us, so if you're looking at the ongoing impact. But actually, what you're not going to see, going forward, is you're not going to see that impact anymore. So it happened. It's a one-time adjustment. And now the cost going through the P&L will be at the lower standard, so it should have the impact of raising margins for us."

One of the things which you see in the business here within the U.S. is that you see the economic growth is moderating also. So in 2010 in fiscal year for us, we saw an economy within the U.S. which probably grew around 5% on the manufacturing side. We're predicting growth of 3% to 4% in 2011. And the reason why it grew stronger in 2010 was that the inventory pipeline refilled during that time period. But you've seen it -- another example of an industry which has seen some of those is on the steel industry. Steel industry rebuilt their pipeline and then they brought their operating rates back down. So as we look forward, our basic assumptions of a long, slow recovery in manufacturing seems to be holding well. Everyone, I think, was hoping for more of a V-shape. We did not see a V. We did see some inventory rebuild in 2010. But as far as the dynamics in the U.S. economy, we're still dealing with a high unemployment; consumer confidence, which is getting better, albeit it still isn't great with things. And so everyone is doing what I think is the right thing, including us, watching our costs, paying attention to it, going after the business, at which we're advantaged and which we have opportunities for in the future. But as far as a very strong recovery within the United States, I just don't think it's in the cards until consumer confidence and employment get a lot better for us. We have too much of our economy on the consumer end of things. All that said, I don't see it a double-dip either. So I see long, good, steady, solid growth going forward here for the economy."

So we're very excited about those opportunities. As far as impact on earnings for this year, as we talked about it last quarter, probably $0.30 to $0.40 a share, as far as the onstreams in this year and in last year. A little early to tell what the impact for 2012 is going to be, but I wouldn't expect it to be a lot changed from that."

There's still a lot of bids which need to be decided and awards which should happen. We would expect that in 2011, that award activity, it will pick up in the industry because of those factors, because of the energy. I think as uncertainty starts to come out of the economy, I think that's also something which is actually important. So as people grow less concerned with a double-dip, both here in the United States or Europe or worldwide, order patterns and demand, people will get more confident around that. So I think that leads to improving orders in 2011 for things. If you take a look at the tonnage operating margins, one of the things which we've talked about for a long time is we invest in this business on return and not upon margin of the business. The margin of the business is impacted by a number of factors. First off on the hydrogen end, a hydrogen plant with the same type of contract as an oxygen plant is going to have a lower margin in this business because what happens is the energy passes through and then the cost of the gas is higher. Whether it's a hydrogen plant or an oxygen plant, we make our money by investing money in these plants and running them well for our customers and building them well and good operations and getting efficiencies in the future. We don't care. And so we try not to establish, really, targets. All that said, higher margins are better with those things. And so what we try to pay attention to is the efficiencies of the plants and how we're doing there. And so with the efficiencies of the plants, that is something which we have made good and steady progress on. It's helped in the margins of this business over time and improved things for us with things. But we don't actually set a margin target is the important thing which you have to understand, Laurence. And so we do try to drive the efficiencies and the returns higher. And that's is what is occurring in the business for us as we go forward here."

With half of our fiscal year behind us, we are well on our way towards delivering on our 2011 financial goals. For the quarter, sales of $2.5 billion were up 11% versus prior year on growth in our Electronics and Performance Materials, Tonnage and Merchant segments. Underlying sales increased 12% on 11% higher volumes and 1% higher pricing. Sequentially, sales were 5% higher. Underlying sales were up 3% with volumes contributing 2% and a pricing adding 1%. This sequential improvement was driven primarily by our Electronics and Performance Materials segment and our Merchant Gases a segment.
Operating income of $425 million increased 17% from prior year, primarily on higher volumes. Our operating margins improved to 17%, up 80 basis points versus prior year. We remain on track to deliver on our 17% goal for fiscal 2011. For the quarter, net income increased 16% and diluted earnings per share increased by 15%, each versus prior year. Return on capital employed for the quarter improved to 230.2%, a 110 basis points.
Turning to Slide 4 for a review of the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our adjusted earnings per share increased by 15% or $0.18 per share. Higher volumes in the Electronics and Performance Materials, Tonnage and Merchant segments increased earnings per share by $0.27 year-on-year.
The impact of pricing combined with energy and raw material costs attracted $0.02. Costs were $0.04 unfavorable as our productivity gains were more than offset by higher operating, maintenance and distribution costs, particularly in our purchase segment.
Currency translation and foreign exchange netted to $0.01 unfavorable impact and the higher tax rate and higher shares outstanding cost us a $0.01 each. In March, we announced an 18% dividend increase marking 29 consecutive years of increases. We are all proud of this record.
Also, this past quarter, we repurchased $350 million of our stock, about 3.8 million shares. We have $300 million remaining on our repurchase authorization.
In summary, this was another quarter of solid gains in sales, earnings, margins and returns. Now, I'll turn the call over to Simon to review our business segment results. Simon?"

We had a number of a plant operating challenges that increased maintenance costs and resulted in higher distribution cost as we reallocated our supply chain to the customer's needs.
Versus prior quarter, the same cost impacts combined with the smaller sequential volume increase drove the margin decline. We believe that these challenges are largely behind us and expect operating margins to improve through the rest of the year. Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to Slide 6.
In North America, sales improved 5% versus prior year. Volumes were up 3% on growth across all product lines. Pricing was positive with a 2% broad-based increased led by helium. LOX/LIN pricing was up 2%.
LOX/LIN plant loading remained in the mid-70s. During the quarter, we announced plans to construct a new liquid nitrogen production facility in Portland, Oklahoma to further strengthen our leadership decision in supplying the region's oil field services market.
We also announced an increasing Merchant and oxygen at Middleton, Ohio. This facility fully integrated with an increase of our on-site oxygen supply.
These two opportunities were driven by specific opportunities to create value. As always, we will carefully consider loading as we manage capacity going forward. In Europe, sales increased 3% versus last year. Volumes were up 4% with stronger liquid bulk growth particularly liquid oxygen and nitrogen come up 9%. Packaged gas volumes were up slightly and healthcare volumes were flat.
Pricing was down 1% with positive packaged gas pricing offset by unfavorable healthcare and Liquid Bulk pricing. Our LOX/LIN pricing remained in the low 80s.
In Asia, sales were up 30% versus last year with underlying sales up 25%. Volumes were up 18% with strength across all products led by the electronics market. Pricing was also strong, up 7%, the highest increase in over four years. We were able to continue to take advantage of the higher spot Airgas pricing in China that we mentioned last quarter. LOX/LIN pricing stayed strong across Asia, up 3%. Plant loadings were in the mid-80s with a slight dip through the lunar new year. We will continue to bring new capacity onstream over the next few quarters. Please turn to Slide 7, Tonnage gases.
Tonnage gases sales of $799 million, increased 6% versus last year with volumes up 10% in energy and raw material pass-through decreasing sales by 5%.
The volume increase was primarily driven by refinery hydrogen customers.
Sequentially, sales were up 4% on flat volumes and higher energy and raw material pass-through. New plant volume growth was offset by scheduled outages. These maintenance outages are scheduled to coincide with our customer outages to eliminate any impact on their operations.
Operating income of $121 million rose 13% from the prior year on higher new plant volumes and increased operating efficiencies, particularly in our Gulf Coast system. Operating margin of 15.1% increased 90 basis points versus prior year due to improved operating efficiency and lower natural gas costs pass-through.
Moving to new business. We announced an increase of our pipeline hydrogen supply to Marathon Petroleum in Garyville, Louisiana. We are pleased with this latest expansion of our relationship as we have been supplying this refinery for almost 20 years. Marathon will continue to benefit from that reliability and flexibility of the Air Products Gulf Coast hydrogen pipeline system. This is the world's largest hydrogen pipeline.
As I mentioned in the Merchant discussion, we also announced the expansion of our facility in Middletown, Ohio, including a new air separation unit and a new hydrogen production plants. We have been supplying pipeline in Merchant customers from this facility since the 1960s.
Please turn to Slide 8, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $576 million were up 28% compared to last year on 23% higher volumes and 3% positive pricing. Sequentially, sales were up 9% on 6% higher volumes and 2% higher prices 
Electronics sales were up 33% compared to last year and up 6% sequentially as the industry continued to demonstrate strong growth. The sequential sales increase is particularly notable given the typical slowdown for lunar new year.
Electronics Specialty Materials sales increased 16% versus prior year and 4% sequentially. Ongoing Tonnage sales were up 18% versus prior year and 3% sequentially and our Equipment business was up significantly versus prior year and sequentially.
The Electronics Specialty Materials pricing was essentially flat versus last year and last quarter. Performance Materials sales increased 22% versus last year with volumes up 16% and pricing up 5%. Our pricing actions successfully recovered increased raw material costs. Sequentially, sales rose 14% with a stronger than typical rebound from normal Q1 seasonality.
Segment operating income of $92 million is the highest ever for this segment, up 61% versus prior year, primarily due to volume leverage and a positive effect of the Electronics restructuring actions taken last year. Income was up 33% sequentially due to volume leverage in the inventory revaluation in Q1.
The segment operating margin of 15.9% improved 330 basis points from last year due to higher volumes and improved productivity. Sequentially, margins were up to 280 basis points on higher volumes and the Q1 inventory revaluation.
In terms of the Japan tragedy, our first thoughts go to the victims and to the recovery efforts. We did not see any significant impact on our business during Q2. In terms of new business, last month, we announced the new nitrogen plant and pipeline at our Korea site to supply Samsung Electronics fabs in the area.
And yesterday, we announced an expansion of our Carlsbad California electronics material development and production facility supporting product development, process demonstration, new product scale-up and performance testing to create the next generation materials our electronics customers needs. Now, please turn to Slide 9, Equipment and Energy.
Sales of $114 million were down 5% versus prior year and up 1% sequentially, reflecting lower ASU activity. Operating income of $23 million increased 24% versus prior year and 11% sequentially due to higher LNG activity. Our backlog is lower both prior year and sequentially. We expect it to improve by the end of the year. We did announce an the new LNG technology and equipment order from JGC Corporation for the 2 million ton per year, Donggi-Senoro LNG project in Indonesia. Air Products' leading LNG technology has been supporting projects in Indonesia since the late 1970s.
Now, I'll turn the call back over to Paul."

Now, if you will turn to Slide 10. I'd like to share my thoughts on our outlook.

Now, if you will turn to Slide 10. I'd like to share my thoughts on our outlook. Our guidance for quarter three is for earnings per share of $1.42 to $1.47, which is a year-over-year growth of 11% to 15% and is based on the following factors. On the positive side, we expect to see increased earnings sequentially from the following areas. We expect the manufacturing economy globally to continue its gradual recovery. This along with some seasonal boost should result in higher sequential volumes in Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments. We also expect better cost performance in our Merchant segment as the operating and related distribution impacts should not repeat this quarter. And our fiscal quarter three tax rate will be lower as we anticipate closing some open tax orders. Our tax rate next quarter should be 24% to 25%. For the year, we expect the rate to come in towards the lower end of our original guidance range of 25% to 26%.
Partially offsetting these sequential improvements. In Tonnage, results will be down sequentially. We expect that our operating bonuses will be lower as these bonuses are tied to contract year end and quarter two is our peak bonus quarter.
Also, quarter three, will be the highest quarter for maintenance spending this year. As Simon told you, we coincide our maintenance outages timing with our customer plant shutdowns. For quarter four, we expect significantly higher operating income in Tonnage.
And in Equipment and Energy, we expect lower results as our air separation unit backlog is currently low. As a result, we expect operating income in the second half of the year will be about half of what we recorded in the first half. As I mentioned, we expect to add orders to our backlog by fiscal year end.
To date, we have not experienced any significant business impacts from the Japan tragedy. Japan represents only about 2% of our revenue. While our electronics customers are continuing to operate at high utilization rates, there is still some uncertainty of a potential global supply chain impact. On balance, we do not expect any material impact on our business and have reflected this in our guidance.
For fiscal year 2011, the underlying assumptions from the beginning of the year remained unchanged. Our capital expenditure guidance also remains unchanged at $1.5  billion to $1.7 billion, up from last year's $1.3 billion.
With half of our fiscal year completed, we're raising our earnings per share guidance, increasing our full year guidance range to $5.65 to $5.75, 13% to 15% growth over last year.
Now, let me wrap up. With the first half of our fiscal year behind us, we are off to a great start in 2011 with sales and earnings continuing to grow. We also continue to improve our operating margin and our return on capital. As I mentioned, we are all proud of the fact that we increased our dividend by 18%, marking 29 consecutive years of increases. We are confident that we can continue to drive strong growth and higher returns over our planning horizon. Before the recession, we generated annual top line growth of 14% from 2004 to 2008 with underlying growth of 9%. As we have emerged from the recession, we have seen in this underlying growth rate increase and have consistently beaten our competitors
We expect that our revenue growth will continue this strong pace because of the following factors. First, with the world experiencing higher energy cost and more environmental pressures, we are seeing industrial gases being used in more and more processes, applications and industries as companies look to increase energy efficiency and improve environmental performance.
Second, as the manufacturing grows in the emerging markets to serve the needs of their large populations, we are seeing industrial gas usage to grow significantly in those countries. Finally, Air Products' leading position in the electronics, hydrogen and energy markets coupled with our leading position in a number of the Asian countries makes us and the industrial gas company that has the best opportunity to take advantage of these macro trends.
We've also demonstrated our commitment to improve returns by increasing our return on capital employed by about 300 basis points over the past six years. We believe we have a number of opportunities to further expand our returns. Some examples are: As we look to the future, we still have operating leverage in our existing facilities. We are also pursuing a number of programs to improve the way we price our products, simplify the way we do business with our customers and suppliers, improve the efficiency and output of our plants and lower the capital costs of our investments. We are excited by these opportunities and believe that they will make us the best investment in our industry going forward. TO find out more about what we are doing and what our long-term goals are, please join us at our investor conference on June 9 for a day of presentations, questions and answers and interactive discussions regarding Air Products strategy, opportunities and outlook. You will have a chance to discuss our businesses and interface with a broad cross section of our management team. If you're interested in attending, please contact our Investor Relations team.

We certainly intend to continue to drive the margins in that business. The thing, which has driven them are two things: First, we have very strong volume growth, not only from our existing product but some of the new products, which we've introduced and those new products come in a very nice margin for us. So that has helped on our facilities certainly has helped. Secondly, as everyone knows we have put that group through a lot of changes over the past few years and those changes have paid off in increased margins and better operations for that facility, for their facilities and the way they operate. So, yes, we do think that we have a sustainable model in there and that we will continue to experience good growth. With regard to Japan, from an Electronics standpoint, we don't -- to date we have not seen any real impacts. We've washed our volumes very closely through April. Our volumes look good year. We've talked our customers. Our customers continue to operate. There's obviously people concern about supply chain. Apple recently commented that they do not see any issues with whether that's good news from our standpoint because they are downstream produce units. And so we hope that as we go forward and that it won't be a problem for us."

If you look at it, we did have volume leverage that we have had volume in the business here. We lost the volume leverage principally because of a couple of items. Number one, we had some operating problems at facilities, which caused us the distribution cost to move product around, higher cost to operate and maintain those facilities and fixed those problems. Now some of those cost will go away in the next quarter. But there will be more cost, which need to go away in the longer term to get that. The second factor is that we have not delivered in this quarter, we have not delivered the productivity gains, which we have planned up on and that something we need to fix and get moving forward. We constantly have inflation in this business as anyone in any business has. We aim to more than offset our inflation on the productivity end. We did not do that this quarter, obviously, and we felt that a little bit. And so, we are attempting to come out of that. Will margins come back up to the quarter one levels in quarter three? We're going to try to get them back up but that's a large test for us. I will to tell you there right now.

Thanks. The question of NF3, obviously, there is a lot of facilities in Japan and this is a broader comment than just NF3 they are affected not only by potential damage but also by rolling power outages this I don't know exactly what our competitors are doing but NF3 is a type of process where you have a very difficult around the plant if you were still experiencing rolling power outages. So we have seen increased for product from our customers. I would say that NF3 pricing specifically was slightly positive versus last year and also slightly positive sequentially. There are some other things to talk about over the last few quarters about mitigating the downward pressure. We are starting to see some positive effects there. Now keep in mind NF3 is roughly around 10% of our Electronics sales and so while that is a flat to slightly up, we also have some of the newer products that we are pleased our customers are adopting and we have shown them some price volume curves. So on balance as we've said before, for the electronics segment, we probably see stable pricing going forward. The other point to make about NF3 is we typically have these under contracts. Now they're not as long as the contracts in the other aspects of our business for about a year. So we're certainly honoring our contracts and we're looking to manage the pricing availability with our customer relationships as best as we can."

If you take a look at the cost, one of the things that you look at end of the amount of what the shortfall for us was to get to kind of the margin where our leverage will show up in flow through, we were short about $15 million in profit in an estimate, which we did. About half of that is under inflation where we did get the productivity savings, which we were planning on getting for us. The remainder  of that then sits in two other areas. The first is the cost of additional power and the variable costs of the product around from an operations standpoint. In other words, you've got a plant out in a predicable pay so you've got longer distances to serve the customer. We have the capacity in those products to be able to do that. So we didn't lose a lot in volume. We have lost some in volume but we didn't lose lot. And that the additional fixed cost to maintain the plants, that was the other half. Those are split about even when you look at that. With regard to pricing overall in this segment, we have about recovered the variable cost increases, which we saw year-on-year for those things. So pricing, we can pick on certain areas in certain regions. But on net overall, it looked good. There is opportunity for us to increase the margins particularly in places like Europe and in some of the recovery areas of some of the cost. With regard to the surcharges on diesel cost and things like that, diesel was not a huge issue for us in this quarter, as I said. But our surcharges typically lag triggered they lag by a month or so for us before we can get that out into the customer and it varies contract by contract."

For the quarter, sales of $2.5 billion were up",374,"Thanks, Simon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Please turn to Slide #3.
With half of our fiscal year behind us, we are well on our way towards delivering on our 2011 financial goals. For the quarter, sales of $2.5 billion were up 11% versus prior year on growth in our Electronics and Performance Materials, Tonnage and Merchant segments. Underlying sales increased 12% on 11% higher volumes and 1% higher pricing. 
Sequentially, sales were 5% higher. Underlying sales were up 3%, with volumes contributing 2% and a pricing adding 1%. This sequential improvement was driven primarily by our Electronics and Performance Materials segment and our Merchant Gases segment.
Operating income of $425 million increased 17% from prior year, primarily on higher volumes. Our operating margins improved to 17%, up 80 basis points versus prior year. We remain on track to deliver on our 17% goal for fiscal 2011. For the quarter, net income increased 16% and diluted earnings per share increased by 15%, each versus prior year. Return on capital employed for the quarter improved to 13.3%, up 110 basis points.
Turning to Slide 4 for a review of the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our adjusted earnings per share increased by 15% or $0.18 per share. Higher volumes in the Electronics and Performance Materials, Tonnage and Merchant segments increased earnings per share by $0.27 year-on-year.
The impact of pricing, combined with energy and raw material costs, attracted $0.02. Costs were $0.04 unfavorable, as our productivity gains were more than offset by higher operating, maintenance and distribution costs, particularly in our Merchant segment.
Currency translation and foreign exchange netted to a $0.01 unfavorable impact, and the higher tax rate and higher shares outstanding cost us a $0.01 each. In March, we announced an 18% dividend increase, marking 29 consecutive years of increases. We are all proud of this record.
Also, in this past quarter, we repurchased $350 million of our stock, about 3.8 million shares. We have $300 million remaining on our repurchase authorization.
In summary, this was another quarter of solid gains in sales, earnings, margins and returns. Now I'll turn the call over to Simon to review our business segment results. Simon?"

Please turn to Slide 5, Merchant Gases. Merchant Gases sales of just over $1 billion were up 10% versus prior year. Underlying sales improved by 9% on 8% higher volumes and positive pricing.  Currency increased sales by 1%. Year-on-year sale",1205,"Thanks, Paul. Please turn to Slide 5, Merchant Gases. Merchant Gases sales of just over $1 billion were up 10% versus prior year. Underlying sales improved by 9% on 8% higher volumes and positive pricing.  Currency increased sales by 1%. Year-on-year sales improvement was driven by volume growth across the segment, with the greatest improvement in Asia. Sequentially, sales were up 3% with underlying sales up 2% even with the Lunar New Year holiday.
Merchant Gases operating income of $185 million was up 4% versus prior year and down 8% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 18.3% was down 100 basis point versus prior year and down to 200 basis points sequentially.
Versus last year, volume leverage was more than offset by higher operating, maintenance and distribution costs and lower pricing in European healthcare. We had a number of a plant operating challenges that increased maintenance costs and resulted in a higher distribution cost, as we reallocated our supply chain to meet customers' needs.
Versus prior quarter, the same cost impacts, combined with the smaller sequential volume increase, drove the margin decline. We believe these challenges are largely behind us and expect operating margins to improve through the rest of the year. Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to Slide 6.
In North America, sales improved 5% versus prior year. Volumes were up 3% on growth across all product lines. Pricing was positive with a 2% broad-based increased led by Helium. LOX/LIN pricing was up 2%.
LOX/LIN plant loading remained in the mid-70s. During the quarter, we announced plans to construct a new liquid nitrogen production facility in Mooreland, Oklahoma, to further strengthen our leadership position in supplying the region's oil field services market.
We also announced an increase in Merchant oxygen and argon production at Middletown, Ohio. This facility and expansion are fully integrated with an increase of our on-site oxygen supply.
These two opportunities were driven by specific opportunities to create value. As always, we will carefully consider loadings, as we manage capacity going forward. In Europe, sales increased 3% versus last year. Volumes were up 4% with strong liquid bulk growth, particularly liquid oxygen and nitrogen, up 9%. Packaged gas volumes were up slightly, and healthcare volumes were flat.
Pricing was down 1% with positive packaged gas pricing offset by unfavorable healthcare and liquid bulk pricing. Our LOX/LIN plant loading remain in the low 80s.
In Asia, sales were up 30% versus last year, with underlying sales up 25%. Volumes were up 18%, with strength across all products led by the electronics market. Pricing was also strong, up 7%, the highest increase in over four years. We were able to continue to take advantage of the higher spot argon pricing in China that we mentioned last quarter. LOX/LIN pricing stayed strong across Asia, up 3%. Plant loadings were in the mid-80s, with a slight dip through the Lunar New Year. We will continue to bring new capacity onstream over the next few quarters. Please turn to Slide 7, Tonnage Gases.
Tonnage gases sales of $799 million, increased 6% versus last year, with volumes up 10% in energy and raw material pass-through decreasing sales by 5%. The volume increase was primarily driven by our refinery hydrogen customers.
Sequentially, sales were up 4% on flat volumes and higher energy and raw material pass-through. New plant volume growth was offset by scheduled outages. These maintenance outages are scheduled to coincide with our customer outages to eliminate any impact on their operations.
Operating income of $121 million rose 13% from the prior year on higher new plant volumes and increased operating efficiencies, particularly in our Gulf Coast system. Operating margin of 15.1% increased 90 basis points versus prior year, due to improved operating efficiency and lower natural gas costs pass-through.
Moving to new business. We announced an increase of our pipeline hydrogen supply to Marathon Petroleum in Garyville, Louisiana. We are pleased with this latest expansion of our relationship, as we have been supplying this refinery for almost 20 years. Marathon will continue to benefit from the reliability and flexibility of the Air Products Gulf Coast hydrogen pipeline system. This is the world's largest hydrogen pipeline.
As I mentioned in the Merchant discussion, we also announced the expansion of our facility in Middletown, Ohio, including a new air separation unit and a new hydrogen production plant. We have been supplying pipeline and Merchant customers from this facility since the 1960s.
Please turn to Slide 8, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $576 million were up 28% compared to last year on 23% higher volumes and 3% positive pricing. Sequentially, sales were up 9% on 6% higher volumes and 2% higher prices. 
Electronics sales were up 33% compared to last year and up 6% sequentially, as the industry continued to demonstrate strong growth. This sequential sales increase is particularly notable given the typical slowdown for Lunar New Year.
Electronics Specialty Materials sales increased 16% versus prior year and 4% sequentially. Ongoing Tonnage sales were up 18% versus prior year and 3% sequentially, and our Equipment business was up significantly versus prior year and sequentially.
The Electronics Specialty Materials pricing was essentially flat versus last year and last quarter. Performance Materials sales increased 22% versus last year, with volumes up 16% and pricing up 5%. Our pricing actions successfully recovered increased raw material costs. Sequentially, sales rose 14% with a stronger-than-typical rebound from normal Q1 seasonality.
Segment operating income of $92 million is the highest ever for this segment, up 61% versus prior year, primarily due to volume leverage and the positive effect of the Electronics restructuring actions taken last year. Income was up 33% sequentially due to volume leverage and the inventory revaluation in Q1.
The segment operating margin of 15.9% improved 330 basis points from last year, due to higher volumes and improved productivity. Sequentially, margins were up to 280 basis points on higher volumes and the Q1 inventory revaluation.
In terms of the Japan tragedy, our first thoughts go to the victims and their recovery efforts. We did not see any significant impact on our business during Q2. In terms of new business, last month, we announced the new nitrogen plant and pipeline at our Hwaseong, Korea site to supply Samsung Electronics fabs in the Hwaseong-Giheung area.
And yesterday, we announced an expansion of our Carlsbad, California electronic materials development and production facility, supporting product development, process demonstration, new product scale-up and performance testing to create the next-generation materials our electronics customers needs. Now please turn to Slide 9, Equipment and Energy.
Sales of $114 million were down 5% versus prior year and up 1%, sequentially, reflecting lower ASU activity. Operating income of $23 million increased 24% versus prior year and 11% sequentially due to higher LNG activity. Our backlog is lower, both versus prior year and sequentially. We expect it to improve by the end of the year. 
We did announce an the new LNG technology and equipment order from JGC Corporation for the 2 million ton per year Donggi-Senoro LNG project in Indonesia. Air Products' leading LNG technology has been supporting projects in Indonesia since the late 1970s.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul."

Now if you'll turn to Slide 10. I'd like to share my thoughts on our outlook.

Now if you'll turn to Slide 10. I'd like to share my thoughts on our outlook. Our guidance for quarter three is for earnings per share of $1.42 to $1.47, which is a year-over-year growth of 11% to 15% and is based on the following factors. 
On the positive side, we expect to see increased earnings sequentially from the following areas. We expect the manufacturing economy globally to continue its gradual recovery. This along with some seasonal boost should result in higher sequential volumes in Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments. We also expect better cost performance in our Merchant segment, as the operating and related distribution impacts should not repeat this quarter. And our fiscal quarter three tax rate will be lower, as we anticipate closing some open tax audits. Our tax rate next quarter should be 24% to 25%. For the year, we expect the rate to come in towards the lower end of our original guidance range of 25% to 26%.
Partially offsetting these sequential improvements, in Tonnage, results will be down sequentially. We expect that our operating bonuses will be lower, as these bonuses are tied to contract year end, and quarter two is our peak bonus quarter.
Also, quarter three will be the highest quarter for maintenance spending this year. As Simon told you, we coincide our maintenance outage timing with our customer plant shutdowns. For quarter four, we expect significantly higher operating income in Tonnage.
And in Equipment and Energy, we expect lower results, as our air separation unit backlog is currently low. As a result, we expect operating income in the second half of the year will be about half of what we recorded in the first half. As Simon mentioned, we expect to add orders to our backlog by fiscal year end.
To date, we have not experienced any significant business impacts from the Japan tragedy. Japan represents only about 2% of our revenue. While all our electronics customers are continuing to operate at high utilization rates, there is still some uncertainty on the potential global supply chain impact. On balance, we do not expect any material impact on our business and have reflected this in our guidance.
For fiscal year 2011, the underlying assumptions from the beginning of the year remain unchanged. Our capital expenditure guidance also remains unchanged at $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, up from last year's $1.3 billion.
With half of our fiscal year completed, we're raising our earnings per share guidance, increasing our full year guidance range to $5.65 to $5.75, 13% to 15% growth over last year.
Now let me wrap up. With the first half of our fiscal year behind us, we are off to a great start in 2011, with sales and earnings continuing to grow. We also continue to improve our operating margin and our return on capital. As I mentioned, we are all proud of the fact that we increased our dividend by 18%, marking 29 consecutive years of increases. We are confident that we can continue to drive strong growth and higher returns over our planning horizon. 
Before the recession, we generated annual top line growth of 14% from 2004 through 2008, with underlying growth of 9%. As we have emerged from the recession, we have seen this underlying growth rate increase and have consistently beaten our competitors.
We expect that our revenue growth will continue this strong pace because of the following factors: First, with the world experiencing higher energy costs and more environmental pressures, we are seeing industrial gases being used in more and more processes, applications and industries, as companies look to increase energy efficiency and improved environmental performance.
Second, as the manufacturing grows in the emerging markets to serve the needs of their large populations, we are seeing industrial gas usage to grow significantly in those countries. 
Finally, Air Products' leading position in the electronics, hydrogen and energy markets, coupled with our leading position in a number of the Asian countries, makes us the industrial gas company that has the best opportunity to take advantage of these macro trends.
We've also demonstrated our commitment to improve returns by increasing our return on capital employed by about 300 basis points over the past six years. We believe we have a number of opportunities to further expand our returns. Some examples are: As we look to the future, we still have operating leverage in our existing facilities. We are also pursuing a number of programs to improve the way we price our products, simplify the way we do business with our customers and suppliers, improve the efficiency and output of our plants and lower the capital costs of our investments. 
We are excited by these opportunities and believe that they will make us the best investment in our industry going forward. To find out more about what we are doing and what our long-term goals are, please join us at our investor conference on June 9 for a day of presentations, questions-and-answers and interactive discussions regarding Air Products strategy, opportunities and outlook. You will have a chance to discuss our businesses and interface with a broad cross section of our management team. If you're interested in attending, please contact our Investor Relations team.

We certainly intend to continue to drive the margins in that business. The thing, which has driven them are two things: First, we have very strong volume growth, not only from our existing product but some of the new products, which we've introduced. And those new products come in at a very nice margin for us. So that has helped, and the leverage on our facilities certainly has helped. Second, as everyone knows, we have put that group through a lot of changes over the past few years and those changes have paid off in increased margins and better operations for that facility, for their facilities and the way they operate. So yes, we do think that we have a sustainable model in there and that we will continue to experience good growth. With regard to Japan, from an Electronics standpoint, we don't -- to date we have not seen any real impacts. We watched our volumes very closely through April. Our volumes look good with things. We've talked our customers. Our customers continue to operate. There's obviously people who are concerned about supply chain. Apple recently commented that they do not see any issues with it. That's good news from our standpoint, because they are downstream, people who produce units. And so, we hope that, as we go forward, and that it won't be a problem for us."

If you look at it, we did get the volume leverage that we have had. We've had good volume growth in the business here. We lost the volume leverage, principally because of a couple of items. Number one, we had some operating problems at facilities, which caused us, actually, distribution cost to move product around, higher cost to operate and maintain those facilities and fix those problems. Now some of those costs will go away in the next quarter, but there will be more costs, which need to go away in the longer term to get that. The second factor is that we have not delivered in this quarter, we have not delivered the productivity gains, which we have planned upon. And that something we need to fix and get moving forward. We constantly have inflation in this business, as anyone in any business has. We aim to more than offset our inflation on the productivity end. We did not do that this quarter, obviously, and we fell back a little bit. And so, we are attempting to come out of that. Will margins come back up to the quarter one levels in quarter three? We're going to try to get them back up, but that's a large test for us. I will to tell you that right now. But we do expect to start to see continued improvement, as we look to the future here and see margins improve on a sequential basis in quarter three and in quarter four."

Good question on NF3. So, obviously, there's a lot of facilities in Japan. And this is a broader comment in just NF3, they are affected not only by potential damage, but also by rolling power outages. SO we don't know exactly what our competitors are doing, but NF3 is a type of process where you'd have a very difficult around the plant if you were still experiencing rolling power outages. So we have seen increased requests for product from our customers. I would say that NF3 pricing specifically was slightly positive versus last year and also slightly positive sequentially. This is some of the things we've talked over the last few quarters about mitigating the downward pressure. We are starting to see some positive effects there. Now keep in mind, NF3 is roughly around 10% of our Electronics sales. And so while that is a flat to slightly up, we also have some of the newer products that we are pleased our customers are adopting, and we have shown them some price volume curves. So on balance, as we've said before, for the Electronics segment, we'll probably see stable pricing going forward. The other point to make about NF3 is we typically have this under contracts. Now they're not as long as the contracts and the other aspects of our business for about a year. So we're certainly honoring our contracts and we're looking to manage the pricing availability with our customer relationships as best as we can."

About half of that is unrecovered inflation, where we didn't get the productivity savings, which we were planning on getting for us. The remainder of that then sits in two other areas. The first is the cost of additional power and the variable costs of moved product around from an operation standpoint. In other words, you've got a plant out in a particular, so you got to move product a longer distances to serve the customer. We have the capacity in most products to be able to do that. So we didn't lose a lot in volume. We lost some in volume, but we didn't lose lot. And then the additional fixed cost to fix the plants and maintaining the plants and stuff like that, that was the other half of those things. Those are split about even, when you look at that. With regard to pricing overall in this segment, we have about recovered the variable cost increases, which we saw year-on-year for those things. So pricing, we can pick on certain areas in certain regions. But on net, overall, it looked good. There is opportunity for us to increase margins with the pricing. Particularly in places like Europe and in some of the recovery areas of some of the cost. With regard to the surcharges on diesel costs and things like that, diesel was not a huge issue for us in this quarter, as I said. But our surcharges typically will hold on it [ph] they'd lag by a month or so for us before we can get that out to the customer. Maybe it varies contract by contract."

With half of our fiscal year behind us, we are well on our way towards delivering on our 2011 financial goals. For the quarter, sales of $2.5 billion were up 11% versus prior year on growth in our Electronics and Performance Materials, Tonnage and Merchant segments. Underlying sales increased 12% on 11% higher volumes and 1% higher pricing. 
Sequentially, sales were 5% higher. Underlying sales were up 3%, with volumes contributing 2% and pricing adding 1%. This sequential improvement was driven primarily by our Electronics and Performance Materials segment and our Merchant Gases segment. Operating income of $425 million increased 17% from prior year, primarily on higher volumes. Our operating margins improved to 17%, up 80 basis points versus prior year. We remain on track to deliver on our 17% goal for fiscal 2011. For the quarter, net income increased 16% and diluted earnings per share increased by 15%, each versus prior year. Return on capital employed for the quarter improved to 13.3%, up 110 basis points.
Turning to Slide 4 for a review of the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our adjusted earnings per share increased by 15% or $0.18 per share. Higher volumes in the Electronics and Performance Materials, Tonnage and Merchant segments increased earnings per share by $0.27 year-on-year.
The impact of pricing, combined with energy and raw material costs, attracted $0.02. Costs were $0.04 unfavorable, as our productivity gains were more than offset by higher operating, maintenance and distribution costs, particularly in our Merchant segment.
Currency translation and foreign exchange netted to a $0.01 unfavorable impact, and the higher tax rate and higher shares outstanding cost us a $0.01 each. In March, we announced an 18% dividend increase, marking 29 consecutive years of increases. We are all proud of this record.
Also, in this past quarter, we repurchased $350 million of our stock, about 3.8 million shares. We have $300 million remaining on our repurchase authorization.
In summary, this was another quarter of solid gains in sales, earnings, margins and returns. Now I'll turn the call over to Simon to review our business segment results. Simon?"

Currency increased sales by 1%. Year-on-year sale",1202,"Thanks, Paul. Please turn to Slide 5, Merchant Gases. Merchant Gases sales of just over $1 billion were up 10% versus prior year. Underlying sales improved by 9% on 8% higher volumes and positive pricing.  Currency increased sales by 1%. Year-on-year sales improvement was driven by volume growth across the segment, with the greatest improvement in Asia. Sequentially, sales were up 3% with underlying sales up 2% even with the lunar New Year holiday.
Merchant Gases operating income of $185 million was up 4% versus prior year and down 8% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 18.3% was down 100 basis points versus prior year and down 200 basis points sequentially.
Versus last year, volume leverage was more than offset by higher operating, maintenance and distribution costs and lower pricing in European healthcare. We had a number of plant operating challenges that increased maintenance costs and resulted in a higher distribution cost, as we reallocated our supply chain to meet customers' needs.
Versus prior quarter, the same cost impacts, combined with the smaller sequential volume increase, drove the margin decline. We believe these challenges are largely behind us and expect operating margins to improve through the rest of the year. Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to Slide 6.
In North America, sales improved 5% versus prior year. Volumes were up 3% on growth across all product lines. Pricing was positive with a 2% broad-based increased led by Helium. LOX/LIN pricing was up 2%.
LOX/LIN plant loading remained in the mid-70s. During the quarter, we announced plans to construct a new liquid nitrogen production facility in Mooreland, Oklahoma, to further strengthen our leadership position in supplying the region's oil field services market.
We also announced an increase in merchant oxygen and argon production at Middletown, Ohio. This facility and expansion are fully integrated with an increase of our on-site oxygen supply.
These 2 opportunities were driven by specific opportunities to create value. As always, we will carefully consider loadings, as we manage capacity going forward. In Europe, sales increased 3% versus last year. Volumes were up 4% with strong liquid bulk growth, particularly liquid oxygen and nitrogen, up 9%. Packaged gas volumes were up slightly, and healthcare volumes were flat.
Pricing was down 1% with positive packaged gas pricing offset by unfavorable healthcare and liquid bulk pricing. Our LOX/LIN plant loading remained in the low 80s.
In Asia, sales were up 30% versus last year, with underlying sales up 25%. Volumes were up 18%, with strength across all products led by the electronics market. Pricing was also strong, up 7%, the highest increase in over 4 years. We were able to continue to take advantage of the higher spot argon pricing in China that we mentioned last quarter. LOX/LIN pricing stayed strong across Asia, up 3%. Plant loadings were in the mid-80s, with a slight dip through the lunar New Year. We will continue to bring new capacity onstream over the next few quarters. Please turn to Slide 7, Tonnage Gases.
Tonnage gases sales of $799 million, increased 6% versus last year, with volumes up 10% in energy and raw material pass-through decreasing sales by 5%. The volume increase was primarily driven by our refinery hydrogen customers.
Sequentially, sales were up 4% on flat volumes and higher energy and raw material pass-through. New plant volume growth was offset by scheduled outages. These maintenance outages are scheduled to coincide with our customer outages to eliminate any impact on their operations.
Operating income of $121 million rose 13% from the prior year on higher new plant volumes and increased operating efficiencies, particularly in our Gulf Coast system. Operating margin of 15.1% increased 90 basis points versus prior year, due to improved operating efficiency and lower natural gas costs pass-through.
Moving to new business. We announced an increase of our pipeline hydrogen supply to Marathon Petroleum in Garyville, Louisiana. We are pleased with this latest expansion of our relationship, as we have been supplying this refinery for almost 20 years. Marathon will continue to benefit from the reliability and flexibility of the Air Products Gulf Coast hydrogen pipeline system. This is the world's largest hydrogen pipeline.
As I mentioned in the Merchant discussion, we also announced the expansion of our facility in Middletown, Ohio, including a new air separation unit and a new hydrogen production plant. We have been supplying pipeline and Merchant customers from this facility since the 1960s.
Please turn to Slide 8, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $576 million were up 28% compared to last year on 23% higher volumes and 3% positive pricing. Sequentially, sales were up 9% on 6% higher volumes and 2% higher prices. 
Electronics sales were up 33% compared to last year and up 6% sequentially, as the industry continued to demonstrate strong growth. This sequential sales increase is particularly notable given the typical slowdown for Lunar New Year.
Electronics Specialty Materials sales increased 16% versus prior year and 4% sequentially. Ongoing Tonnage sales were up 18% versus prior year and 3% sequentially, and our Equipment business was up significantly versus prior year and sequentially.
The Electronics Specialty Materials pricing was essentially flat versus last year and last quarter. Performance Materials sales increased 22% versus last year, with volumes up 16% and pricing up 5%. Our pricing actions successfully recovered increased raw material costs. Sequentially, sales rose 14% with a stronger-than-typical rebound from normal Q1 seasonality.
Segment operating income of $92 million is the highest ever for this segment, up 61% versus prior year, primarily due to volume leverage and the positive effect of the Electronics restructuring actions taken last year. Income was up 33% sequentially due to volume leverage and the inventory revaluation in Q1.
The segment operating margin of 15.9% improved 330 basis points from last year, due to higher volumes and improved productivity. Sequentially, margins were up to 280 basis points on higher volumes and the Q1 inventory revaluation.
In terms of the Japan tragedy, our first thoughts go to the victims and their recovery efforts. We did not see any significant impact on our business during Q2. In terms of new business, last month, we announced a new nitrogen plant and pipeline at our Hwaseong, Korea site to supply Samsung Electronics fabs in the Hwaseong-Giheung area.
And yesterday, we announced an expansion of our Carlsbad, California electronic materials development and production facility, supporting product development, process demonstration, new product scale-up and performance testing to create the next-generation materials our electronics customers needs. Now please turn to Slide 9, Equipment and Energy.
Sales of $114 million were down 5% versus prior year and up 1%, sequentially, reflecting lower ASU activity. Operating income of $23 million increased 24% versus prior year and 11% sequentially due to higher LNG activity. Our backlog is lower, both versus prior year and sequentially. We expect it to improve by the end of the year. 
We did announce the new LNG technology and equipment order from JGC Corporation for the 2 million ton per year Donggi-Senoro LNG project in Indonesia. Air Products' leading LNG technology has been supporting projects in Indonesia since the late 1970s.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul."

Now if you'll turn to Slide 10. I'd like to share my thoughts on our outlook.

Now if you'll turn to Slide 10. I'd like to share my thoughts on our outlook. Our guidance for quarter three is for earnings per share of $1.42 to $1.47, which is a year-over-year growth of 11% to 15% and is based on the following factors. 
On the positive side, we expect to see increased earnings sequentially from the following areas. We expect the manufacturing economy globally to continue its gradual recovery. This along with some seasonal boost should result in higher sequential volumes in Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments. We also expect better cost performance in our Merchant segment, as the operating and related distribution impacts should not repeat this quarter. And our fiscal quarter three tax rate will be lower, as we anticipate closing some open tax audits. Our tax rate next quarter should be 24% to 25%. For the year, we expect the rate to come in towards the lower end of our original guidance range of 25% to 26%.
Partially offsetting these sequential improvements, in Tonnage, results will be down sequentially. We expect that our operating bonuses will be lower, as these bonuses are tied to contract year end, and quarter two is our peak bonus quarter.
Also, quarter three will be the highest quarter for maintenance spending this year. As Simon told you, we coincide our maintenance outage timing with our customer plant shutdowns. For quarter four, we expect significantly higher operating income in Tonnage.
And in Equipment and Energy, we expect lower results, as our air separation unit backlog is currently low. As a result, we expect operating income in the second half of the year will be about half of what we recorded in the first half. As Simon mentioned, we expect to add orders to our backlog by fiscal year end.
To date, we have not experienced any significant business impacts from the Japan tragedy. Japan represents only about 2% of our revenue. While our electronics customers are continuing to operate at high utilization rates, there is still some uncertainty on the potential global supply chain impact. On balance, we do not expect any material impact on our business and have reflected this in our guidance.
For fiscal year 2011, the underlying assumptions from the beginning of the year remain unchanged. Our capital expenditure guidance also remains unchanged at $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, up from last year's $1.3 billion.
With half of our fiscal year completed, we're raising our earnings per share guidance, increasing our full year guidance range to $5.65 to $5.75, 13% to 15% growth over last year.
Now let me wrap up. With the first half of our fiscal year behind us, we are off to a great start in 2011, with sales and earnings continuing to grow. We also continue to improve our operating margin and our return on capital. As I mentioned, we are all proud of the fact that we increased our dividend by 18%, marking 29 consecutive years of increases. We are confident that we can continue to drive strong growth and higher returns over our planning horizon. 
Before the recession, we generated annual top line growth of 14% from 2004 through 2008, with underlying growth of 9%. As we have emerged from the recession, we have seen this underlying growth rate increase and have consistently beaten our competitors.
We expect that our revenue growth will continue this strong pace because of the following factors: First, with the world experiencing higher energy costs and more environmental pressures, we are seeing industrial gases being used in more and more processes, applications and industries, as companies look to increase energy efficiency and improved environmental performance.
Second, as the manufacturing grows in the emerging markets to serve the needs of their large populations, we are seeing industrial gas usage grow significantly in those countries. 
Finally, Air Products' leading position in the electronics, hydrogen and energy markets, coupled with our leading position in a number of the Asian countries, makes us the industrial gas company that has the best opportunity to take advantage of these macro trends.
We've also demonstrated our commitment to improve returns by increasing our return on capital employed by about 300 basis points over the past 6 years. We believe we have a number of opportunities to further expand our returns. Some examples are: As we look to the future, we still have operating leverage in our existing facilities. We are also pursuing a number of programs to improve the way we price our products, simplify the way we do business with our customers and suppliers, improve the efficiency and output of our plants and lower the capital costs of our investments. 
We are excited by these opportunities and believe that they will make us the best investment in our industry going forward. To find out more about what we are doing and what our long-term goals are, please join us at our investor conference on June 9 for a day of presentations, questions-and-answers and interactive discussions regarding Air Products strategy, opportunities and outlook. You will have a chance to discuss our businesses and interface with a broad cross section of our management team. If you're interested in attending, please contact our Investor Relations team.

We certainly intend to continue to drive margins in that business. The thing, which has driven them are two things: First, we have very strong volume growth, not only from our existing product but some of the new products, which we've introduced. And those new products come in at a very nice margin for us. So that has helped, and the leverage on our facilities certainly has helped. Second, as everyone knows, we have put that group through a lot of changes over the past few years and those changes have paid off in increased margins and better operations for that facility, for their facilities and the way they operate. So yes, we do think that we have a sustainable model in there and that we will continue to experience good growth. With regard to Japan, from an Electronics standpoint, we don't -- to date we have not seen any real impacts. We watched our volumes very closely through April. Our volumes look good with things. We've talked our customers. Our customers continue to operate. There's obviously people who are concerned about supply chain. Apple recently commented that they do not see any issues with it. That's good news from our standpoint, because they are downstream, people who produce units. And so, we hope that, as we go forward, and that it won't be a problem for us."

If you look at it, we did get the volume leverage that we have had. We've had good volume growth in the business here. We lost the volume leverage, principally because of a couple of items. Number one, we had some operating problems at facilities, which caused us, actually, distribution cost to move product around, higher cost to operate and maintain those facilities and fix those problems. Now some of those costs will go away in the next quarter, but there will be more costs, which need to go away in the longer term to get that. The second factor is that we have not delivered in this quarter, we have not delivered the productivity gains, which we have planned upon. And that's something, which we need to fix and get moving forward. We constantly have inflation in this business, as anyone in any business has. We aim to more than offset our inflation on the productivity end. We did not do that this quarter, obviously, and we fell back a little bit. And so, we are attempting to come out of that. Will margins jump back up to the quarter one levels in quarter three? We're going to try to get them back up, but that's a large test for us. I will tell you that right now. But we do expect to start to see continued improvement, as we look to the future here and see margins improve on a sequential basis in quarter three and in quarter four."

So, obviously, there's a lot of facilities in Japan, and this is a broader comment than just NF3, that are affected not only by any potential damage, but also by rolling power outages. SO we don't know exactly what our competitors are doing, but NF3 is a type of process where you'd have a very difficult time to run the plant if you were still experiencing rolling power outages. So we have seen increased requests for product from our customers. I would say that NF3 pricing specifically was slightly positive versus last year and also slightly positive sequentially. So some of the things we've talked about over the last few quarters about mitigating the downward pressure, we are starting to see some positive effects there. Now keep in mind, NF3 is roughly around 10% of our Electronics sales. And so while that is a flat to slightly up, we also have some of the newer products that we are pleased our customers are adopting, and we have shown them some price volume curves. So on balance, as we've said before, for the Electronics segment, we'll probably see stable pricing going forward. The other point to make about NF3 is we typically have this under contracts. Now they're not as long as the contracts in the other aspects of our business so about a year. So we're certainly honoring our contracts and we're looking to manage the price and availability with our customer relationships as best as we can."

About half of that is unrecovered inflation, where we didn't get the productivity savings, which we were planning on getting for us. The remainder of that then sits in 2 other areas. The first is the cost of additional power and the variable costs to move product around from an operation standpoint. In other words, you've got a plant out in a particular place, so you got to move product to longer distances to serve the customer. We have the capacity in most products to be able to do that. So we didn't lose a lot in volume. We lost some in volume, but we didn't lose a lot. And then the additional fixed cost to fix the plants and maintain the plants and stuff like that, that was the other half of those things. Those are split about even, when you look at that. With regard to pricing overall in this segment, we about recovered the variable cost increases, which we saw year-on-year for those things. So pricing, we can pick on certain areas in certain regions. But on net, overall, it looked good. There is opportunity for us to increase margins with the pricing as I covered before, particularly in places like Europe and in some of the recovery areas of some of the cost. With regard to the surcharges on diesel costs and things like that, diesel was not a huge issue for us in this quarter, as I said. But our surcharges typically will go on the way they lag, by a month or so for us before we can get that out to the customer. And it varies contract by contract."

And then again just a couple of things, we said on the Performance Materials side, we were successful with the price increases we took out recovering additional costs on the Performance Materials side. So good work by the team there. On the Electronics side, we said that the Specialty Materials, and obviously, as Paul said historically that's the area that has the most variability and has had the most downward pressure. That was flat versus last year and basically flat versus last quarter in Specialty Materials. So that's a big change from the historical direction that this business has been taking. I gave you a little bit more color specifically on NF3. But again, we have a suite of products in this area, and I think we'd say, stable pricing going forward as we continue to drive productivity, allows us the opportunity to expand margins."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Please turn to Slide #3.For the quarter, sales of $2.6 billion were up 14% versus prior year. Underlying sales increased 7% on 6% higher volumes primarily in our Electronics and P",719,"Thanks, Simon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. 
Please turn to Slide #3.
For the quarter, sales of $2.6 billion were up 14% versus prior year. Underlying sales increased 7% on 6% higher volumes primarily in our Electronics and Performance Materials and Tonnage segments and 1% higher pricing. Favorable currency translation contributed 5%. Sequentially, sales were 3% higher mainly due to currency. And while we did see sequential volume growth in our Electronics and Performance Materials and Tonnage segments, Merchant Gases volumes were flat sequentially and Equipment sales declined.
Operating income of $417 million increase 11% from prior year, primarily due to higher volumes. Our operating margin of 16.2% declined 40 basis points versus prior year and 80 basis points sequentially due to higher operating costs in our Merchant segment and planned maintenance costs in our Tonnage segment. 
For the quarter, net income from continuing operations increased 15% and diluted earnings per share increased 14%, each versus prior year. Return on capital employed for the quarter improved to 13%, up 30 basis points. The 16.2% operating margin for this quarter is disappointment for us. The shortfall to our goal is primarily in the Merchant segment due to 4 factors: A lack of volume growth in the North American business where we have significant available capacity; further declines in our European business; continued operating problems that resulted in higher operating and dislocation costs; and tight helium supply with increased procurement costs. 
To remedy these issues, we are taking the following assets. In North America, we are continuing to add sales resources focused around our plants and on the end markets where we have strong offerings. For example, oil field services and Electronics packaging. We've already seen signings in the third quarter improved and we expect continued improvement. It does take about 6 to 9 months for new signings to come online. We will also continue to drive the price improvement.
In Europe, we continue to face a slow recovery along with the pricing environment that is under recovering our variable cost increases. To address this, we had raised prices for a number of products and in a number of countries and we'll have more price increases this quarter to stop price and variable margin erosion.
We will strongly defend our volumes from competitive attack. However, there are certain accounts that we will either improve or shed. We are focusing our sales efforts on customers close to our plants to lower our distribution costs and to leverage our application strength in areas like cement and combustion.
For our operating performance, we are working hard across our system to increase planned availability and reduce unplanned outages. An example is argon production, where product has been tight and operating and distribution costs have been high. Tonnage experience is currently underway, such as of the new Freeport plant, scheduled to come on stream later this year will enhance our argon availability.
Regarding helium, we have and we'll be raising prices further, and we will be bringing on additional capacity later this year. Overall, we are forecasting Merchant margins to improve next quarter, and we now expect to meet our 20% margin goal in fiscal 2012, on our way to our 21% to 24% goal for 2015. 
While Merchant margins are disappointing, the Electronics and Performance Materials segment exceeded their 15% goal posting a year-to-date margin of 15.8% and 18.1% for this quarter. This performance has offset some of the Merchant shortfall. While this quarter just made it harder on ourselves, we're still committed to achieving our 17% goal for the year.
Turning to Slide 4 for a review of the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our adjusted earnings per share increased by 14% or $0.18 per share. Higher volumes increased earnings per share by $0.14 year-on-year. Pricing combined with the impact of energy and raw materials subtracted $0.02. Costs were $0.06 unfavorable as our productivity gains were more than offset by higher operating and maintenance and distribution costs, particularly in our Merchant segment.
equity affiliate income was broadly higher across our Merchant, Tonnage and Electronics segments contributing $0.03. Currency translation and foreign exchange netted to a $0.09 favorable impact. Now I'll turn the call over to Simon to review our business segment results. Simon?"

Merchant Gases sales of just over $1 billion were up 12% versus prior year. Underlying sales improved by 4% on 3% higher volumes primarily in Asia and positive pricing in North America and Asia. Currency increased sales by 8%. 
Sequentially, sales were up 1% with underlying sales flat and a 1% increase due to currency. Merchant Gases' operating income of $182 million was up 3% versus prior year and down 2% sequentially. 
Segment operating margin of 17.7% was down 160 basis points versus prior year and down 60 basis points sequentially. Versus last year, plant operating issues increased maintenance and distribution costs. These challenges resulted in higher dislocation cost to keep our customers supplied. 
In addition, our price increase efforts in Europe did not fully recovered increased cost. Versus the quarter, fixed and variable cost increases drove the margin decline. 
As Paul said, we expect margins to improve from these levels in Q4 and beyond. Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to Slide 6.
In North America, sales improved 3% versus prior year. Volumes were flat with modest liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon growth offset by helium supply constraints limiting sales. Pricing was 3% positive with improvement across the product lines. 
LOX/LIN plant loadings were in the low 70s. Signings were very strong this quarter, which will improve loadings as these new contracts take effect. 
In Europe, sales increased 14% versus last year with underlying sales up 1% and a positive 13% currency impact. Volumes were up 2% with modest growth across the product lines. Pricing remained a challenge, down 1% due to competitive pressure in both healthcare and liquid bulk. LOX/LIN plant loadings are in the mid-80s.
In Asia, sales were up 22% versus last year with underlying sales up 15%. As expected, growth rates have moderated somewhat from previous quarters as we have moved to tougher year-on-year comparisons. Overall volume growth remains strong. Volumes were up 12% with liquid oxygen and nitrogen up 13% across the region and up 19% in China. Pricing continued to be strong, up 3% with liquid oxygen and nitrogen prices up modestly. Argon pricing was strong versus last year, but as expected, we did see lower sequential argon pricing due to less spot sales in China with a more balanced supply and demand markets.
Plant loadings remained in the mid-80s. We did bring on stream our new merchant capacity at Xingtai Steel in China, integrated with our Tonnage oxygen plant. 
Please turn to Slide 7, Tonnage Gases.
Tonnage Gases sales of $869 million increased 20% versus last year with volumes up 11% and energy and raw material pass-through increasing sales by 7%. The volume increase was driven by both new projects and improved loadings. Sequentially, sales were up 9% on a 5% volume increase and 3% higher energy and raw material pass-through.
New plant volume growth and less volume impact for maintenance outages drove the increase. 
Operating income of $115 million was down 4% from prior year on a higher maintenance cost, primarily from customer scheduled outages and down 5% sequentially due to lower annual operating bonuses. After a number of scheduled maintenance outages in Q2 and Q3, we expect Q4 maintenance spending to be lower.
Operating margin of 13.2% decreased 330 basis points versus prior year. About 2/3 of this decline is due to the maintenance cost just mentioned, the remainder is due to higher natural gas cost pass-thru.
Moving to new business, we were pleased to announce a significant increase in our hydrogen supply to Valero's 2 Gulf Coast refineries. This awarded over 200 million standard cubic feet a day for Valero and Portland, Texas and St. Charles, Louisiana was facilitated by our Gulf Coast pipeline project and expands our leading global hydrogen position.
We expect to announce additional hydrogen and oxygen awards in Q4. 
Please turn to Slide 8, Electronics and Performance Materials.
We were very pleased with this quarter's performance as sales, income and margin were all the highest in the history of this segment. Segment sales of $602 million were up 21% compared to last year on 14% higher volumes, 3% positive pricing and 4% currency. 
Sequentially, sales were up 5% on 3% higher volumes and 1% higher prices. Electronic sales were up 24% compared to last year and up 3% sequentially as the industry maintained high utilization rates.
Electronics Specialty Materials sales increased 14% versus prior year and 6% sequentially. Tonnage sales were up 12% versus prior year and 4% sequentially and our Equipment business was up significantly versus prior year and sequentially.
Electronics Specialty Materials pricing was flat versus last year and last quarter. As we communicated at the Investor Conference, we continue to see more stable pricing. In fact, NF3 prices were up slightly versus last year and sequentially. This positive impact was offset by lower new product pricing resulting from higher new product volumes based on previously negotiated price volume discounts. This is good news as customers move our profitable new products into full production.
Performance Materials sales increased 18% versus last year with volumes up 7%, pricing up 7% and currency contributing 4%. We continue to recover increased raw material costs with our pricing actions. 
Sequentially, sales rose 6% on 3% volume growth and 2% price. Operating income of $109 million was up 75% versus prior year primarily due to volume leverage and continued positive cost performance. Income was up 19% sequentially primarily due to volume leverage.
Segment operating margin of 18.1% improved 550 basis points from last year and 220 basis points sequentially due to strong volume and cost performance. As expected, we do not see any material impact to our business from the tragic events in Japan. 
There have been some signs of softening in certain Electronics sectors, including foundry and LCD. However, you probably saw the very strong results from Apple and Intel exceeded expectations in results reported this week. As we have said, we believe our strong position with the industry leaders and our new product success will mitigate any effect, and we expect continued strong performance from this segment. 
In terms of new projects, last month we announced the successful startup of our new Electronic Materials facility in Bangua, Korea. This facility will produce products enabling our customers to create advanced generation devices and reinforces our leadership position in the Electronics market.
During the quarter, we announced plans to increase production of ultrahigh purity nitrogen and oxygen and expand the nitrogen pipeline at our Chandler, Arizona facility. We have successfully served semiconductor manufacturers in Chandler for over 20 years.
Finally, earlier this week, we announced an expansion of our nitrogen capacity and pipeline network at the Gumi National Industrial Complex in Korea. We currently supply nearly 20 semiconductor and photovoltaic customers via our pipeline network. This expansion will support existing customer growth and new customers.
Now please turn to Slide 9, Equipment and Energy.
Sales of $80 million were down 31% versus prior year on lower ASU sales and 30% sequentially on lower ASU and LNG sales. Operating income of $9 million was down 59% versus prior year due to lower sales in the prior year asset gain and 62% sequentially due to lower sales.
Our backlog is down versus prior year, but as expected showed a 34% increase sequentially primarily driven by our new LNG technology and equipment order for the world's first floating LNG facility at Shales Australia Trail project. We leveraged our innovative capabilities and years of LNG experience to meet the unique demands of the successful floating LNG facility and we feel we're well positioned to benefit from that could be a major LNG trend.

This quarter, our underlying revenue growth rate declined from 12% in the first half to 7%. This i",455,"Thanks, Simon. Now if you'll turn to Slide 10. I'd like to share my thoughts on our outlook. 
First, let's take a look at the current economic environment. This quarter, our underlying revenue growth rate declined from 12% in the first half to 7%. This is partially due to the slowing of manufacturing growth rates across all regions. Many manufacturing markets slowed as a result of spikes in commodity price inflation, high inventory levels, uncertainty over government policies and fiscal situations and weak private sector confidence.
As uncertainties surrounding policy, fiscal and sovereign debt issues begin to resolve over the coming months, we would expect growth to pick up early in our fiscal 2012.
Our guidance for quarter 4 is for earnings per share of $1.48 to $1.53, year-over-year growth of 10% to 13% is based on the following factors. On the positive side, we expect to see increased earnings sequentially from the following areas, the manufacturing economy globally should continue its gradual recovery. This along with some seasonal boost should result in higher sequential volumes in Merchant Gases. And in Tonnage Gases, operating income should improve significantly on higher volumes and lower planned maintenance spending. Partially offsetting these sequential improvements will be a higher fiscal quarter 4 tax rate. Our tax rate in quarter 4 should be about 26%. For the year, we expect the rate to come in towards the lower end of our original guidance range of 25% to 26%.
For fiscal year 2011, the underlying assumptions from the beginning of the year have not changed significantly. Our capital expenditure guidance is now $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion for 2011, at the top end of the original $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion range.
Our full year fiscal 2011 earnings per share guidance range is now $5.70 to $5.75. 14% to 15% growth over last year. While it is still early, as we look to fiscal 2012, we expect our capital spending will increase by 20% to 30% next year. We will provide more specific guidance on next quarter's call. 
Now, let me wrap up. Please turn to Slide 11.
Last month, many of you joined us at our Investor Conference where we shared our 2015 revenue growth and margin and returning goal along with the actions and plans that we have to achieve them. All of us are excited about the growth and improvement opportunities these goals represent. We believe the market positions we have built, the customer relationships and product offerings we have cultivated and the actions we are taking to drive out costs will make us the best investment in our industry for our shareholders.

As a look at there, there's a lot of uncertainty around there. You have to be blind to not see it on every news channel and every newspaper about what's happening with the various things, on the debt crisis. And that worries us, so that worries consumers, which then worries a business, which has to invest, we are creating jobs and so we've got to get beyond this uncertainty. So hopefully as we go through this summer, we resolve some of these issues. We start to move forward. We take some better and get firmer on what the policy actions will be, we'll see the economy uncertainty start to lift a little bit off the economy and people start making decisions with regard to that. But if you look at any of the prediction statistics for the U.S., they've been trending downward as far as the growth rate was concerned. The first half of our fiscal year, which is the last quarter of the calendar year in '10 and the first quarter of the calendar year in 2011, certainly had a stronger economy from a manufacturing standpoint. We are probably seeing growth somewhere in the 6% to 7% range. We are seeing growth less than half of that in the third and fourth quarter if we're lucky given things. So then if you look at that, the impact of our sales force, we started to increase our sales force post things which happened in their guess, so we have already started to see the signings get better for us and so we are seeing that with our people. So I think it doesn't take too long for our sales guys to become effective and start to add some business. It does take us, as I said, some time to bring that business on stream.

So it's not 1 issue, it's a number of issues and they're small and they're different plants around here. And so it's going to be something, which we are going to have to pay attention to. With regard to some of the issues which I mentioned, argon availability has been an issue for us. We do have capacity coming onstream in the on-site area, in both the U.S. and Asia, which will help our argon availability around the world. We've brought some argon capacity on stream at Xingtai Steel, as an example, that will help us. We have a plant coming onstream towards the end of our fiscal year in Freeport, Texas, which will help us with argon availability and also cut down on distribution cost. So it's going to be -- it's not 1 thing, which we can do to fix it, it's a number of things. And then it just getting on to getting the benefits out of the service center investments, which we've made and things like that. So we can do this things. You've seen the progress of focus, which we've made on SG&A as a company. SG&A we didn't make a big deal about it, but SG&A is under 10% of sales this quarter. And if you take currency out of it, SG&A is down year-on-year for us. So we've made -- we continue to make a lot of progress in those areas. We can take cost out. We can be successful at this. We applied the tools, we applied the information systems, which we have good decisions, and we can get this done."

Helium has been tight around the world. It is a commodity which ships around the world. You don't ship in the gas, you ship it in liquid form, in containers. But it has been tight due to various production issues around the world and continued strong growth, a lot of the growth being driven by the Electronics industry for the uses of William. We do have new capacity coming onstream within the United States towards the end of calendar year '11, which will help our supply. One of the things, which is a factor here is the Bureau of Mines, I think it is in the United States, BLM, but landmines. They have a storage amount of helium gradually they've been selling off, in which we own a portion of it, our competitors own a portion of that and that amount is going away. And so we are going to be more reliant on foreign sources of helium globally and the procurement costs for that is higher for these things as we attempt to take these helium, it mainly occurs in gas fields and you strip that out and then you purify it. So it is something which we manage. We are the largest supplier of helium in the world, so it impacts us a decent amount. But we also think that we have a good handle on that. It's just, for me, prices are going to have to go up as we see higher cost for procuring the raw helium."

We did see a very significant decline in pricing if you go back over the last 10 years. But we've definitely seen a stabilization of those larger volume, more mature products. And that's why we were commenting about stable pricing going forward. I did mention that in fact actually NF3 is up slightly year-on-year and sequentially and what's offsetting that and bringing that to flat for Electronics is the great news that some of our new products are being adopted by our customers. What happens when work out these new products, our are customers doing, let's say, a test quantity, we might be supplying from a small pilot plant, and we need a certain price. But for the customer to agree to adopt that product in full production, they need to have a price roadmap and understand where that's going to go before they commit to it. So we often, when we have a new product, we'll pre-renegotiate, let's say, a share of the savings, a price volume curve. So actually seeing prices go down in those new products is very good because it shows that they're being adopted. So if you take the more mature products, slightly up. The newer products, slightly down. That's where Electronics is fairly stable. Of course, the other part of the segment is Performance Materials where the team's done a great job of basically recovering some cost increases with some higher price and that's what's driven the segment."

We acknowledged in our comments that we're seeing some subsegments that are little bit softer, particularly the foundry segment. I think mentioned utilization rates down a little bit going forward. On the flipside of that, in Intel's call, they referenced and I quote, ""increasing confidence in the second half of the year. "" We still see growth in TV and LED. Again, perhaps the growth rates are moderating a little bit. When we take a look at MSI, we had thought MSI for the year going back to our comments back in October was up 5% to 10% for FY '11 over FY '10. I think that we're going to see a little flatter back half of the year in the industry and we saw very strong second half FY '10. So when you put together, we could see MSI growth year-on-year be below that lower end of our range. Having said that, we still see some strength. Apple obviously had tremendous results and as we've explained many times, the pull through from iPads and iPhones, both in terms of computer chips of those devices themselves but again the processing technology capability that has to be in the servers that are doing the math in the cloud, if you will, continue to drive business forward. So I think we should see probably moderating but no significant drop off at all going forward."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Please turn to Slide #3.  For the quarter, sales of $2.6 billion were up 14% versus prior year. Underlying sales increased 7% on 6% higher volumes, primarily in our Electronics and",721,"Thanks, Simon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. 
Please turn to Slide #3.  For the quarter, sales of $2.6 billion were up 14% versus prior year. Underlying sales increased 7% on 6% higher volumes, primarily in our Electronics and Performance Materials and Tonnage segments and 1% higher pricing. Favorable currency translation contributed 5%. Sequentially, sales were 3% higher, mainly due to currency. And while we did see sequential volume growth in our Electronics and Performance Materials and Tonnage segments, Merchant Gases volumes were flat sequentially and Equipment sales declined.
Operating income of $417 million increased 11% from prior year, primarily due to higher volumes. Our operating margin of 16.2% declined 40 basis points versus prior year and 80 basis points sequentially, due to higher operating costs in our Merchant segment and planned maintenance costs in our Tonnage segment. 
For the quarter, net income from continuing operations increased 15% and diluted earnings per share increased 14%, each, versus prior year. Return on capital employed for the quarter improved to 13%, up 30 basis points. The 16.2% operating margin for this quarter is a disappointment for us. The shortfall to our goal is primarily in the Merchant segment due to 4 factors: a lack of volume growth in North -- in the North American business where we have significant available capacity, further declines in our European business, continued operating problems that resulted in higher operating and dislocation costs and tight helium supply with increased procurement costs. 
To remedy these issues, we are taking the following actions. In North America, we are continuing to add sales resources focused around our plants and on the end markets where we have strong offerings. For example, oil field services and electronics packaging. We've already seen signings in the third quarter improved, and we expect continued improvement. It does take about 6 to 9 months for new signings to come on line. We will also continue to drive price improvement.
In Europe, we continue to face a slow recovery, along with the pricing environment that is under recovering our variable cost increases. To address this, we had raised prices for a number of products and in a number of countries, and we'll have more price increases this quarter to stop price and variable margin erosion.
We will strongly defend our volumes from competitive attack. However, there are certain accounts we will either improve or shed. We are focusing our sales efforts on customers close to our plants to lower our distribution costs and to leverage our application strength in areas like cement and combustion.
For our operating performance, we are working hard across our system to increase plant availability and reduce unplanned outages. An example is argon production, where product has been tight and operating and distribution costs have been high. Tonnage expansion is currently underway, such as the new LaPorte plant scheduled to come onstream later this year, will enhance our argon availability.
Regarding helium, we have and we'll be raising prices further, and we will be bringing on additional capacity later this year. Overall, we are forecasting Merchant margins to improve next quarter, and we now expect to meet our 20% margin goal in fiscal 2012, on our way to our 21% to 24% goal for 2015. 
While Merchant margin is disappointed, the Electronics and Performance Materials segment exceeded their 15% goal, posting a year-to-date margin of 15.8% and 18.1% for this quarter. This performance has offset some of the Merchant shortfall. While this quarter just made it harder on ourselves, we are still committed to achieving our 17% goal for the year.
Turning to Slide 4 for a review of the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our adjusted earnings per share increased by 14% or $0.18 per share. Higher volumes increased earnings per share by $0.14 year-on-year. Pricing, combined with the impact of energy and raw materials, subtracted $0.02. Costs were $0.06 unfavorable, as our productivity gains were more than offset by higher operating and maintenance and distribution costs, particularly in our Merchant segment. Equity affiliate income was broadly higher across our Merchant, Tonnage and Electronics segments contributing $0.03. Currency translation and foreign exchange netted to a $0.09 favorable impact. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Simon to review our business segment results. Simon?"

Merchant Gases sales of just over $1 billion were up 12% versus prior year. Underlying sales improved by 4% on 3% higher volumes, primarily in Asia and positive pricing in North America and Asia. Currency increased sales by 8%. Sequentially, sales were up 1%, with underlying sales flat and a 1% increase due to currency. Merchant Gases' operating income of $182 million was up 3% versus prior year and down 2% sequentially. 
Segment operating margin of 17.7% was down 160 basis points versus prior year and down 60 basis points sequentially. Versus last year, plant operating issues increased maintenance and distribution costs. These challenges resulted in higher dislocation costs to keep our customers supplied. 
In addition, our price increase efforts in Europe did not fully recover increased cost. Versus prior quarter, fixed and variable cost increases drove the margin decline. As Paul said, we expect margins to improve from these levels in Q4 and beyond. 
Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to Slide 6. In North America, sales improved 3% versus prior year. Volumes were flat with modest liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon growth offset by helium supply constraints limiting sales. Pricing was 3% positive, with improvement across the product lines. LOX/LIN plant loadings were in the low 70s. Signings were very strong this quarter, which will improve loadings as these new contracts take effect. 
In Europe, sales increased 14% versus last year, with underlying sales up 1% and a positive 13% currency impact. Volumes were up 2% with modest growth across the product lines. Pricing remained a challenge, down 1% due to competitive pressure in both healthcare and liquid bulk. LOX/LIN plant loadings are in the mid-80s.
In Asia, sales were up 22% versus last year, with underlying sales up 15%. As expected, growth rates have moderated somewhat from previous quarters as we have moved to tougher year-on-year comparisons. Overall volume growth remained strong. Volumes were up 12% with liquid oxygen and nitrogen up 13% across the region and up 19% in China. Pricing continued to be strong, up 3% with liquid oxygen and nitrogen prices up modestly. Argon pricing was strong versus last year, but as expected, we did see lower sequential argon pricing due to less spot sales in China with a more balanced supply-and-demand market. Plant loadings remained in the mid-80s. We did bring onstream our new merchant capacity at Xingtai Steel in China integrated with our Tonnage oxygen plant. 
Please turn to Slide 7, Tonnage Gases. Tonnage Gases sales of $869 million increased 20% versus last year, with volumes up 11% and energy and raw material pass-through increasing sales by 7%. The volume increase was driven by both new projects and improved loadings. Sequentially, sales were up 9% on a 5% volume increase and 3% higher energy and raw material pass-through. New plant volume growth and less volume impact for maintenance outages drove the increase. 
Operating income of $115 million was down 4% from prior year on a higher maintenance cost, primarily from customer-scheduled outages, and down 5% sequentially, due to lower annual operating bonuses. After a number of scheduled maintenance outages in Q2 and Q3, we expect Q4 maintenance spending to be lower. Operating margin of 13.2% decreased 330 basis points versus prior year. About 2/3 of this decline is due to the maintenance cost just mentioned, the remainder is due to higher natural gas cost pass-through.
Moving to new business. We were pleased to announce a significant increase in our hydrogen supply to Valero's 2 Gulf Coast refineries. This award of over 200 million standard cubic feet a day for Valero in Port Arthur, Texas and St. Charles, Louisiana was facilitated by our Gulf Coast pipeline project and expands our leading global hydrogen position. We expect to announce additional hydrogen and oxygen awards in Q4. 
Please turn to Slide 8, Electronics and Performance Materials. We were very pleased with this quarter's performance as sales, income and margin were all the highest in the history of the segment. Segment sales of $602 million were up 21% compared to last year, on 14% higher volumes, 3% positive pricing and 4% currency. Sequentially, sales were up 5% on 3% higher volumes and 1% higher prices. 
Electronic sales were up 24% compared to last year and up 3% sequentially, as the industry maintained high utilization rates. Electronic Specialty Materials sales increased 14% versus prior year and 6% sequentially. Tonnage sales were up 12% versus prior year and 4% sequentially, and our Equipment business was up significantly versus prior year and sequentially.
Electronic Specialty Materials pricing was flat versus last year and last quarter. As we communicated at the Investor Conference, we continue to see more stable pricing. In fact, NF3 prices were up slightly both versus last year and sequentially. This positive impact was offset by lower new product pricing, resulting from higher new product volumes based on previously negotiated price volume discounts. This is good news as customers move our profitable new products into full production.
Performance Materials sales increased 18% versus last year, with volumes up 7%, pricing up 7% and currency contributing 4%. We continue to recover increased raw material costs with our pricing actions. Sequentially, sales rose 6% on 3% volume growth and 2% price. 
Operating income of $109 million was up 75% versus prior year, primarily due to volume leverage and continued positive cost performance. Income was up 19% sequentially, primarily due to volume leverage. Segment operating margin of 18.1% improved 550 basis points from last year and 220 basis points sequentially, due to strong volume and cost performance. As expected, we did not see any material impact to our business from the tragic events in Japan. 
There have been some signs of softening in certain electronic sectors, including foundry and LCD. However, you probably saw the very strong results from Apple and Intel exceeding expectations in results reported this week. As we have said, we believe our strong position with the industry leaders and our new product success will mitigate any effect, and we expect continued strong performance from this segment. 
In terms of new projects, last month, we announced the successful startup of our new Electronic Materials facility in Banwol, Korea. This facility will produce products enabling our customers to create advanced generation devices and reinforces our leadership position in the electronics market.
During the quarter, we announced plans to increase production of ultrahigh purity nitrogen and oxygen and expand the nitrogen pipeline at our Chandler, Arizona facility. We have successfully served semiconductor manufacturers in the Chandler market for over 30 years.
Finally, earlier this week, we announced an expansion of our nitrogen capacity and pipeline network at the Gumi National Industrial Complex in Korea. We currently supply nearly 20 semiconductor and photovoltaic customers via our pipeline network. This expansion will support existing customer growth and new customers.
Now please turn to Slide 9, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $80 million were down 31% versus prior year on lower ASU sales and 30% sequentially on lower ASU and LNG sales. Operating income of $9 million was down 59% versus prior year, due to lower sales and a prior year asset gain, and 62% sequentially, due to lower sales.
Our backlog is down versus prior year, but as expected, showed a 34% increase sequentially, primarily driven by our new LNG technology and equipment order for the world's first floating LNG facility at Shell's Australia Prelude Project. We leveraged our innovative capabilities and years of LNG experience to meet the unique demands of a successful floating LNG facility, and we feel we are well positioned to benefit from what could be a major LNG trend.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul."

This quarter, our underlying revenue growth rate declined from 12% in the first half to 7%. T",456,"Thank you, Simon. Now if you will turn to Slide 10. I'd like to share my thoughts on our outlook. 
First, let's take a look at the current economic environment. This quarter, our underlying revenue growth rate declined from 12% in the first half to 7%. This is partially due to the slowing of manufacturing growth rates across all regions. Many manufacturing markets slowed as a result of spikes in commodity price inflation, high inventory levels, uncertainty over government policies and fiscal situations and weak private sector confidence. As uncertainty surrounding policy, fiscal and sovereign debt issues begin to resolve over the coming months, we would expect growth to pick up early in our fiscal 2012.
 Our guidance for quarter 4 is for earnings per share of $1.48 to $1.53, year-over-year growth of 10% to 13%. This is based on the following factors. On the positive side, we expect to see increased earnings sequentially from the following areas. The manufacturing economy globally should continue its gradual recovery. This, along with some seasonal boost, should result in higher sequential volumes in Merchant Gases. And in Tonnage Gases, operating income should improve significantly, on higher volumes and lower planned maintenance spending. 
Partially offsetting these sequential improvements will be a higher fiscal quarter 4 tax rate. Our tax rate in quarter 4 should be about 26%. For the year, we expect the rate to come in towards the lower end of our original guidance range of 25% to 26%.
For fiscal year 2011, the underlying assumptions from the beginning of the year have not changed significantly. Our capital expenditure guidance is now $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion for 2011, at the top end of the original $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion range. Our full year fiscal '11 earnings per share guidance range is now $5.70 to $5.75, 14% to 15% growth over last year. While it is still early, as we look to fiscal 2012, we expect our capital spending will increase by 20% to 30% next year. We'll provide more specific guidance on next quarter's call. 
Now let me wrap up. Please turn to Slide 11. Last month, many of you joined us at our Investor Conference where we shared our 2015 revenue growth and margin and returning goal, along with the actions and plans we have to achieve them. All of us are excited by the growth and improvement opportunities these goals represent. We believe the market positions we have built, the customer relationships and product offerings we have cultivated and the actions we are taking to drive out costs will make us the best investment in our industry for our shareholders. 
Thank you, and now I'll turn the call over to Augusta to take your questions."

So that worries consumers, which then worries the -- a business, which has to invest. We're not creating jobs, and so if I got -- we got to get beyond this uncertainty. So hopefully, as we go through this summer, we resolve some of these issues. We start to move forward. We take some better and get firmer on what the policy actions will be, we'll see the economy -- the uncertainty start to lift a little bit off the economy and people start making decisions with regard to that. But if you look at any of the production statistics for the U.S., they have been trending downward, as far as the growth rate was concerned. The first half of our fiscal year, which is the last quarter of the calendar year in '10 and the first quarter of the calendar year in 2011, certainly had a stronger economy from a manufacturing standpoint. We were probably seeing growth somewhere in the 6% to 7% range. We are seeing growth less than half of that in the third and fourth quarter, if we're lucky, given things. So then if you look at that, the impact of our sales force, we started to increase our sales force post the -- post-thing in which happened with Airgas. And so we have already started to see the signings get better for us, and so we are seeing that with our people. So I think it doesn't take too long for our sales guys to become effective and start to add some business. It does take us, as I said, some time to bring that business onstream.

One of the things that has -- which is a factor here is the Bureau of Mines, I think it is, in the United States, BOM, but landmines. They have a storage amount of helium, which they have gradually been selling off, in which we own a portion of it, our competitors own a portion of that, and that amount is going away. And so we are going to become more reliant on foreign sources of helium globally, and the procurement costs for that is higher for these things, as we attempt to take these helium. It mainly occurs -- it occurs in gas fields and you strip it out and then you purify it. So it's -- it is something which we manage.

We did see very significant declines in pricing if you go back over the last 10 years. But we've definitely seen a stabilization of those larger volume, more mature products, and that's why we were commenting about stable pricing going forward. I did mention that, in fact, actually NF3 is up slightly year-on-year and sequentially, and what's offsetting that and bringing that to flat for Electronics is the great news that some of our new products are being adopted by our customers. What happens when we work out these new products, our customer is doing, let's say, a test quantity, we might be supplying from a small pilot plant, and we need a certain price. But for the customer to agree to adopt that product in full production, they need to have a price roadmap and understand where that's going to go before they commit to it. So we often, when we have our new product, we'll pre-renegotiate, let's say, a share of the savings, a price volume curve. So actually, seeing prices go down in those new products is very good because it shows that they're being adopted. So if you take the more mature products, slightly up. The newer products, slightly down. That's where Electronics is fairly stable. Of course, the other part of the segment is Performance Materials, where the team's done a great job of basically recovering some cost increases with some higher prices, and that's what's driven the segment."

We acknowledged in our comments that we are seeing some subsegments that are little bit softer, particularly the foundry segment. I think TSMC has mentioned they see utilization rates down a little bit going forward. Kind of on the flip side of that is on Intel's call, they referenced, and I quote, ""Increasing confidence in the second half of the year."" We still see growth in TV and LED. Again, perhaps the growth rates are moderating a little bit. When we take a look at MSI, we had thought MSI for the year, and I'm going back to our comments back in October, was up 5% to 10% for FY '11 over FY '10. I think that we're going to see a little flatter back half of the year in the industry, and we saw a very strong second half FY '10. So when you put that together, we could see MSI growth, year-on-year, to be below that lower end of our range. Having said that, we still see some strength. Apple obviously had tremendous results. And as we've explained a few  times, the pull-through from iPads and iPhones, both in terms of the computer chips in those devices themselves, but again the processing technology capability that has to be in the servers that are doing the math in the cloud, if you will, continues to drive business forward.

Please turn to Slide #3.  For the quarter, sales of $2.6 billion were up 14% versus prior year. Underlying sales increased 7% on 6% higher volumes, primarily in our Electronics and Performance Materials and Tonnage segments and 1% higher pricing. Favorable currency translation contributed 5%. Sequentially, sales were 3% higher, mainly due to currency. And while we did see sequential volume growth in our Electronics and Performance Materials and Tonnage segments, Merchant Gases volumes were flat sequentially and Equipment sales declined.
Operating income of $417 million increased 11% from prior year, primarily due to higher volumes. Our operating margin of 16.2% declined 40 basis points versus prior year and 80 basis points sequentially, due to higher operating costs in our Merchant segment and planned maintenance costs in our Tonnage segment. 
For the quarter, net income from containing operations increased 15% and diluted earnings per share increased 14%, each, versus prior year. Return on capital employed for the quarter improved to 13%, up 30 basis points. The 16.2% operating margin for this quarter is a disappointment for us. The shortfall to our goal is primarily in the Merchant segment due to 4 factors: a lack of volume growth in North -- in the North American business where we have significant available capacity, further declines in our European business, continued operating problems that resulted in higher operating and dislocation costs and tight helium supply with increased procurement costs. 
To remedy these issues, we are taking the following actions. In North America, we are continuing to add sales resources focused around our plants and on the end markets where we have strong offerings. For example, oil field services and electronics packaging. We've already seen signings in the third quarter improved, and we expect continued improvement. It does take about 6 to 9 months for new signings to come on line. We will also continue to drive price improvement.
In Europe, we continue to face a slow recovery, along with the pricing environment that is under recovering our variable cost increases. To address this, we had raised prices for a number of products and in a number of countries, and we'll have more price increases this quarter to stop price and variable margin erosion.
We will strongly defend our volumes from competitive attack. However, there are certain accounts we will either improve or shed. We are focusing our sales efforts on customers close to our plants to lower our distribution costs and to leverage our application strength in areas like cement and combustion.
For our operating performance, we are working hard across our system to increase plant availability and reduce unplanned outages. An example is argon production, where product has been tight and operating and distribution costs have been high. Tonnage expansion is currently underway, such as the new LaPorte plant scheduled to come onstream later this year, will enhance our argon availability.
Regarding helium, we have and we'll be raising prices further, and we will be bringing on additional capacity later this year. Overall, we are forecasting Merchant margins to improve next quarter, and we now expect to meet our 20% margin goal in fiscal 2012, on our way to our 21% to 24% goal for 2015. 
While Merchant margins disappointed, the Electronics and Performance Materials segment exceeded their 15% goal, posting a year-to-date margin of 15.8% and 18.1% for this quarter. This performance has offset some of the Merchant shortfall. While this quarter just made it harder on ourselves, we are still committed to achieving our 17% goal for the year.
Turning to Slide 4 for a review of the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our adjusted earnings per share increased by 14% or $0.18 per share. Higher volumes increased earnings per share by $0.14 year-on-year. Pricing, combined with the impact of energy and raw materials, subtracted $0.02. Costs were $0.06 unfavorable, as our productivity gains were more than offset by higher operating and maintenance and distribution costs, particularly in our Merchant segment. Equity affiliate income was broadly higher across our Merchant, Tonnage and Electronics segments contributing $0.03. Currency translation and foreign exchange netted to a $0.09 favorable impact. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Simon to review our business segment results. Simon?"

Merchant Gases sales of just over $1 billion were up 12% versus prior year. Underlying sales improved by 4% on 3% higher volumes, primarily in Asia and positive pricing in North America and Asia. Currency increased sales by 8%. Sequentially, sales were up 1%, with underlying sales flat and a 1% increase due to currency. Merchant Gases' operating income of $182 million was up 3% versus prior year and down 2% sequentially. 
Segment operating margin of 17.7% was down 160 basis points versus prior year and down 60 basis points sequentially. Versus last year, plant operating issues increased maintenance and distribution costs. These challenges resulted in higher dislocation costs to keep our customers supplied. 
In addition, our price increase efforts in Europe did not fully recover increased cost. Versus prior quarter, fixed and variable cost increases drove the margin decline. As Paul said, we expect margins to improve from these levels in Q4 and beyond. 
Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to Slide 6. In North America, sales improved 3% versus prior year. Volumes were flat with modest liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon growth offset by helium supply constraints limiting sales. Pricing was 3% positive, with improvement across the product lines. LOX/LIN plant loadings were in the low 70s. Signings were very strong this quarter, which will improve loadings as these new contracts take effect. 
In Europe, sales increased 14% versus last year, with underlying sales up 1% and a positive 13% currency impact. Volumes were up 2% with modest growth across the product lines. Pricing remained a challenge, down 1% due to competitive pressure in both healthcare and liquid bulk. LOX/LIN plant loadings are in the mid-80s.
In Asia, sales were up 22% versus last year, with underlying sales up 15%. As expected, growth rates have moderated somewhat from previous quarters as we have moved to tougher year-on-year comparisons. Overall volume growth remained strong. Volumes were up 12% with liquid oxygen and nitrogen up 13% across the region and up 19% in China. Pricing continued to be strong, up 3% with liquid oxygen and nitrogen prices up modestly. Argon pricing was strong versus last year, but as expected, we did see lower sequential argon pricing due to less spot sales in China with a more balanced supply-and-demand market. Plant loadings remained in the mid-80s. We did bring onstream our new merchant capacity at Xingtai Steel in China integrated with our Tonnage oxygen plant. 
Please turn to Slide 7, Tonnage Gases. Tonnage Gases sales of $869 million increased 20% versus last year, with volumes up 11% and energy and raw material pass-through increasing sales by 7%. The volume increase was driven by both new projects and improved loadings. Sequentially, sales were up 9% on a 5% volume increase and 3% higher energy and raw material pass-through. New plant volume growth and less volume impact for maintenance outages drove the increase. 
Operating income of $115 million was down 4% from prior year on a higher maintenance cost, primarily from customer-scheduled outages, and down 5% sequentially, due to lower annual operating bonuses. After a number of scheduled maintenance outages in Q2 and Q3, we expect Q4 maintenance spending to be lower. Operating margin of 13.2% decreased 330 basis points versus prior year. About 2/3 of this decline is due to the maintenance cost just mentioned, the remainder is due to higher natural gas cost pass-through.
Moving to new business. We were pleased to announce a significant increase in our hydrogen supply to Valero's 2 Gulf Coast refineries. This award of over 200 million standard cubic feet a day for Valero in Port Arthur, Texas and St. Charles, Louisiana was facilitated by our Gulf Coast pipeline project and expands our leading global hydrogen position. We expect to announce additional hydrogen and oxygen awards in Q4. 
Please turn to Slide 8, Electronics and Performance Materials. We were very pleased with this quarter's performance as sales, income and margin were all the highest in the history of the segment. Segment sales of $602 million were up 21% compared to last year, on 14% higher volumes, 3% positive pricing and 4% currency. Sequentially, sales were up 5% on 3% higher volumes and 1% higher prices. 
Electronic sales were up 24% compared to last year and up 3% sequentially, as the industry maintained high utilization rates. Electronic Specialty Materials sales increased 14% versus prior year and 6% sequentially. Tonnage sales were up 12% versus prior year and 4% sequentially, and our Equipment business was up significantly versus prior year and sequentially.
Electronic Specialty Materials pricing was flat versus last year and last quarter. As we communicated at the Investor Conference, we continue to see more stable pricing. In fact, NF3 prices were up slightly both versus last year and sequentially. This positive impact was offset by lower new product pricing, resulting from higher new product volumes based on previously negotiated price volume discounts. This is good news as customers move our profitable new products into full production.
Performance Materials sales increased 18% versus last year, with volumes up 7%, pricing up 7% and currency contributing 4%. We continue to recover increased raw material costs with our pricing actions. Sequentially, sales rose 6% on 3% volume growth and 2% price. 
Operating income of $109 million was up 75% versus prior year, primarily due to volume leverage and continued positive cost performance. Income was up 19% sequentially, primarily due to volume leverage. Segment operating margin of 18.1% improved 550 basis points from last year and 220 basis points sequentially, due to strong volume and cost performance. As expected, we did not see any material impact to our business from the tragic events in Japan. 
There have been some signs of softening in certain electronic sectors, including foundry and LCD. However, you probably saw the very strong results from Apple and Intel exceeding expectations in results reported this week. As we have said, we believe our strong position with the industry leaders and our new product success will mitigate any effect, and we expect continued strong performance from this segment. 
In terms of new projects, last month, we announced the successful startup of our new Electronic Materials facility in Banwol, Korea. This facility will produce products enabling our customers to create advanced generation devices and reinforces our leadership position in the electronics market.
During the quarter, we announced plans to increase production of ultrahigh purity nitrogen and oxygen and expand the nitrogen pipeline at our Chandler, Arizona facility. We have successfully served semiconductor manufacturers in the Chandler market for over 30 years.
Finally, earlier this week, we announced an expansion of our nitrogen capacity and pipeline network at the Gumi National Industrial Complex in Korea. We currently supply nearly 20 semiconductor and photovoltaic customers via our pipeline network. This expansion will support existing customer growth and new customers.
Now please turn to Slide 9, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $80 million were down 31% versus prior year on lower ASU sales and 30% sequentially on lower ASU and LNG sales. Operating income of $9 million was down 59% versus prior year, due to lower sales and a prior year asset gain, and 62% sequentially, due to lower sales.
Our backlog is down versus prior year, but as expected, showed a 34% increase sequentially, primarily driven by our new LNG technology and equipment order for the world's first floating LNG facility at Shell's Australia Prelude Project. We leveraged our innovative capabilities and years of LNG experience to meet the unique demands of a successful floating LNG facility, and we feel we are well positioned to benefit from what could be a major LNG trend.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul."

This quarter, our underlying revenue growth rate declined from 12% in the first half to 7%. T",456,"Thank you, Simon. Now if you will turn to Slide 10. I'd like to share my thoughts on our outlook. 
First, let's take a look at the current economic environment. This quarter, our underlying revenue growth rate declined from 12% in the first half to 7%. This is partially due to the slowing of manufacturing growth rates across all regions. Many manufacturing markets slowed as a result of spikes in commodity price inflation, high inventory levels, uncertainty over government policies and fiscal situations and weak private sector confidence. As uncertainty surrounding policy, fiscal and sovereign debt issues begin to resolve over the coming months, we would expect growth to pick up early in our fiscal 2012.
 Our guidance for quarter 4 is for earnings per share of $1.48 to $1.53, year-over-year growth of 10% to 13%. This is based on the following factors. On the positive side, we expect to see increased earnings sequentially from the following areas. The manufacturing economy globally should continue its gradual recovery. This, along with some seasonal boost, should result in higher sequential volumes in Merchant Gases. And in Tonnage Gases, operating income should improve significantly, on higher volumes and lower planned maintenance spending. 
Partially offsetting these sequential improvements will be a higher fiscal quarter 4 tax rate. Our tax rate in quarter 4 should be about 26%. For the year, we expect the rate to come in towards the lower end of our original guidance range of 25% to 26%.
For fiscal year 2011, the underlying assumptions from the beginning of the year have not changed significantly. Our capital expenditure guidance is now $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion for 2011, at the top end of the original $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion range. Our full year fiscal '11 earnings per share guidance range is now $5.70 to $5.75, 14% to 15% growth over last year. While it is still early, as we look to fiscal 2012, we expect our capital spending will increase by 20% to 30% next year. We'll provide more specific guidance on next quarter's call. 
Now let me wrap up. Please turn to Slide 11. Last month, many of you joined us at our Investor Conference where we shared our 2015 revenue growth and margin and returning goal, along with the actions and plans we have to achieve them. All of us are excited by the growth and improvement opportunities these goals represent. We believe the market positions we have built, the customer relationships and product offerings we have cultivated and the actions we are taking to drive out costs will make us the best investment in our industry for our shareholders. 
Thank you, and now I'll turn the call over to Augusta to take your questions."

So that worries consumers, which then worries the -- a business, which has to invest. We're not creating jobs, and so if I got -- we got to get beyond this uncertainty. So hopefully, as we go through this summer, we resolve some of these issues. We start to move forward. We take some better and get firmer on what the policy actions will be, we'll see the economy -- the uncertainty start to lift a little bit off the economy and people start making decisions with regard to that. But if you look at any of the production statistics for the U.S., they have been trending downward, as far as the growth rate was concerned. The first half of our fiscal year, which is the last quarter of the calendar year in '10 and the first quarter of the calendar year in 2011, certainly had a stronger economy from a manufacturing standpoint. We were probably seeing growth somewhere in the 6% to 7% range. We are seeing growth less than half of that in the third and fourth quarter, if we're lucky, given things. So then if you look at that, the impact of our sales force, we started to increase our sales force post the -- post-thing in which happened with Airgas. And so we have already started to see the signings get better for us, and so we are seeing that with our people. So I think it doesn't take too long for our sales guys to become effective and start to add some business. It does take us, as I said, some time to bring that business onstream.

You talked about the need to get volume in North America and pricing in Europe. I think both of those things are a little bit market- and competitive-environment dependent. But with respect to the operational issues and the need to reduce some of the dislocation costs, et cetera, how much of those issues have been fixed at this point and things are taken care of, and to the extent that they can give you confidence that you'll see margin improvement from those areas where you have more control over your own destiny, so to speak?"

So far, for our look at this, it's just -- it's hitting a lot of singles of making sure we run our plants well and do a better job. So it's not one issue, it's a number of issues. And they're small, and they're at different plants around here. And so it's going to be something which we're going to have to pay attention to. With regard to some of the issues, which I mentioned, argon availability has been an issue for us. We do have capacity coming onstream in the on-site area, in both the U.S. and Asia, which will help our argon availability around the world. We have -- we've brought some argon capacity on time at Xingtai Steel, as an example. That will help us. We have a plant coming onstream towards the end of our fiscal year in LaPorte, Texas, which will help us with argon availability and also cut down on the distribution costs. So it's going to be -- it's not one thing, which we can do to fix it, it's a number of things. And then it just getting on to getting the benefits out of our -- out of us, the service center investments, which we've made and things like that. So we've -- we can do these things. You've seen the progress or focus which we've made on SG&A as a company. SG&A, we didn't make a big deal about it, but SG&A is under 10% of sales this quarter. If you take currency out of it, SG&A is down year-on-year for us. So we've made -- we continue to make a lot of progress in those areas. We can take cost out. We can be successful at this. We applied the tools, we applied the information systems, which we have. We've make good decisions, and we can get this done."

One of the things that has -- which is a factor here is the Bureau of Mines, I think it is, in the United States, BOM, but landmines. They have a storage amount of helium, which they have gradually been selling off, in which we own a portion of it, our competitors own a portion of that, and that amount is going away. And so we are going to become more reliant on foreign sources of helium globally, and the procurement costs for that is higher for these things, as we attempt to take these helium. It mainly occurs -- it occurs in gas fields and you strip it out and then you purify it. So it's -- it is something which we manage.

We did see very significant declines in pricing if you go back over the last 10 years. But we've definitely seen a stabilization of those larger volume, more mature products, and that's why we were commenting about stable pricing going forward. I did mention that, in fact, actually NF3 is up slightly year-on-year and sequentially, and what's offsetting that and bringing that to flat for Electronics is the great news that some of our new products are being adopted by our customers. What happens when we work out these new products, our customer is doing, let's say, a test quantity, we might be supplying from a small pilot plant, and we need a certain price. But for the customer to agree to adopt that product in full production, they need to have a price roadmap and understand where that's going to go before they commit to it. So we often, when we have our new product, we'll pre-renegotiate, let's say, a share of the savings, a price volume curve. So actually, seeing prices go down in those new products is very good because it shows that they're being adopted. So if you take the more mature products, slightly up. The newer products, slightly down. That's where Electronics is fairly stable. Of course, the other part of the segment is Performance Materials, where the team's done a great job of basically recovering some cost increases with some higher prices, and that's what's driven the segment."

The Middle East probably picks up some things for us within the next year or so, as far as backlog's concerned, but I would say that we are going to see a more tilt in ourself towards Asia as far as the spending is concerned."

We acknowledged in our comments that we are seeing some subsegments that are little bit softer, particularly the foundry segment. I think TSMC has mentioned they see utilization rates down a little bit going forward. Kind of on the flip side of that is on Intel's call, they referenced, and I quote, ""Increasing confidence in the second half of the year."" We still see growth in TV and LED. Again, perhaps the growth rates are moderating a little bit. When we take a look at MSI, we had thought MSI for the year, and I'm going back to our comments back in October, was up 5% to 10% for FY '11 over FY '10. I think that we're going to see a little flatter back half of the year in the industry, and we saw a very strong second half FY '10. So when you put that together, we could see MSI growth, year-on-year, to be below that lower end of our range. Having said that, we still see some strength. Apple obviously had tremendous results. And as we've explained a few  times, the pull-through from iPads and iPhones, both in terms of the computer chips in those devices themselves, but again the processing technology capability that has to be in the servers that are doing the math in the cloud, if you will, continues to drive business forward. So I think we should -- we see probably moderating, but no significant drop off at all going forward."

Good day, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Please turn to Slide #3 for a view of the key highlights from our fiscal year 2011. Clearly, the top highlight for us in 2011 was the number of new projects we announced over the last 12 months",846,"Thanks, Simon. Good day, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Please turn to Slide #3 for a view of the key highlights from our fiscal year 2011. Clearly, the top highlight for us in 2011 was the number of new projects we announced over the last 12 months. Some of the larger ones are shown at the top of this slide. For some time, we have been sharing with you that bidding activity for new project remained high and as a validation of that point, our capital project backlog continues to rise and now stands at $2.5 billion. For this year, our capital spending was $1.6 billion, up 22% from 2010 and our outlook is now for this to grow to $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion in 2012. You can see that these projects are aligned with the key growth drivers we discussed at our Investor Conference. Hydrogen and oxygen for energy and environmental markets, nitrogen for Electronics and Merchant capacity for emerging markets. 
Now some financial highlights. We had a strong year with significant improvement in operating cash flow, up 15%. We increased our dividend for the 29th consecutive year, an increase of 18%. We repurchased $649 million of stock during fiscal year 2011 and announced a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization. And our adjusted earnings per share of $5.73 was up 14%, just above the high end of our original guidance range. On the sustainability front, we renamed the both Carbon Disclosure Project and Dow Jones Sustainable indices, reflecting the results and leadership that we are delivering in this important area. 
Turning to Slide #4, sales of $10.1 billion increased 12% as we delivered strong gains across our Merchant Gases, Tonnage Gases and our Electronics and Performance Materials segments. Our underlying sales grew 10%, with volumes up 9% and price up 1%. We delivered good volume growth in a period of modest economic growth driven by strong performance on our Electronics and Performance Materials segment, which posted its second consecutive year of over 20% growth. Volume growth of 11% in Tonnage Gases, principally from new investments and contracts. And in our Merchant segment, growth in Asia was well above 20% with much more modest growth experienced in the U.S. and Europe. Operating income of $1.7 billion grew 13% mainly from better performance in Electronics and Performance Materials and Tonnage Gases segments. Our operating margin for the year was 16.6%, a modest improvement from last year. While we attained the highest operating margin in more than a decade, our operating leverage was partially offset by a number of product supply and cost issues in the second half of the year. As a result, we finished short of our 17% target. Looking forward, margin should continue to expand. We have operating leverage in the United States and Europe and we have solutions to our product supply and cost issues. And we remain committed to continuing to drive our cost reductions as we expand our business. Equity affiliates income increased 22% to $154 million this year, due to better results across the number of our joint ventures. The largest improvement came from Mexico, where volumes were significantly higher on strong LOX/LIN and packaged gas sales driven by glass, oil field services, refining and general manufacturing. And most importantly, our annual after-tax return on capital employed improved to 13.3%, 80 basis points above last year. 
Please turn to Slide 5. For the quarter, sales of $2.6 billion were 11% higher versus prior year. Underlying sales increased 6% year-on-year due to 4% higher volumes driven by Tonnage Gases, Electronics, Performance Materials and Merchant Gases segments and 2% higher pricing. Operating income of $425 million increased 6% from prior year due primarily to volume growth. Our operating margin declined to 16.3%, down 80 basis points versus prior year with 50 basis points due to currency and higher raw material pass-through and the rest due to price and recovery of cost inflation. For the quarter, net income increased 11% and diluted earnings per share increased by 12%, each versus prior year. 
Our return on capital employed on an instantaneous a run rate basis improved to 13.5%. 
Turning to Slide 6 for a review of the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our adjusted continuing operations earnings per share increased by $0.16. Higher volumes increased earnings per share by $0.07 year-on-year, pricing, energy and raw materials taken together, were flat and costs were about $0.01 unfavorable as our productivity gains were more than offset by cost inflation. Currency translation in foreign exchange netted to a $0.02 favorable impact, equity affiliate income was $0.07 higher, partially due to better results in Mexico, India, Thailand and South Africa. Equity affiliate income also included a positive of $0.04 of good news from nonoperational items, which was offset by an accounting adjustment of a similar amount in non-controlling interest. Lower interest expense, a lower tax rate and fewer shares outstanding altogether were $0.05 positive. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Simon to review our business segment results. Simon?"

Merchant Gases sales of just over $1 billion were up 10% versus prior year. Underlying sales improved by 5% on 4% higher volumes with growth in Asia and the U.S./Canada and 1% higher pricing again driven by Asia and U.S./Canada. Currency increased sales by 5%. Sequentially, sales were up 2% with 3% positive volumes, flat pricing and a minus 1% currency impact. Just a note, we are now using the term U.S./Canada rather than North America to more accurately reflect the countries we are reporting. Our strong business in Mexico is reported as an equity affiliate so it's not included in these results. Merchant Gases' operating income of $192 million was up 4% versus prior year and 6% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 18.4% was down one 110 basis points versus prior year but up 70 basis points sequentially. Versus last year, volume and price increased operating income, but the price increases were not enough to fully recover raw material cost increases, particularly in Europe. Versus prior quarter, positive volume combined with better operating and distribution cost performance drove the margin expansion. 
Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to Slide 8. In U.S./Canada, sales improved 8% versus prior year. Volumes were up 5% with particular strength in both argon and hydrogen. Pricing was 3% positive with improvement across the product lines as we took actions to recover higher costs. LOX/LIN capacity utilization improved to the mid-70s. Consistent with our plans, contract signings were very strong again this quarter above the good Q3 results. This will translate into positive volume momentum through next year. In Europe, sales increased 8% versus last year all due to currency. Volumes were relatively flat across the businesses, pricing was positive in liquid/bulk and packaged gases, but offset by continued negative price pressure in healthcare. The positive liquid/bulk price was an improvement over last quarter but still do not fully recover cost increases. LOX/LIN plant loadings were in the low 80s. In Asia, sales were up 30% versus last year with underlying sales up 23% and a 7% positive impact from currency. Volumes were up 20% with growth across the product lines, LOX/LIN volumes were up 2% in China. Rice in continues to be strong, up 3% with the LOX/LIN prices up 5%. Plant loadings are around 80% as we continue to add capacity and sales to the system. Signings for the quarter were well above last year. 
This quarter, we continue to demonstrate our focus on, and success, in emerging markets. In August, we announced a new contract to supply our fully integrated Oxy fuel combustion solution to Guangzhou, [indiscernible] Century Fiber Glass in Ningxia, China to reduce emissions and improve productivity in glass filament production. We will supply our clean fire oxy fuel burners and flow control skid and we will install a prism BSA unit for on-site oxygen generation. Last month, we announced an agreement to acquire a 25% stake in the gases and equipment businesses of Abdula Hashin Industrial Gases and Equipment Co., the largest industrial gas company in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We are excited about using our successful joint venture strategy in the Middle East. This strategy of providing our partners' local market and country knowledge with our skills and engineering, operations, applications and finance, has led to our leadership positions in Taiwan, Korea, Spain and other countries. Deepening a relationship with AHG gives us the opportunity to participate in the strong Merchant Gases growth in Saudi Arabia and is a significant new platform from which to pursue Tonnage Gas opportunities throughout the Middle East. 
Please turn to Slide 9, Tonnage Gases. Tonnage Gases sales of $883 million increased 17% versus last year with volumes up 11%, energy and raw material pass-through increasing sales by 3% and a positive 3% currency affect. Sequentially, sales were up 2% on 3% higher volumes and 1% lower energy and raw material pass-through. The volume increases relative to both prior year and prior quarter, were primarily driven by new projects. Operating income of $152 million was up 30% from prior year and 32% sequentially on higher volumes, improved operating efficiency and reduced maintenance costs. We also had a net gain from contract modifications of a about $0.05 in the quarter. As expected, after a number of scheduled maintenance outages in Q2 and Q3, Q4 maintenance spending was lower. Operating margin of 17.2% increased to 160 basis points versus prior year and 400 basis points sequentially on the higher operating income. 
Moving to new business. We are pleased to long-term hydrogen supply agreement for Shell Oil's Texas refinery and for Motiva Enterprise's Convent, Louisiana refinery. Both contracts will be supported by Air Products' industry-leading Gulf Coast hydrogen pipeline supply network that will serve multiple refinery and petrochemical companies from New Orleans on the east to the Houston ship channel on the West. We also, on our third long-term contract to supply oxygen and nitrogen to Wison and Clean Energy Limited's coal classification facility in Nanjing, China. We will build, own and operate our third air separation unit and integrate and liquefy to supply Wison and produce liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon for the growing regional Merchant industrial gas market. These awards are concrete examples of the key market growth drivers we shared at our Investor Conference in June. 
Please turn to Slide 10, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $587 million were up 12% compared to last year on 5% higher volumes, 4% higher pricing and 3% currency. Sequentially, sales were down 3% on lower volumes. Electronics sales were up 17% compared to last year and up 2% sequentially as industry growth slowed as we expected. Electronic materials sales were up modestly versus last year, while Tonnage and equipment continued to show strong growth. Electronics specialty materials pricing remained stable. Performance Matrox sales increased 7% versus last year with 9% higher prices and a 3% positive currency affect, offsetting a 5% volume decline. Sequentially, sales were down 9% primarily on volume declines. The softness in PMD reflects slowdown in key markets, including housing, construction and autos. Operating income of $92 million was up 9% versus prior year, primarily due to Electronics volumes and Performance Materials pricing and was down 16% sequentially due to lower Performance Materials volumes. Segment operating margin of 15.6% was down 50 basis points versus prior year due to higher costs, down 250 basis points sequentially due to lower volumes and higher costs. Margins exceeded the FY '11 target of 15% by 80 basis points for the year. In new projects, we announced a new nitrogen plant at our site in the Chonan Industrial Complex in Korea and the second contract with Samsung mobile display to supply gaseous nitrogen and oxygen and liquid argon for their active matrix organic light-emitting diode production in [indiscernible], Korea. Finally, earlier this quarter, we announced plans to more than double our nitrogen trifluoride or NF3 capacity at our Ulsan, Korea site. NF3 remains the chamber cleaning gas of choice for semiconductor display and photovoltaic manufacturers. This plan will leverage our existing site infrastructure to expand our reliable and cost-effective NF3 supply. 
Now please turn to Slide 11, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $96 million were down 25% versus prior year on lower ASU and LNG sales and up 21% sequentially on higher ASU sales. Operating income of $12 mil was down 43% versus prior year due to lower sales and up 34% sequentially due primarily to favorable year end cost absorption. Our backlog is up versus prior year and sequentially on several new large ASU orders. 
Now, I'll turn the call back over to Paul."

Now if you'll turn to Slide #12, I'd like to share our thoughts on our outlook. After a fairly good start during the first half of fiscal 2011, we saw economic growth decline as uncertainty grew. Because of this uncertainty, our fiscal 2012",1543,"Thanks, Simon. Now if you'll turn to Slide #12, I'd like to share our thoughts on our outlook. After a fairly good start during the first half of fiscal 2011, we saw economic growth decline as uncertainty grew. Because of this uncertainty, our fiscal 2012 forecast for economic growth has a wider range than in past years. Globally, for the regions we operate in, we see economic growth of 2% to 5%. on the pessimistic side of this range, we would see the following scenarios: For the U.S., if the current fiscal and policy uncertainties continue, this would likely keep consumer confidence low, automotive production slow, housing at its current low level and the investment climate depressed, resulting in about 1% manufacturing growth. Asia would see the contraction of consumer markets in the U.S. and Europe and we would not expect China's consumer spending to significantly offset this. Investment activity would be held down by overcapacity concerns and we would expect regional growth to drop to 4%. For Europe, while we are not forecasting a full-fledged financial crisis, we are forecasting the current negative trends continue and the region would have a modest manufacturing recession with an expected 2% contraction. On the optimistic side of this range, we would see the following scenarios: In the U.S., we would start to see a consensus form in advance of the election, which leads to improved consumer confidence and business investment, starting a virtuous cycle of growth in the second half of our fiscal year. We would expect 5% economic growth. In Asia, the attempts to drive greater consumer spending in China would succeeded and demand would grow across the region, along with better export markets to the U.S. and Europe. Expect the growth to rise to 9%. In Europe, the negative trends would start to reverse as the governments made progress on their fiscal problems. However, expected growth would still be weak at 1%. This broad range of economic scenarios results in a wider range for earnings of $5.90 to $6.30 per share for 2012. While the outcomes could vary, we are prepared to execute our business plans and adapt to whatever economic environment emerges. Walking from our 2011 earnings per share of $5.73, we have the following factors: New plant on-streams in 2011 and 2012 should add $0.30 to $0.35. These are projects that are either onstream now, or will be on stream soon and our backed by contract contractual commitments to buy. We should see this growth independent of global economic conditions. Loading existing assets should add $0.10 to $0.40 to earnings per share. This is the factor most influenced by the economy. In Equipment and Energy, we expect to fiscal 2012 operating results will be down due to less LNG activity, a $0.05 to $0.10 headwind. Pension expense will be about $0.05 headwind due to the drop in interest rates from 2010 to 2011 and lower asset returns. And we see a $0.10 headwind from a higher tax rate, approximately 26%. In any economic environment, cost control and cost reductions are important factors that drive earnings, margin and return improvement. For 2012, our bottom line should also improve from our productivity efforts and we will remain diligent on discretionary spending, new programs and staffing. 
Now, turning to our outlook by business segment. In Merchant Gases, we are continuing to add selling resources in the U.S. to drive the volume growth as we focus on new applications and expand our micro vault offering. We continue to expand our Merchant capacity in Asia, manufacturing growth along with our new applications efforts should lead to strong volume growth. In Europe, we will continue to derive prices higher to offset higher energy costs and take actions to reduce operating costs. In our Tonnage Gases segment, we will see the benefit from the full year loading of our fiscal 2011 startups along with a number of investments due to come onstream this year. A list of our major projects is in the appendix slide. On the new order front, we have announced and expect to continue to announce, a significant number of new projects, which will provide growth in 2013 and beyond. For Electronics, we are forecasting modest silicon growth of 0% to 5% for 2012. We expect that our position with the industry leaders should help us grow faster than the industry as a they are making the majority of new capital investments. Electronics industry capital expenditures after 2 very strong years, is forecasted to decline 15% to 20% in 2012. Our Electronics Equipment business results are expected to slow accordingly. However, this would still make 2012 the second highest capital spending year for the industry. For Performance Materials, we expect the current volume softness to continue through Q1 but when economic conditions improve, volume growth should return, as we benefit from our low-cost production facilities and our new product, market and application successes. 
Before we turn to the next quarter, I want to briefly address a question we have heard. What if 2012 turns into a re-run of 2009 and the world goes back into a recession? First, we believe the world is different from both an economic and an Air Product standpoint. With regard to the economy, autos and housing, which were hit hard, have not fully recovered. Therefore, they have less relative exposure. Electronics had a massive inventory correction but today, inventories are at a much lower level. And both corporations and consumers have de-levered their balance sheets and are financially stronger. With regard to Air Products, we are also much stronger our margins are 200 basis points higher than in 2008 and our Tonnage segment in 2009, we experienced a significant drop in the value of our operating efficiencies due to the large drop in natural gas prices. With already low natural gas prices, our operating results should be more stable. And Electronics has restructured its business, strengthened its position with the industry leaders, improved its product portfolio and increased segment margins by over 450 basis points. So if we do go into a global recession, we don't see 2012 being as bad as 2009. 
Turning to Slide #13. Our guidance for quarter 1 is for earnings per share of $1.31 to $1.39 based on the following factors: On the positive side, we expect to see increased earnings sequentially from new plant on streams, including our new hydrogen in Rotterdam and the Weihe oxygen on-site and Merchant plant. Offsetting this sequential improvement, in Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials, we expect flat economic growth along with the lower seasonal demand. In Tonnage Gases, profits are expected to decline due to higher maintenance spending, financial difficulties with a particular customer in our polyurethane intermediates business and the quarter 4 contract modifications. So we expect our quarter 1 operating profit level in the Tonnage segment to be similar to the level delivered in quarter 1 last year. Consistent with the full year guidance, we will see lower Equipment and Energy profits. equity affiliates, pension and currency will be negative, but they will be roughly offset by lower non-controlling interest on lower taxes. As I said, we believe are there is a chance that Europe goes into a recession and at best, we'll have flat to very slight growth. Therefore, regardless of the economy during Q1, we will begin to take actions to reduce our costs across the region. These actions are not yet fully defined and any cost or benefits from these actions are not included in our guidance. 
Please turn to Slide #14 for our capital spending outlook. Our capital spending for 2011 was $1.6 billion. For 2012, we expect that our capital spending will be between $1.9 billion and $2.2 billion, an increase of 20% to 40%. This includes a maintenance capital expenditure of $300 million to $350 million, in line with prior year. The majority of our spending is in the Tonnage area with about $1 billion associated with new large plants and pipelines. When you look across all 4 business segments, over 75% of our growth capital expenditures is under long-term take or pay contracts. You can also seen that the majority of our spending is in the Americas and Asia. We continue to work on acquisition opportunities, including captive plans from customers and we also continue to look for focus opportunities to complement our existing positions, such as our investment in Saudi Arabia. 
Now, let me wrap up. We had a good 2011, growing sales and earnings double digits while continuing to make improvements in our operating margin and most importantly, our return on capital. The increase in capital spending we announced today plus the bidding activity we are seeing, gives us a number of excellent opportunities for the future beyond 2012. As we move forward, our priority is to deliver the growth, margin improvement and higher returns that will make us the best investment choices in the industry for our shareholders. 2012 will certainly offer its challenges as we work through the economic uncertainties. However, we believe we are well positioned to make the progress we need to deliver our 2015 goals.

And we outlined a number of actions last quarter in which we said we were going to take. The first of those actions was within the U.S. to improve our volumes there. We made good progress. We had 5% growth in volumes. We are working to get that better obviously. I think the good news, what Simon reported is quarter 4 was the signing up from quarter 3 and when we just compare our signings for the second half when our actions and post-Airgas started to take some effect to the first half, our signings our 2x in the second half what they were in the first half. So we're still hiring salespeople. That effort, I believe, is on track and will accomplish the goals, which we have. As we said it's going to take some time for us to see this. It will take probably through the next year as we see these customers go on stream because it takes 6 to 9 months to make a customer on stream. With regard to Europe and the prices we talked about. The Europe pricing as you heard was flat, that was healthcare being down. Improved pricing in Europe on the liquid/bulk side. However, we are not recovering the increased our -- the increased power there and we need to do that. So we did more actions in pricing and we need to be better there. So I'd like the trend starting to move up but it's not fixed yet and we need to get more things going there. Operational issues, which we had. We had less this quarter. So we are improving in those things. You can see that in cost performance. We still have some other things, which we've got to do to bring plants onstream to end of the distribution cost we talked about the plants and Riley Ridge [indiscernible] plants, which helped in our supply of argon and Helium, which has lowered our distribution costs in those areas and they come onstream in quarter 1 of this year and we'll likely we'll see the effect in quarter 2. Helium supply is still short and the Riley Ridge plant will help is there to come on stream so overall, we think that we like the improvement. But we still think that there is more prior year was higher. But we intend to go there. So first quarter, we're not going to [indiscernible] everything anything in. There is a seasonal volume decline so it's going probably tough but we look towards the second, third and fourth quarters for that getting a lot better."

And so, I could see a delay where the economies pickup but we don't follow directly in that particular quarter. And so that is really what happens, which would then say, that yes, 2013 growth would be stronger than what you would expect to see from the economy."

First, within the books we use a standard cost in our P&Ls and so what that means if you go back to accounting courses, you take the inventory outed standard and you put the inventory in its standard and that goes into the costs and the purchase price variances to flow through the P&L. At the end of the year, we do our inventory on the balance sheet and they get the valued at current cost for those things. And so there is a right up or a write-down of inventories, which occurs within the business segments. In the U.S. only then, we also adjust to LIFO, which occurs at the corporate level in total on that thing. So it's a gain or loss which gets impacted there.

If you then took a look at and said, the confidence on the second half of the year, I think what happens is hopefully, some of these uncertainties start to resolve. We gave the thing for the U.S. it is that within the U.S., we start to see a consensus emerge on things like tax reform, regulations, entitlements, spending. Things like that. And people start to see a way forward where they can start what impact is that going to have on the decision, which I'm going to make to run my business. Once we see that, I think people will start to expand, invest, hire people and staff like that. And once we get the politicians somewhat in line with his things and we get a passport, I think it gets better for that. In Europe, I think as they continue to work through the current crisis, which exists there, as they start to see and resolve those things in whatever way they go, they go worse or better, as we work our through, our going to get at some point to an end at that and I think that probably occurs sometime within the next year or so."

Please turn to Slide #3 for a review of the key highlights from our fiscal year 2011. Clearly, the top highlight for us in 2011 was the number of new projects we announced over the last 12 months. Some of the larger ones are shown at the top of this slide. For some time, we have been sharing with you that bidding activity for new project remains high and as a validation of that point, our capital project backlog continues to rise and now stands at $2.5 billion. For this year, our capital spending was $1.6 billion, up 22% from 2010 and our outlook is now for this to grow to $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion in 2012. You can see that these projects are aligned with the key growth drivers we discussed at our Investor Conference. Hydrogen and oxygen for energy and environmental markets, nitrogen for electronics and merchant capacity for emerging markets. 
Now some financial highlights. We had a strong year with significant improvement in operating cash flow, up 15%. We increased our dividend for the 29th consecutive year, an increase of 18%. We repurchased $649 million of stock during fiscal year 2011 and announced a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization. And our adjusted earnings per share of $5.73 was up 14%, just above the high end of our original guidance range. On the sustainability front, we renamed the both the Carbon Disclosure Project and Dow Jones Sustainable indices, reflecting the results and leadership we are delivering in this important area. 
Turning to Slide #4, sales of $10.1 billion increased 12% as we delivered strong gains across our Merchant Gases, Tonnage Gases and our Electronics and Performance Materials segments. Our underlying sales grew 10%, with volumes up 9% and price up 1%. We delivered good volume growth in a period of modest economic growth driven by strong performance on our Electronics and Performance Materials segment, which posted its second consecutive year of over 20% growth. Volume growth of 11% in Tonnage Gases, principally from new investments and contracts. And in our Merchant segment, growth in Asia was well above 20% with much more modest growth experienced in the U.S. and Europe. Operating income of $1.7 billion grew 13% mainly from better performance in Electronics and Performance Materials and Tonnage Gases segments. 
Our operating margin for the year was 16.6%, a modest improvement from last year. While we attained the highest operating margin in more than a decade, our operating leverage was partially offset by a number of product supply and cost issues in the second half of the year. As a result, we finished short of our 17% target. Looking forward, margin should continue to expand. We have operating leverage in the United States and Europe and we have solutions to our product supply and cost issues. And we remain committed to continuing to drive our cost reductions as we expand our business. Equity affiliates income increased 22% to $154 million this year, due to better results across the number of our joint ventures. The largest improvement came from Mexico, where volumes were significantly higher on strong LOX/LIN and packaged gas sales driven by glass, oil field services, refining and general manufacturing. And most importantly, our annual after-tax return on capital employed improved to 13.3%, 80 basis points above last year. 
Please turn to Slide 5. For the quarter, sales of $2.6 billion were 11% higher versus prior year. Underlying sales increased 6% year-on-year due to 4% higher volumes driven by Tonnage Gases, Electronics, Performance Materials and Merchant Gases segments and 2% higher pricing. Operating income of $425 million increased 6% from prior year due primarily to volume growth. Our operating margin declined to 16.3%, down 80 basis points versus prior year with 50 basis points due to currency and higher raw material pass-through and the rest due to price under recovery of cost inflation. For the quarter, net income increased 11% and diluted earnings per share increased by 12%, each versus prior year. 
Our return on capital employed on an instantaneous, our run rate basis improved to 13.5%. 
Turning to Slide 6 for a review of the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our adjusted continuing operations earnings per share increased by $0.16. Higher volumes increased earnings per share by $0.07 year-on-year, pricing, energy and raw materials taken together, were flat and costs were about $0.01 unfavorable as our productivity gains were more than offset by cost inflation. Currency translation in foreign exchange netted to a $0.02 favorable impact, equity affiliate income was $0.07 higher, partially due to better results in Mexico, India, Thailand and South Africa. Equity affiliate income also included a positive of $0.04 of good news from nonoperational items, which was offset by an accounting adjustment of a similar amount in non-controlling interest. Lower interest expense, a lower tax rate and fewer shares outstanding altogether were $0.05 positive. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Simon to review our business segment results. Simon?"

Merchant Gases sales of just over $1 billion were up 10% versus prior year. Underlying sales improved by 5% on 4% higher volumes with growth in Asia and U.S./Canada and 1% higher pricing, again, driven by Asia and U.S./Canada. Currency increased sales by 5%. Sequentially, sales were up 2% with 3% positive volume, flat pricing and a minus 1% currency impact. Just to note, we are now using the term U.S./Canada rather than North America to more accurately reflect the countries we are reporting. Our strong business in Mexico is reported as an equity affiliate so it's not included in these results. Merchant Gases' operating income of $192 million was up 4% versus prior year and 6% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 18.4% was down one 110 basis points versus prior year, but up 70 basis points sequentially. Versus last year, volume and price increased operating income, but the price increases were not enough to fully recover raw material cost increases, particularly in Europe. Versus prior quarter, positive volume combined with better operating and distribution cost performance drove the margin expansion. 
Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to Slide 8. In U.S./Canada, sales improved 8% versus prior year. Volumes were up 5% with particular strength in both argon and hydrogen. Pricing was 3% positive with improvement across the product lines as we took actions to recover higher costs. LOX/LIN capacity utilization improved to the mid-70s. Consistent with our plans, contract signings were very strong again this quarter above the good Q3 results. This will translate into positive volume momentum through next year. In Europe, sales increased 8% versus last year all due to currency. Volumes were relatively flat across the businesses, pricing was positive in liquid/bulk and packaged gases, but offset by continued negative price pressure in healthcare. The positive liquid/bulk price was an improvement over last quarter but still do not fully recover cost increases. LOX/LIN plant loadings were in the low 80s. In Asia, sales were up 30% versus last year with underlying sales up 23% and a 7% positive impact from currency. Volumes were up 20% with growth across the product lines, LOX/LIN volumes were up 22% in China. Pricing continued to be strong, up 3% with the LOX/LIN prices up 5%. Plant loadings are around 80% as we continue to add capacity and sales to the system. Signings for the quarter were well above last year. 
This quarter, we continue to demonstrate our focus on, and success, in emerging markets. In August, we announced a new contract to supply our fully integrated Oxy fuel combustion solution to Guangzhou Chung Sung century Fiber Glass in Nansha, China to reduce emissions and improve productivity in glass filament production. We will supply our clean fire oxy fuel burners and flow control skid and we will install a prism BSA unit for on-site oxygen generation. Last month, we announced an agreement to acquire a 25% stake in the gases and equipment businesses of Abdula Hashin Industrial Gases and Equipment Co., the largest industrial gas company in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We are excited about using our successful joint venture strategy in the Middle East. This strategy of combing our partners' local market and country knowledge with our skills and engineering, operations, applications and finance, has led to our leadership positions in Taiwan, Korea, Spain and other countries. Deepening our relationship with AHG gives us the opportunity to participate in the strong Merchant Gases growth in Saudi Arabia and is a significant new platform from which to pursue Tonnage Gas opportunities throughout the Middle East. 
Please turn to Slide 9, Tonnage Gases. Tonnage Gases sales of $883 million increased 17% versus last year with volumes up 11%, energy and raw material pass-through increasing sales by 3% and a positive 3% currency affect. Sequentially, sales were up 2% on 3% higher volumes and 1% lower energy and raw material pass-through. The volume increase is relative to both prior year and prior quarter, were primarily driven by new projects. Operating income of $152 million was up 30% from prior year and 32% sequentially on higher volumes, improved operating efficiency and reduced maintenance costs. We also had a net gain from contract modifications of a about $0.05 in the quarter. As expected, after a number of scheduled maintenance outages in Q2 and Q3, Q4 maintenance spending was lower. Operating margin of 17.2% increased to 160 basis points versus prior year and 400 basis points sequentially on the higher operating income. 
Moving to new business. We were pleased to announce the long-term hydrogen supply agreement for Shell Oil's Deer Park, Texas refinery and for Motiva Enterprise's Convent, Louisiana refinery. Both contracts will be supported by Air Products' industry-leading Gulf Coast hydrogen pipeline supply network that will serve multiple refinery and petrochemical companies from New Orleans on the east to the Houston ship channel on the West. We also, on our third long-term contract to supply oxygen and nitrogen to Wison and Clean Energy Limited's coal classification facility in Nanjing, China. We will build, own and operate our third air separation unit and integrate a liquefier to supply Wison and produce liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon for the growing regional Merchant industrial gas market. These awards are concrete examples of the key market growth drivers we shared at our Investor Conference in June. 
Please turn to Slide 10, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $587 million were up 12% compared to last year on 5% higher volumes, 4% higher pricing and 3% currency. Sequentially, sales were down 3% on lower volumes. Electronics sales were up 17% compared to last year and up 2% sequentially as industry growth slowed as we expected. Electronic materials sales were up modestly versus last year, while Tonnage and equipment continued to show strong growth. Electronics specialty materials pricing remained stable. Performance material sales increased 7% versus last year with 9% higher prices and a 3% positive currency affect, offsetting a 5% volume decline. Sequentially, sales were down 9% primarily on the volume declines. The softness in PMD reflects slowdowns in key markets, including housing, construction and autos. Operating income of $92 million was up 9% versus prior year, primarily due to Electronics volumes and Performance Materials pricing and was down 16% sequentially due to lower Performance Materials volumes. Segment operating margin of 15.6% was down 50 basis points versus prior year due to higher costs, down 250 basis points sequentially due to lower volumes and higher costs. Margins exceeded the FY '11 target of 15% by 80 basis points for the year. In new projects, we announced the new nitrogen plant at our site in the Chonan Industrial Complex in Korea and a second contract with Samsung mobile display to supply gaseous nitrogen and oxygen and liquid argon for their active matrix organic light-emitting diode production in Tanjeong, Korea. 
Finally, earlier this quarter, we announced plans to more than double our nitrogen trifluoride or NF3 capacity at our Ulsan, Korea site. NF3 remains the chamber cleaning gas of choice for semiconductor display and photovoltaic manufacturers. This plan will leverage our existing site infrastructure to expand our reliable and cost-effective NF3 supply. 
Now please turn to Slide 11, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $96 million were down 25% versus prior year on lower ASU and LNG sales and up 21% sequentially on higher ASU sales. Operating income of $12 million was down 43% versus prior year due to lower sales and up 34% sequentially due primarily to favorable year-end cost absorption. Our backlog is up versus prior year and sequentially on several new large ASU orders. 
Now, I'll turn the call back over to Paul."

Now if you'll turn to Slide #12, I'd like to share our thoughts on our outlook. After a fairly good start during the first half of fiscal 2011, we saw economic growth decline as uncertainty grew. Because of this uncertainty, our fiscal 2012",1538,"Thanks, Simon. Now if you'll turn to Slide #12, I'd like to share our thoughts on our outlook. After a fairly good start during the first half of fiscal 2011, we saw economic growth decline as uncertainty grew. Because of this uncertainty, our fiscal 2012 forecast for economic growth has a wider range than in past years. Globally, for the regions we operate in, we see economic growth of 2% to 5%. On the pessimistic side of this range, we would see the following scenarios: for the U.S., if the current fiscal and policy uncertainties continue, this would likely keep consumer confidence low; automotive production slow; housing at its current low level and the investment climate depressed, resulting in about 1% manufacturing growth. Asia would see the contraction of consumer markets in the U.S. and Europe and we would not expect Chinese consumer spending to significantly offset this. Investment activity would be held down by overcapacity concerns and we would expect regional growth to drop to 4%. For Europe, while we are not forecasting a full-fledged financial crisis, we are forecasting that current negative trends continue and the region would have a modest manufacturing recession with an expected 2% contraction. 
On the optimistic side of this range, we would see the following scenarios: in the U.S., we would start to see a consensus form in advance of the election, which leads to improved consumer confidence and business investment, starting a virtuous cycle of growth in the second half of our fiscal year; we would expect 5% economic growth; in Asia, the attempts to drive greater consumer spending in China would succeeded and demand would grow across the region, along with better export markets to the U.S. and Europe; expected growth would rise to 9%; in Europe, the negative trends would start to reverse as the governments made progress on their fiscal problems, however, expected growth would still be weak at 1%. This broad range of economic scenarios results in a wider range for earnings of $5.90 to $6.30 per share for 2012. While the outcomes could vary, we are prepared to execute our business plans and adapt to whatever economic environment emerges. 
Walking from our 2011 earnings per share of $5.73, we have the following factors. New plant on-streams in 2011 and 2012 should add $0.30 to $0.35. These are projects that are either onstream now, or will be on stream soon and our backed by contract contractual commitments to buy. We should see this growth independent of global economic conditions. Loading existing assets should add $0.10 to $0.40 to earnings per share. This is the factor most influenced by the economy. In Equipment and Energy, we expect fiscal 2012 operating results will be down due to less LNG activity, a $0.05 to $0.10 headwind. Pension expense will be about a $0.05 headwind due to the drop in interest rates from 2010 to 2011 and lower asset returns. And we see a $0.10 headwind from a higher tax rate, approximately 26%. In any economic environment, cost control and cost reductions are important factors that drive earnings, margin and return improvement. For 2012, our bottom line should also improve from our productivity efforts and we will remain diligent on discretionary spending, new programs and staffing. 
Now, turning to our outlook by business segment. In Merchant Gases, we are continuing to add selling resources in the U.S. to drive volume growth as we focus on new applications and expand our micro bulk offering. We continue to expand our Merchant capacity in Asia, manufacturing growth along with our new applications efforts should lead to strong volume growth. In Europe, we will continue to derive prices higher to offset higher energy costs and take actions to reduce operating costs. In our Tonnage Gases segment, we will see the benefit from the full year loading of our fiscal 2011 startups along with a number of investments due to come onstream this year. A list of our major projects is in the appendix slide. 
On the new order front, we have announced and expect to continue to announce, a significant number of new projects, which will provide growth in 2013 and beyond. For Electronics, we are forecasting modest silicon growth of 0% to 5% for 2012. We expect that our position with the industry leaders should help us grow faster than the industry as they are making the majority of new capital investments. Electronics industry capital expenditures after 2 very strong years, is forecasted to decline 15% to 20% in 2012. Our Electronics Equipment business results are expected to slow accordingly. However, this would still make 2012 the second highest capital spending year for the industry. For Performance Materials, we expect the current volume softness to continue through Q1. But when economic conditions improve, volume growth should return, as we benefit from our low-cost production facilities and our new product, market and application successes. 
Before we turn to the next quarter, I want to briefly address a question we have heard. What if 2012 turns into a re-run of 2009 and the world goes back into a recession? First, we believe the world is different from both an economic and an Air Product standpoint. With regard to the economy, autos and housing, which were hit hard, have not fully recovered. Therefore, they have less relative exposure. Electronics had a massive inventory correction, but today, inventories are at a much lower level. And both corporations and consumers have delevered their balance sheets and are financially stronger. With regard to Air Products, we're also much stronger, our margins are 200 basis points higher than in 2008 and our Tonnage segment in 2009, we experienced a significant drop in the value of our operating efficiencies due to the large drop in natural gas prices. With already low natural gas prices, our operating results should be more stable. And Electronics has restructured its business, strengthened its position with the industry leaders, improved its product portfolio and increased segment margins by over 450 basis points. So if we do go into a global recession, we don't see 2012 being as bad as 2009. 
Turning to Slide #13. Our guidance for quarter 1 is for earnings per share of $1.31 to $1.39 based on the following factors. On the positive side, we expect to see increased earnings sequentially from new plant on streams, including our new hydrogen plant in Rotterdam and the Weihe oxygen on-site and Merchant plant. Offsetting this sequential improvement, in Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials, we expect flat economic growth along with the lower seasonal demand. In Tonnage Gases, profits are expected to decline due to higher maintenance spending, financial difficulties with a particular customer in our polyurethane intermediates business and the quarter 4 contract modifications. So we expect our quarter 1 operating profit level in the Tonnage segment to be similar to the level delivered in quarter 1 last year. 
Consistent with the full year guidance, we will see lower Equipment and Energy profits. Equity affiliates, pension and currency will be negative, but they will be roughly offset by lower non-controlling interest on lower taxes. As I said, we believe there is a chance that Europe goes into a recession and at best, we'll have flat to very slight growth. Therefore, regardless of the economy during Q1, we will begin to take actions to reduce our costs across the region. These actions are not yet fully defined and any cost or benefits from these actions are not included in our guidance. 
Please turn to Slide #14 for our capital spending outlook. Our capital spending for 2011 was $1.6 billion. For 2012, we expect that our capital spending will be between $1.9 billion and $2.2 billion, an increase of 20% to 40%. This includes a maintenance capital expenditure of $300 million to $350 million, in line with prior year. The majority of our spending is in the Tonnage area with about $1 billion associated with new large plants and pipelines. When you look across all 4 business segments, over 75% of our growth capital expenditures is under long-term take or pay contracts. You can also seen that the majority of our spending is in the Americas and Asia. We continue to work on acquisition opportunities, including captive plans from customers and we also continue to look for focused opportunities that complement our existing positions, such as our investment in Saudi Arabia. 
Now, let me wrap up. We had a good 2011, growing sales and earnings double digits while continuing to make improvements in our operating margin and most importantly, our return on capital. The increase in capital spending we announced today plus the bidding activity we are seeing, gives us a number of excellent opportunities for the future beyond 2012. As we move forward, our priority is to deliver the growth, margin improvement and higher returns that'll make us the best investment choice in the industry for our shareholders. 2012 will certainly offer its challenges as we work through the economic uncertainties.

But as Paul mentioned, we see MSI for the year, in a range of 0% to 5%. I would just also make the point though, that while that's fairly modest growth, we saw sequential sales in Electronics up 2% and we see the number of our customers make comments this week that certainly would clarify that we're in no danger of seeing any significant downturn like we have seen in the past. I mean, Intel talked about inventories being tightly managed and obviously, Apple reported very strong sequential sales increases in their units. So again, I think we see flat but no sign of any significant downturn."

And we outlined a number of actions last quarter in which we said we're going to take. The first of those actions was within the U.S. to improve our volumes there. We made good progress. We had 5% growth in volumes. We are working to get that better obviously. I think the good news, which Simon reported is quarter 4 was that the signings were up from quarter 3 and when we just compare our signings for the second half, when our actions and post-Airgas started to take some effect to the first half, our signings our 2x in the second half what they were in the first half. So we're still hiring salespeople. That effort, I believe, is on track and will accomplish the goals, which we have. As we said it's going to take some time for us to see this. It will take probably through the next year as we see these customers brought on stream, because it takes 6 to 9 months to marry a customer on stream. With regard to Europe and the prices which we talked about, the Europe pricing as you heard was flat, that was healthcare being down. Improved pricing in Europe on the liquid/bulk side. However, we're not recovering the increased power there and we need to do that. So we did more actions on pricing and we need to be better there. So I'd like the trend of pricing starting to move up but it's not fixed yet and we need to get more things going there. Operational issues, which we had. We had less this quarter. So we are improving in those things. You can see that in the cost performance. We still have some other things, which we've got to do to bring plants onstream to end the distribution cost. We talked about the LaPorte plant and the Riley Ridge helium plant, which help in our supply of argon and helium, which will lower our distribution costs in those areas. And they come onstream in quarter 1 of this year and we'll likely -- we'll see the effect in quarter 2. Helium supply is still short and the Riley Ridge plant will help us there to come on stream. So overall, we think that we like the improvement. But we still think that there is more. Prior year was higher, but we intend to go there. So first quarter, we're not going to have everything in. There is a seasonal volume decline, so it's going probably tough, but we look towards the second, third and fourth quarters for that getting a lot better."

You'll see the big number, which is included in there is an inventory number, which and so I'll explain what happened to this. In total, the inventory number, which affected the corporation in total is about $2 million unfavorable. What happens is, at year end, is we do 2 things. First, within the books we use a standard cost in our P&Ls and so what that means if you go back to accounting courses, you take the inventory out its standard and you put the inventory in its standard and that goes into the COGS and the purchase price variances flow through the P&L. At the end of the year, we do our inventory on the balance sheet and they get they get valued at current cost for those things. And so there is a write up or a write down of inventories, which occurs within the business segments. In the U.S. only then, we also adjust to LIFO, which occurs at the corporate level in total on that thing. So it's a gain or loss, and which gets impacted there. So the $19 million or so on inventory, I believe, is all relates to those 2 adjustments on net for the company, is $2 million unfavorable."

Please turn to Slide #3 for a review of the key highlights from our fiscal year 2011. Clearly, the top highlight for us in 2011 was the number of new projects we announced over the last 12 months. Some of the larger ones are shown at the top of this slide. For some time, we have been sharing with you that bidding activity for new project remains high and as a validation of that point, our capital project backlog continues to rise and now stands at $2.5 billion. For this year, our capital spending was $1.6 billion, up 22% from 2010 and our outlook is now for this to grow to $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion in 2012. You can see that these projects are aligned with the key growth drivers we discussed at our Investor Conference. Hydrogen and oxygen for energy and environmental markets, nitrogen for electronics and merchant capacity for emerging markets. 
Now some financial highlights. We had a strong year, with significant improvement in operating cash flow, up 15%. We increased our dividend for the 29th consecutive year, an increase of 18%. We repurchased $649 million of stock during fiscal year 2011 and announced a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization. And our adjusted earnings per share of $5.73 was up 14%, just above the high end of our original guidance range. On the sustainability front, we renamed the both the Carbon Disclosure Project and Dow Jones Sustainable indices, reflecting the results and leadership we are delivering in this important area. 
Turning to Slide #4, sales of $10.1 billion increased 12% as we delivered strong gains across our Merchant Gases, Tonnage Gases and our Electronics and Performance Materials segments. Our underlying sales grew 10%, with volumes up 9% and price up 1%. We delivered good volume growth in a period of modest economic growth driven by strong performance on our Electronics and Performance Materials segment, which posted its second consecutive year of over 20% growth. Volume growth of 11% in Tonnage Gases, principally from new investments and contracts. And in our Merchant segment, growth in Asia was well above 20% with much more modest growth experienced in the U.S. and Europe. Operating income of $1.7 billion grew 13% mainly from better performance in Electronics and Performance Materials and Tonnage Gases segments. 
Our operating margin for the year was 16.6%, a modest improvement from last year. While we attained the highest operating margin in more than a decade, our operating leverage was partially offset by a number of product supply and cost issues in the second half of the year. As a result, we finished short of our 17% target. Looking forward, margin should continue to expand. We have operating leverage in the United States and Europe and we have solutions to our product supply and cost issues. And we remain committed to continuing to drive our cost reductions as we expand our business. Equity affiliates income increased 22% to $154 million this year, due to better results across a number of our joint ventures. The largest improvement came from Mexico, where volumes were significantly higher on strong LOX/LIN and packaged gas sales driven by glass, oil field services, refining and general manufacturing. And most importantly, our annual after-tax return on capital employed improved to 13.3%, 80 basis points above last year. 
Please turn to Slide 5. For the quarter, sales of $2.6 billion were 11% higher versus prior year. Underlying sales increased 6% year-on-year due to 4% higher volumes driven by Tonnage Gases, Electronics, Performance Materials and Merchant Gases segments and 2% higher pricing. Operating income of $425 million increased 6% from prior year due primarily to volume growth. Our operating margin declined to 16.3%, down 80 basis points versus prior year with 50 basis points due to currency and higher raw material pass-through and the rest due to price under recovery of cost inflation. For the quarter, net income increased 11% and diluted earnings per share increased by 12%, each versus prior year. 
Our return on capital employed on an instantaneous, our run rate basis improved to 13.5%. 
Turning to Slide 6 for a review of the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our adjusted continuing operations earnings per share increased by $0.16. Higher volumes increased earnings per share by $0.07 year-on-year. Pricing, energy and raw materials taken together, were flat and costs were about $0.01 unfavorable as our productivity gains were more than offset by cost inflation. Currency translation in foreign exchange netted to a $0.02 favorable impact. Equity affiliate income was $0.07 higher, partially due to better results in Mexico, India, Thailand and South Africa. Equity affiliate income also included a positive of $0.04 of good news from nonoperational items, which was offset by an accounting adjustment of a similar amount in non-controlling interest. Lower interest expense, a lower tax rate and fewer shares outstanding altogether were $0.05 positive. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Simon to review our business segment results. Simon?"

Merchant Gases sales of just over $1 billion were up 10% versus prior year. Underlying sales improved by 5% on 4% higher volumes with growth in Asia and U.S./Canada and 1% higher pricing, again, driven by Asia and U.S./Canada. Currency increased sales by 5%. Sequentially, sales were up 2% with 3% positive volume, flat pricing and a minus 1% currency impact. Just to note, we are now using the term U.S./Canada rather than North America to more accurately reflect the countries we are reporting. Our strong business in Mexico is reported as an equity affiliate so it's not included in these results. Merchant Gases' operating income of $192 million was up 4% versus prior year and 6% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 18.4% was down one 110 basis points versus prior year, but up 70 basis points sequentially. Versus last year, volume and price increased operating income, but the price increases were not enough to fully recover raw material cost increases, particularly in Europe. Versus prior quarter, positive volume combined with better operating and distribution cost performance drove the margin expansion. 
Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to Slide 8. In U.S./Canada, sales improved 8% versus prior year. Volumes were up 5% with particular strength in both argon and hydrogen. Pricing was 3% positive with improvement across the product lines as we took actions to recover higher costs. LOX/LIN capacity utilization improved to the mid-70s. Consistent with our plans, contract signings were very strong again this quarter above the good Q3 results. This will translate into positive volume momentum through next year. In Europe, sales increased 8% versus last year all due to currency. Volumes were relatively flat across the businesses, pricing was positive in liquid/bulk and packaged gases, but offset by continued negative price pressure in healthcare. The positive liquid/bulk price was an improvement over last quarter but still do not fully recover cost increases. LOX/LIN plant loadings were in the low 80s. In Asia, sales were up 30% versus last year with underlying sales up 23% and a 7% positive impact from currency. Volumes were up 20% with growth across the product lines, LOX/LIN volumes were up 22% in China. Pricing continued to be strong, up 3% with the LOX/LIN prices up 5%. Plant loadings are around 80% as we continue to add capacity and sales to the system. Signings for the quarter were well above last year. 
This quarter, we continue to demonstrate our focus on, and success, in emerging markets. In August, we announced a new contract to supply our fully integrated Oxy fuel combustion solution to Guangzhou Chung Sung century Fiber Glass in Nansha, China to reduce emissions and improve productivity in glass filament production. We will supply our clean fire oxy fuel burners and flow control skid and we will install a prism BSA unit for on-site oxygen generation. Last month, we announced an agreement to acquire a 25% stake in the gases and equipment businesses of Abdula Hashin Industrial Gases and Equipment Co., the largest industrial gas company in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We are excited about using our successful joint venture strategy in the Middle East. This strategy of combing our partners' local market and country knowledge with our skills and engineering, operations, applications and finance, has led to our leadership positions in Taiwan, Korea, Spain and other countries. Deepening our relationship with AHG gives us the opportunity to participate in the strong Merchant Gases growth in Saudi Arabia and is a significant new platform from which to pursue Tonnage Gas opportunities throughout the Middle East. 
Please turn to Slide 9, Tonnage Gases. Tonnage Gases sales of $883 million increased 17% versus last year with volumes up 11%, energy and raw material pass-through increasing sales by 3% and a positive 3% currency affect. Sequentially, sales were up 2% on 3% higher volumes and 1% lower energy and raw material pass-through. The volume increase is relative to both prior year and prior quarter, were primarily driven by new projects. Operating income of $152 million was up 30% from prior year and 32% sequentially on higher volumes, improved operating efficiency and reduced maintenance costs. We also had a net gain from contract modifications of a about $0.05 in the quarter. As expected, after a number of scheduled maintenance outages in Q2 and Q3, Q4 maintenance spending was lower. Operating margin of 17.2% increased to 160 basis points versus prior year and 400 basis points sequentially on the higher operating income. 
Moving to new business. We were pleased to announce the long-term hydrogen supply agreement for Shell Oil's Deer Park, Texas refinery and for Motiva Enterprise's Convent, Louisiana refinery. Both contracts will be supported by Air Products' industry-leading Gulf Coast hydrogen pipeline supply network that will serve multiple refinery and petrochemical companies from New Orleans on the east to the Houston ship channel on the West. We also, on our third long-term contract to supply oxygen and nitrogen to Wison and Clean Energy Limited's coal classification facility in Nanjing, China. We will build, own and operate our third air separation unit and integrate a liquefier to supply Wison and produce liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon for the growing regional Merchant industrial gas market. These awards are concrete examples of the key market growth drivers we shared at our Investor Conference in June. 
Please turn to Slide 10, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $587 million were up 12% compared to last year on 5% higher volumes, 4% higher pricing and 3% currency. Sequentially, sales were down 3% on lower volumes. Electronics sales were up 17% compared to last year and up 2% sequentially as industry growth slowed as we expected. Electronic materials sales were up modestly versus last year, while Tonnage and equipment continued to show strong growth. Electronics specialty materials pricing remained stable. Performance material sales increased 7% versus last year with 9% higher prices and a 3% positive currency affect, offsetting a 5% volume decline. Sequentially, sales were down 9% primarily on the volume declines. The softness in PMD reflects slowdowns in key markets, including housing, construction and autos. Operating income of $92 million was up 9% versus prior year, primarily due to Electronics volumes and Performance Materials pricing and was down 16% sequentially due to lower Performance Materials volumes. Segment operating margin of 15.6% was down 50 basis points versus prior year due to higher costs, down 250 basis points sequentially due to lower volumes and higher costs. Margins exceeded the FY '11 target of 15% by 80 basis points for the year. In new projects, we announced the new nitrogen plant at our site in the Chonan Industrial Complex in Korea and a second contract with Samsung mobile display to supply gaseous nitrogen and oxygen and liquid argon for their active matrix organic light-emitting diode production in Tanjeong, Korea. 
Finally, earlier this quarter, we announced plans to more than double our nitrogen trifluoride or NF3 capacity at our Ulsan, Korea site. NF3 remains the chamber cleaning gas of choice for semiconductor display and photovoltaic manufacturers. This plan will leverage our existing site infrastructure to expand our reliable and cost-effective NF3 supply. 
Now please turn to Slide 11, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $96 million were down 25% versus prior year on lower ASU and LNG sales and up 21% sequentially on higher ASU sales. Operating income of $12 million was down 43% versus prior year due to lower sales and up 34% sequentially due primarily to favorable year-end cost absorption. Our backlog is up versus prior year and sequentially on several new large ASU orders. 
Now, I'll turn the call back over to Paul."

Now if you'll turn to Slide #12, I'd like to share our thoughts on our outlook. After a fairly good start during the first half of fiscal 2011, we saw economic growth decline as uncertainty grew. Because of this uncertainty, our fiscal 2012",1537,"Thanks, Simon. Now if you'll turn to Slide #12, I'd like to share our thoughts on our outlook. After a fairly good start during the first half of fiscal 2011, we saw economic growth decline as uncertainty grew. Because of this uncertainty, our fiscal 2012 forecast for economic growth has a wider range than in past years. Globally, for the regions we operate in, we see economic growth of 2% to 5%. On the pessimistic side of this range, we would see the following scenarios: for the U.S., if the current fiscal and policy uncertainties continue, this would likely keep consumer confidence low; automobile production slow; housing at its current low level and the investment climate depressed, resulting in about 1% manufacturing growth. Asia would see the contraction of consumer markets in the U.S. and Europe and we would not expect Chinese consumer spending to significantly offset this. Investment activity would be held down by overcapacity concerns and we would expect regional growth to drop to 4%. For Europe, while we are not forecasting a full-fledged financial crisis, we are forecasting that current negative trends continue and the region would have a modest manufacturing recession with an expected 2% contraction. 
On the optimistic side of this range, we would see the following scenarios: in the U.S., we would start to see a consensus form in advance of the election, which leads to improved consumer confidence and business investment, starting a virtuous cycle of growth in the second half of our fiscal year; we would expect 5% economic growth; in Asia, the attempts to drive greater consumer spending in China would succeeded and demand would grow across the region, along with better export markets to the U.S. and Europe; expected growth would rise to 9%; in Europe, the negative trends would start to reverse as the governments made progress on their fiscal problems, however, expected growth would still be weak at 1%. This broad range of economic scenarios results in a wider range for earnings of $5.90 to $6.30 per share for 2012. While the outcomes could vary, we are prepared to execute our business plans and adapt to whatever economic environment emerges. 
Walking from our 2011 earnings per share of $5.73, we have the following factors. New plant on-streams in 2011 and 2012 should add $0.30 to $0.35. These are projects that are either onstream now, or will be on stream soon and our backed by contract contractual commitments to buy. We should see this growth independent of global economic conditions. Loading existing assets should add $0.10 to $0.40 to earnings per share. This is the factor most influenced by the economy. In Equipment and Energy, we expect fiscal 2012 operating results will be down due to less LNG activity, a $0.05 to $0.10 headwind. Pension expense will be about a $0.05 headwind due to the drop in interest rates from 2010 to 2011 and lower asset returns. And we see a $0.10 headwind from a higher tax rate, approximately 26%. In any economic environment, cost control and cost reductions are important factors that drive earnings, margin and return improvement. For 2012, our bottom line should also improve from our productivity efforts and we will remain diligent on discretionary spending, new programs and staffing. 
Now, turning to our outlook by business segment. In Merchant Gases, we are continuing to add selling resources in the U.S. to drive volume growth as we focus on new applications and expand our micro bulk offering. We continue to expand our Merchant capacity in Asia, manufacturing growth along with our new applications efforts should lead to strong volume growth. In Europe, we will continue to derive prices higher to offset higher energy costs and take actions to reduce operating costs. In our Tonnage Gases segment, we will see the benefit from the full year loading of our fiscal 2011 startups along with a number of investments due to come onstream this year. A list of our major projects is in the appendix slide. 
On the new order front, we have announced and expect to continue to announce, a significant number of new projects, which will provide growth in 2013 and beyond. For Electronics, we are forecasting modest silicon growth of 0% to 5% for 2012. We expect that our position with the industry leaders should help us grow faster than the industry as they are making the majority of new capital investments. Electronics industry capital expenditures after 2 very strong years, is forecasted to decline 15% to 20% in 2012. Our Electronics Equipment business results are expected to slow accordingly. However, this would still make 2012 the second highest capital spending year for the industry. For Performance Materials, we expect the current volume softness to continue through Q1. But when economic conditions improve, volume growth should return, as we benefit from our low-cost production facilities and our new product, market and application successes. 
Before we turn to the next quarter, I want to briefly address a question we have heard. What if 2012 turns into a re-run of 2009 and the world goes back into a recession? First, we believe the world is different from both an economic and an Air Product standpoint. With regard to the economy, autos and housing, which were hit hard, have not fully recovered. Therefore, they have less relative exposure. Electronics had a massive inventory correction, but today, inventories are at a much lower level. And both corporations and consumers have delevered their balance sheets and are financially stronger. With regard to Air Products, we're also much stronger, our margins are 200 basis points higher than in 2008 and our Tonnage segment in 2009, we experienced a significant drop in the value of our operating efficiencies due to the large drop in natural gas prices. With already low natural gas prices, our operating results should be more stable. And Electronics has restructured its business, strengthened its position with the industry leaders, improved its product portfolio and increased segment margins by over 450 basis points. So if we do go into a global recession, we don't see 2012 being as bad as 2009. 
Turning to Slide #13. Our guidance for quarter 1 is for earnings per share of $1.31 to $1.39 based on the following factors. On the positive side, we expect to see increased earnings sequentially from new plant onstreams, including our new hydrogen plant in Rotterdam and the Weihe oxygen on-site and Merchant plant. Offsetting this sequential improvement, in Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials, we expect flat economic growth along with the lower seasonal demand. In Tonnage Gases, profits are expected to decline due to higher maintenance spending, financial difficulties with a particular customer in our polyurethane intermediates business and the quarter 4 contract modifications. So we expect our quarter 1 operating profit level in the Tonnage segment to be similar to the level delivered in quarter 1 last year. 
Consistent with the full year guidance, we will see lower Equipment and Energy profits. Equity affiliates, pension and currency will be negative, but they will be roughly offset by lower non-controlling interest on lower taxes. As I said, we believe there is a chance that Europe goes into a recession and at best, we'll have flat to very slight growth. Therefore, regardless of the economy during Q1, we will begin to take actions to reduce our costs across the region. These actions are not yet fully defined and any cost or benefits from these actions are not included in our guidance. 
Please turn to Slide #14 for our capital spending outlook. Our capital spending for 2011 was $1.6 billion. For 2012, we expect that our capital spending will be between $1.9 billion and $2.2 billion, an increase of 20% to 40%. This includes a maintenance capital expenditure of $300 million to $350 million, in line with prior year. The majority of our spending is in the Tonnage area with about $1 billion associated with new large plants and pipelines. When you look across all 4 business segments, over 75% of our growth capital expenditures is under long-term take or pay contracts. You can also see that the majority of our spending is in the Americas and Asia. We continue to work on acquisition opportunities, including captive plans from customers and we also continue to look for focused opportunities that complement our existing positions, such as our investment in Saudi Arabia. 
Now, let me wrap up. We had a good 2011, growing sales and earnings double digits while continuing to make improvements in our operating margin and most importantly, our return on capital. The increase in capital spending we announced today, plus the bidding activity we are seeing, gives us a number of excellent opportunities for the future beyond 2012. As we move forward, our priority is to deliver the growth, margin improvement and higher returns that'll make us the best investment choice in the industry for our shareholders. 2012 will certainly offer its challenges as we work through the economic uncertainties. However, we believe we are well positioned to make the progress we need to deliver our 2015 goals. 
Thank you and now, I'll turn the call over to David to take your questions."

I would just also make the point though, that while that's fairly modest growth, we saw sequential sales in Electronics up 2% and we see the number of our customers make comments this week that certainly would clarify that we're in no danger of seeing any significant downturn like we have seen in the past. I mean, Intel talked about inventories being tightly managed and obviously, Apple reported very strong sequential sales increases in their units.

And we outlined a number of actions last quarter in which we said we're going to take. The first of those actions was within the U.S. to improve our volumes there. We made good progress. We had 5% growth in volumes. We are working to get that better obviously. I think the good news, which Simon reported is quarter 4 was that the signings were up from quarter 3 and when we just compare our signings for the second half, when our actions and post-Airgas started to take some effect to the first half, our signings our 2x in the second half what they were in the first half. So we're still hiring salespeople. That effort, I believe, is on track and will accomplish the goals, which we have. As we said it's going to take some time for us to see this. It will take probably through the next year as we see these customers brought on stream, because it takes 6 to 9 months to marry a customer on stream. With regard to Europe and the prices which we talked about, the Europe pricing as you heard was flat, that was healthcare being down. Improved pricing in Europe on the liquid/bulk side. However, we're not recovering the increased power there and we need to do that. So we did more actions on pricing and we need to be better there. So I'd like the trend of pricing starting to move up but it's not fixed yet and we need to get more things going there. Operational issues, which we had. We had less this quarter. So we are improving in those things. You can see that in the cost performance. We still have some other things, which we've got to do to bring plants onstream to end the distribution cost. We talked about the LaPorte plant and the Riley Ridge helium plant, which help in our supply of argon and helium, which will lower our distribution costs in those areas. And they come onstream in quarter 1 of this year and we'll likely -- we'll see the effect in quarter 2. Helium supply is still short and the Riley Ridge plant will help us there to come on stream. So overall, we think that we like the improvement. But we still think that there is more. Prior year was higher, but we intend to go there. So first quarter, we're not going to have everything in. There is a seasonal volume decline, so it's going probably tough, but we look towards the second, third and fourth quarters for that getting a lot better."

First, within the books we use a standard cost in our P&Ls and so what that means if you go back to accounting courses, you take the inventory out its standard and you put the inventory in its standard and that goes into the COGS and the purchase price variances flow through the P&L. At the end of the year, we do our inventory on the balance sheet and they get they get valued at current cost for those things. And so there is a write up or a write down of inventories, which occurs within the business segments. In the U.S. only then, we also adjust to LIFO, which occurs at the corporate level in total on that thing. So it's a gain or loss, and which gets impacted there.
