Altria delivered strong results to its shareholders last year in a challenging business environment. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew by 8.6% to $1.90 per share, which exceeded our original 2010 guida",1437,"Thanks, Cliff, and good morning to everyone. Altria delivered strong results to its shareholders last year in a challenging business environment. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew by 8.6% to $1.90 per share, which exceeded our original 2010 guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share growth. We increased our dividend twice last year for a total increase of 11.8%, and Altria's total shareholder return in 2010 was 32.9%, significantly outpacing the S&P 500's total return of 14.8%. Solid operating companies income results from the Cigarettes, Smokeless Products and Wine segment as well as growth in earnings from our SABMiller equity investment were partially offset by lower operating companies income results from the Cigar and Financial Services segments.
In the Cigarette segment, PM U.S.A. grew operating companies income by expanding margins while also maintaining share momentum on Marlboro. The brand continued to perform very well in the marketplace as both the Marlboro non-menthol and Marlboro Menthol components of the brand had solid retail share gains last year. 
In addition, careful management of Marlboro's value equation helped the brand expand its operating margins while also supporting strong retail share growth. A variety of new products continued to help build Marlboro's marketplace position. The successful launch of the two Marlboro Special Blend of non-menthol products in the first quarter last year and the introduction of Marlboro's Skyline and follow in the fourth quarter of 2010 helped build the brand's position. In the first quarter of this year, Marlboro was launching two new special blend products, one non-menthol and the other menthol to round out this portfolio. Marlboro special brand products give the band knew we were profile designed to appeal to competitive adult smokers and offer existing adult smokers equity building news on the brand. 
In the Smokeless Products segment, USSTC and PM U.S.A. successfully grew their combined 2010 full year retail sale, which enabled their combined assistant volumes to grow faster than the category. This adjusted the volume growth contributed to strong adjusted operating companies income growth from the Smokeless Products segment in 2010.
Copenhagen performed particularly well in 2010 as the new product launches of copper dragon log to what degree Long Cut Straight and Extra Long Cut Natural helps drive strong retail share gains and volume growth for the brand. For the fourth quarter, the brand also offered Copenhagen Black is a unique offering specially blended with a rich dark character for a limited time only. 
USSTC is now beginning to roll out a comprehensive set of brand building initiatives to enhance Skoal's position of the marketplace. This include the national launch of 10 new products for Skoal in the first quarter of 2011, including eight new Skoal extra products that build on Skoal's heritage as an innovative smoke was brand that delivers food and taste. USSTC and PM U.S.A. also continue to build their businesses in the emerging snooze segment of the smokeless products category. In the first quarter of last year, PM U.S.A. expanded Marlboro's Snus naturally to build awareness and trial of all adult cigarette smokers for these innovative smokeless tobacco products. This month, PM U.S.A. began shipping two new Marlboro Snus varieties and a bigger and bolder format for a adult cigarette smokers looking for a more flavorful experience. Also this month, Skoal began shipping two new Snus varieties for adult smokers tobacco consumers seeking a spit-free smoking tobacco alternative.
We're pleased with the business and financial results achieved since we acquired UST in a little more than two years ago. The strong 2010 adjusted operating companies income results of our Smokeless Products and Wine segments when combined with the cost savings realized across the Altria family of companies resulting from the acquisition made it accretive to our 2010 adjusted diluted earnings per share.
In our Cigars segment, 2010 adjusted operating companies income, adjusted shipment volume and retail share were all down due to increased competitive pressures that forced Middleton to invest in promotional initiatives to defend its position in the marketplace. Some manufacturers are reportedly sourcing untipped machine-made large cigars from overseas locations because the federal excise tax on cigars is calculated as a percentage of the products price rather than per unit, companies that are importing cigars may be structuring the importune's actions in such a manner intended to reduce their tax payments low comparable product manufactured domestically. Although we believe these discrepancies will ultimately be resolved, in the short-term, Middleton plans to balance its operating companies income results with Black & Mild's retail share performance while determining the best approach to deal with the post FET increased challenges. 
Middleton launched Black & Mild Royal last year to address adult cigars preferences for different blends and tastes in cigars. This launch and convention would Black & Mild other initiatives restored the brand to a sequential retail share growth in the back half of 2010 compared to the first half of 2010.
Black & Mild has a strong pipeline of new products and initiatives planned for this year, including two new untipped cigar roll products currently in test markets. 
Altria's Sales & Distribution made significant progress in the back half of 2010, creating an enhanced retail platform to support future initiatives in the Smokeless Tobacco and Cigar businesses. Over the last four months, we have announced the national launch of 13 new smokeless products that are expected to build USSTC's and PM U.S.A. Smokeless Products businesses in 2011. 
In the line segment, last year, Ste. Michelle achieved strong volume growth, which addicted to strong operating companies income performance. Ste. Michelle drove his volume performance with continuing efforts to build distribution of the wine is it owns or represents and by continuing to produce high-quality preview wines. Last year, wines at Ste. Michelle either produced or represented received more than 150 ratings of 90 or higher. 
Altria and its operating companies delivered $317 million in cost savings in 2010. We have now delivered over $1.3 billion of cost savings across our companies against the $1.5 billion cost reduction program of our 2005 cost base. We are confident that we will successfully complete this program by the end of the year.
Altria remains committed to returning a large amount of cash to shareholders in the form of dividends as evidenced by last year's increase in our adjusted earnings per share, dividend payout ratio target of 80%. We are also pleased to announce that Altria's Board of Directors has authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program as an additional way to return cash to shareholders. Altria intends to repurchase these shares in 2011, but the timing of such purchases depends upon marketplace conditions and other factors.
We also remain committed to reducing our financing costs over time and have made progress against this objective. In 2009 and 2010 we paid off $1.7 billion of debt coming due, and in 2010 he took advantage of the low interest rate environment to issue $1 billion in new debt. These actions reduce our long-term weighted average coupon costs and helped lower the company's debt-to-EBITDA ratio. As additional debt comes due over the next few years, Altria will decide whether to refinance our retire this debt in whole or in part, depending upon the marketplace, business needs and conditions and other factors including our desire to maximize cash returns to our shareholders. 
The business environment for 2011 is likely to remain challenging. Adult consumers remain under economic pressure and face high unemployment. We are also cautious about the competitive promotional environment and mindful of uncertainties facing our tobacco businesses as they enter the year. 
In the Cigarette business, p.m. USA's continuing to see significant competitive activity and is also cautious about the outlook for excise tax increases, given the budgetary situation in many states. 
In the smokeless products business, we are very pleased with the business results, USSTC is just beginning to execute its plans for Skoal. 
And in the Cigars business, Middleton faces an especially challenging competitive market, which we believe will be resolved over time.
Our guidance for 2011 is thus appropriately prudent in light of these uncertainties. Altria forecasts that adjusted diluted earnings per share will increase by 6% to 9% to a range of $2.01 to $2.07 from an adjusted basis of $1.90 per share in 2010. Due to inventory movements in the Cigarette business and the timing of new product launches in 2010, we anticipate 2011 adjusted diluted earnings per share to build and accelerate as the year progresses.
I will now turn the call over to Altria's new Chief Financial Officer, Howard Willard, who will discuss Altria's business segment results in more detail."

The Cigarette segment reported solid operating companies income results in 2010. Last year, the Cigarette segment reported operating companies income increased by 7.8% to $5.5 billion, due primarily to higher lease prices, lower restructuring costs and promotional spending as well as higher cost savings from its manufacturing optimization program. These factors were partially offset by lower volume and higher FDA user fees. Excluding restructuring charges, adjusted Cigarette segment operating companies income grew by 4.5% to $5.6 billion. PM U.S.A. grew 2010 adjusted operating companies income by expanding its adjusted Cigarette segments operating margins by 1.6 percentage points to 38.3%. PM U.S.A's reported cigarette shipment volume decline 5.3% for the full year, but was down an estimated 6% when adjusted primarily for trade inventory changes. PM U.S.A. estimates that the total cigarette categories adjusted volumes decline 5% last year, which is in line with historical price elasticity of negative 0.3. The cigarette category's estimated volume decline rate was 7% in the first half of the year as the category lapped the FET related pricing actions, which occurred in the first half of 2009 and 4% in the second half of 2010.
Marlboro performed very well last year as it grew its full year retail share of the Cigarette category by 8/10 of a share point to 42.6%. Marlboro had balanced retail share growth as its non-menthol business grew half a share point to 36.6% and its menthol business grew 3/10 of a share point to 6%. Marlboro's strong retail share growth largely offset retail share declines for the balance of PM U.S.A.'s brand portfolio. PM U.S.A.'s 2010 retail share of the Cigarette category was down 1/10 of a share point, 49.8%. The Cigarette segment's operating income, shipment volume and retail share results in the fourth quarter were impacted by trade inventory changes and differentials in retail pricing around the list price increases taken by some cigarette manufacturers in the quarter.
In the fourth quarter of 2010, reported Cigarette segment's operating companies income was up 7.4% to $1.2 billion. Excluding restructuring costs, the cigarette segment's fourth quarter adjusted operating companies income grew by 1% to $1.2 billion. PM USA's reported fourth quarter cigarette shipment volume decline by 7%, but when adjusted primarily for changes in trade inventories, declined an estimated 6%. This volume decline rate exceeded the estimated fourth quarter cigarette category decline rate of 4% due to moderate retail share losses in the quarter for PM USA's cigarette brand portfolio.
Marlboro's fourth quarter retail share grew by 6/10 of a share point to 42.3%. Continuing momentum from the Marlboro special blend products launched earlier in 2010 as well as the introduction of Marlboro Skyline Menthol the fourth quarter contributed to these strong retail share results. Marlboro's retail share gains largely offset retail share declines and the balance of PM USA's cigarette portfolio. PM USA's retail share in the fourth quarter of 2010 was down 2/10 of a share point to 49.2%.
The Smokeless Products segment had strong financial results for both the full year and fourth quarter of 2010. Reported Smokeless Products segment's operating companies income for 2010 grew over 100% to $803 million. Excluding restructuring and acquisition related costs, 2010 adjusted operating companies income for the Smokeless Products segment grew 30.9% to $827 million.
In the fourth quarter, USSTC and PM U.S.A. reduced promotional activities and allowed trade inventories to adjust and stabilize as ALTSD implemented its enhanced retail platform in about 60,000 stores. These activities impacted the adjusted operating companies income margins, shipment volume, and retail share results for the Smokeless Products segment in the quarter.
Reported Smokeless Products segment income for the fourth quarter grew over 100% to $217 million. Excluding restructuring and acquisition-related costs, fourth quarter adjusted operating companies income for the Smokeless Products segment increased 63.5% to $224 million.

USSTC estimates that the Smokeless Products category grew 6% in the fourth quarter of 2010.
USSTC and PM U.S.A. grew their combined full year retail share of the Smokeless Products category by 7/10 of a share point to 55.3%. Copenhagen's strong retail share gains of two share points for the full year more than offset Skoal's retail share declines and was a principal driver of overall retail share growth.
In the fourth quarter, USSTC and PM U.S.A.'s retail share of the Smokeless Products category declined 1/10 of a share point to 54.5%. Copenhagen grew its  fourth quarter retail share by 1.1 share points to 25.7% behind the continuing marketplace momentum from its new product launches. Skoal's fourth quarter retail share declined by 1.6 share points to 21.7%. USSTC expects Skoal's performance to improve in 2011 due to planned brand building initiatives and new product launches.
Reporting Cigar segment's operating companies income, for the full year and fourth quarter, declined by 5.1% to $167 million and 43.2% to $21 million, respectively. When adjusted for integration costs, adjusted Cigar segment's operating companies income for the full year declined by 8.6% to $169 million and 43.6% to $22  million for the fourth quarter. Adjusted Cigar segment's operating companies income declined in both periods largely due to promotional investments made by Middleton in response the competitive dynamics in the marketplace.
Middleton's 2010 reported cigar shipment volume declined by 1%, and when adjusted for changes in trade inventories, declined by the estimated 4%. In the fourth quarter of 2010, reported cigar shipment volume was essentially unchanged and when adjusted for changes in trade inventories, declined by an estimated 1%. The primary driver of volume declines in both periods was retail share losses on Black & Mild. Middleton estimates that the machine-made large cigar category grew by 2% in 2010 and approximately 4% in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Black & Mild's full year retail share of the machine-mage large cigar category declined by 1.3 share points to 28.5%. For the fourth quarter of 2010, Black & Mild's retail share declined by 1.5 share points to 29.1%. Black & Mild's retail share declines in both periods were driven primarily by increased competitive activity. Black & Mild's successful brand building efforts, which included the lot of Black & Mild Royale last summer helped the brand return to sequential retail share growth. The brand's second half of 2010 in retail share was 1.2 share points higher in the first half of 2010.
The Wine segment reported strong operating companies income and volume results in 2010.

The Financial Services segment's reported operating companies income for 2010 declined by $113 million to $157 million, due primarily to lower gains on asset sales. For the fourth quarter of 2010, the Financial Services segment's reported operating companies income increased by $60 million to $70 million new primarily to higher gains on asset sales and asset impairment and exit costs of 2009.

So I can't speak to whether or not that's fully balanced out in retail stores right now because I don't know. I just can tell you we wanted to give it a chance to occur.

And so we've announced what it would produce when we did that, how long it would take and we've been getting that work done. I think looking ahead, as we look at cost saves, we believe that we'll continue to see declines in volume in the cigarette industry and in our Cigarette business and so we're focused on continuing to methodically reduce cigarette infrastructure. We don't have major factory locations that will be affected by that decline because we only have one major manufacturing facility now. But we do have other areas in the operation of cigarettes that we can have decline in terms of costs as the volume comes down. So that will be our primary component. And then in the growth businesses, particularly the Smokeless business, but also the Cigars business, but primarily in the Smokeless business, we want to realize that growth in away that we're not adding a lot of costs so we can have an impact that's positive on our cost per unit because the volume will grow and we won't have to expand capacity or take on major costs. We're looking for ways to really be more efficient in the way we operate our smokeless operations as the volume grows so we can absorb that volume growth and give a positive impact on our cost structure. And that also is the case in some of our service areas like Sales & Distribution and the Altria Client Services operation. We're looking for ways to be able to absorb Smokeless growth, sometimes to be able to service organization transfer assets that have been applied to the Cigarette business over to the Smokeless business. Sometimes we won't and we'll be taking those assets out. But that's really the fundamental approach as we look at how we're going to get productivity out of the business at least over the next few years."

It's a big country. It's got lots of different markets within it, lots different states, lots of different pricing variables exist over the place and there are different types of development of different products and competitive products in the marketplace. I think what you have to recognize is Marlboro is a big brand and in a declining category, the way that brand grows is it has to get competitive smokers to join its franchise, and it needs to keep its adult smoker consumers that are in that brand or continuing to participate in that category. So the kinds of extensions that we do are designed to reach out to competitive adult smokers and give them an opportunity to join the brand's franchise called Marlboro. At the same token, we get an additional benefit because provides equity news and so even an existing consumer for the Marlboro brand on mainline SKUs isn't interested in new SKUs. It does in fact bring news about the brand. So that's the reason why we do that because this brand is a brand continues to show the equity strength to grow out into the future, but to grow it has to reach out to adult competitive smokers."

296308,118231076,96020,"Altria Group Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2011",2011-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Altria Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Cliff, and good morning to everyone. Altria delivered strong results to its shareholders last year in a challenging business environment. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew by 8.6% to $1.90 per share, which exceeded our original 2010 guidanc",1430,"Thanks, Cliff, and good morning to everyone. Altria delivered strong results to its shareholders last year in a challenging business environment. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew by 8.6% to $1.90 per share, which exceeded our original 2010 guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share growth. We increased our dividend twice last year for a total increase of 11.8%, and Altria's total shareholder return in 2010 was 32.9%, significantly outpacing the S&P 500's total return of 14.8%. Solid operating companies income results from the Cigarettes, Smokeless Products and Wine segments, as well as growth in earnings from our SABMiller equity investment, were partially offset by lower operating companies income results from the Cigar and Financial Services segments.
In the Cigarette segment, PM U.S.A. successfully grew operating companies income by expanding margins, while also maintaining share momentum on Marlboro. The brand continued to perform very well in the marketplace, as both the Marlboro non-menthol and Marlboro Menthol components of the brand had solid retail share gains last year.  In addition, careful management of Marlboro's value equation helped the brand expand its operating margins, while also supporting strong retail share growth. A variety of new products continued to help build Marlboro's marketplace position. The successful launch of the two Marlboro Special Blend non-menthol products in the first quarter of last year, and the introduction of Marlboro's Skyline menthol in the fourth quarter of 2010 helped build the brand's position. 
In the first quarter of this year, Marlboro was launching two new special blend products, one non-menthol and the other menthol, to round out this portfolio. Marlboro Special Blend products give the brand new flavor profiles, designed to appeal to competitive adult smokers and offer its existing adult smokers equity building news on the brand. 
In the Smokeless Products segment, USSTC and PM U.S.A. successfully grew their combined 2010 full year retail share, which enabled their combined adjusted volumes to grow faster than the category. This adjusted volume growth contributed to strong adjusted operating companies income growth for the Smokeless Products segment in 2010.  Copenhagen performed particularly well in 2010 as the new product launches of Copenhagen Long Cut Wintergreen, Long Cut Straight and Extra Long Cut Natural helped drive strong retail share gains and volume growth for the brand. In the fourth quarter, the brand also offered Copenhagen Black as a unique offering, specially blended with a rich dark character for a limited time only. 
USSTC is now beginning to roll out a comprehensive set of the brand building initiatives to enhance Skoal's position in the marketplace. These include the national launch of 10 new products for Skoal in the first quarter of 2011, including eight new Skoal extra products that build on Skoal's heritage as an innovative smokeless brand that delivers smooth taste. USSTC and PM U.S.A. also continued to build their businesses in the emerging Snus segment of the smokeless products category. 
In the first quarter of last year, PM U.S.A. expanded Marlboro's Snus nationally to build awareness and trial among adult cigarette smokers for these innovative smokeless tobacco products. This month, PM U.S.A. began shipping two new Marlboro Snus varieties and a bigger and bolder format for adult cigarette smokers looking for a more flavorful experience. Also this month, Skoal began shipping two new Snus varieties for adult smokers tobacco consumers seeking a spit-free smokers tobacco alternative.
We're pleased with the business and financial results achieved since we acquired UST a little more than two years ago. The strong 2010 adjusted operating companies income results of our Smokeless Products and Wine segments, when combined with the cost savings realized across the Altria family of companies resulting from the acquisition, made it accretive to our 2010 adjusted diluted earnings per share.
In our Cigars segment, 2010 adjusted operating companies income, adjusted shipment volume and retail share were all down due to increased competitive pressures that forced Middleton to invest in promotional initiatives to defend its position in the marketplace. Some manufacturers are reportedly sourcing untipped machine-made large cigars from overseas locations, because the federal excise tax on cigars is calculated as a percentage of the product's price rather than per unit. Companies that are importing cigars may be structuring the import transactions in such a manner intended to reduce their tax payments below comparable product manufactured domestically. Although we believe these discrepancies will ultimately be resolved, in the short-term, Middleton plans to balance its operating companies income results with Black & Mild's retail share performance, while determining the best approach to deal with the post FET increased challenges. 
Middleton launched Black & Mild Royal last year to address adult cigars smokers preferences for different blends and tastes in cigars. This launch and conjunction with Black & Mild's other initiatives restored the brand to sequential retail share growth in the back half of 2010 compared to the first half of 2010.
Black & Mild has a strong pipeline of new products and initiatives planned for this year, including two new untipped cigarillo products currently in test markets. 
Altria's Sales & Distribution made significant progress in the back half of 2010, creating an enhanced retail platform to support future initiatives in the Smokeless Tobacco and Cigar businesses. Over the last four months, we have announced the national launch of 13 new smokeless products that are expected to build USSTC's and PM U.S.A.'s Smokeless Products businesses in 2011. 
In the Wine segment, last year, Ste. Michelle achieved strong volume growth, which contributed to strong operating companies income performance. Ste. Michelle drove this volume performance with continuing efforts to build distribution of the wine it owns or represents, and by continuing to produce high-quality premium wines. Last year, wines at Ste. Michelle either produced or represented, received more than 150 ratings of 90 or higher. 
Altria and its operating companies delivered $317 million in cost savings in 2010. We have now delivered over $1.3 billion of cost savings across our companies against the $1.5 billion cost reduction program of our 2005 cost base. We are confident that we will successfully complete this program by the end of the year.
Altria remains committed to returning a large amount of cash to shareholders in the form of dividends, as evidenced by last year's increase in our adjusted earnings per share dividend payout ratio target of 80%. We are also pleased to announce that Altria's Board of Directors has authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program as an additional way to return cash to shareholders. Altria intends to repurchase these shares in 2011, but the timing of such purchases depends upon marketplace conditions and other factors.
We also remain committed to reducing our financing cost over time and have made progress against this objective. In 2009 and 2010, we paid off $1.7 billion of debt coming due. And in 2010, we took advantage of the low interest rate environment to issue $1 billion in new debt. These actions reduced our long-term weighted average coupon costs and helped lower the company's debt-to-EBITDA ratio. As additional debt comes due over the next few years, Altria will decide whether to refinance or retire this debt in whole or in part, depending upon the marketplace, business needs and conditions, and other factors including our desire to maximize cash returns to our shareholders. 
The business environment for 2011 is likely to remain challenging. Adult consumers remain under economic pressure and face high unemployment. We are also cautious about the competitive promotional environment, and mindful of uncertainties facing our tobacco businesses as they enter the year. 
In the Cigarette business, PM USA is continuing to see significant competitive activity, and is also cautious about the outlook for excise tax increases, given the budgetary situation in many states.  In the Smokeless Products business, while we are very pleased with the business results, USSTC is just beginning to execute its plans for Skoal. 
And in the Cigars business, Middleton faces an especially challenging competitive market, which we believe will be resolved over time.
Our guidance for 2011 is thus appropriately prudent in light of these uncertainties. Altria forecasts that adjusted diluted earnings per share will increase by 6% to 9% to a range of $2.01 to $2.07 from an adjusted base of $1.90 per share in 2010. Due to inventory movements in the Cigarette business and the timing of new product launches in 2010, we anticipate 2011 adjusted diluted earnings per share to build and accelerate as the year progresses.
I will now turn the call over to Altria's new Chief Financial Officer, Howard Willard, who will discuss Altria's business segment results in more detail."

The Cigarette segment reported solid operating companies income results in 2010. Last year, the Cigarette segment's reported operating companies income increased by 7.8% to $5.5 billion, due primarily to higher list prices, lower restructuring costs and promotional spending, as well as higher cost savings from its manufacturing optimization program. These factors were partially offset by lower volume and higher FDA user fees. Excluding restructuring charges, adjusted Cigarette segment's operating companies income grew by 4.5% to $5.6 billion. 
PM U.S.A. grew 2010 adjusted operating companies income by expanding its adjusted Cigarette segments operating margins by 1.6 percentage points to 38.3%. PM U.S.A's reported cigarette shipment volume decline 5.3% for the full year, but was down an estimated 6% when adjusted primarily for trade inventory changes. PM U.S.A. estimates that the total cigarette categories adjusted volumes decline 5% last year, which is in line with historical price elasticity of negative 0.3. The Cigarette category's estimated volume decline rate was 7% in the first half of the year, as the category lapped the FET related pricing actions, which occurred in the first half of 2009 and 4% in the second half of 2010.
Marlboro performed very well last year, as it grew its full year retail share of the Cigarette category by 8/10 of a share point to 42.6%. Marlboro had balanced retail share growth, as its non-menthol business grew half a share point to 36.6% and its Menthol business grew 3/10 of a share point to 6%. Marlboro's strong retail share growth largely offset retail share declines from the balance of PM U.S.A.'s brand portfolio. PM U.S.A.'s 2010 retail share of the Cigarette category was down 1/10 of a share point, 49.8%. The Cigarette segment's operating companies income, shipment volume and retail share results in the fourth quarter were impacted by trade inventory changes and differentials in retail pricing around the list price increases taken by some cigarette manufacturers in the quarter.
In the fourth quarter of 2010, reported Cigarette segment's operating companies income was up 7.4% to $1.2 billion. Excluding restructuring costs, the cigarette segment's fourth quarter adjusted operating companies income grew by 1% to $1.2 billion. PM USA's reported fourth quarter cigarette shipment volume declined by 7%, but when adjusted primarily for changes in trade inventories, declined an estimated 6%. This volume decline rate exceeded the estimated fourth quarter cigarette category decline rate of 4% due to moderate retail share losses in the quarter for PM USA's cigarette brand portfolio.
Marlboro's fourth quarter retail share grew by 6/10 of a share point to 42.3%. Continuing momentum from the Marlboro special blend products launched earlier in 2010, as well as the introduction of Marlboro Skyline menthol in the fourth quarter contributed to these strong retail share results. Marlboro's retail share gains largely offset retail share declines in the balance of PM USA's cigarette portfolio. PM USA's retail share in the fourth quarter of 2010 was down 2/10 of a share point to 49.2%.
The Smokeless Products segment had strong financial results for both the full year and fourth quarter of 2010. Reported Smokeless Products segment's operating companies income for 2010 grew over 100% to $803 million. Excluding restructuring and acquisition related costs, 2010 adjusted operating companies income for the Smokeless Products segment grew 30.9% to $827 million.
In the fourth quarter, USSTC and PM U.S.A. reduced promotional activities, and allowed trade inventories to adjust and stabilize as AL&D implemented its enhanced retail platform in about 60,000 stores. These activities impacted the adjusted operating companies income margins, shipment volume, and retail share results for the Smokeless Products segment in the quarter.
Reported Smokeless Products segment income for the fourth quarter grew over 100% to $217 million. Excluding restructuring and acquisition-related costs, fourth quarter adjusted operating companies income for the Smokeless Products segment increased 63.5% to $224 million.
In 2010, USSTC and PM U.S.A.'s adjusted smokeless products volume growth exceeded the Smokeless Products category's estimated growth rate of 7%. Reported Smokeless Products shipment volume increased by 12.2% last year, but when adjusted primarily for trade inventory changes and new product pipeline volume, it was estimated to be up 8%. In the fourth quarter, reported Smokeless Products shipment volume increased by 2.5%, but when adjusted primarily for trade inventory changes and new product pipeline volume, it was estimated to be up 7%.
USSTC estimates that the Smokeless Products category grew 6% in the fourth quarter of 2010.  USSTC and PM U.S.A. grew their combined full year retail share of the Smokeless Products category by 7/10 of a share point to 55.3%. Copenhagen's strong retail share gains of two share points for the full year more than offset Skoal's retail share declines, and was a principal driver of overall retail share growth.
In the fourth quarter, USSTC and PM U.S.A.'s retail share of the Smokeless Products category declined 1/10 of a share point to 54.5%. Copenhagen grew its  fourth quarter retail share by 1.1 share points to 25.7% behind the continuing marketplace momentum from its new product launches. Skoal's fourth quarter retail share declined by 1.6 share points to 21.7%. USSTC expects Skoal's performance to improve in 2011 due to planned brand building initiatives and new product launches.
Reporting Cigar segment's operating companies income, for the full year and fourth quarter, declined by 5.1% to $167 million and 43.2% to $21 million, respectively. When adjusted for integration costs, adjusted Cigar segment's operating companies income for the full year declined by 8.6% to $169 million and 43.6% to $22  million for the fourth quarter. Adjusted Cigar segment's operating companies income declined in both periods largely due to promotional investments made by Middleton in response to competitive dynamics in the marketplace.
Middleton's 2010 reported cigar shipment volume declined by 1%, and when adjusted for changes in trade inventories, declined by an estimated 4%. In the fourth quarter of 2010, reported cigar shipment volume was essentially unchanged and when adjusted for changes in trade inventories, declined by an estimated 1%. The primary driver of volume declines in both periods was retail share losses on Black & Mild. Middleton estimates that the machine-made large cigar category grew by 2% in 2010 and approximately 4% in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Black & Mild's full year retail share of the machine-made Large Cigar category declined by 1.3 share points to 28.5%. For the fourth quarter of 2010, Black & Mild's retail share declined by 1.5 share points to 29.1%. Black & Mild's retail share declines in both periods were driven primarily by increased competitive activity. Black & Mild's successful brand building efforts, which included the launch of Black & Mild Royale last summer helped the brand return to sequential retail share growth. The brand's second half of 2010 retail share was 1.2 share points higher in the first half of 2010.
The Wine segment reported strong operating companies income and volume results in 2010. The Wine segment's reported operating companies income increased by 41.9% to $61 million for the full year of 2010 and by 42.9% to $30 million for the fourth quarter. Excluding restructuring and acquisition-related costs, adjusted operating companies income for the Wine segment increased by 13.7% to $83 million for the full year, and by 23.3% to $37 million for the fourth quarter. Ste. Michelle's 2010 wine shipments grew by 10.8% in the fourth quarter and 11.3% for the full year. 
The Financial Services segment's reported operating companies income for 2010 declined by $113 million to $157 million, due primarily to lower gains on asset sales. For the fourth quarter of 2010, the Financial Services segment's reported operating companies income increased by $60 million to $70 million, due primarily to higher gains on asset sales and asset impairment and exit costs in 2009.
Mike and I will now be happy to take your questions. While the calls are compiled, let me cover a few housekeeping items.
Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest effective priced cigarette was 35% in the fourth quarter and 34% for the full year. Marlboro's net pack price in the fourth quarter was $5.66, and for the full year was $5.55, while the lowest effective priced cigarette was $4.20 in the fourth quarter and $4.14 for the full year. 
The cigarette discount category's fourth quarter retail share was 27.9%, and was 27.4% for the full year. The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax at the end of the fourth quarter was $1.36 per pack. Copenhagen's fourth quarter net retail price was $4.25, and its price gap versus the leading discount brand was approximately 39% in the quarter. For the full year, Copenhagen's net retail price was $4.20, and its price gap versus the leading discount brand was 41%.
As of January 1, 2011, 20 states in the District of Columbia used a weight-based smokeless tobacco excise tax system, representing approximately 32% of the Smokeless Tobacco category's volume. And CapEx was $52 million and $168 million for the fourth quarter and full year of 2010, respectively. And ongoing depreciation and amortization was $68 million and $276 million for the fourth quarter and full year time periods, respectively.

So I can't speak whether or not that's fully balanced out in retail stores right now, because I don't know. I just can tell you we wanted to just give it a chance to occur.

And so we've announced what it would produce when we did that, how long it would take, and we've been getting that work done. I think looking ahead, as we look at cost saves, we believe that we'll continue to see declines in volume in the cigarette industry and in our Cigarette business, and so we're focused on continuing to methodically reduce cigarette infrastructure. We don't have major factory locations that will be affected by that decline because we only have one major manufacturing facility now. But we do have other areas in the operation of cigarettes that we can have decline in terms of cost as the volume comes down. So that will be a primary component. And then in the growth businesses, particularly the Smokeless business, but also the Cigar business, but primarily in the Smokeless business, we want to realize that growth in away that we're not adding a lot of costs, so we can have an impact that's positive on our cost per unit because the volume will grow, and we won't have to expand capacity or take on major costs. So we're looking for ways to really be more efficient in the way we operate our smokeless operations as the volume grows, so we can absorb that volume growth and give a positive impact on our cost structure. And that also is the case in some of the service areas like Sales & Distribution and the Altria Client Services operation. We're looking for ways to be able to absorb Smokeless growth, sometimes we'd be able to in those service organization, transfer assets that have been applied to the Cigarette business over to the Smokeless business. Sometimes we won't and we'll be taking some of those assets out. But that's really the fundamental approach as we look at how we're going to get productivity out of the business at least over the next few years."

I think what you have to recognize is that Marlboro's a big brand and that in a declining category, the way that brand grows is it has to get competitive smokers to join its franchise, and it needs to keep its adult smoker consumers that are in that brand or continuing to participate in the category. So the kinds of extensions that we do are designed to reach out to competitive adult smokers, and give them an opportunity to join the brand's franchise called Marlboro. At the same token, we get an additional benefit on the brand because it provides equity news. And so even if an existing consumer for the Marlboro brand on mainline SKUs isn't interested in the new SKU, it does in fact bring news about the brand to them. So that's the reason why we do them, because this brand is a brand that continues to show the equity strength to grow out into the future. But to grow, it has to reach out to competitive adult smokers."

The launches that are taking place, just beginning to be announced actually at retail and really, won't really impact the marketplace until March. One is a non-menthol product and the other one is a menthol product. So there hasn't been really any impact on our menthol business by special blend thus far. We did launch in the fourth quarter a product called Skyline, Marlboro Skyline, which is a different blend of Marlboro that has a different appeal to competitive menthol smokers for the brand. And that's off to a good start, but it's early for that product. But it's a continuation of us reaching out to competitive menthol smokers with good products that they might enjoy. And then beyond that, relative to FDA, that process continues. And sometime here, I think, over the next couple of months, we ought to see whatever recommendations come out of the TPSAC [Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee] committee. We'll talk about that in a little more detail on Monday."

296308,118231076,96075,"Altria Group Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2011",2011-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Altria Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Cliff, and good morning to everyone. Altria delivered strong results to its shareholders last year in a challenging business environment. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew by 8.6% to $1.90 per share, which exceeded our original 2010 guidanc",1432,"Thanks, Cliff, and good morning to everyone. Altria delivered strong results to its shareholders last year in a challenging business environment. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew by 8.6% to $1.90 per share, which exceeded our original 2010 guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share growth. We increased our dividend twice last year for a total increase of 11.8%, and Altria's total shareholder return in 2010 was 32.9%, significantly outpacing the S&P 500's total return of 14.8%. Solid operating companies' income results from the Cigarettes, Smokeless Products and Wine segments, as well as growth in earnings from our SABMiller equity investment were partially offset by lower operating companies' income results from the Cigar and Financial Services segments.
In the Cigarette segment, PM U.S.A. successfully grew operating companies' income by expanding margins, while also maintaining share momentum on Marlboro. The brand continued to perform very well in the marketplace, as both the Marlboro non-menthol and Marlboro Menthol components of the brand had solid retail share gains last year.  In addition, careful management of Marlboro's value equation helped the brand expand its operating margins, while also supporting strong retail share growth. A variety of new products continue to help build Marlboro's marketplace position. The successful launch of the two Marlboro Special Blend non-menthol products in the first quarter of last year, and the introduction of Marlboro's Skyline Menthol in the fourth quarter of 2010 helped build the brand's position. 
In the first quarter of this year, Marlboro is launching two new special blend products, one non-menthol and the other menthol, to round out this portfolio. Marlboro Special Blend products give the brand new flavor profiles, designed to appeal to competitive adult smokers and offer its existing adult smokers equity building news on the brand. 
In the Smokeless Products segment, USSTC and PM U.S.A. successfully grew their combined 2010 full year retail share, which enabled their combined adjusted volumes to grow faster than the category. This adjusted volume growth contributed to strong adjusted operating companies' income growth for the Smokeless Products segment in 2010.  Copenhagen performed particularly well in 2010 as the new product launches of Copenhagen Long Cut Wintergreen, Long Cut Straight and Extra Long Cut Natural helped drive strong retail share gains and volume growth for the brand. In the fourth quarter, the brand also offered Copenhagen Black as a unique offering, specially blended with a rich dark character for a limited time only. 
USSTC is now beginning to roll out a comprehensive set of the brand building initiatives to enhance Skoal's position in the marketplace. These include the national launch of 10 new products for Skoal in the first quarter of 2011, including eight new Skoal Extra products that build on Skoal's heritage as an innovative smokeless brand that delivers smooth taste. USSTC and PM U.S.A. also continued to build their businesses in the emerging Snus segment of the smokeless products category. 
In the first quarter of last year, PM U.S.A. expanded Marlboro Snus nationally to build awareness and trial among adult cigarette smokers for these innovative smokeless tobacco products. This month, PM U.S.A. began shipping two new Marlboro Snus varieties and a bigger and bolder format for adult cigarette smokers looking for a more flavorful experience. Also this month, Skoal began shipping two new Snus varieties for adult smokeless tobacco consumers seeking a spit-free smokers tobacco alternative.
We're pleased with the business and financial results achieved since we acquired UST a little more than two years ago. The strong 2010 adjusted operating companies' income results of our Smokeless Products and Wine segments, when combined with the cost savings realized across the Altria family of companies resulting from the acquisition, made it accretive to our 2010 adjusted diluted earnings per share.
In our Cigars segment, 2010 adjusted operating companies' income, adjusted shipment volume and retail share were all down due to increased competitive pressures that forced Middleton to invest in promotional initiatives to defend its position in the marketplace. Some manufacturers are reportedly sourcing untipped machine-made large cigars from overseas locations, because the federal excise tax on cigars is calculated as a percentage of the product's price rather than per unit. Companies that are importing cigars may be structuring their import transactions in such a manner intended to reduce their tax payments below a comparable product manufactured domestically. Although we believe these discrepancies will ultimately be resolved, in the short term, Middleton plans to balance its operating companies' income results with Black & Mild's retail share performance, while determining the best approach to deal with the post FET increased challenges. 
Middleton launched Black & Mild Royale last year to address adult cigar smokers' preferences for different blends and tastes in cigars. This launch, in conjunction with Black & Mild's other initiatives, restored the brand to sequential retail share growth in the back half of 2010 compared to the first half of 2010.
Black & Mild has a strong pipeline of new products and initiatives planned for this year, including two new untipped cigarillo products currently in test markets. 
Altria's Sales & Distribution made significant progress in the back half of 2010, creating an enhanced retail platform to support future initiatives in the Smokeless Tobacco and Cigar businesses. Over the last four months, we have announced the national launch of 13 new smokeless products that are expected to build USSTC's and PM U.S.A.'s Smokeless Products businesses in 2011. 
In the Wine segment, last year, Ste. Michelle achieved strong volume growth, which contributed to strong operating companies' income performance. Ste. Michelle drove this volume performance with continuing efforts to build distribution of the wines it owns or represents, and by continuing to produce high-quality premium wines. Last year, wines at Ste. Michelle either produced or represented, received more than 150 ratings of 90 or higher. 
Altria and its operating companies delivered $317 million in cost savings in 2010. We have now delivered over $1.3 billion of cost savings across our companies against the $1.5 billion cost reduction program off our 2005 cost base. We are confident that we will successfully complete this program by the end of the year.
Altria remains committed to returning a large amount of cash to shareholders in the form of dividends, as evidenced by last year's increase in our adjusted earnings per share dividend payout ratio target of 80%. We are also pleased to announce that Altria's Board of Directors has authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program as an additional way to return cash to shareholders. Altria intends to repurchase these shares in 2011, but the timing of such purchases depends upon marketplace conditions and other factors.
We also remain committed to reducing our financing costs over time and have made progress against this objective. In 2009 and 2010, we paid off $1.7 billion of debt coming due. And in 2010, we took advantage of the low interest rate environment to issue $1 billion in new debt. These actions reduced our long-term weighted average coupon cost and helped lower the company's debt-to-EBITDA ratio. As additional debt comes due over the next few years, Altria will decide whether to refinance or retire this debt in whole or in part, depending upon the marketplace, business needs and conditions, and other factors including our desire to maximize cash returns to our shareholders. 
The business environment for 2011 is likely to remain challenging. Adult consumers remain under economic pressure and face high unemployment. We are also cautious about the competitive promotional environment, and mindful of uncertainties facing our tobacco businesses as they enter the year. 
In the Cigarette business, PM U.S.A. is continuing to see significant competitive activity, and is also cautious about the outlook for excise tax increases, given the budgetary situation in many states.  In the Smokeless Products business, while we are very pleased with our business results, USSTC is just beginning to execute its plans for Skoal. And in the Cigar business, Middleton faces an especially challenging competitive market, which we believe will be resolved over time.
Our guidance for 2011 is thus appropriately prudent in light of these uncertainties. Altria forecasts that adjusted diluted earnings per share will increase by 6% to 9% to a range of $2.01 to $2.07 from an adjusted base of $1.90 per share in 2010. Due to inventory movements in the Cigarette business and the timing of new product launches in 2010, we anticipate 2011 adjusted diluted earnings per share to build and accelerate as the year progresses.
I will now turn the call over to Altria's new Chief Financial Officer, Howard Willard, who will discuss Altria's business segment results in more detail."

The Cigarette segment reported solid operating companies' income results in 2010. Last year, the Cigarette segment's reported operating companies' income increased by 7.8% to $5.5 billion, due primarily to higher list prices, lower restructuring costs and promotional spending, as well as higher cost savings from its manufacturing optimization program. These factors were partially offset by lower volume and higher FDA user fees. Excluding restructuring charges, adjusted Cigarette segment's operating companies' income grew by 4.5% to $5.6 billion. 
PM U.S.A. grew 2010 adjusted operating companies' income by expanding its adjusted Cigarette segment's operating margins by 1.6 percentage points to 38.3%. PM U.S.A.'s reported cigarette shipment volume decline 5.3% for the full year, but was down an estimated 6% when adjusted primarily for trade inventory changes. PM U.S.A. estimates that the total cigarette category's adjusted volumes decline 5% last year, which is in line with historical price elasticity of negative 0.3%. The Cigarette category's estimated volume decline rate was 7% in the first half of the year, as the category lapped the FET related pricing actions, which occurred in the first half of 2009 and 4% in the second half of 2010.
Marlboro performed very well last year, as it grew its full year retail share of the Cigarette category by 8/10 of a share point to 42.6%. Marlboro had balanced retail share growth, as its non-menthol business grew half a share point to 36.6% and its Menthol business grew 3/10 of a share point to 6%. Marlboro's strong retail share growth largely offset retail share declines from the balance of PM U.S.A.'s brand portfolio. PM U.S.A.'s 2010 retail share of the Cigarette category was down 1/10 of a share point, 49.8%. The Cigarette segment's operating companies' income, shipment volume and retail share results in the fourth quarter were impacted by trade inventory changes and differentials in retail pricing around the list price increases taken by some cigarette manufacturers in the quarter.
In the fourth quarter of 2010, reported Cigarette segment's operating companies' income was up 7.4% to $1.2 billion. Excluding restructuring costs, the cigarette segment's fourth quarter adjusted operating companies' income grew by 1% to $1.2 billion. PM U.S.A.'s reported fourth quarter cigarette shipment volume declined by 7%, but when adjusted primarily for changes in trade inventories, declined an estimated 6%. This volume decline rate exceeded the estimated fourth quarter cigarette category decline rate of 4% due to moderate retail share losses in the quarter for PM U.S.A.'s cigarette brand portfolio.
Marlboro's fourth quarter retail share grew by 6/10 of a share point to 42.3%. Continuing momentum from the Marlboro Special Blend products launched earlier in 2010, as well as the introduction of Marlboro Skyline Menthol in the fourth quarter contributed to these strong retail share results. Marlboro's retail share gains largely offset retail share declines in the balance of PM U.S.A.'s cigarette portfolio. PM U.S.A.'s retail share in the fourth quarter of 2010 was down 2/10 of a share point to 49.2%.
The Smokeless Products segment had strong financial results for both the full year and fourth quarter of 2010. Reported Smokeless Products segment's operating companies' income for 2010 grew over 100% to $803 million. Excluding restructuring and acquisition related costs, 2010 adjusted operating companies' income for the Smokeless Products segment grew 30.9% to $827 million.
In the fourth quarter, USSTC and PM U.S.A. reduced promotional activities, and allowed trade inventories to adjust and stabilize as ALS&D implemented its enhanced retail platform in about 60,000 stores. These activities impacted the adjusted operating companies' income margins, shipment volume, and retail share results for the Smokeless Products segment in the quarter.
Reported Smokeless Products segment's income for the fourth quarter grew over 100% to $217 million. Excluding restructuring and acquisition-related costs, fourth quarter adjusted operating companies' income for the Smokeless Products segment increased 63.5% to $224 million.
In 2010, USSTC and PM U.S.A.'s adjusted smokeless products volume growth exceeded the Smokeless Products category's estimated growth rate of 7%. Reported Smokeless Products shipment volume increased by 12.2% last year, but when adjusted primarily for trade inventory changes and new product pipeline volume, was estimated to be up 8%. In the fourth quarter, reported Smokeless Products shipment volume increased by 2.5%, but when adjusted primarily for trade inventory changes and new product pipeline volume, was estimated to be up 7%.
USSTC estimates that the Smokeless Products category grew 6% in the fourth quarter 2010.  USSTC and PM U.S.A. grew their combined full year retail share of the Smokeless Products category by 7/10 of a share point to 55.3%. Copenhagen's strong retail share gains of two share points for the full year more than offset Skoal's retail share declines, and was a principal driver of overall retail share growth.
In the fourth quarter, USSTC and PM U.S.A.'s retail share of the Smokeless Products category declined 1/10 of a share point to 54.5%. Copenhagen grew its fourth quarter retail share by 1.1 share points to 25.7% behind the continuing marketplace momentum from its new product launches. Skoal's fourth quarter retail share declined by 1.6 share points to 21.7%. USSTC expects Skoal's performance to improve in 2011 due to planned brand building initiatives and new product launches.
Reporting Cigar segment's operating companies' income, for the full year and fourth quarter, declined by 5.1% to $167 million and 43.2% to $21 million, respectively. When adjusted for integration costs, adjusted Cigar segment's operating companies' income for the full year declined by 8.6% to $169 million and 43.6% to $22 million for the fourth quarter. Adjusted Cigar segment's operating companies' income declined in both periods largely due to promotional investments made by Middleton in response to competitive dynamics in the marketplace.
Middleton's 2010 reported cigar shipment volume declined by 1%, and when adjusted for changes in trade inventories, declined by an estimated 4%. In the fourth quarter of 2010, reported cigar shipment volume was essentially unchanged and when adjusted for changes in trade inventories, declined by an estimated 1%. The primary driver of volume declines in both periods was retail share losses on Black & Mild. Middleton estimates that the machine-made large cigar category grew by 2% in 2010 and approximately 4% in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Black & Mild's full year retail share of the machine-made Large Cigar category declined by 1.3 share points to 28.5%. For the fourth quarter of 2010, Black & Mild's retail share declined by 1.5 share points to 29.1%. Black & Mild's retail share declines in both periods were driven primarily by increased competitive activity. Black & Mild's successful brand building efforts, which included the launch of Black & Mild Royale last summer, helped the brand return to sequential retail share growth. The brand's second half of 2010 retail share was 1.2 share points higher than the first half of 2010.
The Wine segment reported strong operating companies' income and volume results in 2010. The Wine segment's reported operating companies' income increased by 41.9% to $61 million for the full year of 2010 and by 42.9% to $30 million for the fourth quarter. Excluding restructuring and acquisition-related costs, adjusted operating companies' income for the Wine segment increased by 13.7% to $83 million for the full year, and by 23.3% to $37 million for the fourth quarter. Ste. Michelle's 2010 wine shipments grew by 10.8% in the fourth quarter and 11.3% for the full year. 
The Financial Services segment's reported operating companies' income for 2010 declined by $113 million to $157 million, due primarily to lower gains on asset sales. For the fourth quarter of 2010, the Financial Services segment's reported operating companies' income increased by $60 million to $70 million, due primarily to higher gains on asset sales and asset impairment and exit costs in 2009.
Mike and I will now be happy to take your questions. While the calls are compiled, let me cover a few housekeeping items.
Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest effective priced cigarette was 35% in the fourth quarter and 34% for the full year. Marlboro's net pack price in the fourth quarter was $5.66, and for the full year was $5.55, while the lowest effective priced cigarette was $4.20 in the fourth quarter and $4.14 for the full year. 
The cigarette discount category's fourth quarter retail share was 27.9%, and was 27.4% for the full year. The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax at the end of the fourth quarter was $1.36 per pack. Copenhagen's fourth quarter net retail price was $4.25, and its price gap versus the leading discount brand was approximately 39% in the quarter. For the full year, Copenhagen's net retail price was $4.20, and its price gap versus the leading discount brand was 41%.
As of January 1, 2011, 20 states in the District of Columbia used a weight-based smokeless tobacco excise tax system, representing approximately 32% of the Smokeless Tobacco category's volume. And CapEx was $52 million and $168 million for the fourth quarter and full year of 2010, respectively. And ongoing depreciation and amortization was $68 million and $276 million for the fourth quarter and full year time periods, respectively.

So I can't speak to whether or not that's fully balanced out in retail stores right now, because I don't know. I just can tell you we wanted to just give it a chance to occur.

And so we've announced what it would produce when we did that, how long it would take, and we've been getting that work done. I think looking ahead, as we look at cost saves, we believe that we'll continue to see declines in volume in the cigarette industry and in our Cigarette business, and so we're focused on continuing to methodically reduce cigarette infrastructure. We don't have major factory locations that will be affected by that decline because we only have one major manufacturing facility now. But we do have other areas in the operation of cigarettes that we can have decline in terms of cost as the volume comes down. So that will be a primary component. And then in the growth businesses, particularly the Smokeless business, but also the Cigar business, but primarily in the Smokeless business, we want to realize that growth in a way that we're not adding a lot of cost, so we can have an impact that's positive on our cost per unit because the volume will grow, and we won't have to expand capacity or take on major costs. So we're looking for ways to really be more efficient in the way we operate our smokeless operations as the volume grows, so we can absorb that volume growth and get a positive impact on our cost structure. And that also is the case in some of the service areas like Sales & Distribution and the Altria Client Services operation. We're looking for ways to be able to absorb Smokeless growth, sometimes we'd be able to in those service organization, transfer assets that have been applied to the Cigarette business over to the Smokeless business. Sometimes we won't and we'll be taking some of those assets out. But that's really the fundamental approach as we look at how we're going to get productivity out of the business at least over the next few years."

I think what you have to recognize is that Marlboro's a big brand and that in a declining category, the way that brand grows is it has to get competitive smokers to join its franchise, and it needs to keep its adult smoker consumers that are in that brand that are continuing to participate in the category. So the kinds of extensions that we do are designed to reach out to competitive adult smokers, and give them an opportunity to join the brand franchise called Marlboro. At the same token, we get an additional benefit on the brand because it provides equity news. And so even if an existing consumer for the Marlboro brand on mainline SKUs isn't interested in the new SKU, it does in fact bring news about the brand to them. So that's the reason why we do them, because this brand is a brand that continues to show the equity strength to grow out into the future. But to grow, it has to reach out to competitive adult smokers."

Altria delivered strong financial results in the first quarter with adjusted diluted EPS growth of 4.8% as our businesses navigated through high unemployment low consumer confidence and a competitive business",1412,"Thank you, Cliff, and good morning, everyone. Altria delivered strong financial results in the first quarter with adjusted diluted EPS growth of 4.8% as our businesses navigated through high unemployment low consumer confidence and a competitive business environment. As we anticipated, adjusted EPS growth comparisons for the first quarter were challenging but our results exceeded our initial expectations and give us confidence in our ability to achieve adjusted diluted EPS growth within our forecasted range for the year. In the Cigarette segment, PM U.S.A reported strong operating companies income growth with margin expansion. We are particularly pleased with these financial results and the comparable year ago period, the Cigarette segments adjusted operating companies income growth was also for some trade inventory changes impacted year-over-year comparisons for retail share volume and income in the Cigarette segment. New product launches for this year and in the first quarter last year had a significant impact on both PM U's.S.A. and Marlboro's retail share comparisons. PM U.S.A. shipped to Marlboro Special Blend SKUs in the beginning of the first quarter last year. The success of this launched significantly benefited Marlboro's retail share resorts and all of the first quarter of 2010, creating a challenging retail share comparison. Two additional Marlboro Special Blend SKUs were shipped toward the end of the first quarter this year with minimal impact on the quarter's retail share results.
Trade inventory changes also impacted quarter year-over-year Cigarette segment shipment and income comparisons.  PM U.S.A. believes trade build inventory from the beginning to the end of both comparable time periods but the trade build last inventory this year than 2010. Trade inventory build in the first quarter could negatively impacted volume and income results for the Cigarette segment if completed in the future.
PM U'. S.A. reported cigarette shipments decline versus the comparable year ago period and after adjusting for trade inventory changes, were estimated to be down slightly more than the cigarette category. PM U.S.A. adjustment cigarette shipments decline more than the category due to a decline in the  retail share. This retail share decline occurred primarily due to the timing of the Marlboro new product launches I've mentioned and retail share losses on some of PM U.S.A.'s other brands primarily discount as  PM U.S.A. optimizes the long-term income of its portfolio brands. 
PM U.S.A. is pleased with Marlboro's first quarter performance. The brand gained retail share as the quarter progressed, showing increased momentum and turned in an excellent profit performance. Although  PM U.S.A. faces a particularly challenging second quarter retail share comparison as Marlboro had a record retail share result in the second quarter of 2010, we expect quarterly retail share comparisons to improve significantly in the second half of the year both overall for Marlboro.
Overall,  PM U.S.A. delivered solid Cigarette segment business results in the quarter. Although competition remained intense and comparisons were tough, operating companies income continue to grow, operating companies marching continue to expand and Marlboro is well positioned for the balance of the year.
In the Smokeless Products segment, USSTC and  PM U.S.A. reported solid business results in the competitive environment. We are particularly pleased with the Smokeless Products segments operating companies income result as it had a challenging comparison to the first quarter of 2010. As in the Cigarette segment, there were a number of factors and the Smokeless Products segment impacting year-over-year comparisons for income, volume and retail share. Last year's results benefited from the 2009 fourth quarter launch of Copenhagen Wintergreen. Given the timing of this launch, first quarter of 2010 represented the first full quarter of shipments for this very successful new product. Second, the 2010 first quarter shipments of two new Copenhagen products, Long Cut Straight and Extra Long Cut Natural and international launch of foreign Marlboro Snus products. And the Skoal slimline promotion in the first quarter of 2010.
USSTC and  PM U.S.A. shipped several new Smokeless Products in the first quarter of 2011, although these staunchest did not benefit this quarter's results, as much as new products and promotions contributed to last year's first quarter results. This year, Marlboro and Skoal each launched two new Snus products and Skoal shipped 8 new Skoal extra products towards the end of the quarter. As a result of the year-over-year changes in new product and promotional activities, reported Smokeless Products shipments decline versus prior year period. However, after adjusting for these factor, USSTC and  PM U.S.A. estimate that there combined Smokeless Products shipment volumes grew slightly below the Smokeless categories growth rate for the quarter. 
Smokeless Products segments retails share decline versus last year as the segment had a challenging comparison due to the new product activity in the year-ago time period as well as Skoal's year-over-year retail share performance. On a sequential basis, however, USSTC and  PM U.S.A. grew their combined retail share of the Smokeless category due to sequential retail share growth for both Copenhagen and Skoal. Copenhagen's retail share increased both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis due to continuing marketplace momentum from its new products and strengthen its core natural business. Copenhagen plans to build on this momentum and help drive future growth by launching Copenhagen Wintergreen pouches nationally in the second quarter of this year.
Skoal grew retail share on a sequential basis as comprehensive brand building initiatives positively impacted its performance. USSTC expects the new Skoal extra products ship toward the end of the quarter will contribute to the brand's future growth. 
Overall, USSTC and  PM U.S.A. delivered solid first quarter Smokeless Products segment results. Copenhagen and Skoal both grew sequential retail share and adjusted shipment volumes and operating companies income grew on a year-over-year basis. USSTC and  PM U.S.A. believe they are well positioned to continue delivering solid results on the smokeless category as the year progresses.
In the Cigars segment, post FET increased marketplace dynamics continue to impact Middleton's reported income results. Middleton is working to resolve these issues but expects that a resolution will take some time and these marketplace dynamics will continue to have an impact on Middleton's income results for the year. In response to these dynamics, Middleton invested in promotional initiatives to defend Black & Mild's marketplace position that benefited Middleton's volume and retail share results for the quarter. Middleton's reported shipments and Black & Mild's retail share both increased versus the comparable year ago period.
Middleton had several brand building activities planned for the balance of the year designed to continue enhancing Black & Mild's performance. These activities include introducing nationally two untipped cigarillo varieties in the second quarter of this year to expand Black & Mild's position in the untapped cigarillo segment, where historically is not completed widely. This is the largest machine made Large Cigar segment, representing over 50% of the category share in 2010. And introducing Black & Mild shorts as competitively priced tipped cigarillo alternatives in a number of high volume geographies. Middleton believes these and other actions plan for the balance of the year should enhance Black & Mild's marketplace position and improve the company's financial results as the year progresses.
In the line segment, Ste. Michelle reported solid business results with strong growth and adjusted operating companies income due in part to Ste. Michelle's focus on improving its mix with higher margin products. First quarter reported line shipments were essentially the same in the prior year period and Ste. Michelle believes that shipments in both time periods were impacted by wholesale inventory movements. Ste. Michelle's retail unit volumes continue to grow, helping position the company for solid business results in the balance of the year.
Overall, we are pleased with our results to the end of the first quarter as our businesses successfully navigated through a challenging environment faced some difficult comparisons. The underlying strength of these businesses in conjunction with solid first quarter results gives us confidence that we can deliver adjusted diluted EPS growth of 6% to 9% for the full year at the range of $2.01 to $2.07, off an adjusted base of $1.90 per share in 2010. Given that first quarter EPS results outperformed our expectations in part due to trade inventory dynamics that will play out as the year progresses, we expect some unevenness and adjusted EPS growth on a quarterly basis with more growth toward the back half of the year.
I will now turn the call over to Howard Willard, Altria's Executive Vice President and CFO, who will discuss Altria's business segment results in more detail."

Good morning. In the Cigarette segment, reported operating companies income increased by 9.5% to $1.3 billion, due primarily to higher list prices and lower restructuring costs, partially offset by lower volume and a higher FDA user fees. When adjusted for restructuring costs, first quarter operating companies income increased by 7.1% to $1.3 billion and adjusted income margins increased by 2.5 percentage points to 39.6%. And as Mike noted, we are particularly pleased with these results since in the first quarter last year, adjusted Cigarette segment operating companies income grew by a strong 6.7%.  Reported Cigarette segment shipments declined by 6.4% but after adjusting for trade inventory changes, declined by an estimated 5%. The trade increase cigarette inventories from the beginning to the end of the first quarter, benefiting reported Cigarette segment volume and income results. PM U.S.A. estimates that the overall cigarette categories adjusted volume declined by approximately 4% in the first quarter, which is in line with historical price elasticity.
PM U.S.A.'s first quarter Cigarette segment retail share declined by 1.2 share points to 49% due to retail share declines of 7/10 of a share point on its portfolio brands and 0.5 a share point on Marlboro. Marlboro's retail share was 42.2% in the first quarter. Marlboro Menthol performed well in the marketplace as its retail share grew by 1/10 of a share point to 6.1%. based in part of the reduction of Marlboro's Skyline menthol in the fourth quarter of 2010.
The Smokeless Products segment reported operating companies income increased by 8.4% to $193 million, due primarily to higher pricing and lower restructuring costs. When adjusted for restructuring and UST acquisition related costs, operating companies income increased by 3.2% to $194 million. Reported Smokeless Products shipments decreased by 1.3% but when adjusted primarily for the timing of new product launches, increased by an estimated 6%. USSTC and  PM U.S.A. estimate that the Smokeless Products category grew 7% in the first quarter.
USSTC and PM U.S.A.'s combined retail share of the Smokeless Products category decreased by 6/10 of a share point versus the comparable year-ago period to 54.7%., but increased by 2/10 of a share point on a sequential basis versus the fourth quarter of 2010 due to share growth for both Copenhagen and Skoal. Copenhagen grew 3/10 of a share point versus the fourth quarter of 2010 to 26% and also grew by 4/10 of a share point on a comparable year-over-year basis. Skoal also grew 3/10 of a share point on a sequential basis to 22% but declined 1.1 share points on a comparable year-over-year basis.
Middleton's reported operating companies income decreased 53.2% to $22 million, primarily due to promotional investments made to protect Black & Mild's marketplace position. Middleton's overall retail share grew by 6/10 of a share point to 29.1%, driven by Black & Mild's retail share performance. Black & Mild grew its retail share by 8/10 of a share point to 28.9%. When adjusted for integration costs, operating companies income decreased by 54.2% to $22 million. Middleton's first quarter shipments grew by 1.9%. Increases in imported machine made large cigars have made trade inventory volumes difficult to determine accurately in the short term. Consequently, Middleton is only providing its reported company shipments.
Ste. Michelle's reported operating companies income increased by 71.4% to $12 million. When adjusted for UST acquisition related and restructuring costs, operating companies income increased by 25% to $15 million. The Wine segment shipment volume was essentially the same as the prior year period but shipments were impacted primarily by wholesale inventory changes. Ste. Michelle believes that in the first quarter of 2011, wholesalers depleted inventory built during the fourth quarter of 2010 while in the year-ago period of wholesalers increased inventories. Ste. Michelle's retail unit volume increased by 2.3% while the wine industry's volume grew 3.2%.
The Financial Services segment reported operating companies income of $21 million was the same as last year. At the end of the quarter, the allowance for losses was unchanged versus the end of last year at $202 million. Altria continue to deliver shareholder value by managing its cost structure. Altria delivered $35 million in cost savings across its family of companies in the first quarter of 2011. We are confident that we can achieve the remaining $110 million in cost savings from our $1.5 billion program by the end of this year. Since 2006, we have delivered nearly $1.4 billion in cost savings.
Altria also delivered value to shareholders by returning cash to them. In the first quarter, the company paid almost $800 million in dividends, reflecting our intention to return 80% of adjusted diluted EPS to shareholders in the form of dividends. Based on our annualized dividend rate of $1.52 per share, our closing stock price of $27.01 on April 15, our yield of 5.6% makes Altria stock stack an attractive investment. Altria intends to complete its previously announced 2011$1 billion share repurchase program by the end of this year, but the timing of any share repurchases depends present marketplace conditions and other factors and remains subject to discussion of our board.
Mike and I will now be happy to take your questions. While the calls are compiled, let me cover a few housekeeping items.
Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest effective price cigarette was 35% in the first quarter. Marlboro's net pack price in the quarter was $5.70 while the lowest effective price cigarette was $4.21. The cigarette discount categories first quarter retail share was 27.6%. The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise taxes at the end of the first quarter was $1.36 per pack. There were no cigarette excise tax increases in the first quarter.
Copenhagen's first quarter net retail price was $4.17 and its price gap versus the leading discount brand was approximately 40% in the quarter. As of March 31, 2011, 20 states in the District of Columbia use a weight based Smokeless Tobacco excise tax system, representing approximately 32% of the Smokeless Tobacco categories volume. CapEx was $13 million in the first quarter and depreciation and amortization was $60 million. And on April 15,  PM U.S.A. made its annual 2010 MSA payment of approximately $3.5 billion. The amount includes approximately $267 million at PM U.S.A. disputes those as a result of the 2008 nonparticipating manufacture adjustment.

If you think about just the core Marlboro franchise so when you excise some of these new products, can you tell us how much retail share of the core Marlboro franchise is up or down? And as some sum of these new product launches got into retail this year, can you tell us how the share is performing for Marlboro?"

You go back 2010 Marlboro share grew for the year about $0.08 on a port it's been its average growth rate over the past few years and that was substantially more than was necessary to offset the growth of our other premium brand share loss which is something we'd like to cover with Marlboro. That means that the rest of that share was largely guarded from promotions and consumers discount consumers as I talked before shop and every brand even though Barbara has a very high loyalty factor relative to other consumer products, every brand has some percentage of its business that's price sensitive. So we have some share points that are like that. If you look at the first quarter of the year, actually the first half, what you see is that we have major product launch, a very successful behind Marlboro Special Blend. So while most of that share is sustainable share, some of it due to promotion activity when you launched new product comes from these more promotion sensitive or discounts shoppers, and that activity was replicated in the first quarter of this year. If you look at total year last year during the period that we had that lunch activity, we saw very strong share, actually, a record share in the second quarter from Marlboro. And then we saw as a lunch activity abated, we also saw some of that what I call, temporary share slip away. And so as we lap that quarter, the first quarter this year, we didn't have the same kind of activity. We expected to see some loss in the share. And during the same time this year in the first quarter, you had some other products that had a high level of activity that was price related. Newport menthol, Camel continued low price activity on Pall Mall can cause some of this promotion sensitive discount versus shift around. So I think more indicative of the Marlboro business right now is its comparison March to December. We showed some nice share growth during that time even without extraordinary support that we had in the year ago time frame. We think Marlboro is actually in pretty good shape and we're going to face a tough comparison in the second quarter and move into the back half of the year, the comparisons would be more fair of favorable, and we tend to look at the trends performance on a long-term basis rather than a quarter-to-quarter basis we're going to have to have. So I think it's doing fine. We don't break out the various pieces but the franchise continues to show good strength."

296308,129544394,115949,"Altria Group Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2011",2011-04-20,"Earnings Calls","Altria Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Cliff, and good morning to everyone. Altria delivered strong financial results in the first quarter with adjusted diluted EPS growth of 4.8% as our businesses navigated through high unemployment, low consumer confidence and a competitive busine",1425,"Thank you, Cliff, and good morning to everyone. Altria delivered strong financial results in the first quarter with adjusted diluted EPS growth of 4.8% as our businesses navigated through high unemployment, low consumer confidence and a competitive business environment. 
As we anticipated, adjusted EPS growth comparisons for the first quarter were challenging but our results exceeded our initial expectations and give us confidence in our ability to achieve adjusted diluted EPS growth within our forecasted range for the year. In the Cigarette segment, PM U.S.A reported strong adjusted operating companies income growth with margin expansion. 
We are particularly pleased with these financial results since and the comparable year ago period, the Cigarette segments adjusted operating companies income growth was also quite strong. Timing of new product launches and trade inventory changes impacted year-over-year comparisons for retail share volume and income in the Cigarette segment. New product launches this year and in the first quarter last year had a significant impact on both PM U.S.A.'s and Marlboro's retail share comparisons. 
PM U.S.A. shipped to Marlboro Special Blend SKUs in the beginning of the first quarter last year. The success of this launch significantly benefited Marlboro's retail share results in all of the first quarter of 2010, creating a challenging retail share comparison. Two additional Marlboro Special Blend SKUs were shipped toward the end of the first quarter this year with minimal impact on the quarter's retail share results.
Trade inventory changes also impacted quarterly year-over-year Cigarette segment shipment and income comparisons.  PM U.S.A. believes trade build inventory from the beginning to the end of both comparable time periods but the trade build less inventory this year than in 2010. Trade inventory build in the first quarter could negatively impact volume and income results for the Cigarette segment if depleted in the future.
PM U.S.A.'s reported cigarette shipments declined versus the comparable year ago period and after adjusting for trade inventory changes, were estimated to be down slightly more than the Cigarette category. PM U.S.A.'s adjustment cigarette shipments declined more than the category due to a decline in the  retail share. This retail share decline occurred primarily due to the timing of the Marlboro new product launches I've mentioned and retail share losses on some of PM U.S.A.'s other brands, primarily discount as  PM U.S.A. optimizes the long-term income of its portfolio brands. 
PM U.S.A. is pleased with Marlboro's first quarter performance. The brand gained retail share as the quarter progressed, showing increased momentum and turned in an excellent profit performance. Although  PM U.S.A. faces a particularly challenging second quarter retail share comparison as Marlboro had a record retail share result in the second quarter of 2010, we expect quarterly retail share comparisons to improve significantly in the second half of the year both overall and for Marlboro.
Overall,  PM U.S.A. delivered solid Cigarette segment business results in the quarter. Although competition remained intense and comparisons were tough, operating companies income continue to grow, operating companies margins continue to expand and Marlboro is well positioned for the balance of the year.
In the Smokeless Products segment, USSTC and  PM U.S.A. reported solid business results in the competitive environment. We are particularly pleased with the Smokeless Products segments operating companies income result as it had a challenging comparison to the first quarter of 2010. As in the Cigarette segment, there were a number of factors in the Smokeless Products segment impacting year-over-year comparisons for income, volume and retail share. 
Last year's results benefited from the 2009 fourth quarter launch of Copenhagen Wintergreen. Given the timing of this launch, first quarter of 2010 represented the first full quarter of shipments for this very successful new product. Second, the 2010 first quarter shipments of two new Copenhagen products, Long Cut Straight and Extra Long Cut Natural and the national launch of four Marlboro Snus products, and the Skoal Slim line can pouch promotion in the first quarter 2010.
USSTC and  PM U.S.A. shipped several new Smokeless Products in the first quarter of 2011, although these launches did not benefit this quarter's results, as much as new products and promotions contributed to last year's first quarter results. This year, Marlboro and Skoal each launched two new Snus products and Skoal shipped 8 new Skoal Xtra products towards the end of the quarter. 
As a result of the year-over-year changes in new product and promotional activities, reported Smokeless Products shipments declined versus prior year period. However, after adjusting for these factor, USSTC and  PM U.S.A. estimate that their combined Smokeless Products shipment volumes grew slightly below the Smokeless categories growth rate for the quarter. 
Smokeless Products segments retails share declined versus last year as the segment had a challenging comparison due to the new product activity in the year-ago time period as well as Skoal's year-over-year retail share performance. On a sequential basis, however, USSTC and  PM U.S.A. grew their combined retail share of the Smokeless category due to a sequential retail share growth for both Copenhagen and Skoal. 
Copenhagen's retail share increased both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis due to continuing marketplace momentum from its new products and strengthened its core natural business. Copenhagen plans to build on this momentum and help drive future growth by launching Copenhagen Wintergreen pouches nationally in the second quarter of this year.
Skoal grew retail share on a sequential basis as comprehensive brand building initiatives positively impacted its performance. USSTC expects the new Skoal extra products shipped toward the end of the quarter will contribute to the brand's future growth. 
Overall, USSTC and  PM U.S.A. delivered solid first quarter Smokeless Products segment results. Copenhagen and Skoal both grew sequential retail share and adjusted shipment volumes and operating companies income grew on a year-over-year basis. USSTC and  PM U.S.A. believe they are well positioned to continue delivering solid results on the Smokeless category as the year progresses.
In the Cigars segment, post FET increased marketplace dynamics continue to impact Middleton's reported income results. Middleton is working to resolve these issues but expects that a resolution will take some time and that these marketplace dynamics will continue to have an impact on Middleton's income results for the year. In response to these dynamics, Middleton invested in promotional initiatives to defend Black & Mild's marketplace position that benefited Middleton's volume and retail share results for the quarter. Middleton's reported shipments and Black & Mild's retail share both increased versus the comparable year ago period.
Middleton had several brand building activities planned for the balance of the year designed to continue enhancing Black & Mild's performance. These activities include: Introducing nationally two untipped cigarillo varieties in the second quarter of this year to expand Black & Mild's position in the Untipped Cigarillo segment, where historically has not completed widely, this is the largest machine-made Large Cigar segment, representing over 50% of the category share in 2010; and introducing Black & Mild shorts as competitively priced tipped cigarillo alternatives in a number of high volume geographies. Middleton believes these and other actions plan for the balance of the year should enhance Black & Mild's marketplace position and improve the company's financial results as the year progresses.
In the line segment, Ste. Michelle reported solid business results with strong growth and adjusted operating companies income due in part to Ste. Michelle's focus on improving its mix with higher margin products. First quarter reported line shipments were essentially the same as the prior year period and Ste. Michelle believes that shipments in both time periods were impacted by wholesale inventory movements. Ste. Michelle's retail unit volumes continue to grow, helping position the company for solid business results in the balance of the year.
Overall, we are pleased with our results to the end of the first quarter as our businesses successfully navigated through a challenging environment faced some difficult comparisons. The underlying strengths of these businesses, in conjunction with solid first quarter results, gives us confidence that we can deliver adjusted diluted EPS growth of 6% to 9% for the full year at a range of $2.01 to $2.07, off an adjusted base of $1.90 per share in 2010. Given that first quarter EPS results outperformed our expectations, in part due to trade inventory dynamics that will play out as the year progresses, we expect some unevenness and adjusted EPS growth on a quarterly basis with more growth toward the back half of the year.
I will now turn the call over to Howard Willard, Altria's Executive Vice President and CFO, who will discuss Altria's business segment results in more detail."

In the Cigarette segment, reported operating companies income increased by 9.5% to $1.3 billion, due primarily to higher list prices and lower restructuring costs, partially offset by lower volume and a higher FDA user fees.",1044,"Thank you, Mike. Good morning. In the Cigarette segment, reported operating companies income increased by 9.5% to $1.3 billion, due primarily to higher list prices and lower restructuring costs, partially offset by lower volume and a higher FDA user fees. When adjusted for restructuring costs, first quarter operating companies income increased by 7.1% to $1.3 billion and adjusted income margins increased by 2.5 percentage points to 39.6%. 
As Mike noted, we are particularly pleased with these results since in the first quarter last year, adjusted Cigarette segment operating companies income grew by a strong 6.7%.  Reported Cigarette segment shipments declined by 6.4% but after adjusting for trade inventory changes, declined by an estimated 5%. The trade increase cigarette inventories from the beginning to the end of the first quarter, benefiting reported Cigarette segment volume and income results. PM U.S.A. estimates that the overall cigarette categories adjusted volume declined by approximately 4% in the first quarter, which is in line with historical price elasticity.
PM U.S.A.'s first quarter Cigarette segment retail share declined by 1.2 share points to 49% due to retail share declines of 7/10 of a share point on its portfolio brands and 0.5 a share point on Marlboro. Marlboro's retail share was 42.2% in the first quarter. Marlboro Menthol performed well in the marketplace as its retail share grew by 1/10 of a share point to 6.1%. based in part on the introduction of Marlboro's Skyline Menthol in the fourth quarter of 2010.
The Smokeless Products segment's reported operating companies income increased by 8.4% to $193 million, due primarily to higher pricing and lower restructuring costs. When adjusted for restructuring and UST acquisition related costs, operating companies income increased by 3.2% to $194 million. Reported Smokeless Products shipments decreased by 1.3% but when adjusted primarily for the timing of new product launches, increased by an estimated 6%. USSTC and  PM U.S.A. estimate that the Smokeless Products category grew 7% in the first quarter.
USSTC and PM U.S.A.'s combined retail share of the Smokeless Products category decreased by 0.6 of a share point versus the comparable year ago period to 54.7%., but increased by 0.2 share point on a sequential basis versus the fourth quarter of 2010 due to share growth for both Copenhagen and Skoal. Copenhagen grew 0.3 share point versus the fourth quarter of 2010 to 26% and also grew by 0.4 share point on a comparable year-over-year basis. Skoal also grew 0.3 share point on a sequential basis to 22% but declined 1.1 share points on a comparable year-over-year basis.
Middleton's reported operating companies income decreased 53.2% to $22 million, primarily due to promotional investments made to protect Black & Mild's marketplace position. Middleton's overall retail share grew by 0.6 share point to 29.1%, driven by Black & Mild's retail share performance. Black & Mild grew its retail share by 0.8 share point to 28.9%. When adjusted for integration costs, operating companies income decreased by 54.2% to $22 million. Middleton's first quarter shipments grew by 1.9%. Increases in imported machine-made large cigars have made trade inventory volumes difficult to determine accurately in the short term. Consequently, Middleton is only providing its reported company shipments.
Ste. Michelle's reported operating companies income increased by 71.4% to $12 million. When adjusted for UST acquisition related and restructuring costs, operating companies income increased by 25% to $15 million. The Wine segment shipment volume was essentially the same as the prior year period but shipments were impacted primarily by wholesale inventory changes. Ste. Michelle believes that in the first quarter of 2011, wholesalers depleted inventory built during the fourth quarter of 2010 while in the year-ago period, wholesalers increased inventories. Ste. Michelle's retail unit volume increased by 2.3% while the wine industry's volume grew 3.2%.
The Financial Services segment's reported operating companies income of $21 million was the same as last year. At the end of the quarter, the allowance for losses was unchanged versus the end of last year at $202 million. Altria continue to deliver shareholder value by managing its cost structure. Altria delivered $35 million in cost savings across its family of companies in the first quarter of 2011. We are confident that we can achieve the remaining $110 million in cost savings from our $1.5 billion program by the end of this year. Since 2006, we have delivered nearly $1.4 billion in cost savings.
Altria also delivered value to shareholders by returning cash to them. In the first quarter, the company paid almost $800 million in dividends, reflecting our intention to return 80% of adjusted diluted EPS to shareholders in the form of dividends. Based on our annualized dividend rate of $1.52 per share, our closing stock price of $27.01 on April 15, our yield of 5.6% makes Altria stock an attractive investment. 
Altria intends to complete its previously announced 2011 $1 billion share repurchase program by the end of this year, but the timing of any share repurchases depends present marketplace conditions and other factors and remains subject to the discretion of our board.
Mike and I will now be happy to take your questions. While the calls are compiled, let me cover a few housekeeping items.
Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest effective price cigarette was 35% in the first quarter. Marlboro's net pack price in the quarter was $5.70 while the lowest effective price cigarette was $4.21. The cigarette discount categories first quarter retail share was 27.6%. The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise taxes at the end of the first quarter was $1.36 per pack. There were no cigarette excise tax increases in the first quarter.
Copenhagen's first quarter net retail price was $4.17 and its price gap versus the leading discount brand was approximately 40% in the quarter. As of March 31, 2011, 20 states in the District of Columbia use a weight based Smokeless Tobacco excise tax system, representing approximately 32% of the Smokeless Tobacco categories volume. CapEx was $13 million in the first quarter and depreciation and amortization was $60 million. And on April 15,  PM U.S.A. made its annual 2010 MSA payment of approximately $3.5 billion. The amount includes approximately $267 million that PM U.S.A. disputes it owes  as a result of the 2008 non-participating manufacturer adjustment.

If you think about just the core Marlboro franchise so when you excise some of these new products, can you tell us how much retail share of the core Marlboro franchise is up or down? And then as some of these new product launches got into the retail this year, can you tell us how the share is performing for Marlboro?"
296308,129544394,115949,"Altria Group Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2011",2011-04-20,"Earnings Calls","Altria Group, Inc.","Executives","Well, let me talk about the Marlboro share just a little bit because I often remind investors that quarter-to-quarter comparisons due to the amount of activity either we have in the marketplace or competitors have in the marketplace cannot be indicative o",507,"Well, let me talk about the Marlboro share just a little bit because I often remind investors that quarter-to-quarter comparisons due to the amount of activity either we have in the marketplace or competitors have in the marketplace cannot be indicative of underlying trends in the business, and I think the first quarter of 2011 is case in point. You go back 2010 Marlboro share grew for the year about 0.8 well ahead of what had been its average growth rate over the past few years and that was substantially more than was necessary to offset the growth of our other premium brand share loss, which is something we'd like to cover with Marlboro. That means that the rest of that share was largely guarded from promotions and consumers discount, consumers, who as I talked before shop in every brand even though Marlboro has a very high loyalty factor relative to other consumer products, every brand has some percentage of its business that's price sensitive. So we have some share points that are like that. If you look at the first quarter of the year, actually the first half, what you see is that we have major product launch, a very successful behind Marlboro Special Blend. So while most of that share is sustainable share, some of it due to promotion activity when you launch new product comes from these more promotion sensitive or discount shoppers, and that activity was replicated in the first quarter of this year. If you look at the total year last year during the period that we had that launch activity, we saw very strong share, actually, a record share in the second quarter from Marlboro. And then we saw as the launch activity abated, we also saw some of that what I'll call, temporary share slip away. And so as we lap that quarter, the first quarter this year, we didn't have the same kind of activity. We expected to see some loss in the share. And during the same time this year in the first quarter, you had some other products that had a high level of activity that was price related. Newport Menthol, Camel continued low price activity, and Pall Mall that can cause some of this more promotion sensitive or discount business to shift around. So I think more indicative of the Marlboro business right now is its comparison March to December. We showed some nice share growth during that period of time even without extraordinary support that we had in the year ago time frame. So we think Marlboro is actually in pretty good shape and we're going to face a tough comparison in the second quarter but as we move into the back half of the year, the comparisons would be more favorable, and we tend to look at the brands' performance on a longer-term basis rather than a quarter-to-quarter basis or even a half-to-half. So I think it's doing fine. We don't break out the various pieces but the franchise continues to show good strength."

Marlboro has, for a while, had a program available to retailers that wanted to use Marlboro as a means to draw traffic in their stores, so this is really a redesign of that program because all programs kind of become less relevant over time and their structure as marketplace conditions change and that's the case with this one and we will look at these programs periodically and update them. So we update this program effective April 1, it's designed to be cost neutral all program, and beyond that the response rate around about a program that's designed for every retailer necessarily based on their strategy more with once in the past but response rate to this program has been, I think, very positive by many retailers. And some retailers won't choose to do it. That's what we expect. We'll see what the impact is in the marketplace but we expect to see some positive impact from the brands' performance as we have in the past with programs like one when some of our customers get behind."

Altria delivered strong financial results in the first quarter with adjusted diluted EPS growth of 4.8% as our businesses navigated through high unemployment, low consumer confidence and a competitive busine",1429,"Thank you, Cliff, and good morning to everyone. Altria delivered strong financial results in the first quarter with adjusted diluted EPS growth of 4.8% as our businesses navigated through high unemployment, low consumer confidence and a competitive business environment. 
As we anticipated, adjusted EPS growth comparisons for the first quarter were challenging but our results exceeded our initial expectations and give us confidence in our ability to achieve adjusted diluted EPS growth within our forecasted range for the year. In the Cigarette segment, PM U.S.A reported strong adjusted operating companies income growth with margin expansion. 
We are particularly pleased with these financial results since in the comparable year ago period, the Cigarette segments adjusted operating companies income growth was also quite strong. Timing of new product launches and trade inventory changes impacted year-over-year comparisons for retail share volume and income in the Cigarette segment. New product launches this year and in the first quarter of last year had a significant impact on both PM U.S.A.'s and Marlboro's retail share comparisons. 
PM U.S.A. shipped 2 Marlboro Special Blend SKUs in the beginning of the first quarter last year. The success of this launch significantly benefited Marlboro's retail share results in all of the first quarter of 2010, creating a challenging retail share comparison. 2 additional Marlboro Special Blend SKUs were shipped toward the end of the first quarter this year with minimal impact on the quarter's retail share results.
Trade inventory changes also impacted quarterly year-over-year Cigarette segment shipment and income comparisons.  PM U.S.A. believes the trade build inventory from the beginning to the end of both comparable time periods but the trade built less inventory this year than in 2010. Trade inventory build in the first quarter could negatively impact volume and income results for the Cigarette segment if depleted in the future.
PM U.S.A.'s reported cigarette shipments declined versus the comparable year ago period and after adjusting for trade inventory changes, were estimated to be down slightly more than the Cigarette category. PM U.S.A.'s adjustment cigarette shipments declined more than the category due to a decline in the retail share. This retail share decline occurred primarily due to the timing of the Marlboro new product launches I mentioned and retail share losses on some of PM U.S.A.'s other brands, primarily discount as  PM U.S.A. optimizes the long-term income of its portfolio brands. 
PM U.S.A. is pleased with Marlboro's first quarter performance. The brand gained retail share as the quarter progressed, showing increased momentum and turned in an excellent profit performance. Although PM U.S.A. faces a particularly challenging second quarter retail share comparison as Marlboro had a record retail share result in the second quarter of 2010, we expect quarterly retail share comparisons to improve significantly in the second half of the year both overall and for Marlboro.
Overall, PM U.S.A. delivered solid Cigarette segment business results in the quarter. Although competition remained intense and comparisons were tough, operating companies income continued to grow, operating companies margins continue to expand and Marlboro is well positioned for the balance of the year.
In the Smokeless Products segment, USSTC and PM U.S.A. reported solid business results in a competitive environment. We are particularly pleased with the Smokeless Products segments operating companies income result as it had a challenging comparison to the first quarter of 2010. As in the Cigarette segment, there were a number of factors in the Smokeless Products segment impacting year-over-year comparisons for income, volume and retail share. 
Last year's results benefited from the 2009 fourth quarter launch of Copenhagen Wintergreen. Given the timing of this launch, first quarter of 2010 represented the first full quarter of shipments for this very successful new product. Second, the 2010 first quarter shipments of two new Copenhagen products, Long Cut Straight and Extra Long Cut Natural and the national launch of four Marlboro Snus products, and the Skoal Slim line can pouch promotion in the first quarter 2010.
USSTC and PM U.S.A. shipped several new Smokeless Products in the first quarter of 2011, although these launches did not benefit this quarter's results, as much as new products and promotions contributed to last year's first quarter results. This year, Marlboro and Skoal each launched two new Snus products and Skoal shipped 8 new Skoal xtra products towards the end of the quarter. 
As a result of the year-over-year changes in new product and promotional activities, reported Smokeless Products shipments declined versus prior year period. However, after adjusting for these factor, USSTC and PM U.S.A. estimate that their combined Smokeless Products shipment volumes grew slightly below the Smokeless categories growth rate for the quarter. 
The Smokeless Products segments retails share declined versus last year as the segment had a challenging comparison due to the new product activity in the year-ago time period as well as Skoal's year-over-year retail share performance. On a sequential basis, however, USSTC and PM U.S.A. grew their combined retail share of the Smokeless category due to a sequential retail share growth for both Copenhagen and Skoal. 
Copenhagen's retail share increased both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis due to continuing marketplace momentum from its new products and strengthened its core natural business. Copenhagen plans to build on this momentum and help drive future growth by launching Copenhagen Wintergreen pouches nationally in the second quarter of this year.
Skoal grew retail share on a sequential basis as comprehensive brand building initiatives positively impacted its performance. USSTC expects the new Skoal xtra products shipped toward the end of the quarter will contribute to the brand's future growth. 
Overall, USSTC and PM U.S.A. delivered solid first quarter Smokeless Products segment results. Copenhagen and Skoal both grew sequential retail share and adjusted shipment volumes and operating companies income grew on a year-over-year basis. USSTC and PM U.S.A. believe they are well positioned to continue delivering solid results in the Smokeless category as the year progresses.
In the Cigars segment, post FET increase, marketplace dynamics continue to impact Middleton's reported income results. Middleton is working to resolve these issues but expects that a resolution will take some time and that these marketplace dynamics will continue to have an impact on Middleton's income results for the year. In response to these dynamics, Middleton invested in promotional initiatives to defend Black & Mild's marketplace position that benefited Middleton's volume and retail share results for the quarter. Middleton's reported shipments and Black & Mild's retail share both increased versus the comparable year ago period.
Middleton had several brand building activities planned for the balance of the year designed to continue enhancing Black & Mild's performance. These activities include: introducing nationally two untipped cigarillo varieties in the second quarter of this year to expand Black & Mild's position in the Untipped Cigarillo segment, where it, historically, has not completed widely. This is the largest machine-made Large Cigar segment, representing over 50% of the category share in 2010; and introducing Black & Mild shorts as competitively priced tipped cigarillo alternatives in a number of high volume geographies. Middleton believes these and other actions planned for the balance of the year should enhance Black & Mild's marketplace position and improve the company's financial results as the year progresses.
In the line segment, Ste. Michelle reported solid business results with strong growth and adjusted operating companies income due in part to Ste. Michelle's focus on improving its mix with higher margin products. First quarter reported line shipments were essentially the same as the prior year period and Ste. Michelle believes that shipments in both time periods were impacted by wholesale inventory movements. Ste. Michelle's retail unit volumes continue to grow, helping position the company for solid business results in the balance of the year.
Overall, we are pleased with our results through the end of the first quarter, as our businesses successfully navigated through a challenging environment, faced some difficult comparisons. The underlying strengths of these businesses, in conjunction with solid first quarter results, gives us confidence that we can deliver adjusted diluted EPS growth of 6% to 9% for the full year at a range of $2.01 to $2.07, off an adjusted base of $1.90 per share in 2010. Given that first quarter EPS results outperformed our expectations, in part due to trade inventory dynamics that will play out as the year progresses, we expect some unevenness and adjusted EPS growth on a quarterly basis with more growth toward the back half of the year.
I will now turn the call over to Howard Willard, Altria's Executive Vice President and CFO, who will discuss Altria's business segment results in more detail."

W",1054,"Thank you, Mike. Good morning. In the Cigarette segment, reported operating companies income increased by 9.5% to $1.3 billion, due primarily to higher list prices and lower restructuring costs, partially offset by lower volume and higher FDA user fees. When adjusted for restructuring costs, first quarter operating companies income increased by 7.1% to $1.3 billion and adjusted income margins increased by 2.5 percentage points to 39.6%. 
As Mike noted, we are particularly pleased with these results since in the first quarter last year, adjusted Cigarette segment operating companies income grew by a strong 6.7%.  Reported Cigarette segment shipments declined by 6.4% but after adjusting for trade inventory changes, declined by an estimated 5%. The trade increase cigarette inventories from the beginning to the end of the first quarter, benefiting reported Cigarette segment volume and income results. PM U.S.A. estimates that the overall cigarette categories adjusted volume declined by approximately 4% in the first quarter, which is in line with historical price elasticity.
PM U.S.A.'s first quarter Cigarette segment retail share declined by 1.2 share points to 49% due to retail share declines of 0.7 of a share point on its portfolio brands and 0.5 a share point on Marlboro. Marlboro's retail share was 42.2% in the first quarter. Marlboro Menthol performed well in the marketplace as its retail share grew by 0.1 of a share point to 6.1%. based in part on the introduction of Marlboro's Skyline Menthol in the fourth quarter of 2010.
The Smokeless Products segment's reported operating companies income increased by 8.4% to $193 million, due primarily to higher pricing and lower restructuring costs. When adjusted for restructuring and UST acquisition related costs, operating companies income increased by 3.2% to $194 million. Reported Smokeless Products shipments decreased by 1.3% but when adjusted primarily for the timing of new product launches, increased by an estimated 6%. USSTC and PM U.S.A. estimate that the Smokeless Products category grew 7% in the first quarter.
USSTC and PM U.S.A.'s combined retail share of the Smokeless Products category decreased by 0.6 of a share point versus the comparable year ago period to 54.7%., but increased by 0.2 of a share point on a sequential basis versus the fourth quarter of 2010 due to share growth for both Copenhagen and Skoal. Copenhagen grew 0.3 of a share point versus the fourth quarter of 2010 to 26% and also grew by 0.4 of a share point on a comparable year-over-year basis. Skoal also grew 0.3 of a share point on a sequential basis to 22% but declined 1.1 share points on a comparable year-over-year basis.
Middleton's reported operating companies income decreased 53.2% to $22 million, primarily due to promotional investments made to protect Black & Mild's marketplace position. Middleton's overall retail share grew by 0.6 of a share point to 29.1%, driven by Black & Mild's retail share performance. Black & Mild grew its retail share by 0.8 of a share point to 28.9%. When adjusted for integration costs, operating companies income decreased by 54.2% to $22 million. Middleton's first quarter shipments grew by 1.9%. Increases in imported machine-made large cigars have made trade inventory volumes difficult to determine accurately in the short term. Consequently, Middleton is only providing its reported company shipments.
Ste. Michelle's reported operating companies income increased by 71.4% to $12 million. When adjusted for UST acquisition related and restructuring costs, operating companies income increased by 25% to $15 million. The Wine segment shipment volume was essentially the same as the prior year period but shipments were impacted primarily by wholesale inventory changes. Ste. Michelle believes that in the first quarter of 2011, wholesalers depleted inventory billed during the fourth quarter of 2010 while in the year-ago period, wholesalers increased inventories. Ste. Michelle's retail unit volume increased by 2.3% while the wine industry's volume grew 3.2%.
The Financial Services segment's reported operating companies income of $21 million was the same as last year. At the end of the quarter, the allowance for losses was unchanged versus the end of last year at $202 million. Altria continued to deliver shareholder value by managing its cost structure. Altria delivered $35 million in cost savings across its family of companies in the first quarter of 2011. We are confident that we can achieve the remaining $110 million in cost savings from our $1.5 billion program by the end of this year. Since 2006, we have delivered nearly $1.4 billion in cost savings.
Altria also delivered value to shareholders by returning cash to them. In the first quarter, the company paid almost $800 million in dividends, reflecting our intention to return 80% of adjusted diluted EPS to shareholders in the form of dividends. Based on our annualized dividend rate of $1.52 per share, our closing stock price of $27.01 on April 15, our yield of 5.6% makes Altria stock an attractive investment. 
Altria intends to complete its previously announced 2011 $1 billion share repurchase program by the end of this year, but the timing of any share repurchases depends present marketplace conditions and other factors and remains subject to the discretion of our board.
Mike and I will now be happy to take your questions. While the calls are compiled, let me cover a few housekeeping items.
Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest effective price cigarette was 35% in the first quarter. Marlboro's net pack price in the quarter was $5.70 while the lowest effective price cigarette was $4.21. The cigarette discount categories first quarter retail share was 27.6%. The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax, at the end of the first quarter, was $1.36 per pack. There were no cigarette excise tax increases in the first quarter.
Copenhagen's first quarter net retail price was $4.17 and its price gap versus the leading discount brand was approximately 40% in the quarter. As of March 31, 2011, 20 states and the District of Columbia use a weight-based Smokeless Tobacco excise tax system, representing approximately 32% of the Smokeless Tobacco categories volume. CapEx was $13 million in the first quarter and depreciation and amortization was $60 million. And on April 15, PM U.S.A. made its annual 2010 MSA payment of approximately $3.5 billion. The amount includes approximately $267 million that PM U.S.A. disputes it owes, as a result of the 2008 non-participating manufacturer adjustment.

If you think about just the core Marlboro franchise so when you exiled some of these new products, can you tell us how much retail share of the core Marlboro franchise is up or down? And then as some of these new product launches got into the retail this year, can you tell us how the share is performing for Marlboro?"
296308,129544394,116073,"Altria Group Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2011",2011-04-20,"Earnings Calls","Altria Group, Inc.","Executives","Well, let me talk about the Marlboro share just a little bit because I often remind investors that quarter-to-quarter comparisons due to the amount of activity either we have in the marketplace or competitors have in the marketplace cannot be indicative o",509,"Well, let me talk about the Marlboro share just a little bit because I often remind investors that quarter-to-quarter comparisons due to the amount of activity either we have in the marketplace or competitors have in the marketplace cannot be indicative of underlying trends in the business, and I think the first quarter of 2011 is a case in point. If you go back 2010, the Marlboro share grew for the year about 0.8, well ahead of what had been its average growth rate over the past few years and that was substantially more than was necessary to offset the growth of our other premium brand share loss, which is something we like to cover with Marlboro. That means that the rest of that share was largely guarded from promotion-sensitive consumers and discount consumers, who, as I talked before, shop in every brand even though Marlboro has a very high loyalty factor relative to other consumer products, every brand has some percentage of its business that's price sensitive. So we have some share points that are like that. If you look at the first quarter of the year, actually the first half, what you'll see is that we have major product launch, a very successful behind Marlboro Special Blend. So while most of that share is sustainable share, some of it, due to promotion activity when you launch new product, comes from these more promotion sensitive or discount shoppers, and that activity wasn't replicated in the first quarter of this year. If you look at the total year last year during the period that we had that launch activity, we saw very strong share, actually, a record share in the second quarter for Marlboro. And then we saw, as the launch activity abated, we also saw some of that, what I'll call, temporary share slip away. And so as we lap that quarter, the first quarter this year, we didn't have the same kind of activity. We expected to see some loss in the share. And during the same time this year in the first quarter, you had some other products that had a high level of activity that was price related. Newport Non-Menthol, Camel continued low price activity, and Pall Mall that can cause some of this more promotion-sensitive or discount business to shift around. So I think more indicative of the Marlboro business right now is its comparison March to December. We showed some nice share growth during that period of time even without extraordinary support that we had in the year ago time frame. So we think Marlboro is actually in pretty good shape and we're going to face a tough comparison in the second quarter but as we move into the back half of the year, the comparisons will be more favorable, and we tend to look at the brands' performance on a longer-term basis rather than a quarter-to-quarter basis or even a half-to-half. So I think it's doing fine. We don't break out the various pieces but the franchise continues to show good strength."

Marlboro has, for a while, had a program available to retailers that wanted to use Marlboro as a means to draw traffic in to their stores, so this is really a redesign of that program because all programs kind of become less relevant over time and their structure as marketplace conditions change and that's the case with this one and we will look at these programs periodically and update them. So we update this program effective April 1, it's designed to be cost neutral with the old program, and beyond that the older response rate about a program is designed for every retailer necessarily based on their strategy more with ones in the past but the response rate to this program has been, I think, very positive by many retailers. And some retailers won't choose to do it. That's what we expect. We'll see what the impact is in the marketplace but we expect to see some positive impact from the brands' performance as we have in the past with programs like this one when some of our customers get behind it."

Altria's delivered solid financial results from the second quarter and the first half with adjusted diluted EPS growth of 6% and 5.4%, respectively. Our premium tobacco brands performed well in a highly competitive environment marked by continuing economic pressure on adult consumers. We are pleased with our business results and remain on track to achieve the 2011 full year adjusted diluted EPS we forecast in our guidance. In the Cigarette segment, PM U.S.A. reported solid adjusted operating companies income growth and margin strength for both the second quarter and first half as Marlboro grew its retail share sequentially and PM U.S.A.'s premium mix continued to improve versus the prior year.  PM U.S.A. grew its adjusted operating companies income 2.8% for the second quarter and 4.8% for the first half. Adjusted operating companies income margins which include the impact of a $36 million charge for the Scott case were down 0.03 of a percentage point in the second quarter and were up 1 percentage point for the first half. 
In the cigarette industry environment where premium share has remained relatively stable in recent years, Marlboro's retail share increased sequentially and performed well when compared to last year's record share in the second quarter. Marlboro's second quarter retail share grew by 0.04 of a share point was the first quarter of 2011 to 42.6%. This represented a share decline of 0.02 of a share point compared to last year's record retail share. Marlboro's performance was driven in part by growth in Marlboro Menthol and the continued success of Special Blend which launched 2 new packings last quarter. 
We are pleased with Marlboro's performance for the first half of 2011 from both a share and profitability standpoint.
P.m. U.S.A. second quarter cigarette shipment volume benefit from trade movement is the can trade continued to build inventory levels through the quarter. We believe that the trade is already begun to deplete some of that inventory in July and expect trade inventory depletion to impact shipment volume in the third quarter. PM U.S.A. reported cigarette shipments in the quarter declined versus the comparable year ago period and after adjusting for trade inventory changes are estimated to be down 4.5% compared to the total cigarette categories estimates a decline rate of 3.5%. Shipments of premium products represented 94.3% of PM U.S.A.' total shipments, an increase of 1 percentage point from last year. PM U.S.A.'s results were delivered in an intense competitive environment marked by high unemployment and low consumer confidence. Despite these challenges, PM U.S.A. improved its premium mix, delivered strong adjusted operating income margins and achieved solid share results from Marlboro. 
In the Smokeless Products segment, our company's delivered excellent adjusted operating companies income growth driven by the share performance of Copenhagen and Skoal and strong margin growth. Adjusted operating companies income for the Smokeless Products increased 10.9% for the second quarter and 7.2% for the first half. Adjusted operating companies income margins increased 3.8 percentage points for the second quarter and 3 percentage points for the first half primarily due to higher pricing, the shift of volume and the more profitable Copenhagen and Skoal's brands and lower SG&A costs. Copenhagen's momentum continued the second quarter as the brand increased its retail share prior year and 0.7 of a share point sequentially. Copenhagen share results continue to benefit from recent product introductions as well as strength in its core natural business. 
Skoal has responded to brand building initiatives. The brand gained sequential retail sale for the second consecutive quarter as it benefited from the 2011 first quarter introduction of Skoal X-tra products and Skoal's Snus. Gains from these new products fully offset retail share losses which resulted from USSTC portfolio rationalization that delisted 7 Skoal SKUs that individually had limited distribution. 
Combined shipment volumes for Copenhagen and Skoal increased 2.4% in the second quarter and 3.2% for the first half. USSTC and PM U.S.A.'s combined shipment volume for the first half decreased due to trade inventory changes and a negative comparison on their portfolio brands including Marlboro's Snus partially offset by volume growth on Copenhagen and Skoal. Overall, USSTC and PM U.S.A. delivered accident financial results in the Smokeless Products segment in the first half of 2011. We are pleased with the way Copenhagen and Skoal are performing and with the momentum they carry into the second half of the year. 
The Cigars segment continues to be affected by increased levels of low-priced imported machine made larger cigars following the 2009 federal excise tax increase. Middleton has taken a number of steps to improve its business performance including efficiently investing in promotional resources to defend Black & Mild retail share and launching new products to expand the brand into new segments where it has not completed widely. In addition, Middleton has entered into a contract manufacturing arrangement to show a portion of its cigars outside of the United States. Middleton's second quarter adjusted operating companies income of $47 million was down versus the prior year but more than doubled sequentially while Black & Mild's retail share grew 0.09 of a share point versus last year., supported by new products and brand building initiatives.
In the Wine segment, Ste. Michelle's adjusted operating companies income increased 11.8% in the second quarter and 17.2% for the first half. Wine shipment volume increased 6.3% in the second quarter and 3.5% in the first half. We believe that our business results through June put us on track to achieve our 2011 full year guidance for both reported and adjusted diluted EPS. We expect to deliver adjusted diluted EPS growth of 6% to 9% for the full year in a range of $2.01 to $2.07, off an adjusted based of $1.90 per share in 2010. We also expect to achieve reported diluted EPS in the range of $1.70 to $1.76. 
Since our second quarter and first half results benefited from trade inventory dynamics and as a cigarette trade inventories are depleted in the third quarter, we expect Altria's 2011 fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS growth to be stronger than the third quarter of 2011. I will now turn the call over to Howard Willard, Altria's Executive Vice President and CFO, who will discuss Altria's business segment results in more detail."
296308,137037004,143147,"Altria Group Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2011",2011-07-20,"Earnings Calls","Altria Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. Good morning.

Good morning. In the Cigarette segment, second quarter reported operating companies income increased by 5.9% to $1.5 billion primarily due to higher risk prices and lower restructuring costs partially offset by lower volume, higher FDA user fees and a $36 million charge for the Scott case. Adjusted second quarter operating companies income, which is calculated excluding restructuring costs but including the charge for the Scott case, increased 2.8% to $1.5 billion. Adjusted operating companies income margins were 39. % including the Scott case. 
PM U.S.A. grew at second quarter sequential retail share 0.3 share points versus the first quarter of 2011 primarily due to Marlboro's share performance. On a year-over-year basis, PM U.S.A.'s second quarter Cigarette segment retail share declined by 0.9 share points to 49.3% due to retail share declines of 0.7 share points on its portfolio brands and 0.2 share points on Marlboro as the brand faced a difficult comparison versus its record retail share performance last year.
Reported Cigarette segment shipments declined by 0.7% but after adjusting primarily for the trade inventory changes, Mike discussed, declined by an estimated 4.5%. PM U.S.A. estimates that the overall cigarette categories adjusted volume decline by approximately 3.5% in the second quarter, which is in line with historical price elasticity.
The Smokeless Products segment reported second quarter operating companies income increased by 12.1% to $222 million primarily due to higher pricing, lower SG&A and lower restructuring costs, partially offset by lower volume. Adjusted operating companies income, which is calculated excluding restructuring costs, increased by 10.9% to $224 million. 
Copenhagen and Skoal demonstrated sequential share momentum in the second quarter, gaining that combined 0.9 share points. Skoal's second quarter retail share declined 0.3 share points year-over-year but increased 0.2 share points sequentially versus the first quarter of 2011. Skoal has gained 0.5 share points since the fourth quarter of 2010. USSTC and PM U.S.A.'s second quarter combined retail share decreased by 0.7 share points versus the year-ago period to 55.1% as Copenhagen share gains were more than offset by share declines in the rest of the portfolio.
Marlboros Snus volumes in retail share comparisons were impacted by 2 factors. First, the brand had significantly lower levels of promotional activity compared to last year's national expansion. Second, new Marlboro's Snus products launched earlier this year contained 15 pouches per tin compared to 6 pouches per foil pack and Marlboro's other 4 Snus package. This makes volume in retail share comparisons more difficult since the tin with 15 pouches is considered equivalent to a foil pack with 6 pouches.
Reported second quarter Smokeless Products shipments decreased by 2.1% but when adjusted primarily for new product pipeline volume, trade inventories and discontinued SKUs, adjusted volume grew by an estimated 4%. USSTC and PM U.S.A. estimate that the Smokeless Products category grew about 5% in the first half.
Middleton saw a sequential improvement in adjusted operating companies income and margins. Adjusted operating companies income margins increased sequentially by 16.2 percentage points to 49.5% as Middleton more efficiently allocated Black & Mild promotional investments. Black & Mild retail share performance in the second quarter benefited from brand building initiatives and the launch of untipped cigarillo varieties in both classic and suites blends. Middleton shipment volumes was essentially flat in the second quarter.
Ste. Michelle delivered strong financial results in the second quarter as adjusted operating companies income, which is calculated excluding restructuring in UST acquisition related costs, increased by 11.8% to $19 million. The Wine segment shipment volume in the second quarter benefited from higher off and on-premise channel volume partially offset by changes in trade inventories. 
The Financial Services segment reported an operating companies loss of $463 million in the second quarter, resulting from the previously announced onetime charge related to the tax treatment of certain leverage leases. Second quarter adjusted operating companies income, which is calculated excluding the onetime charge, was $27 million.
Altria continue to manage its cost structure, delivering $80 million in cost savings this quarter. We expect to achieve at least $30 million in additional cost savings by the end of the year and are on track to exceed our goal of $1.5 billion in cost reductions versus 2006.
Altria also delivered value to shareholders by returning cash to them through dividends and stock repurchases. Altria paid almost $800 million in dividends in the second quarter and $1.6 billion in the first half, reflecting our intention to return 80% of adjusted diluted EPS to shareholders in the form of dividends. Also in the second quarter, Altria repurchased $616 million of its common stock at an average price of $27.07. We intended to complete our previously announced 2011 1 billion share repurchase program by the end of this year but the timing of any share repurchases depends upon marketplace conditions and other factors. Dividends and share repurchases remain subject to the discretion of our board.
Mike and I will now be happy to take your questions. While the calls are compiled, let me cover a few housekeeping items.
Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest effective price cigarette was 34% in the second quarter. Marlboro's net pack price in the quarter was $5.63 while the lowest effective price cigarette was $4.20. The cigarette discount categories second quarter retail share was 27.3%. There were no cigarette excise tax increases affected in the first half of this year. Effective July 1, 3 states: Connecticut, Hawaii and Vermont increased the excise taxes while the New Hampshire lowered its excise tax by $0.10 per pack. As a result of this activity, the estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax at the beginning of the third quarter was $1.37 per pack.
Copenhagen second quarter retail price was $4.17 and its price gap versus the leading discount brand was approximately44% in the quarter. As of June 30, 2011, 20 states in the District of Columbia used a weight based smokeless tobacco excise tax system, representing approximately 31% of the Smokeless Tobacco categories volume. CapEx was $27 million in the second quarter, and we anticipate that our 2011 full year CapEx will be approximately $160 million. And finally, depreciation and amortization was $61 million in the second quarter and Altria anticipates that its 2011 full year ongoing depreciation and amortization will be approximately $250 million.

But I think that in general, what were looking for was the focus on the premium brands, Copenhagen and Skoal, cost reduction, significant cost reduction to fund getting in line the price gaps so that these premium brands could grow, and then kind of a Phase II approach, which includes looking at efficiencies rationalizing the total portfolio so that it can become more efficient so that over time, we're really focused on what we think are the key growth levers in that business. And I would say we're making progress in line with our expectations were. We did Copenhagen first and now we've move to Skoal Copenhagen remains on a nice growth trend, and I think while it's early on Skoal, the signs are right. We still have some remodeling to do with that franchise. It has a lot of SKUs and so we're -- as we adjust the franchise, were also pruning some of that so we'll continue to have some effect from that kind of activity and we're also migrating share a bit from the discount portfolio that has been built up in USSTC before we acquired it. I think on top of that, you have this Snus phenomena which is kind of adds a bit of complexity to reading the data on the overall Smokeless business and that's still evolving. And I don't know exactly where that's going to go longer term at this point. I tend to see more interaction relative to total pouch segment of the total Smokeless business which would include Snus and MST pouches. As time goes on, more so than seeing Snus as kind of a separate business relative to the MST pouches business which is larger. So that's still going to shake itself out. But all in all, we're trending in line with where we expected to trend and the margins are performing well. The business is performing well.  The shares are moving in the right direction on Copenhagen and Skoal, and the cost side of that business has come in the line quite nicely with some more opportunities I think in front of us. So I'd say that's where it stands right now."

I would say in this particular case we had broad acceptance and participation in this program and that that's occurred pretty rapidly. The program that we currently have as well as the ones in the past that have always been created to retailers use Marlboro as a competitive tool, and so that's what this does and so we've seen some competitive increase, competitive activity increase, relative to Marlboro leadership. I think that we saw some margin creep on Marlboro and the back half of last year as our some retail margins expanded more on Marlboro than it did an other brands in the category. It looks to us like in the second quarter that it came back in line with where it was prior to that creep occurrence so the gap for Marlboro versus the lowest in the second quarter of this year was identical to where it was in the second quarter last year. And so that's been the impact. I mean this is something where we're always paying attention to. We evolve these programs. We'll evolve this one as time goes on.

If you look at our long-term growth trends, I know people have some difficulty looking at short-term comparisons and trying to figure out what the long-term growth trends are but we do figure them out. What you see is the Marlboro has been consolidating share in the Premium segment so business comes from people who are more inclined to smoke high-quality premium product. And I don't see anything changing that. I do think that particularly in tough economic times, you have to be thoughtful about how you manage your value equation and that includes how you manage your gap relative to the market. And keep in mind the reason why the gap percentage is lower now than it was is because of the FET.  That FET is a mathematical adjustment that took a mid-40s gap down to mid-30s gap just doing the math. So I think that, that all occurred at the same time that we went into some tough economic times but nonetheless, that's how that gap got to the mid-30s from the mid to lower 40s.

Altria delivered solid financial results from the second quarter and the first half with adjusted diluted EPS growth of 6% and 5.4%, respectively. Our premium tobacco brands performed well in a highly competitive environment marked by continuing economic pressure on adult consumers. We are pleased with our business results and remain on track to achieve the 2011 full year adjusted diluted EPS we forecast in our guidance. 
In the Cigarette segment, PM U.S.A. reported solid adjusted operating companies income growth and margin strength for both the second quarter and first half as Marlboro grew its retail share sequentially and PM U.S.A.'s premium mix continued to improve versus the prior year.  PM U.S.A. grew its adjusted operating companies income 2.8% for the second quarter and 4.8% for the first half. Adjusted operating companies income margins, which include the impact of a $36 million charge for the Scott case were down 3/10 of a percentage point in the second quarter and were up 1 percentage point for the first half. 
In the cigarette industry environment where premium share has remained relatively stable in recent years, Marlboro's retail share increased sequentially and performed well when compared to last year's record share in the second quarter. Marlboro's second quarter retail share grew by 4/10 of a share point was the first quarter of 2011 to 42.6%. This represented a share decline of 2/10 of a share point compared to last year's record retail share. Marlboro's performance was driven in part by growth in Marlboro Menthol and the continued success of Special Blend, which launched 2 new packings last quarter. We are pleased with Marlboro's performance for the first half of 2011 from both a share and profitability standpoint.
PM U.S.A. second quarter cigarette shipment volume benefited from trade inventory movements as the trade continued to build inventory levels through the quarter. We believe that the trade has already begun to deplete some of its inventory in July, and expect trade inventory depletion to impact shipment volume in the third quarter. PM U.S.A.'s reported cigarette shipments in the quarter declined versus the comparable year-ago period and after adjusting for trade inventory changes were estimated to be down 4.5% compared to the total cigarette categories estimated decline rate of 3.5%. Shipments of premium products represented 94.3% of PM U.S.A.'s total shipments, an increase of 1 percentage point from last year. PM U.S.A.'s results were delivered in an intense competitive environment marked by high unemployment and low consumer confidence. Despite these challenges, PM U.S.A. improved its premium mix, delivered strong adjusted operating income margins and achieved solid share results from Marlboro. 
In the Smokeless Products segment, our companies  delivered excellent adjusted operating companies income growth driven by the share performance of Copenhagen and Skoal and strong margin growth. Adjusted operating companies income for the Smokeless Products increased 10.9% for the second quarter and 7.2% for the first half. Adjusted operating companies income margins increased 3.8 percentage points for the second quarter and 3 percentage points for the first half primarily due to higher pricing, the shift to volume and to the more profitable Copenhagen and Skoal brands and lower SG&A costs. Copenhagen's momentum continued in the second quarter as the brand increased its retail share 1.1 percentage points versus the prior year and 7/10 of a share point sequentially. Copenhagen share results continue to benefit from recent product introductions, as well as strength in its core natural business. 
Skoal has responded to brand building initiatives. The brand gained sequential retail share for the second consecutive quarter as it benefited from the 2011 first quarter introduction of Skoal X-tra  products and Skoal Snus. Gains from these new products fully offset retail share losses, which resulted from USSTC's portfolio rationalization that delisted 7 Skoal SKUs that individually had limited distribution. 
Combined shipment volumes for Copenhagen and Skoal increased 2.4% in the second quarter and 3.2% for the first half. USSTC and PM U.S.A.'s combined shipment volume for the first half decreased due to trade inventory changes and a negative comparison on their portfolio brands including Marlboro Snus  partially offset by volume growth on Copenhagen and Skoal. Overall, USSTC and PM U.S.A. delivered excellent financial results in the Smokeless Products segment in the first half 2011. We are pleased with the way Copenhagen and Skoal are performing and with the momentum they carry into the second half of the year. 
The Cigars segment continues to be affected by increased levels of low-priced imported machine made large cigars following the 2009 federal excise tax increase. Middleton has taken a number of steps to improve its business performance including efficiently investing in promotional resources to defend Black & Mild's retail share and launching new products to expand the brand into new segments, where it has not completed widely. In addition, Middleton has entered into a contract manufacturing arrangement to source a portion of its cigars outside of the United States. Middleton's second quarter adjusted operating companies income of $47 million was down versus the prior year but more than doubled sequentially, while Black & Mild's retail share grew 9/10 of a share point versus last year, supported by new products and brand-building initiatives.
In the Wine segment, Ste. Michelle's adjusted operating companies income increased 11.8% in the second quarter and 17.2% for the first half. Wine shipment volume increased 6.3% in the second quarter and 3.5% in the first half. We believe that our business results through June put us on track to achieve our 2011 full year guidance for both reported and adjusted diluted EPS. We expect to deliver adjusted diluted EPS growth of 6% to 9% for the full year in a range of $2.01 to $2.07, off an adjusted base of $1.90 per share in 2010. We also expect to achieve reported diluted EPS in the range of $1.70 to $1.76. 
Since our second quarter and first half results benefited from trade inventory dynamics and as cigarette trade inventories are depleted in the third quarter, we expect Altria's 2011 fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS growth to be stronger than the third quarter of 2011. 
I will now turn the call over to Howard Willard, Altria's Executive Vice President and CFO, who will discuss Altria's business segment results in more detail."

Good morning. In the Cigarette segment, second quarter reported operating companies income increased by 5.9% to $1.5 billion, primarily due to higher list prices and lower restructuring costs partially offset by lower volume, higher FDA user fees and a $36 million charge for the Scott case. Adjusted second quarter operating companies income, which is calculated excluding restructuring costs but including the charge for the Scott case, increased 2.8% to $1.5 billion. Adjusted operating companies income margins were 39.7% including the Scott case. 
PM U.S.A. grew at second quarter sequential retail share 0.3 share points versus the first quarter of 2011, primarily due to Marlboro's share performance. On a year-over-year basis, PM U.S.A.'s second quarter Cigarette segment retail share declined by 0.9 share points to 49.3% due to retail share declines of 0.7 share points on its portfolio brands and 0.2 share points on Marlboro, as the brand faced a difficult comparison versus its record retail share performance last year.
Reported Cigarette segment shipments declined by 0.7% but after adjusting primarily for the trade inventory changes Mike discussed, declined by an estimated 4.5%. PM U.S.A. estimates that the overall cigarette categories adjusted volume declined by approximately 3.5% in the second quarter, which is in line with historical price elasticity.
The Smokeless Products segments reported second quarter operating companies income increased by 12.1% to $222 million primarily due to higher pricing, lower SG&A and lower restructuring costs, partially offset by lower volume. Adjusted operating companies income, which is calculated excluding restructuring costs, increased by 10.9% to $224 million. 
Copenhagen and Skoal demonstrated sequential share momentum in the second quarter, gaining that combined 0.9 share points. Skoal's second quarter retail share declined 0.3 share points year-over-year but increased 0.2 share points sequentially versus the first quarter of 2011. Skoal has gained 0.5 share points since the fourth quarter of 2010. USSTC and PM U.S.A.'s second quarter combined retail share decreased by 0.7 share points versus the year-ago period to 55.1%, as Copenhagen share gains were more than offset by share declines in the rest of the portfolio.
Marlboro Snus volume and retail share comparisons were impacted by 2 factors. First, the brand had significantly lower levels of promotional activity compared to last year's national expansion. Second, new Marlboro Snus products launched earlier this year contained 15 pouches per tin compared to 6 pouches per foil pack in Marlboro's other 4 Snus packings. This makes volume and retail share comparisons more difficult since the tin with 15 pouches is considered equivalent to a foil pack with 6 pouches.
Reported second quarter Smokeless Products shipments decreased by 2.1% but when adjusted primarily for new product pipeline volume, trade inventories and discontinued SKUs, adjusted volume grew by an estimated 4%. USSTC and PM U.S.A. estimate that the Smokeless Products category grew about 5% in the first half.
Middleton saw a sequential improvement in adjusted operating companies income and margins. Adjusted operating companies income margins increased sequentially by 16.2 percentage points to 49.5% as Middleton more efficiently allocated Black & Mild's promotional investments. Black & Mild's retail share performance in the second quarter benefited from brand building initiatives and the launch of untipped cigarillo varieties in both Classic and Sweets Blends. Middleton shipment volume was essentially flat in the second quarter.
Ste. Michelle delivered strong financial results in the second quarter as adjusted operating companies income, which is calculated excluding restructuring in UST acquisition related costs, increased by 11.8% to $19 million. 
The Wine segment shipment volume in the second quarter benefited from higher off- and on-premise channel volume partially offset by changes in trade inventories. 
The Financial Services segment reported an operating companies loss of $463 million in the second quarter, resulting from the previously announced onetime charge related to the tax treatment of certain leverage leases. Second quarter adjusted operating companies income, which is calculated excluding the onetime charge was $27 million.
Altria continued to manage its cost structure, delivering $80 million in cost savings this quarter. We expect to achieve at least $30 million in additional cost savings by the end of the year and are on track to exceed our goal of $1.5 billion in cost reductions versus 2006.
Altria also delivered value to shareholders by returning cash to them through dividends and stock repurchases. Altria paid almost $800 million in dividends in the second quarter and $1.6 billion in the first half, reflecting our intention to return 80% of adjusted diluted EPS to shareholders in the form of dividends. Also in the second quarter, Altria repurchased $616 million of its common stock at an average price of $27.07. We intend to complete our previously announced 2011 1 billion share repurchase program by the end of this year but the timing of any share repurchases depends upon marketplace conditions and other factors. Dividends and share repurchases remain subject to the discretion of our board.
Mike and I will now be happy to take your questions. While the calls are compiled, let me cover a few housekeeping items.
Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest effective price cigarette was 34% in the second quarter. Marlboro's net pack price in the quarter was $5.63 while the lowest effective price cigarette was $4.20. The cigarette discount category second quarter retail share was 27.3%. There were no cigarette excise tax increases effective in the first half of this year. Effective July 1, 3 states: Connecticut, Hawaii and Vermont increased their excise taxes, while New Hampshire lowered its excise tax by $0.10 per pack. As a result of this activity, the estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax at the beginning of the third quarter was $1.37 per pack.
Copenhagen second quarter retail price was $4.17, and its price gap versus the leading discount brand was approximately 44% in the quarter. As of June 30, 2011, 20 states in the District of Columbia used a weight-based smokeless tobacco excise tax system, representing approximately 31% of the Smokeless Tobacco categories volume. 
CapEx was $27 million in the second quarter, and we anticipate that our 2011 full year CapEx will be approximately $160 million. And finally, depreciation and amortization was $61 million in the second quarter, and Altria anticipates that its 2011 full year ongoing depreciation and amortization will be approximately $250 million.
Operator, do we have any questions?"

But",411,"Well, I would say in general, the trends are in line with what our expectations were, although a lot of things have changed since we put together the initial acquisition model, not the least of which was we entered into a pretty significant recession. But I think that in general, what we were looking for was a focus on the premium brands, Copenhagen and Skoal, cost reduction, significant cost reduction to fund it, getting in line the price gaps, so that these premium brands could grow. And then kind of a Phase 2 approach, which includes looking at efficiencies, rationalizing the total portfolio, so that it can become more efficient. So that over time, we're really focused on what we think are the key growth levers in that business. And I would say we're making progress in line with what our expectations were. We did Copenhagen first and now we've moved to Skoal, Copenhagen remains on a nice growth trend. And I think while it's early on Skoal, the signs are right. We still have some remodeling to do with that franchise. It has a lot of SKUs and so we're -- as we adjust the franchise, were also pruning some of that, so we'll continue to have some effect from that kind of activity and we're also migrating share a bit from the discount portfolio that had been built up in USSTC before we acquired it. I think on top of that, you have this Snus phenomena, which is -- kind of adds a bit of complexity to reading the data on the overall Smokeless business and that's still evolving. And I don't know exactly where that's going to go longer term at this point. I tend to see more interaction relative to total pouch segment of the total Smokeless business, which would include Snus and MST pouches. As time goes on, more so than seeing Snus as kind of a separate business relative to the MST pouches business, which is larger. So that's still going to shake itself out. But all in all, we're trending in line with where we expected to trend and the margins are performing well. The business is performing well.  The shares are moving in the right direction on Copenhagen and Skoal, and the cost side of that business has come in the line quite nicely with some more opportunities, I think, in front of us. So I'd say that's where it stands right now."

So what happens when we make evolutionary changes in these programs is we always have a group of customers that jump on them immediately, and then we have other customers who don't see that program as a strategic fit for their business, and then we have customers who watch what happens in the marketplace and come on to the program over time. I would say in this particular case we've had broad acceptance and participation in this program and that, that's occurred pretty rapidly. The program that we currently have, as well as the ones in the past have always been created to help retailers use Marlboro as a competitive tool, and so that's what this does and so we've seen some competitive increase, competitive activity increase, relative to Marlboro leadership. I think that we saw some margin creep on Marlboro in the back half of last year, as some retail margins expanded more on Marlboro than it did an other brands in the category. It looks to us like in the second quarter that it came back in line with where it was prior to that creep occurrence. So the gap for Marlboro versus the lowest in the second quarter of this year was identical to where it was in the second quarter last year. And so that's been the impact. I mean this is something that we're always paying attention to. We evolve these programs. We'll evolve this one as time goes on. But so far, it's pretty much in line with what we would have expected it to do and it's pretty consistent with the way these programs have functioned in the past."

What you see is that Marlboro has been consolidating share in the Premium segment, so it's -- business comes from people who are more inclined to smoke a high-quality premium product. And I don't see anything changing that. I do think that particularly in tough economic times, you have to be thoughtful about how you manage your value equation and that includes how you manage your gap relative to the market. And keep in mind the reason why the gap percentage is lower now than it was is because of the FET.  That FET is a mathematical adjustment that took a mid-40s gap down to mid-30s gap, just due to the math, okay? So I think that, that all occurred at the same time that we went into some tough economic times. But nonetheless, that's how that gap got to the mid-30s from the mid to lower-40s. So no, I think that, that's something that you have to pay attention to, but the Premium segment looks pretty healthy and Marlboro is very healthy within it."

Altria delivered solid financial results from the second quarter and the first half with adjusted diluted EPS growth of 6% and 5.4%, respectively. Our premium tobacco brands performed well in a highly competitive environment marked by continuing economic pressure on adult consumers. We are pleased with our business results and remain on track to achieve the 2011 full year adjusted diluted EPS we forecast in our guidance. 
In the Cigarette segment, PM U.S.A. reported solid adjusted operating company’s income growth and margin strength for both the second quarter and first half as Marlboro grew its retail share sequentially and PM U.S.A.'s premium mix continued to improve versus the prior year.  PM U.S.A. grew its adjusted operating company’s income 2.8% for the second quarter and 4.8% for the first half. Adjusted operating company’s income margins, which include the impact of a $36 million charge for the Scott case were down 3/10 of a percentage point in the second quarter and were up 1 percentage point for the first half. 
In the cigarette industry environment where premium share has remained relatively stable in recent years, Marlboro's retail share increased sequentially and performed well when compared to last year's record share in the second quarter. Marlboro's second quarter retail share grew by 4/10 of a share point versus the first quarter of 2011 to 42.6%. This represented a share decline of 2/10 of a share point compared to last year's record retail share. Marlboro's performance was driven in part by growth in Marlboro Menthol and the continued success of Special Blend, which launched 2 new packings last quarter. We are pleased with Marlboro's performance for the first half of 2011 from both a share and profitability standpoint.
PM U.S.A. second quarter cigarette shipment volume benefited from trade inventory movements as the trade continued to build inventory levels through the quarter. We believe that the trade has already begun to deplete some of its inventory in July, and expect trade inventory depletion to impact shipment volume in the third quarter. PM U.S.A.'s reported cigarette shipments in the quarter declined versus the comparable year-ago period and after adjusting for trade inventory changes were estimated to be down 4.5% compared to the total cigarette categories estimated decline rate of 3.5%. Shipments of premium products represented 94.3% of PM U.S.A.'s total shipments, an increase of 1 percentage point from last year. PM U.S.A.'s results were delivered in an intense competitive environment marked by high unemployment and low consumer confidence. Despite these challenges, PM U.S.A. improved its premium mix, delivered strong adjusted operating income margins and achieved solid share results from Marlboro. 
In the Smokeless Products segment, our companies delivered excellent adjusted operating companies income growth driven by the share performance of Copenhagen and Skoal and strong margin growth. Adjusted operating companies income for the Smokeless Products increased 10.9% for the second quarter and 7.2% for the first half. Adjusted operating companies income margins increased 3.8 percentage points for the second quarter and 3 percentage points for the first half primarily due to higher pricing, the shift to volume and to the more profitable Copenhagen and Skoal brands and lower SG&A costs. Copenhagen's momentum continued in the second quarter as the brand increased its retail share 1.1 percentage points versus the prior year and 7/10 of a share point sequentially. Copenhagen share results continue to benefit from recent product introductions, as well as strength in its core natural business. 
Skoal has responded to brand building initiatives. The brand gained sequential retail share for the second consecutive quarter as it benefited from the 2011 first quarter introduction of Skoal X-tra  products and Skoal Snus. Gains from these new products fully offset retail share losses, which resulted from USSTC's portfolio rationalization that delisted 7 Skoal SKUs that individually had limited distribution. 
Combined shipment volumes for Copenhagen and Skoal increased 2.4% in the second quarter and 3.2% for the first half. USSTC and PM U.S.A.'s combined shipment volume for the first half decreased due to trade inventory changes and a negative comparison on their portfolio brands including Marlboro Snus  partially offset by volume growth on Copenhagen and Skoal. Overall, USSTC and PM U.S.A. delivered excellent financial results in the Smokeless Products segment in the first half of 2011. We are pleased with the way Copenhagen and Skoal are performing and with the momentum they carry into the second half of the year. 
The Cigars segment continues to be affected by increased levels of low-priced imported machine made large cigars following the 2009 federal excise tax increase. Middleton has taken a number of steps to improve its business performance including efficiently investing in promotional resources to defend Black & Mild's retail share and launching new products to expand the brand into new segments, where it has not competed widely. In addition, Middleton has entered into a contract manufacturing arrangement to source a portion of its cigars outside of the United States. Middleton's second quarter adjusted operating companies income of $47 million was down versus the prior year but more than doubled sequentially, while Black & Mild's retail share grew 9/10 of a share point versus last year, supported by new products and brand-building initiatives.
In the Wine segment, Ste. Michelle's adjusted operating companies income increased 11.8% in the second quarter and 17.2% for the first half. Wine shipment volume increased 6.3% in the second quarter and 3.5% in the first half. We believe that our business results through June put us on track to achieve our 2011 full year guidance for both reported and adjusted diluted EPS. We expect to deliver adjusted diluted EPS growth of 6% to 9% for the full year in a range of $2.01 to $2.07, off an adjusted base of $1.90 per share in 2010. We also expect to achieve reported diluted EPS in the range of $1.70 to $1.76. 
Since our second quarter and first half results benefited from trade inventory dynamics and as cigarette trade inventories are depleted in the third quarter, we expect Altria's 2011 fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS growth to be stronger than the third quarter of 2011. 
I will now turn the call over to Howard Willard, Altria's Executive Vice President and CFO, who will discuss Altria's business segment results in more detail."

Good morning. In the Cigarette segment, second quarter reported operating companies income increased by 5.9% to $1.5 billion, primarily due to higher list prices and lower restructuring costs partially offset by lower volume, higher FDA user fees and a $36 million charge for the Scott case. Adjusted second quarter operating companies income, which is calculated excluding restructuring costs but including the charge for the Scott case, increased 2.8% to $1.5 billion. Adjusted operating companies income margins were 39.7% including the Scott case. 
PM U.S.A. grew at second quarter sequential retail share 0.3 share points versus the first quarter of 2011, primarily due to Marlboro's share performance. On a year-over-year basis, PM U.S.A.'s second quarter Cigarette segment retail share declined by 0.9 share points to 49.3% due to retail share declines of 0.7 share points on its portfolio brands and 0.2 share points on Marlboro, as the brand faced a difficult comparison versus its record retail share performance last year.
Reported Cigarette segment shipments declined by 0.7% but after adjusting primarily for the trade inventory changes Mike discussed, declined by an estimated 4.5%. PM U.S.A. estimates that the overall cigarette categories adjusted volume declined by approximately 3.5% in the second quarter, which is in line with historical price elasticity.
The Smokeless Products segments reported second quarter operating companies income increased by 12.1% to $222 million primarily due to higher pricing, lower SG&A and lower restructuring costs, partially offset by lower volume. Adjusted operating companies income, which is calculated excluding restructuring costs, increased by 10.9% to $224 million. 
Copenhagen and Skoal demonstrated sequential share momentum in the second quarter, gaining that combined 0.9 share points. Skoal's second quarter retail share declined 0.3 share points year-over-year but increased 0.2 share points sequentially versus the first quarter of 2011. Skoal has gained 0.5 share points since the fourth quarter of 2010. USSTC and PM U.S.A.'s second quarter combined retail share decreased by 0.7 share points versus the year-ago period to 55.1%, as Copenhagen share gains were more than offset by share declines in the rest of the portfolio.
Marlboro Snus volume and retail share comparisons were impacted by 2 factors. First, the brand had significantly lower levels of promotional activity compared to last year's national expansion. Second, new Marlboro Snus products launched earlier this year contained 15 pouches per tin compared to 6 pouches per foil pack in Marlboro's other 4 Snus packings. This makes volume and retail share comparisons more difficult since the tin with 15 pouches is considered equivalent to a foil pack with 6 pouches.
Reported second quarter Smokeless Products shipments decreased by 2.1% but when adjusted primarily for new product pipeline volume, trade inventories and discontinued SKUs, adjusted volume grew by an estimated 4%. USSTC and PM U.S.A. estimate that the Smokeless Products category grew about 5% in the first half.
Middleton saw a sequential improvement in adjusted operating companies income and margins. Adjusted operating companies income margins increased sequentially by 16.2 percentage points to 49.5% as Middleton more efficiently allocated Black & Mild's promotional investments. Black & Mild's retail share performance in the second quarter benefited from brand building initiatives and the launch of untipped cigarillo varieties in both Classic and Sweets Blends. Middleton shipment volume was essentially flat in the second quarter.
Ste. Michelle delivered strong financial results in the second quarter as adjusted operating companies income, which is calculated excluding restructuring in UST acquisition related costs, increased by 11.8% to $19 million. 
The Wine segment shipment volume in the second quarter benefited from higher off- and on-premise channel volume partially offset by changes in trade inventories. 
The Financial Services segment reported an operating companies loss of $463 million in the second quarter, resulting from the previously announced onetime charge related to the tax treatment of certain leverage leases. Second quarter adjusted operating companies income, which is calculated excluding the onetime charge was $27 million.
Altria continued to manage its cost structure, delivering $80 million in cost savings this quarter. We expect to achieve at least $30 million in additional cost savings by the end of the year and are on track to exceed our goal of $1.5 billion in cost reductions versus 2006.
Altria also delivered value to shareholders by returning cash to them through dividends and stock repurchases. Altria paid almost $800 million in dividends in the second quarter and $1.6 billion in the first half, reflecting our intention to return 80% of adjusted diluted EPS to shareholders in the form of dividends. Also in the second quarter, Altria repurchased $616 million of its common stock at an average price of $27.07. We intend to complete our previously announced 2011 1 billion share repurchase program by the end of this year but the timing of any share repurchases depends upon marketplace conditions and other factors. Dividends and share repurchases remain subject to the discretion of our board.
Mike and I will now be happy to take your questions. While the calls are compiled, let me cover a few housekeeping items.
Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest effective price cigarette was 34% in the second quarter. Marlboro's net pack price in the quarter was $5.63 while the lowest effective price cigarette was $4.20. The cigarette discount category second quarter retail share was 27.3%. There were no cigarette excise tax increases effective in the first half of this year. Effective July 1, 3 states: Connecticut, Hawaii and Vermont increased their excise taxes, while New Hampshire lowered its excise tax by $0.10 per pack. As a result of this activity, the estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax at the beginning of the third quarter was $1.37 per pack.
Copenhagen second quarter retail price was $4.17, and its price gap versus the leading discount brand was approximately 44% in the quarter. As of June 30, 2011, 20 states in the District of Columbia used a weight-based smokeless tobacco excise tax system, representing approximately 31% of the Smokeless Tobacco categories volume. 
CapEx was $27 million in the second quarter, and we anticipate that our 2011 full year CapEx will be approximately $160 million. And finally, depreciation and amortization was $61 million in the second quarter, and Altria anticipates that its 2011 full year ongoing depreciation and amortization will be approximately $250 million.

But",411,"Well, I would say in general, the trends are in line with what our expectations were, although a lot of things have changed since we put together the initial acquisition model, not the least of which was we entered into a pretty significant recession. But I think that in general, what we were looking for was a focus on the premium brands, Copenhagen and Skoal, cost reduction, significant cost reduction to fund it, getting in line the price gaps, so that these premium brands could grow. And then kind of a Phase 2 approach, which includes looking at efficiencies, rationalizing the total portfolio, so that it can become more efficient. So that over time, we're really focused on what we think are the key growth levers in that business. And I would say we're making progress in line with what our expectations were. We did Copenhagen first and now we've moved to Skoal, Copenhagen remains on a nice growth trend. And I think while it's early on Skoal, the signs are right. We still have some remodeling to do with that franchise. It has a lot of SKUs and so we're -- as we adjust the franchise, we’re also pruning some of that, so we'll continue to have some effect from that kind of activity and we're also migrating share a bit from the discount portfolio that had been built up in USSTC before we acquired it. I think on top of that, you have this Snus phenomena, which is -- kind of adds a bit of complexity to reading the data on the overall Smokeless business and that's still evolving. And I don't know exactly where that's going to go longer term at this point. I tend to see more interaction relative to total pouch segment of the total Smokeless business, which would include Snus and MST pouches. As time goes on, more so than seeing Snus as kind of a separate business relative to the MST pouches business, which is larger. So that's still going to shake itself out. But all in all, we're trending in line with where we expected to trend and the margins are performing well. The business is performing well.  The shares are moving in the right direction on Copenhagen and Skoal, and the cost side of that business has come in the line quite nicely with some more opportunities, I think, in front of us. So I'd say that's where it stands right now."

So what happens when we make evolutionary changes in these programs is we always have a group of customers that jump on them immediately, and then we have other customers who don't see that program as a strategic fit for their business, and then we have customers who watch what happens in the marketplace and come on to the program over time. I would say in this particular case we've had broad acceptance and participation in this program and that, that's occurred pretty rapidly. The program that we currently have, as well as the ones in the past have always been created to help retailers use Marlboro as a competitive tool, and so that's what this does and so we've seen some competitive increase, competitive activity increase, relative to Marlboro leadership. I think that we saw some margin creep on Marlboro in the back half of last year, as some retail margins expanded more on Marlboro than it did on other brands in the category. It looks to us like in the second quarter that it came back in line with where it was prior to that creep occurrence. So the gap for Marlboro versus the lowest in the second quarter of this year was identical to where it was in the second quarter last year. And so that's been the impact. I mean this is something that we're always paying attention to. We evolve these programs. We'll evolve this one as time goes on. But so far, it's pretty much in line with what we would have expected it to do and it's pretty consistent with the way these programs have functioned in the past."

So I can't suggest to you one that's a target, but it is a subject that we review regularly not just for Marlboro but across the portfolio, and we have done some delisting over time but like I said, most of them are profitable.

That's been going on for a while. We also, over time, launched some new blends on Marlboro that are designed to appeal to competitive adult smokers, non-menthol competitive adult smokers and we would expect to get some growth from that portfolio as well. And so because menthol is a place where we're underdeveloped and because to attract competitive premium smokers, you have to give them an offering that they find appealing. We use some kinds of promotion activity on these brands to -- on these SKUs, to go ahead and reach out to those folks. But I might point out to you -- so we'd expect to see growth from those particular areas. But I might point out to you as I said before, in the context of all that, the mix and Marlboro hasn't changed, its percentage of that business in terms of value spend of its revenues remains relatively low versus most competitive brands and in fact, is pretty constant. So this isn't a big mix shift for us because we don't promote all of these things, all the time. We use some strategically. So I don't know if that specifically answers your question, but I think that's the appropriate way for you to think about it."

So I think that there's no trend there. It's a pretty solid ratio, and we've been consolidating. If you look at our long-term growth trends, I know people have some difficulty looking at short-term comparisons and trying to figure out what the long-term growth trends are but we do figure them out. What you see is that Marlboro has been consolidating share in the Premium segment, so it's -- business comes from people who are more inclined to smoke a high-quality premium product. And I don't see anything changing that. I do think that particularly in tough economic times, you have to be thoughtful about how you manage your value equation and that includes how you manage your gap relative to the market. And keep in mind the reason why the gap percentage is lower now than it was is because of the FET.  That FET is a mathematical adjustment that took a mid-40s gap down to a mid-30s gap, just do to the math, okay? So I think that, that all occurred at the same time that we went into some tough economic times. But nonetheless, that's how that gap got to the mid-30s from the mid to lower-40s. So no, I think that, that's something that you have to pay attention to, but the Premium segment looks pretty healthy and Marlboro is very healthy within it."

Altria made significant progress in the third quarter on its plans to continue delivering strong returns to shareholders. The company increased it's dividends, 7.9%. It completed its previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program. It exceeded its goal of achieving $1.5 billion of cost reductions and it grew its third quarter adjusted diluted EPS 3.7%. And our Consumer Products businesses continue to expand their adjusted operating margins.
For the first 9 months of 2011, adjusted diluted EPS grew 4.8% and includes a $0.01 per share charge for the judgment payed in the Scott case.
In the Cigarette segment, Philip Morris U.S.A. delivered strong third quarter adjusted operating income margin growth despite difficult comparisons which were impacted by trade inventory depletions in 2011, and strong operating companies income growth and Marlboro retail share performance in 2010. PM U.S.A.'s reported cigarette buy and decline 9% for the third quarter after trade depleted inventories that have been built in the first half of this year. After adjusting for trade inventories, PM U.S.A. estimates it's cigarette shipment volume decline approximately 5%. Marlboro's third quarter retail share was negatively impacted by relative changes in manufacturer's promotional activities. Following PM U.S.A.'s July 2011 list price increase, Marlboro's retail Price increased more than major competitive premium and discount brands as PM U.S.A. focused on growing its adjusted operating company's income margins.
As we have stated before, PM U.S.A. subjective in the cigarette category, is to maximize income growth while maintaining modest retail share momentum on Marlboro. PM U.S.A. balances these objectives overtime writer than focusing on quarter-to-quarter income and share results that may fluctuate on a short-term basis due to the timing of Marlboro's new products, and brand building initiatives as well as competitive activity and trade inventory dynamics.
PM U.S.A. is willing to accept short-term negative retail share comparisons on Marlboro, as it balances these objectives. We remain confident that Marlboro's brand strength as it's equity, loyalty rate and adult demographics remain strong.
In the Smokeless Products segment, USSTC delivered strong adjusted operating company's income and margin growth driven by Copenhagen and Skoal. In the Cigars segment, John Middleton achieved double-digit growth in net revenues and operating company's income and delivered strong adjusted operating company's income margin growth in the third quarter. In the Line segment, Ste. Michelle delivered excellent financial and volume results as it continue to focus on improving it's mix to higher-margin premium products. Overall, we are pleased with our business results through the first 9 months of the year which were achieved in a difficult economic environment marked by intense competition in our Tobacco businesses. We believe that we are on-track to achieve solid adjusted earnings per share results for the full-year.
We are reaffirming our adjusted diluted EPS guidance as we expect to deliver EPS growth in the range of 6% to 9% for the full year or $2.01 to $2.07 off an adjusted base of $1.90 per share in 2010.
This adjusted EPS guidance includes $0.01 per share charge related to the Scott case. We also expect to achieve afforded diluted EPS in the range of $1.60 to $1.66 per share.
In the third quarter, Altria completed its previously announced share repurchase and cost reduction programs. Yesterday, Altria's board approved 2 new initiatives to build on this year's progress and support our goal delivering average annual adjusted diluted EPS growth of 79% overtime. First, the board authorized the new $1 billion share repurchase program as part of Altria's ongoing commitment to return cash to shareholders. Altria intends to complete this new program by the end of 2012, but the timing of such purchases depend upon marketplace conditions and other factors. And the program is subject to the discretion of the Board.
Second, following the completion of our 2007 to 2011 program, we have announced the new cost reduction program which is primarily focused on cigarette-related infrastructure costs. As you are aware, cigarette industry volume has declined significantly following the 158% increase in the federal excise tax in April 2009, resulting in our need to continue reducing cigarette-related infrastructure.
Altria expects this new cost reduction program to deliver $400 million in estimated annualized cost savings by the end of 2013. Altria estimates total pretax restructuring charges of approximately $375 million with approximately $340 million being recorded in the fourth quarter of this year. The substantial portion of the charges were resolved in cash expenditures related primarily to employee separation costs of approximately $300 million. The charges also reflect other associated costs and including lease termination and asset impairment.
Altria's made consistent progress in this challenging economic environment. Marked by volatility in the financial markets, slow economic growth, high unemployment, and low consumer confidence. We believe that our strong brand positions outstanding people, high dividend yield, focus on cost management and the past consistency of our adjusted EPS growth continue to differentiate Altria positively from other investment alternatives. Altria grew its adjusted diluted EPS 6.1% in 2009, and 8.6% in 2010 and expects to grow it's 2011 full-year adjusted diluted EPS on a range of 6% to 9%. Altria believes that the ongoing performance of it's businesses, along with its new share repurchase and cost reduction initiatives, will allow it to deliver 2012 adjusted diluted EPS growth that is consistent with this past performance. I will now turn the call over to Howard Willard, Altria's Executive Vice President and CFO, who will discuss Altria's business segment results in more detail."

Good morning. Third quarter reported operating company's income in the Cigarette segment, decreased 0.8% to $1.5 billion primarily due to lower shipment volume as the trade depleted inventory build in the first half of the year and higher FDA user feeds partially offset by higher list prices and lower restructuring costs. When adjusted for restructuring costs, third quarter operating company's income decreased 2.4% to $1.5 billion. In the third quarter, adjusted operating company's income margins increased 1.5 percentage points, to 41.7% and were higher than those of our principal competitors. Reported operating co income for the first 9 months increased 4.5% to $4.4 billion primarily due to higher list prices and lower restructuring costs partially offset by lower shipment volume, higher FDA user-fees and the $36 million charge for the Scott case.
Adjusted operating company's income for the first 9 months which is calculated excluding restructuring costs, but including the Scott case charge, grew 2.2%. Our Cigarette segment's operating company's income margins for the first 9 months increased 1.1 percentage points to 40.3%. For the first 9 months of 2011, PM U.S.A. grew its adjusted operating companies income per pack and adjusted operating company's income margins faster than its principal competitors.
PM U.S.A. and Marlboro's volume comparisons for the third quarter were impacted by trade inventory dynamics. PM U.S.A.'s reported domestic cigarette volume for the third quarter declined 9% primarily due to trade inventory reductions and retail share losses. For the first 9 months of 2011, PM U.S.A.'s volume declined 5.4%. When adjusted primarily for trade inventories, PM U.S.A. estimates that it's volume declined approximately 5% for both time periods. The total cigarette category volume was estimated to be down approximately 3.5% for both the third quarter and first 9 months of this year.
To the first 9 months of the year, PM U.S.A. has delivered solid adjusted operating company's income growth, and increased it's adjusting operating income margin while retaining some of the strong share gains achieved last year for Marlboro. In the Smokeless Products segment, reported operating company's income increased 16.7% for the third quarter to $245 million and 12.6% to $660 million for the first 9 months due primarily to higher pricing and lower SG&A costs. When adjusted for restructuring and UST acquisition-related cost, operating company's income increased 15.5% to $246 million for the third quarter and 10.1% to $664 million for the first 9 months. Adjusted operating company's income margins for both the third quarter and the first 9 months increased 3.1 percentage points.
Total Smokeless Product shipment volume declined 2/10 of a percent for the third quarter and 1.2% for the first 9 months, as shipment declines in other portfolio brands including Marlboro's Snus, were partially offset by volume growth for Copenhagen and Skoal. Marlboro's Snus volume was negatively impacted by lower levels of promotional activity compared to last year's national expansion and the shift in mix with packages with 6 pouches to with 15 pouches.
After adjusting for trade inventories, USSTC and PM U.S.A.'s combined Smokeless segment volume was estimated to be up approximately 5% and 4% respectively for the third quarter and first 9 months of 2011. USSTC and PM U.S.A. believe that total Smokeless category volume grew by approximately 5% for the first 9 months. Copenhagen and Skoal's combined volume grew 6.8% and their combined retail share grew 1.4 share points in the third quarter. Copenhagen continue to deliver strong volume and share results supported by recent product introductions including Copenhagen Wintergreen pouches. Skoal grew it's volume for the third quarter as it benefited from new products introduced earlier this year which were partially offset by the delisting of 7 SKUs in the second quarter. Skoal's third quarter share, retail share, declined 3/10ths of a share point sequentially due impart of the impact of the delisting of the 7 SKUs. We are encouraged by Skoal's quarterly retail share performance which has been relatively stable since the fourth quarter of 2010, despite the impact of the SKU reductions.
Overall, USSTC has delivered strong financial results in the Smokeless Products segment so far this year. Copenhagen continues to deliver strong results and Skoal continues to transition as it benefits from brand building initiatives and new product introductions such as Skoal X-tra while streamlining it's SKUs. In the Cigars segment, Middleton increased its third quarter reported that adjusted operating company's income by 27.9% to $55 million. While the Cigar's segment adjusted operating company's income was down 15.6% to $124 million for first 9 months, Middleton's resulted shown sequential improvement since the first quarter of 2011. Adjusted operating company's margin increased 2.7 percentage points to 50.5% for the third quarter. Margin stability in the second and third quarters has given Middleton and adjusted operating company's margin of 45.9% for the first 9 months of 2011. Middleton cigar volumes increased 3.7% for the quarter and 1.8% for the first 9 months. Middleton's third quarter cigar volumes benefited from new product introductions and increases in trade inventories. Black & Mild's retail share declined half a share-point, 29.2% for the third quarter, but was up 4/10 of a share-point for the first 9 months of this year and sequentially versus the second quarter of 2011. The brand's retail share performance so far this year has benefited from brand building initiatives and new product introductions including the launch of untipped cigarette lows in both classic and suite blends. In the fourth quarter, Middleton plans to nationally introduced an untipped version of Black & Mild wine which along with Black & Mild sweets and classic, will be available in a new aroma wrapped foil pouch.
In the Wine segment, Ste. Michelle's reported operating company's income increased 91.7% to $23 million for the third quarter and 74.2% to $54 million for the first 9 months. Adjusted operating companies income increased 41.2% to $24 million for the third quarter and 26.1% to $58 million for the first 9 months. Adjusted operating company's income margins increased 2.2 percentage points to 18.9% for the quarter and 1.7 percentage points to 17.3% for the first 9 months. Wine shipment volume increased 19.7% for the third quarter and 8.9% in the first 9 months. These strong business results reflects Ste. Michelle's focus on premium, higher-margin products.
The Financial Services segment's third quarter reported operating company's income was $83 million, an increase of $56 million primarily due to a decrease in the allowance for losses and higher gains on asset sales. PMCC assesses the adequacy of it's allowance for losses relative to the credit risk of it's leasing portfolio on an ongoing basis. For the third quarter, PMCC decreased it's allowance for losses based on management's assessment of the credit quality of it's leasing portfolio including reductions in exposure to below investment grade lefties, resulting in $35 million of additional operating company's income for the third quarter and first 9 months. The allowance for losses at the end of the third quarter was $167 million versus $202 million at the end of the second quarter 2011.
Altria also delivered value to shareholders by returning cash to them through dividends and share repurchases. The company paid almost $800 million in dividends in the third quarter, and $2.4 billion in the first 9 months, reflecting our objective of returning 80% of adjusted diluted EPS to shareholders in the form of dividends. Altria completed it's previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program in the third quarter by repurchasing $14.8 million shares of it's common stock at an average price of $25.93. For total cost of $384 million. For the total program, Altria repurchased $37.6 million at an average price of $26.62.
Mike and I will be happy to take your questions while the calls are compiled, let me cover a few housekeeping items. Marlboro's price GAAP versus the lowest effective cigarette was 36% for the third quarter. Marlboro's net pack price in the quarter was $5.74 while the lowest effective price cigarette was $4.22. The cigarette discount categories third quarter retail share was 27.9%. The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax at the end of the third quarter was $1.37 per pack. Copenhagen's third quarter retail price was $4.23 and it's price GAAP versus the leading discount brand was approximately 43% in the quarter. CapEx was $35 million for the third quarter and we anticipate that our 2011 full-year CapEx will be approximately $125 million. And finally, depreciation and amortization was $63 million for the third quarter and Altria anticipates that it's 2011 full-year ongoing depreciation and amortization will be approximately $250 million. Operator, do we have any questions?"

So we didn't do anything unusual in the third quarter. We faced actually a tough comp in the quarter from several directions, from an inventory point of view, from a market share point of view, our market share in the third quarter a year ago was 42, 6, which was the record share for the year that we achieved in 2010. So, when we look at it, we felt like we kept in line with what we thought was the goal here which was to maximize income. But then, to make sure that we're maintaining some modest momentum on this brand over time, and so I wouldn't get too caught up with the particular share result in the quarter as a function of a lot of things. If you look at Marlboro share over the last few years, what you'd see is that there is about 1.5 share point deviation spread with the brands operating there. And I think that when we get inside the numbers, what we see is that it's pretty much related to promotion-sensitive consumers. Every brand has a percentage of their makeup and promotion since the consumers, Marlboro's level of debt is lower than most because it has a very high brand loyalty and the brand loyalty has maintained itself, even as we've gone through some tough economic times. But competitive activity, as well as our own level of promotion spending does have an influence on this promotion-sensitive group so we see some share deviation up and down that takes place based on those variables. And that's what you got going on, when you have it going on this year, as we face the record share level last year when we had a lot of activity related to the launch of our Special Blend lineup. So I couldn't tell you if there was anything exceptional there. We did see Marlboro's price go up relative to primary competitive brands during the quarter following pricing activity at the very beginning of the quarter at retail and so that has some, I think short-term impact. But gaps from Marlboro state, in the range they've been in for the previous time since the increase we haven't seen much change there. That's relative to the lowest-priced products. There was a gap expansion versus some of the other premium brands during the quarter."

The discount business is modulated in a range in the mid to high '20s. Marlboro is modulated in the range as I describe and you see that in some other brands, particularly premium brands. In the Discount segment, you'd see some consolidation within the segment though, and that was primarily driven by Pall Mall. You see a few order brands that shares shifts around 2 within the Discount segment. But all of that has actually behaved in a pretty stable way. Now, I think what you're referring to are things like roll your own, small cigars, one-time played a role in terms of some interaction with the Cigarette business down at the bottom. You see some of that going on. That's actually not a new thing. It ebbs and flows sometimes, the particular product that becomes a focal point is new. But for the shoppers that looking for the very cheapest thing that they can find in the Smokable segment, there's always something that is moving around in that regard. And it does have some nominal impact, but I wouldn't say recently there's been any significant impact on the overall category related to that kind of activity. We don't play there, so we really don't participate at the lowest price arena in the categories. So this does not have much of an impact on our business, but it can have some impact on, I think overall Discount segment at the very bottom of the segment where you have shoppers that are looking for the very lowest-priced products that they can find."

It's simply an outcome from the factors that took place in the quarter. And again, I pointed out that there is a certain portion of the brand and Marlboro's case, it's about 10% of the brand that is what we call alternate purchasers there, 90% of that franchise is made up of consumers that say they buy the brand 100% of the time and that has remained pretty constant. So among these alternate purchase groups, you do see activity with these people, that's stimulated by promotion and in a bad economic environment, you see more switching among that group because they're shopping for deals among a group of brands that they qualify as acceptable to them. So when we look at it, it's really a matter of how much money do you want to spend at any point in time relative to that group because you know in some ways you're renting share. And so, we look at that regularly and we make decisions about what we think is appropriate in balancing our objective to maximize profit while we maintain some modest momentum on the brand. But we just don't look at share as the way we understand the health of the brand. We look at other underlying factors that actually are more important to understanding the health of the brand. And those factors remain very strong for Marlboro. So, we monitor all of that on a regular basis but like I say, these kinds of deviations we've seen over the past few years as we've been in a tough economy, it's not in fact the best economic environment to really try and grow share because of the difficult circumstances. Some consumers are in. So you make sure that you're maintaining your equity strength, doing the sensible things to build that equity and at the same time being involved in the promotional activity that is always going to be in any category to a reasonable level, but understanding that at the end of day, the objective with the franchise is to try to make money with it. So, I would say we're pretty comfortable with where we are and we're simply managing this franchise the way we think is best for it's long-term benefit to the company."

But relative to what you're referring to, there was some significant competitive volume that was being shipped through channels that are not measured by these types of panels. And with the change of the enforcement in New York, at that time which was not tax paid, volume moved best we can tell is moved down to some lower tax jurisdictions states and is being picked up now on these panels. The best we can approximate, David, is it had a negative, about a negative 2/10 of a share point affect on Marlboro. That doesn't mean that volume changed, it simply means that volume was out there, not these panels moved into the panels. And so from our perspective, it doesn't really have any bearing on the way we look at the business, but it does have a nominal effect on the numbers, but not the trends."

It was declining, we're still working against a base where there are a number of SKUs, they're in the base that we've since discontinued. And we've launched some new SKUs that we think better position the brand and they're building and offsetting some of that loss. So, we have to lap all of that before we're really understand where we are with the Skoal brand. But Actually we're pretty pleased that it stabilized and it looks like what we've put into place is beginning to perform properly and hopefully what we'll see once we kind of get past this period of reconstructing the brand, we'll see some steady growth. I think it's important to point out though that Skoal doesn't operate in a vacuum, it exists in a category with other brands. One of which is Copenhagen and Copenhagen is showing really strong growth. And so, Skoal has to compete with that and we're not quite as far along with Skoal as we are with Copenhagen. So I think that does have a bearing on the numbers as well, but combined Skoal and Copenhagen are doing quite nicely."

296308,141335912,179225,"Altria Group Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2011",2011-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Altria Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brendan, and good morning everyone.

Altria made significant progress in the third quarter on its plans to continue delivering strong returns to shareholders. The company increased its dividends, 7.9%. It completed its previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program. It exceeded its goal of achieving $1.5 billion of cost reductions, and it grew its third quarter adjusted diluted EPS 3.7%. And our consumer products businesses continue to expand their adjusted operating margins.
For the first 9 months of 2011, adjusted diluted EPS grew 4.8% and includes a $0.01 per share charge for the judgment payed in the Scott case.
In the cigarette segment, Philip Morris U.S.A. delivered strong third quarter adjusted operating income margin growth despite difficult comparisons which were impacted by trade inventory depletions in 2011, and strong operating companies income growth in Marlboro retail share performance in 2010. PM U.S.A.'s reported cigarette volume declined 9% for the third quarter as the trade depleted inventories that had been built in the first half of this year. After adjusting for trade inventories, PM U.S.A. estimates its cigarette shipment volume declined approximately 5%. Marlboro's third quarter retail share was negatively impacted by relative changes in manufacturers' promotional activities. Following PM U.S.A.'s July 2011 list price increase, Marlboro's retail price increased more than major competitive premium and discount brands as PM U.S.A. focused on growing its adjusted operating companies income margins.
As we have stated before, PM U.S.A.'s objective in the cigarette category is to maximize income growth while maintaining modest retail share momentum on Marlboro. PM U.S.A. balances these objectives over time rather than focusing on quarter-to-quarter income and share results that may fluctuate on a short-term basis due to the timing of Marlboro's new products, and brand building initiatives as well as competitive activity and trade inventory dynamics. PM U.S.A. is willing to accept short-term negative retail share comparisons on Marlboro, as it balances these objectives. We remain confident in Marlboro's brand strength as its equity, loyalty rates and adult demographics remain strong.
In the smokeless products segment, USSTC delivered strong adjusted operating companies income and margin growth driven by Copenhagen and Skoal. In the cigars segment, John Middleton achieved double-digit growth in net revenues and operating companies income and delivered strong adjusted operating companies income margin growth in the third quarter. In the Wine segment, Ste. Michelle delivered excellent financial and volume results as it continue to focus on improving its mix to higher-margin premium products. Overall, we are pleased with our business results through the first 9 months of the year which were achieved in a difficult economic environment marked by intense competition in our tobacco businesses. We believe that we are on track to achieve solid adjusted earnings per share results for the full year.
We are reaffirming our adjusted diluted EPS guidance as we expect to deliver EPS growth in the range of 6% to 9% for the full year, or $2.01 to $2.07 off an adjusted base of $1.90 per share in 2010. This adjusted EPS guidance includes $0.01 per share charge related to the Scott case. We also expect to achieve reported diluted EPS in the range of $1.60 to $1.66 per share.
In the third quarter, Altria completed its previously announced share repurchase and cost reduction programs. Yesterday, Altria's board approved 2 new initiatives to build on this year's progress and support our goal delivering average annual adjusted diluted EPS growth of 7% to 9% over time. First, the board authorized the new $1 billion share repurchase program as part of Altria's ongoing commitment to return cash to shareholders. Altria intends to complete this new program by the end of 2012, but the timing of such purchases depends upon marketplace conditions and other factors. And the program is subject to the discretion of the board
Second, following the completion of our 2007 to 2011 program, we have announced the new cost reduction program, which is primarily focused on cigarette-related infrastructure costs. As you are aware, cigarette industry volume has declined significantly following the 158% increase in the federal excise tax in April 2009, resulting in our need to continue reducing cigarette-related infrastructure.
Altria expects this new cost reduction program to deliver $400 million in estimated annualized cost savings by the end of 2013. Altria estimates total pretax restructuring charges of approximately $375 million with approximately $340 million being recorded in the fourth quarter of this year. A substantial portion of the charges were resolved in cash expenditures related primarily to employee separation costs of approximately $300 million. The charges also reflect other associated costs, including lease termination and asset impairment.
Altria's made consistent progress in this challenging economic environment. Marked by volatility in the financial markets, slow economic growth, high unemployment, and low consumer confidence. We believe that our strong brand positions outstanding people, high dividend yield, focus on cost management and the past consistency of our adjusted EPS growth continue to differentiate Altria positively from other investment alternatives. Altria grew its adjusted diluted EPS 6.1% in 2009 and 8.6% in 2010, and expects to grow its 2011 full year adjusted diluted EPS in the range of 6% to 9%. Altria believes that the ongoing performance of its businesses, along with its new share repurchase and cost reduction initiatives, will allow it to deliver 2012 adjusted diluted EPS growth that is consistent with this past performance. 
I will now turn the call over to Howard Willard, Altria's Executive Vice President and CFO, who will discuss Altria's business segment results in more detail."

Good morning. Third quarter reported operating companies income in the cigarettes segment, decreased 0.8% to $1.5 billion primarily due to lower shipment volume as the trade depleted inventory build in the first half of the year and higher FDA user fees, partially offset by higher list prices and lower restructuring costs. When adjusted for restructuring costs, third quarter operating companies income decreased 2.4% to $1.5 billion. 
In the third quarter, adjusted operating companies income margins increased 1.5 percentage points to 41.7% and were higher than those of our principal competitors. Reported operating companies income for the first 9 months increased 4.5% to $4.4 billion primarily due to higher list prices and lower restructuring costs partially offset by lower shipment volume, higher FDA user fees and the $36 million charge for the Scott case.
Adjusted operating companies income for the first 9 months, which is calculated excluding restructuring costs but including the Scott case charge, grew 2.2%. Our cigarettes segment's operating companies income margins for the first 9 months increased 1.1 percentage points to 40.3%. For the first 9 months of 2011, PM U.S.A. grew its adjusted operating companies income per pack and adjusted operating companies income margins faster than its principal competitors.
PM U.S.A. and Marlboro's volume comparisons for the third quarter were impacted by trade inventory dynamics. PM U.S.A.'s reported domestic cigarette volume for the third quarter declined 9% primarily due to trade inventory reductions and retail share losses. For the first 9 months of 2011, PM U.S.A.'s volume declined 5.4%. When adjusted primarily for trade inventories, PM U.S.A. estimates that its volume declined approximately 5% for both time periods. The total cigarette category volume was estimated to be down approximately 3.5% for both the third quarter and first 9 months of this year.
Through the first 9 months of the year, PM U.S.A. has delivered solid adjusted operating companies income growth and increased its adjusting operating income margins while retaining some of the strong share gains achieved last year for Marlboro. In the smokeless products segment, reported operating companies income increased 16.7% for the third quarter to $245 million and 12.6% to $660 million for the first 9 months due primarily to higher pricing and lower SG&A costs. When adjusted for restructuring and UST acquisition-related costs, operating companies income increased 15.5% to $246 million for the third quarter and 10.1% to $664 million for the first 9 months. Adjusted operating companies income margins for both the third quarter and the first 9 months increased 3.1 percentage points.
Total smokeless products shipment volume declined 2/10 of a percent for the third quarter and 1.2% for the first 9 months as shipment declines in other portfolio brands, including Marlboro Snus, were partially offset by volume growth for Copenhagen and Skoal. Marlboro Snus volume was negatively impacted by lower levels of promotional activity compared to last year's national expansion, and the shift in mix with packages with 6 pouches to tins with 15 pouches.
After adjusting for trade inventories, USSTC and PM U.S.A.'s combined smokeless segment volume was estimated to be up approximately 5% and 4%, respectively, for the third quarter and first 9 months of 2011. USSTC and PM U.S.A. believe that total smokeless category volume grew by approximately 5% for the first 9 months. Copenhagen and Skoal's combined volume grew 6.8%, and their combined retail share grew 1.4 share points in the third quarter. Copenhagen continue to deliver strong volume and share results supported by recent product introductions, including Copenhagen Wintergreen pouches. Skoal grew its volume for the third quarter as it benefited from new products introduced earlier this year which were partially offset by the delisting of 7 SKUs in the second quarter. Skoal's third quarter share, retail share, declined 3/10 of a share point sequentially due impart of the impact of the delisting of the 7 SKUs. We are encouraged by Skoal's quarterly retail share performance which has been relatively stable since the fourth quarter of 2010, despite the impact of the SKU reductions. Overall, USSTC has delivered strong financial results in the smokeless products segment so far this year. Copenhagen continues to deliver strong results and Skoal continues to transition as it benefits from brand building initiatives and new product introductions such as Skoal X-tra, while streamlining its SKUs. 
In the cigars segment, Middleton increased its third quarter reported and adjusted operating companies income by 27.9% to $55 million. While the cigars segment adjusted operating companies income was down 15.6% to $124 million for the first 9 months, Middleton's results have shown sequential improvement since the first quarter of 2011. Adjusted operating companies margin increased 2.7 percentage points to 50.5% for the third quarter. Margin stability in the second and third quarters has given Middleton an adjusted operating companies margin of 45.9% for the first 9 months of 2011. Middleton cigar volumes increased 3.7% for the quarter and 1.8% for the first 9 months. Middleton's third quarter cigar volumes benefited from new product introductions and increases in trade inventories. 
Black & Mild's retail share declined half a share point, 29.2% for the third quarter, but was up 4/10 of a share point for the first 9 months of this year and sequentially versus the second quarter of 2011. The brand's retail share performance so far this year has benefited from brand building initiatives and new product introductions, including the launch of untipped cigarillos in both Classic and Sweets blends. In the fourth quarter, Middleton plans to nationally introduce an untipped version of Black & Mild Wine, which along with Black & Mild Sweets and Classic, will be available in a new Aroma Wrap foil pouch.
In the Wine segment, Ste. Michelle's reported operating companies income increased 91.7% to $23 million for the third quarter and 74.2% to $54 million for the first 9 months. Adjusted operating companies income increased 41.2% to $24 million for the third quarter and 26.1% to $58 million for the first 9 months. Adjusted operating companies income margins increased 2.2 percentage points to 18.9% for the quarter and 1.7 percentage points to 17.3% for the first 9 months. Wine shipment volume increased 19.7% for the third quarter and 8.9% in the first 9 months. These strong business results reflects Ste. Michelle's focus on premium higher-margin products.
The financial services segment's third quarter reported operating companies income was $83 million, an increase of $56 million primarily due to a decrease in the allowance for losses and higher gains on asset sales. PMCC assesses the adequacy of its allowance for losses relative to the credit risk of its leasing portfolio on an ongoing basis. For the third quarter, PMCC decreased its allowance for losses based on management's assessment of the credit quality of its leasing portfolio including reductions in exposure to below investment grade lessees, resulting in $35 million of additional operating companies income for the third quarter and first 9 months. The allowance for losses at the end of the third quarter was $167 million versus $202 million at the end of the second quarter of 2011.
Altria also delivered value to shareholders by returning cash to them through dividends and share repurchases. The company paid almost $800 million in dividends in the third quarter and $2.4 billion in the first 9 months, reflecting our objective of returning 80% of adjusted diluted EPS to shareholders in the form of dividends. Altria completed its previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program in the third quarter by repurchasing $14.8 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $25.93 for a total cost of $384 million. For the total program, Altria repurchased $37.6 million at an average price of $26.62.
Mike and I will now be happy to take your questions. While the calls are compiled, let me cover a few housekeeping items. Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest effective priced cigarette was 36% for the third quarter. Marlboro's net pack price in the quarter was $5.74, while the lowest effective priced cigarette was $4.22. The cigarette discount categories third quarter retail share was 27.9%. The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax at the end of the third quarter was $1.37 per pack. Copenhagen's third quarter retail price was $4.23, and its price gap versus the leading discount brand was approximately 43% in the quarter. CapEx was $35 million for the third quarter, and we anticipate that our 2011 full year CapEx will be approximately $125 million. And finally, depreciation and amortization was $63 million for the third quarter and Altria anticipates that its 2011 full year ongoing depreciation and amortization will be approximately $250 million. Operator, do we have any questions?"

So we didn't do anything unusual in the third quarter. We faced actually a tough comp in the quarter from several directions from a inventory point of view, from a market share point of view. Our market share in the third quarter a year ago was 42.6%, which was the record share for the year that we achieved in 2010. So when we look at it, we felt like we kept in line with what we thought was the goal here which was to maximize income. But then to make sure that we're maintaining some modest momentum on this brand over time, and so I wouldn't get too caught up with the particular share result in the quarter, it's a function of a lot of things. If you look at Marlboro's share over the last few years, what you'd see is that there's about 1.5 share point deviation spread that the brand's operated in. And I think that when we get inside the numbers, what we see is that it's pretty much related to promotion-sensitive consumers. Every brand has a percentage of their makeup in promotion-sensitive consumers. Marlboro's level of that is lower than most because it has a very high brand loyalty and the brand loyalty has maintained itself, even as we've gone through some tough economic times. But competitive activity, as well as our own level of promotion spending does have an influence on this promotion-sensitive group, so we see some share deviation up and down that takes place based on those variables. And that's what you got going on, and you've had it going on this year as we faced the record share level last year where we had a lot of activity related to the launch of our Special Blend lineup. So I couldn't tell you there was anything exceptional there. We did see Marlboro's price go up relative to primary competitive brands during the quarter following pricing activity at the very beginning of the quarter at retail. And so that has some, I think, short-term impact. But gaps for Marlboro state in the range they've been in for the previous time since the FET increase, which is the mid-30s, we haven't seen much change there. That's relative to the lowest-priced products. There was some gap expansion versus some of the other premium brands during the quarter."

The discount business has modulated in a range in the mid to high '20s. Marlboro has modulated in a range as I described and you'll see that in some other brands, particularly premium brands. In the discount segment, you've seen some consolidation within the segment though, and that was primarily driven by Pall Mall. You see a few other brands that share shifts around 2 within the discount segment. But all of that has actually behaved in a pretty stable way. Now I think what you're referring to are things like roll-your-own small cigars at one time played a role in terms of some interaction with the cigarette business down at the bottom. You see some of that going on. That's actually not a new thing. It ebbs and flows, sometimes the particular product that becomes a focal point is new. But for the shopper that's looking for the very cheapest thing that they can find in the smokable segment, there's always something that is moving around in that regard. And it does have some nominal impact, but I wouldn't say that recently there's been any significant impact on the overall category related to that kind of activity. We don't play there, so we really don't participate at the lowest price arena in the categories. So this does not have much of an impact on our business, but it can have some impact on I think overall discount segment at the very bottom of the segment, where you have shoppers that are looking for the very lowest-priced products that they can find."

And in a bad economic environment, you'd see more switching among that group because they're shopping for deals among a group of brands that they qualify as acceptable to them. So when we look at it, it's really a matter of how much money do you want to spend at any point in time relative to that group because you know in some ways you're renting share. And so, we look at that regularly and we make decisions about what we think is appropriate in balancing our objective to maximize profit while we maintain some modest momentum on the brand. But we just don't look at share as the way we understand the health of the brand. We look at other underlying factors that actually are more important to understanding the health of the brand. And those factors remain very strong for Marlboro. So we monitor all of that on a regular basis. But like I say, these kinds of deviations we've seen over the past few years as we've been in a tough economy, it's not in fact the best economic environment to really try and grow share because of the difficult circumstances. Some consumers are in. So you want to make sure that you're maintaining your equity strength, doing sensible things to build that equity and at the same time, being involved in the promotion activity that is always going to be in any category to a reasonable level, but understanding that at the end of day, the objective with the franchise is to try to make money with it. So I would say we're pretty comfortable with where we are, and we're simply managing this franchise the way we think is best for its long-term benefit to the company."

It's the trends that you're trying to derive as you look at these panels is why I always kind of encourage people not to get too caught up with quarters. You really have to look at the stuff over a longer period of time to make really good use out of it. But relative to what you're referring to, there was some significant competitive volume that was being shipped through channels that are not measured by these types of panels. And with the change of the enforcement in New York, that volume which was not tax paid, volume moved. Best that we can tell it moved down to some lower tax jurisdiction states, and is being picked up now on these panels. The best we can approximate, David, is it had a negative -- about a negative 2/10 of a share point effect on Marlboro. That doesn't mean that, that's a volume change. It just simply means that volume that was out there, not these panels, moved into the panels. And so from our perspective, it doesn't really have any bearing on the way we look at the business, but it does have a nominal effect on the numbers but not the trends."

To get the SKUs rationalized and to get the product offering right, so that it's relevant to the market as it exists today. And we're still in the midst of that, although I think that what we've seen is the brand stabilized over the last 4 quarters. It was declining. We're still working against a base where there are a number of SKUs. They're in the base that we have since discontinued. And we've launched some new SKUs that we think better position the brand, and they're building and offsetting some of that loss. So we have to lap all of that before we really understand where we are with the Skoal brand. But actually we're pretty pleased it stabilized and it looks like what we've put into place is beginning to perform properly. And hopefully, what we'll see once we kind of get past this period of our reconstructing the brand, we'll see some steady growth. I think it's important to point out though that Skoal doesn't operate a vacuum, it exists in the category with other brands. One of which is Copenhagen, and Copenhagen is showing really strong growth. And so, Skoal has to compete with that and we're not quite as far along with Skoal as we are with Copenhagen. So I think that does have a bearing on the numbers as well. But combined, Skoal and Copenhagen are doing quite nicely."

Since the April 2009 FET, you've seen some pretty substantial declines in overall industry cigarette volume. Albeit they've been consistent with historical price elasticity, nonetheless, there's pretty significant tax increase and so we had a significant impact on volume. And as we've said all along, one of the things that you're going to have to do in this business is as volume declines and that business you have to takeout cigarette-related infrastructure cost, in order to manage the business properly, you can't carry infrastructure for a business that was originally designed for a bigger business. You have to continue to shrink it as the overall business shrinks. And so that's all that's going on. In the current year, we've seen a little bit of moderation of the decline rate. Looks like it's running about 3.5% these days. Nonetheless, it's still a significant decline rate for the cigarette category.

Our remarks contain forward-looking and cautionary statements and projections of future results, and I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statement section at the end of our earnings release for the review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. For a detailed review of Altria's business results, please review the earnings release that is available on our website, altria.com.
Altria reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Today's call will contain various operating results on both a reported and on an adjusted basis, which excludes items that affect the comparability of reported results. Descriptions of these measures and reconciliations are included in today's earnings press release and are available on our website. In addition, comparisons discussed in this conference call are to the same prior-year period unless otherwise stated.
Now it gives me great pleasure to introduce Mike Szymanczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Altria Group Inc."
296308,141335912,179437,"Altria Group Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2011",2011-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Altria Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brendan, and good morning everyone. Altria made significant progress in the third quarter on its plans to continue delivering strong returns to shareholders. The company increased its dividends, 7.9%. It completed its previously announced $1 billi",920,"Thanks, Brendan, and good morning everyone. Altria made significant progress in the third quarter on its plans to continue delivering strong returns to shareholders. The company increased its dividends, 7.9%. It completed its previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program. It exceeded its goal of achieving $1.5 billion of cost reductions, and it grew its third quarter adjusted diluted EPS 3.7%. And our consumer products businesses continue to expand their adjusted operating margins.
For the first 9 months of 2011, adjusted diluted EPS grew 4.8% and includes a $0.01 per share charge for the judgment paid in the Scott case.
In the cigarette segment, Philip Morris U.S.A. delivered strong third quarter adjusted operating income margin growth despite difficult comparisons which were impacted by trade inventory depletions in 2011, and strong operating companies income growth in Marlboro retail share performance in 2010. PM U.S.A.'s reported cigarette volume declined 9% for the third quarter as the trade depleted inventories that had been built in the first half of this year. After adjusting for trade inventories, PM U.S.A. estimates its cigarette shipment volume declined approximately 5%. Marlboro's third quarter retail share was negatively impacted by relative changes in manufacturers' promotional activities. Following PM U.S.A.'s July 2011 list price increase, Marlboro's retail price increased more than major competitive premium and discount brands as PM U.S.A. focused on growing its adjusted operating companies income margins.
As we have stated before, PM U.S.A.'s objective in the cigarette category is to maximize income growth while maintaining modest retail share momentum on Marlboro. PM U.S.A. balances these objectives over time rather than focusing on quarter-to-quarter income and share results that may fluctuate on a short-term basis due to the timing of Marlboro's new products, and brand building initiatives as well as competitive activity and trade inventory dynamics. PM U.S.A. is willing to accept short-term negative retail share comparisons on Marlboro, as it balances these objectives. We remain confident in Marlboro's brand strength as its equity, loyalty rates and adult demographics remain strong.
In the smokeless products segment, USSTC delivered strong adjusted operating companies income and margin growth driven by Copenhagen and Skoal. In the cigars segment, John Middleton achieved double-digit growth in net revenues and operating companies income and delivered strong adjusted operating companies income margin growth in the third quarter. In the Wine segment, Ste. Michelle delivered excellent financial and volume results as it continue to focus on improving its mix to higher-margin premium products. Overall, we are pleased with our business results through the first 9 months of the year which were achieved in a difficult economic environment marked by intense competition in our tobacco businesses. We believe that we are on track to achieve solid adjusted earnings per share results for the full year.
We are reaffirming our adjusted diluted EPS guidance as we expect to deliver EPS growth in the range of 6% to 9% for the full year, or $2.01 to $2.07 off an adjusted base of $1.90 per share in 2010. This adjusted EPS guidance includes $0.01 per share charge related to the Scott case. We also expect to achieve reported diluted EPS in the range of $1.60 to $1.66 per share.
In the third quarter, Altria completed its previously announced share repurchase and cost reduction programs. Yesterday, Altria's board approved 2 new initiatives to build on this year's progress and support our goal delivering average annual adjusted diluted EPS growth of 7% to 9% over time. First, the board authorized the new $1 billion share repurchase program as part of Altria's ongoing commitment to return cash to shareholders. Altria intends to complete this new program by the end of 2012, but the timing of such purchases depends upon marketplace conditions and other factors. And the program is subject to the discretion of the board
Second, following the completion of our 2007 to 2011 program, we have announced the new cost reduction program, which is primarily focused on cigarette-related infrastructure costs. As you are aware, cigarette industry volume has declined significantly following the 158% increase in the federal excise tax in April 2009, resulting in our need to continue reducing cigarette-related infrastructure.
Altria expects this new cost reduction program to deliver $400 million in estimated annualized cost savings by the end of 2013. Altria estimates total pretax restructuring charges of approximately $375 million with approximately $340 million being recorded in the fourth quarter of this year. A substantial portion of the charges will result in cash expenditures related primarily to employee separation costs of approximately $300 million. The charges also reflect other associated costs, including lease termination and asset impairment.
Altria's made consistent progress in this challenging economic environment. Marked by volatility in the financial markets, slow economic growth, high unemployment, and low consumer confidence. We believe that our strong brand positions outstanding people, high dividend yield, focus on cost management and the past consistency of our adjusted EPS growth continue to differentiate Altria positively from other investment alternatives. Altria grew its adjusted diluted EPS 6.1% in 2009 and 8.6% in 2010, and expects to grow its 2011 full year adjusted diluted EPS in the range of 6% to 9%. Altria believes that the ongoing performance of its businesses, along with its new share repurchase and cost reduction initiatives, will allow it to deliver 2012 adjusted diluted EPS growth that is consistent with this past performance. 
I will now turn the call over to Howard Willard, Altria's Executive Vice President and CFO, who will discuss Altria's business segment results in more detail."

Good morning. Third quarter reported operating companies income in the cigarette segment, decreased 0.8% to $1.5 billion primarily due to lower shipment volume as the trade depleted inventory build in the first half of the year and higher FDA user fees, partially offset by higher list prices and lower restructuring costs. When adjusted for restructuring costs, third quarter operating companies income decreased 2.4% to $1.5 billion. 
In the third quarter, adjusted operating companies income margins increased 1.5 percentage points to 41.7% and were higher than those of our principal competitors. Reported operating companies income for the first 9 months increased 4.5% to $4.4 billion primarily due to higher list prices and lower restructuring costs partially offset by lower shipment volume, higher FDA user fees and the $36 million charge for the Scott case.
Adjusted operating companies income for the first 9 months, which is calculated excluding restructuring costs but including the Scott case charge, grew 2.2%. Our cigarette segment's operating companies income margins for the first 9 months increased 1.1 percentage points to 40.3%. For the first 9 months of 2011, PM U.S.A. grew its adjusted operating companies income per pack and adjusted operating companies income margins faster than its principal competitors.
PM U.S.A. and Marlboro's volume comparisons for the third quarter were impacted by trade inventory dynamics. PM U.S.A.'s reported domestic cigarette volume for the third quarter declined 9% primarily due to trade inventory reductions and retail share losses. For the first 9 months of 2011, PM U.S.A.'s volume declined 5.4%. When adjusted primarily for trade inventories, PM U.S.A. estimates that its volume declined approximately 5% for both time periods. The total cigarette category volume was estimated to be down approximately 3.5% for both the third quarter and first 9 months of this year.
Through the first 9 months of the year, PM U.S.A. has delivered solid adjusted operating companies income growth and increased its adjusting operating income margins while retaining some of the strong share gains achieved last year for Marlboro. In the smokeless products segment, reported operating companies income increased 16.7% for the third quarter to $245 million and 12.6% to $660 million for the first 9 months due primarily to higher pricing and lower SG&A costs. When adjusted for restructuring and UST acquisition-related costs, operating companies income increased 15.5% to $246 million for the third quarter and 10.1% to $664 million for the first 9 months. Adjusted operating companies income margins for both the third quarter and the first 9 months increased 3.1 percentage points.
Total smokeless products shipment volume declined 2/10 of a percent for the third quarter and 1.2% for the first 9 months as shipment declines in other portfolio brands, including Marlboro Snus, were partially offset by volume growth for Copenhagen and Skoal. Marlboro Snus volume was negatively impacted by lower levels of promotional activity compared to last year's national expansion, and the shift in mix with packages with 6 pouches to tins with 15 pouches.
After adjusting for trade inventories, USSTC and PM U.S.A.'s combined smokeless segment volume was estimated to be up approximately 5% and 4%, respectively, for the third quarter and first 9 months of 2011. USSTC and PM U.S.A. believe that total smokeless category volume grew by approximately 5% for the first 9 months. Copenhagen and Skoal's combined volume grew 6.8%, and their combined retail share grew 1.4 share points in the third quarter. Copenhagen continue to deliver strong volume and share results supported by recent product introductions, including Copenhagen Wintergreen pouches. 
Skoal grew its volume for the third quarter as it benefited from new products introduced earlier this year which were partially offset by the delisting of 7 SKUs in the second quarter. Skoal's third quarter share, retail share, declined 3/10 of a share point sequentially due impart of the impact of the delisting of the 7 SKUs. We are encouraged by Skoal's quarterly retail share performance which has been relatively stable since the fourth quarter of 2010, despite the impact of the SKU reductions. Overall, USSTC has delivered strong financial results in the smokeless products segment so far this year. Copenhagen continues to deliver strong results and Skoal continues to transition as it benefits from brand building initiatives and new product introductions such as Skoal X-tra, while streamlining its SKUs. 
In the cigars segment, Middleton increased its third quarter reported and adjusted operating companies income by 27.9% to $55 million. While the cigars segment adjusted operating companies income was down 15.6% to $124 million for the first 9 months, Middleton's results have shown sequential improvement since the first quarter of 2011. Adjusted operating companies margin increased 2.7 percentage points to 50.5% for the third quarter. Margin stability in the second and third quarters has given Middleton an adjusted operating companies margin of 45.9% for the first 9 months of 2011. Middleton cigar volumes increased 3.7% for the quarter and 1.8% for the first 9 months. Middleton's third quarter cigar volumes benefited from new product introductions and increases in trade inventories. 
Black & Mild's retail share declined half a share point, 29.2% for the third quarter, but was up 4/10 of a share point for the first 9 months of this year and sequentially versus the second quarter of 2011. The brand's retail share performance so far this year has benefited from brand building initiatives and new product introductions, including the launch of untipped cigarillos in both Classic and Sweets blends. In the fourth quarter, Middleton plans to nationally introduce an untipped version of Black & Mild Wine, which along with Black & Mild Sweets and Classic, will be available in a new Aroma Wrap foil pouch.
In the Wine segment, Ste. Michelle's reported operating companies income increased 91.7% to $23 million for the third quarter and 74.2% to $54 million for the first 9 months. Adjusted operating companies income increased 41.2% to $24 million for the third quarter and 26.1% to $58 million for the first 9 months. Adjusted operating companies income margins increased 2.2 percentage points to 18.9% for the quarter and 1.7 percentage points to 17.3% for the first 9 months. Wine shipment volume increased 19.7% for the third quarter and 8.9% in the first 9 months. These strong business results reflects Ste. Michelle's focus on premium higher-margin products.
The financial services segment's third quarter reported operating companies income was $83 million, an increase of $56 million primarily due to a decrease in the allowance for losses and higher gains on asset sales. PMCC assesses the adequacy of its allowance for losses relative to the credit risk of its leasing portfolio on an ongoing basis. For the third quarter, PMCC decreased its allowance for losses based on management's assessment of the credit quality of its leasing portfolio including reductions in exposure to below investment grade lessees, resulting in $35 million of additional operating companies income for the third quarter and first 9 months. The allowance for losses at the end of the third quarter was $167 million versus $202 million at the end of the second quarter of 2011.
Altria also delivered value to shareholders by returning cash to them through dividends and share repurchases. The company paid almost $800 million in dividends in the third quarter and $2.4 billion in the first 9 months, reflecting our objective of returning 80% of adjusted diluted EPS to shareholders in the form of dividends. Altria completed its previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program in the third quarter by repurchasing $14.8 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $25.93 for a total cost of $384 million. For the total program, Altria repurchased $37.6 million at an average price of $26.62.
Mike and I will now be happy to take your questions. While the calls are compiled, let me cover a few housekeeping items. Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest effective priced cigarette was 36% for the third quarter. Marlboro's net pack price in the quarter was $5.74, while the lowest effective priced cigarette was $4.22. The cigarette discount categories third quarter retail share was 27.9%. The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax at the end of the third quarter was $1.37 per pack. 
Copenhagen's third quarter retail price was $4.23, and its price gap versus the leading discount brand was approximately 43% in the quarter. CapEx was $35 million for the third quarter, and we anticipate that our 2011 full year CapEx will be approximately $125 million. And finally, depreciation and amortization was $63 million for the third quarter and Altria anticipates that its 2011 full year ongoing depreciation and amortization will be approximately $250 million. Operator, do we have any questions?"

So we didn't do anything unusual in the third quarter. We faced actually a tough comp in the quarter from several directions from a inventory point of view, from a market share point of view. Our market share in the third quarter a year ago was 42.6%, which was the record share for the year that we achieved in 2010. So when we look at it, we felt like we kept in line with what we thought was the goal here which was to maximize income. But then to make sure that we're maintaining some modest momentum on this brand over time, and so I wouldn't get too caught up with the particular share result in the quarter, it's a function of a lot of things. If you look at Marlboro's share over the last few years, what you'd see is that there's about 1.5 share point deviation spread that the brand's operated in. And I think that when we get inside the numbers, what we see is that it's pretty much related to promotion-sensitive consumers. Every brand has a percentage of their makeup in promotion-sensitive consumers. 
Marlboro's level of that is lower than most because it has a very high brand loyalty and the brand loyalty has maintained itself, even as we've gone through some tough economic times. But competitive activity, as well as our own level of promotion spending does have an influence on this promotion-sensitive group, so we see some share deviation up and down that takes place based on those variables. And that's what you got going on, and you've had it going on this year as we faced the record share level last year where we had a lot of activity related to the launch of our Special Blend lineup. So I couldn't tell you there was anything exceptional there. We did see Marlboro's price go up relative to primary competitive brands during the quarter following pricing activity at the very beginning of the quarter at retail. And so that has some, I think, short-term impact. But gaps for Marlboro stayed in the range they've been in for the previous time since the FET increase, which is the mid-30s, we haven't seen much change there. That's relative to the lowest-priced products. There was some gap expansion versus some of the other premium brands during the quarter."

Are you seeing growth in, if we can call it sort of the deep discount category, is there any sort of noticeable change there? And then I would also like to talk about maybe a shift in some other categories, whether it be roll-your-own or little cigars?

The discount business has modulated in a range in the mid to high '20s. Marlboro has modulated in a range as I described and you'll see that in some other brands, particularly premium brands. In the discount segment, you've seen some consolidation within the segment though, and that was primarily driven by Pall Mall. You see a few other brands that share shifts around 2 within the discount segment. But all of that has actually behaved in a pretty stable way. 
Now I think what you're referring to are things like roll-your-own small cigars at one time played a role in terms of some interaction with the cigarette business down at the bottom. You see some of that going on. That's actually not a new thing. It ebbs and flows, sometimes the particular product that becomes a focal point is new. But for the shopper that's looking for the very cheapest thing that they can find in the smokable segment, there's always something that is moving around in that regard. And it does have some nominal impact, but I wouldn't say that recently there's been any significant impact on the overall category related to that kind of activity. We don't play there, so we really don't participate at the lowest price arena in the categories. So this does not have much of an impact on our business, but it can have some impact on I think overall discount segment at the very bottom of the segment, where you have shoppers that are looking for the very lowest-priced products that they can find."

And again, I'd point out that there is a certain portion of the brand. In Marlboro's case, it's about 10% of the brand that is what we call alternate purchasers there. 90% of that franchise is made up of consumers that say that they buy the brand 100% of the time, and that has remained pretty constant. So among these alternate purchase group, you do see activity with these people that's stimulated by promotion. And in a bad economic environment, you'd see more switching among that group because they're shopping for deals among a group of brands that they qualify as acceptable to them. So when we look at it, it's really a matter of how much money do you want to spend at any point in time relative to that group because you know in some ways you're renting share. 
And so, we look at that regularly and we make decisions about what we think is appropriate in balancing our objective to maximize profit while we maintain some modest momentum on the brand. But we just don't look at share as the way we understand the health of the brand. We look at other underlying factors that actually are more important to understanding the health of the brand. And those factors remain very strong for Marlboro. 
So we monitor all of that on a regular basis. But like I say, these kinds of deviations we've seen over the past few years as we've been in a tough economy, it's not in fact the best economic environment to really try and grow share because of the difficult circumstances. Some consumers are in. So you want to make sure that you're maintaining your equity strength, doing sensible things to build that equity and at the same time, being involved in the promotion activity that is always going to be in any category to a reasonable level, but understanding that at the end of day, the objective with the franchise is to try to make money with it. So I would say we're pretty comfortable with where we are, and we're simply managing this franchise the way we think is best for its long-term benefit to the company."

It's the trends that you're trying to derive as you look at these panels is why I always kind of encourage people not to get too caught up with quarters. You really have to look at the stuff over a longer period of time to make really good use out of it. But relative to what you're referring to, there was some significant competitive volume that was being shipped through channels that are not measured by these types of panels. And with the change of the enforcement in New York, that volume which was not tax paid, volume moved. Best that we can tell it moved down to some lower tax jurisdiction states, and is being picked up now on these panels. The best we can approximate, David, is it had a negative -- about a negative 2/10 of a share point effect on Marlboro. That doesn't mean that, that's a volume change. It just simply means that volume that was out there, not these panels, moved into the panels. And so from our perspective, it doesn't really have any bearing on the way we look at the business, but it does have a nominal effect on the numbers but not the trends."

Look, this is the year where we really have worked, kind of reconfigured the Skoal franchise to get it properly positioned. To get the SKUs rationalized and to get the product offering right, so that it's relevant to the market as it exists today. And we're still in the midst of that, although I think that what we've seen is the brand stabilized over the last 4 quarters. It was declining. We're still working against a base where there are a number of SKUs. They're in the base that we have since discontinued. And we've launched some new SKUs that we think better position the brand, and they're building and offsetting some of that loss. So we have to lap all of that before we really understand where we are with the Skoal brand. But actually we're pretty pleased it stabilized and it looks like what we've put into place is beginning to perform properly. And hopefully, what we'll see once we kind of get past this period of our reconstructing the brand, we'll see some steady growth. I think it's important to point out though that Skoal doesn't operate a vacuum, it exists in the category with other brands. One of which is Copenhagen, and Copenhagen is showing really strong growth. And so, Skoal has to compete with that and we're not quite as far along with Skoal as we are with Copenhagen. So I think that does have a bearing on the numbers as well. But combined, Skoal and Copenhagen are doing quite nicely."

Since the April 2009 FET, you've seen some pretty substantial declines in overall industry cigarette volume. Albeit they've been consistent with historical price elasticity, nonetheless, there's pretty significant tax increase and so we had a significant impact on volume. And as we've said all along, one of the things that you're going to have to do in this business is as volume declines and that business you have to takeout cigarette-related infrastructure cost, in order to manage the business properly, you can't carry infrastructure for a business that was originally designed for a bigger business. You have to continue to shrink it as the overall business shrinks. And so that's all that's going on. In the current year, we've seen a little bit of moderation of the decline rate. Looks like it's running about 3.5% these days. Nonetheless, it's still a significant decline rate for the cigarette category.
