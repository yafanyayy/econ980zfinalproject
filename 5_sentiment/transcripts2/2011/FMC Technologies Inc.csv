Welcome to our fourth quarter 2010 conference call. With me today are Bill Schumann, our CFO; John Gremp, our President and COO; and Bob Potter, our Executive Vice President. First, I will share with you some highlights from the quarter and",791,"Good morning. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2010 conference call. With me today are Bill Schumann, our CFO; John Gremp, our President and COO; and Bob Potter, our Executive Vice President. First, I will share with you some highlights from the quarter and the year. Bill will then provide you with the details on our financial performance and our outlook for 2011. Finally, we'll open up the call for your questions.
I'm pleased to say we had another strong quarter and finished the year with record results. Our fourth quarter earnings per share were $0.82, including a benefit of $0.13 from some tax items. We earned $3.06 for the full year. Our full year EPS was another all-time high and represented our eighth consecutive year of earnings growth since our IPO. 
In the quarter, the total company backlog rose 14% to $4.2 billion. This increase was led by $1.1 billion in subsea orders, including orders for 39 subsea trees. For 2010, our total company backlog increased 64%. This was the first full year increase since 2007. Our subsea backlog grew for the fourth consecutive quarter and now stands at $3.6 billion after starting the year at $2.0 billion. Our 2010 subsea inbound of $4.1 billion was a record for that business. It was driven by solid fundamentals in the Deepwater market such as favorable oil prices, rig fleet expansion, capital spending increases and international growth. The price of oil remained at a level that has been conducive to Deepwater economics. This strength is in the oil prices continued into 2011 and does not appear to be showing any signs of weakness.
Expansion of the Deepwater rig fleet is a critical enabler for our customers to expand our capacity to complete more subsea wells. After growing 27% since 2007, the fleet is expected to grow another 20% over the next two years. The reported 2011 capital spending estimates for the major oil companies shows an increase of almost 20%, driven in large part by Deepwater activity. Typically, the actual capital spending exceeds these early industry estimates.
The Deepwater market continues to grow internationally. In 2010, we received orders for projects offshore: Brazil, Nigeria, Angola, Russia, China and Norway. In 2011, we have potential subsea awards in all those locations, and in addition, there are other growth areas such as Australia where we expect some long-awaited offshore gas projects to be awarded. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, we've been executing our pre-moratorium backlog and have received a few new post-Macondo orders. However, the base will remain a risk for us until the permitting issues a resolve. The Gulf of Mexico was approximately 11% of our total revenue in 2010, and we expect that it will be an even lower percentage in 2011. Fortunately for us, the Gulf of Mexico region is being largely offset by the combined continued strength that I just mentioned in the large growing international markets. 
Overall, we believe the subsea market will remain robust. As we have suggested last quarter, we think that our 2011 subsea orders could equal the record we set in 2010. Our confidence is based on the market fundamentals, our strong customer alliances and on our technology leadership in areas like subsea processing.
Turning to our Surface Wellhead business, we had a strong fourth quarter for orders and sales. In fact, our Surface Wellhead orders in the fourth quarter were at the highest level since before the industry downturn. 
Shifting to our Energy Processing businesses, the ongoing strength in the North American land rig count combined with the associated pressure pumping activity in both liquids and gas shale plays continue to drive growth in our Fluid Control business. In fact, we had record Fluid Control revenue in the quarter and its backlog reached another all-time high. Our Fluid Control business has recovered substantially since the downturn in the industry. Sales in 2010 for Fluid Control were up 70% from 2009 and orders more than doubled. One of the key factors has been the successful market penetration of our Well Service Pump. After receiving almost no pump orders during the 2009 industry downturn, we booked record pump orders in 2010, and the near-term outlook for these pumps and other Fluid Control products remains very positive.
As for the other Energy Processing businesses, each one had sequential order growth in the fourth quarter, and we expect full year order growth in all these businesses for 2011. 
So let me just say in summary, we had a record year for earnings in subsea orders. The market fundamentals for Deepwater continue to be very, very positive for subsea, and we experienced record performance from our Fluid Control business. So let me now turn the call over to Bill Schumann."
972117,117936077,103039,"FMC Technologies, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 15, 2011",2011-02-15,"Earnings Calls","FMC Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Peter. Energy Production sales for the fourth quarter were $875 million, down 11% from last year but up 14% sequentially. The decrease from the prior year was mainly driven by a mix of early-stage subsea projects in our backlog relative to a year",984,"Thanks, Peter. Energy Production sales for the fourth quarter were $875 million, down 11% from last year but up 14% sequentially. The decrease from the prior year was mainly driven by a mix of early-stage subsea projects in our backlog relative to a year ago. In contrast, the sequential increase is an indication that the rate of execution on subsea projects and backlog is increasing. 
Energy Production generated operating profit of $105 million in the quarter, down 20% from the prior year quarter, mainly due to lower subsea volume. Margins were 12% in the quarter and just under 15% for the full year. For 2011, we expect that the margin to be in the range of 12% to 13% with some fluctuation from quarter-to-quarter depending on timing and the effectiveness of our project execution. 
Inbound orders in Energy Production were $1.3 billion in the quarter, including subsea orders of $1.1 billion. This profit total subsea order amount for the year to a record $4.1 billion. We ended the year with a backlog of $3.9 billion dollars, including subsea backlog of $3.6 billion. Not included in these amounts were the recently announced Total Jerry, Statoil, G grid awards, which will all be booked in the first quarter of 2011.
Turning to Energy Processing, sales were $223 million, up 26% from the year-ago quarter. The increase was driven by our Fluid Control business led by our WECO/Chiksan Flowline Products and our Well Service Pumps as Peter described. Their sales together set a record due to continued strength of the North American pressure pumping activity. While the other Energy Processing businesses had lower sales in the quarter compared to last year, they were up 18% from the third quarter and all of them contributed to that increase. Energy Processing generated record operating profit of $43 million, more than double the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily the result of our record volume in Fluid Control. The fourth quarter margin of 19.5% was also a new record. In 2011, we expect the full year margin for this segment to be in a range of 17% to 18%. I would caution, however, that our Fluid Control business is subject to the volatility of the North American lane rig count and the pressure pumping market, and that can drive significant changes in this segment margin. 
Total inbound orders for Energy Processing reached an all-time high of $256 million, up 48% from last year's fourth quarter. The improvement was again driven by Fluid Control but was aided by order strength in Measurement Solutions also. Backlog ended the quarter at $296 million.
Now for the corporate items. Corporate expense in the quarter was $10.9 million. Other expense net was $3 million. This was less than we had anticipated due mainly to lower LIFO expenses. Our fourth quarter tax rate of 24.7% was impacted by a number of items, but we don't expect to repeat at least with the same impact as we experienced in the past quarter. The quarter included the resolution of an IRS tax appeal as previously announced; other changes in reserves for uncertain tax positions. Actions we took in the quarter related to changes in U.S. tax law that increased our tax expense; and the late receipt of confirmation for a tax incentive that we had anticipated receiving before year end. Removing these items from EPS would reduce earnings per share by $0.13 to $0.69 for the quarter.
Adjusting for these items still leaves us with a 36.3% tax rate in the quarter, which was still higher than anticipated due to the higher U.S. taxes on under distributed foreign earnings. For the full year 2010, the tax rate was 32.7% after adjusting for those special items. We did receive the letter of confirmation for the tax incentives in January. It is retroactive to 2009 but the tax benefit will be recorded in the first quarter of 2011. Our guidance for 2011 tax rate is at an annual rate of 30% to 32%, which excludes the first quarter tax incentive benefit of $7 million.
We ramped up our capital spending this quarter to $47 million, bringing the full year capital spending to $112 million. This ramp-up will continue into to this year as we expect capital spending in 2011 to be in excess of $200 million. Facility improvements planned for Brazil and Asia make up a large portion of this increase, along with the expansion of our Fluid Control facilities in North America. 
At the end of the quarter, we had net debt position of $48 million. This was comprised of $315 million of cash and $363 million of debt. We averaged $121.7 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter due to a combination of the ramp-up in capital spending, an increase in pension funding and a desire to keep our net debt to the current level, we did not repurchase any shares in the quarter.
Turning to the overall outlook for 2011. We expect another strong year in subsea orders. As Peter mentioned, we could potentially reach the same record amount of orders as 2010, driving our subsea backlog to a record level. However, the situation in the Gulf presents a risk to that level of orders. On the top line, we expect improvement in all of our businesses even in Fluid Control, where we're coming off a record year in sales. Subsea and Surface Wellhead sales could also reach all-time highs. The Measurement Solutions and loading system sales will rebound and start to approach the levels they saw in 2008. The 2011 margins in Production will be in a range of 12% to 13%. In Processing, the 2011 margins will be in line with the 2010 average of 17% to 18%. And again, for earnings, our 2011 guidance for diluted EPS is $3.20 to $3.40 per share. Operator, you may now open up the call for questions."

Measurement and Loading Systems had an outstanding fourth quarter, and while we expect them to improve their full year performance in 2011, it's not going to be as strong as their fourth quarter performance. So we anticipate that the Fluid business in 2011 will grow kind of in-line with the rig count, and that the Loading and Measurement will improve their performance actually probably at the top line a little bit better than our Fluid Control business, and that will kind of dilute the margins a little bit. But in absolute terms, we're going to deliver increased earnings in the Energy Processing business in 2011."

On the Fluid Control side, we have a major capital expansion going on to increase our capacity for Well Service Pumps as well as our Flowline products. And that's in our existing facilities, Texas, and that adds machine tools, as well as floor space and that sort of stuff. And then in the Far East, to continue to drive some of our low-cost items in sourcing, we are expanding in both Singapore and Malaysia in terms of our facilities there to continue to drive down our low-cost source strategy work. I think we've talked about before we've taken a lot of standard products that maybe we have made in two or three different plants and we moved all that one to one central location. And that certainly has improved our margin over time in the business. So we continue to invest there.

It's something we want to do for a long time, and it really started with BC Tan in Brazil where that was a direct award to us, and I think Shell clearly saw the benefit of moving the exclusive relationship beyond the Gulf of Mexico, so it was just natural that the enterprise frame agreement was the next logical step for our two companies. What it means in business is where its tendering is not required outside of our production sharing contract environment, we would expect that business to be direct awarded to us. So that's clearly a positive because we won't be competing for some of that business.

We've put about $39 million into our combination of U.S. and foreign pension plans, and we had a working capital build in the quarter also. So we kind of maintained our debt level at about the current rate. We ended the year at 48, but our cash allocation has not changed. We want to support the growth of the business. That's our first priority. Second priority is acquisitions. And our third priority, if we have any cash left over, is repurchase of stock. We repurchased I think $168 million in 2010. We kind of expect a similar level of stock repurchase and maybe a little bit higher actually in 2011, and that will have the result in reduction of shares outstanding. The shares outstanding impact on the earnings guidance really isn't significant if you go through the arithmetic though."

So that's what we would see in subsea pricing start to improve towards the end of this year. Now on the cost side, nickel prices have gone up and nickels are an important component on our subsea equipment. Steel prices have gone up near term, but they're actually expected to be flat for the year as the construction industry being down had a negative impact on steel. So we don't see big increases in steel prices for the full year. We have seen increase the nickel, but we've been able to lock in nickel prices last year for most of this year.

Welcome to our fourth quarter 2010 conference call. With me today are Bill Schumann, our CFO; John Gremp, our President and COO; and Bob Potter, our Executive Vice President. First, I will share with you some highlights from the quarter and",790,"Good morning. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2010 conference call. With me today are Bill Schumann, our CFO; John Gremp, our President and COO; and Bob Potter, our Executive Vice President. First, I will share with you some highlights from the quarter and the year. Bill will then provide you with the details on our financial performance and our outlook for 2011. Finally, we'll open up the call for your questions.
I'm pleased to say we had another strong quarter and finished the year with record results. Our fourth quarter earnings per share were $0.82, including a benefit of $0.13 from some tax items. We earned $3.06 for the full year. Our full year EPS was another all-time high and represented our eighth consecutive year of earnings growth since our IPO. 
In the quarter, the total company backlog rose 14% to $4.2 billion. This increase was led by $1.1 billion in subsea orders, including orders for 39 subsea trees. For 2010, our total company backlog increased 64%. This was the first full year increase since 2007. Our subsea backlog grew for the fourth consecutive quarter and now stands at $3.6 billion after starting the year at $2.0 billion. Our 2010 subsea inbound of $4.1 billion was a record for that business. 
It was driven by solid fundamentals in the deepwater market, such as favorable oil prices, rig fleet expansion, capital spending increases and international growth. The price of oil remained at a level that has been conducive to Deepwater economics. This strength in the oil prices continued into 2011 and does not appear to be showing any signs of weakness.
Expansion of the deepwater rig fleet is a critical enabler for our customers to expand our capacity to complete more subsea wells. After growing 27% since 2007, the fleet is expected to grow another 20% over the next two years. The reported 2011 capital spending estimates for the major oil companies shows an increase of almost 20%, driven in large part by deepwater activity. Typically, the actual capital spending exceeds these early industry estimates.
The deepwater market continues to grow internationally. In 2010, we received orders for projects offshore: Brazil, Nigeria, Angola, Russia, China and Norway. In 2011, we have potential subsea awards in all those locations, and in addition, there are other growth areas, such as Australia where we expect some long-awaited offshore gas projects to be awarded. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, we've been executing our pre-moratorium backlog and have received a few new post-Macondo orders. However, the basin will remain a risk for us until the permitting issues a resolve. The Gulf of Mexico was approximately 11% of our total revenue in 2010, and we expect that it will be an even lower percentage in 2011. Fortunately for us, the Gulf of Mexico region is being largely offset by the combined continued strength that I just mentioned in the large growing international markets. 
Overall, we believe the subsea market will remain robust. As we have suggested last quarter, we think that our 2011 subsea orders could equal the record we set in 2010. Our confidence is based on the market fundamentals, our strong customer alliances and on our technology leadership in areas like subsea processing.
Turning to our Surface Wellhead business, we had a strong fourth quarter for orders and sales. In fact, our Surface Wellhead orders in the fourth quarter were at the highest level since before the industry downturn. 
Shifting to our Energy Processing businesses, the ongoing strength in the North American land rig count combined with the associated pressure pumping activity in both liquids and gas shale plays continue to drive growth in our Fluid Control business. In fact, we had record Fluid Control revenue in the quarter and its backlog reached another all-time high. Our Fluid Control business has recovered substantially since the downturn in the industry. Sales in 2010 for Fluid Control were up 70% from 2009 and orders more than doubled. 
One of the key factors has been the successful market penetration of our Well Service Pump. After receiving almost no pump orders during the 2009 industry downturn, we booked record pump orders in 2010, and the near-term outlook for these pumps and other Fluid Control products remains very positive.
As for the other Energy Processing businesses, each one had sequential order growth in the fourth quarter, and we expect full year order growth in all these businesses for 2011. 
So let me just say in summary, we had a record year for earnings in subsea orders. The market fundamentals for Deepwater continue to be very, very positive for subsea, and we experienced record performance from our Fluid Control business. So let me now turn the call over to Bill Schumann."
972117,117936077,103157,"FMC Technologies, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 15, 2011",2011-02-15,"Earnings Calls","FMC Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Peter. Energy Production sales for the fourth quarter were $875 million, down 11% from last year but up 14% sequentially. The decrease from the prior year was mainly driven by a mix of early-stage subsea projects in our backlog relative to a year",986,"Thanks, Peter. Energy Production sales for the fourth quarter were $875 million, down 11% from last year but up 14% sequentially. The decrease from the prior year was mainly driven by a mix of early-stage subsea projects in our backlog relative to a year ago. In contrast, the sequential increase is an indication that the rate of execution on subsea projects and backlog is increasing. 
Energy Production generated operating profit of $105 million in the quarter, down 20% from the prior year quarter, mainly due to lower subsea volume. Margins were 12% in the quarter and just under 15% for the full year. For 2011, we expect that the margin to be in the range of 12% to 13% with some fluctuation from quarter-to-quarter depending on timing and the effectiveness of our project execution. 
Inbound orders in Energy Production were $1.3 billion in the quarter, including subsea orders of $1.1 billion. This profit total subsea order amount for the year to a record $4.1 billion. We ended the year with a backlog of $3.9 billion dollars, including subsea backlog of $3.6 billion. Not included in these amounts were the recently announced Total GirRI, Statoil, Gygrid [indiscernible] 21:22) awards, which will all be booked in the first quarter of 2011.
Turning to Energy Processing. Sales were $223 million, up 26% from the year-ago quarter. The increase was driven by our Fluid Control business led by our WECO/Chiksan flowline Products and our Well Service Pumps as Peter described. Their sales together set a record due to continued strength of the North American pressure pumping activity. While the other Energy Processing businesses had lower sales in the quarter compared to last year, they were up 18% from the third quarter and all of them contributed to that increase. 
Energy Processing generated record operating profit of $43 million, more than double the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily the result of our record volume in Fluid Control. The fourth quarter margin of 19.5% was also a new record. In 2011, we expect the full year margin for the segment to be in a range of 17% to 18%. I would caution, however, that our Fluid Control business is subject to the volatility of the North American lane rig count and the pressure pumping market, and that can drive significant changes in this segment margin. 
Total inbound orders for Energy Processing reached an all-time high of $256 million, up 48% from last year's fourth quarter. The improvement was again driven by Fluid Control but was aided by order strength in Measurement Solutions also. Backlog ended the quarter at $296 million.
Now for the corporate items. Corporate expense in the quarter was $10.9 million. Other expense net was $3 million. This was less than we had anticipated due mainly to lower LIFO expenses. Our fourth quarter tax rate of 24.7% was impacted by a number of items that we don't expect to repeat at least with the same impact as we experienced in the past quarter:  The quarter included the resolution of an IRS tax appeal as previously announced; other changes in reserves for uncertain tax positions; actions we took in the quarter related to changes in U.S. tax law that increased our tax expense; and the late receipt of confirmation for a tax incentive that we had anticipated receiving before year end. Removing these items from EPS would reduce earnings per share by $0.13 to $0.69 for the quarter.
Adjusting for these items still leaves us with a 36.3% tax rate in the quarter, which was still higher than anticipated due to the higher U.S. taxes on undistributed foreign earnings. For the full year 2010, the tax rate was 32.7% after adjusting for those special items. We did receive the letter of confirmation for the tax incentives in January. It is retroactive to 2009 but the tax benefit will be recorded in the first quarter of 2011. Our guidance for 2011 tax rate is at an annual rate of 30% to 32%, which excludes the first quarter tax incentive benefit of $7 million.
We ramped up our capital spending this quarter to $47 million, bringing the full year capital spending to $112 million. This ramp up will continue into to this year as we expect capital spending in 2011 to be in excess of $200 million. Facility improvements planned for Brazil and Asia make up a large portion of this increase, along with the expansion of our Fluid Control facilities in North America. 
At the end of the quarter, we had net debt position of $48 million. This was comprised of $315 million of cash and $363 million of debt. We averaged $121.7 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter due to a combination of the ramp up in capital spending, an increase in pension funding and a desire to keep our net debt near the current level, we did not repurchase any shares in the quarter.
Turning to the overall outlook for 2011. We expect another strong year in subsea orders. As Peter mentioned, we could potentially reach the same record amount of orders as 2010, driving our subsea backlog to a record level. However, the situation in the Gulf presents a risk to that level of orders. On the top line, we expect improvement in all of our businesses even in Fluid Control, where we're coming off a record year in sales. 
Subsea and Surface Wellhead sales could also reach all-time highs. The Measurement Solutions and loading system sales will rebound and start to approach the levels they saw in 2008. The 2011 margins in production will be in a range of 12% to 13%. In Processing, the 2011 margins will be in line with the 2010 average of 17% to 18%. And again, for earnings, our 2011 guidance for diluted EPS is $3.20 to $3.40 per share. Operator, you may now open up the call for questions."

So we anticipate that the Fluid business in 2011 will grow kind of in line with the rig count, and that the Loading and Measurement will improve their performance actually probably at the top line a little bit better than our Fluid Control business, and that will kind of dilute the margins a little bit. But in absolute terms, we're going to deliver increased earnings in the Energy Processing business in 2011."

We have been operating in Brazil since 1956 and have a great relationship with Petrobras, but they have a lot of particularly -- pre-salt a lot of new technology issues. So that's some capital going there. We're also reconfiguring our facility in Brazil to be a little bit more efficient particularly on the subsea manifold arena. So we're using some capital there. On the Fluid Control side, we have a major capital expansion going on to increase our capacity for Well Service Pumps as well as our Flowline products. And that's in our existing facilities in Stephenville, Texas, and that adds machine tools, as well as floor space and that sort of stuff. And then in the Far East, to continue to drive some of our low-cost items and sourcing, we are expanding in both Singapore and Malaysia in terms of our facilities there to continue to drive down our low-cost source strategy work. I think we've talked about before we've taken a lot of standard products that maybe we have made in two or three different plants and we moved all that to one central location. And that certainly has improved our margin over time in the business. So we continue to invest there. And there may be some additional offshore tooling like our Light Well Intervention Systems and service tools that we invest. So that's the bulk of it."

Now some of them are strong or have a stronger probability of actually happening rather than others, but that's as strong as we've seen it. There were two subsea processing awards last year. There's a potential for three to four this year. Some of them a little later this year so they could slip into 2012, but the list of names processing projects is as healthy as we've seen plus the number of feed studies, for us anyway, is almost doubled. So I think there's a trend, and there's some momentum gaining in terms of the operators being interested in processing. So I'd say it's very healthy, not the exact timing of these projects. As I said, some are stronger than others, but it's very encouraging."

And yes, I think the operators that have major positions, I think they're assuming it's kind of get worked out, and therefore, let's not lose one or two years on schedule and let's be smart here and plan ahead. And so like Shell, we're getting orders in advance in anticipation that the moratorium gets lifted and then go back to drilling. The customers, a bit more cautious. We had a Phase II with Petrobras and their Cascade project in the Gulf of Mexico that they were just about to let us, give us that award just before the Macondo situation. It kind of pulled back, so now we're going to wait and see what happens. So it's still kind of a mixed bag from that standpoint, but fortunately, we've diversified our portfolio and shifted quite a bit of our use of resources on to International projects. And so we're weathering through the situation quite well and anticipate that the Gulf of Mexico comes back and that we're going to need the oil and gas produced from Deepwater."

Now on the cost side, nickel prices have gone up and nickels are an important component in our subsea equipment. Steel prices have gone up near term, but they're actually expected to be flat for the year as the construction industry being down had a negative impact on steel.

Welcome to our fourth quarter 2010 conference call. With me today are Bill Schumann, our CFO; John Gremp, our President and COO; and Bob Potter, our Executive Vice President. First, I will share with you some highlights from the quarter and",790,"Good morning. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2010 conference call. With me today are Bill Schumann, our CFO; John Gremp, our President and COO; and Bob Potter, our Executive Vice President. First, I will share with you some highlights from the quarter and the year. Bill will then provide you with the details on our financial performance and our outlook for 2011. Finally, we'll open up the call for your questions.
I'm pleased to say we had another strong quarter and finished the year with record results. Our fourth quarter earnings per share were $0.82, including a benefit of $0.13 from some tax items. We earned $3.06 for the full year. Our full year EPS was another all-time high and represented our eighth consecutive year of earnings growth since our IPO. 
In the quarter, the total company backlog rose 14% to $4.2 billion. This increase was led by $1.1 billion in subsea orders, including orders for 39 subsea trees. For 2010, our total company backlog increased 64%. This was the first full year increase since 2007. Our subsea backlog grew for the fourth consecutive quarter and now stands at $3.6 billion after starting the year at $2.0 billion. Our 2010 subsea inbound of $4.1 billion was a record for that business. 
It was driven by solid fundamentals in the deepwater market, such as favorable oil prices, rig fleet expansion, capital spending increases and international growth. The price of oil remained at a level that has been conducive to deepwater economics. This strength in the oil prices continued into 2011 and does not appear to be showing any signs of weakness.
Expansion of the deepwater rig fleet is a critical enabler for our customers to expand their capacity to complete more subsea wells. After growing 27% since 2007, the fleet is expected to grow another 20% over the next two years. The reported 2011 capital spending estimates for the major oil companies shows an increase of almost 20%, driven in large part by deepwater activity. Typically, the actual capital spending exceeds these early industry estimates.
The deepwater market continues to grow internationally. In 2010, we received orders for projects offshore: Brazil, Nigeria, Angola, Russia, China and Norway. In 2011, we have potential subsea awards in all those locations, and in addition, there are other growth areas, such as Australia where we expect some long-awaited offshore gas projects to be awarded. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, we've been executing our pre-moratorium backlog and have received a few new post-Macondo orders. However, the basin will remain a risk for us until the permitting issues are resolved. The Gulf of Mexico was approximately 11% of our total revenue in 2010, and we expect that it will be an even lower percentage in 2011. Fortunately for us, the Gulf of Mexico region has been largely offset by the combined continued strength that I just mentioned in the large growing international markets. 
Overall, we believe the subsea market will remain robust. As we have suggested last quarter, we think that our 2011 subsea orders could equal the record we set in 2010. Our confidence is based on the market fundamentals, our strong customer alliances and on our technology leadership in areas like subsea processing.
Turning to our Surface Wellhead business, we had a strong fourth quarter for orders and sales. In fact, our Surface Wellhead orders in the fourth quarter were at the highest level since before the industry downturn. 
Shifting to our Energy Processing businesses, the ongoing strength in the North American land rig count combined with the associated pressure pumping activity in both liquids and gas shale plays continue to drive growth in our Fluid Control business. In fact, we had record Fluid Control revenue in the quarter and its backlog reached another all-time high. Our Fluid Control business has recovered substantially since the downturn in the industry. Sales in 2010 for Fluid Control were up 70% from 2009 and orders more than doubled. 
One of the key factors has been the successful market penetration of our Well Service Pump. After receiving almost no pump orders during the 2009 industry downturn, we booked record pump orders in 2010, and the near-term outlook for these pumps and other Fluid Control products remains very positive.
As for the other Energy Processing businesses, each one had sequential order growth in the fourth quarter, and we expect full year order growth in all these businesses for 2011. 
So let me just say in summary, we had a record year for earnings in subsea orders. The market fundamentals for Deepwater continue to be very, very positive for subsea, and we experienced record performance from our Fluid Control business. So let me now turn the call over to Bill Schumann."
972117,117936077,103343,"FMC Technologies, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 15, 2011",2011-02-15,"Earnings Calls","FMC Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Peter. Energy Production sales for the fourth quarter were $875 million, down 11% from last year but up 14% sequentially. The decrease from the prior year was mainly driven by a mix of early-stage subsea projects in our backlog relative to a year",985,"Thanks, Peter. Energy Production sales for the fourth quarter were $875 million, down 11% from last year but up 14% sequentially. The decrease from the prior year was mainly driven by a mix of early-stage subsea projects in our backlog relative to a year ago. In contrast, the sequential increase is an indication that the rate of execution on subsea projects and backlog is increasing. 
Energy Production generated operating profit of $105 million in the quarter, down 20% from the prior year quarter, mainly due to lower subsea volume. Margins were 12% in the quarter and just under 15% for the full year. For 2011, we expect that the margin to be in a range of 12% to 13% with some fluctuation from quarter-to-quarter depending on timing and the effectiveness of our project execution. 
Inbound orders in Energy Production were $1.3 billion in the quarter, including subsea orders of $1.1 billion. This brought the total subsea order amount for the year to a record $4.1 billion. We ended the year with a backlog of $3.9 billion, including subsea backlog of $3.6 billion. Not included in these amounts were the recently announced Total, GirRI, Statoil, Gygrid, CNOOC Liuhua awards, which will all be booked in the first quarter of 2011.
Turning to Energy Processing. Sales were $223 million, up 26% from the year-ago quarter. The increase was driven by our Fluid Control business led by our WECO/Chiksan flowline Products and our Well Service Pumps as Peter described. Their sales together set a record due to the continued strength of the North American pressure pumping activity. While the other Energy Processing businesses had lower sales in the quarter compared to last year, they were up 18% from the third quarter and all of them contributed to that increase. 
Energy Processing generated record operating profit of $43 million, more than double the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily the result of our record volume in Fluid Control. The fourth quarter margin of 19.5% was also a new record. In 2011, we expect the full year margin for the segment to be in a range of 17% to 18%. I would caution, however, that our Fluid Control business is subject to the volatility of the North American lane rig count and the pressure pumping market, and that can drive significant changes in this segment margin. 
Total inbound orders for Energy Processing reached an all-time high of $256 million, up 48% from last year's fourth quarter. The improvement was again driven by Fluid Control but was aided by order strength in Measurement Solutions also. Backlog ended the quarter at $296 million.
Now for the corporate items. Corporate expense in the quarter was $10.9 million. Other expense net was $3 million. This was less than we had anticipated due mainly to lower LIFO expenses. Our fourth quarter tax rate of 24.7% was impacted by a number of items that we don't expect to repeat at least with the same impact as we experienced in the past quarter. The quarter included the resolution of an IRS tax appeal as previously announced; other changes in reserves for uncertain tax positions; actions we took in the quarter related to changes in U.S. tax law that increased our tax expense; and the late receipt of confirmation for a tax incentive that we had anticipated receiving before year end. Removing these items from EPS would reduce earnings per share by $0.13 to $0.69 for the quarter.
Adjusting for these items still leaves us with a 36.3% tax rate in the quarter, which was still higher than anticipated due to higher U.S. taxes on undistributed foreign earnings. For the full year 2010, the tax rate was 32.7% after adjusting for those special items. We did receive a letter of confirmation for the tax incentives in January. It is retroactive to 2009 but the tax benefit will be recorded in the first quarter of 2011. Our guidance for 2011 tax rate is at an annual rate of 30% to 32%, which excludes the first quarter tax incentive benefit of $7 million.
We ramped up our capital spending this quarter to $47 million, bringing the full year capital spending to $112 million. This ramp up will continue into this year as we expect capital spending in 2011 to be in excess of $200 million. Facility improvements planned for Brazil and Asia make up a large portion of this increase, along with the expansion of our Fluid Control facilities in North America. 
At the end of the quarter, we had net debt position of $48 million. This was comprised of $315 million of cash and $363 million of debt. We averaged $121.7 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter. Due to a combination of the ramp up in capital spending, an increase in pension funding and a desire to keep our net debt near the current level, we did not repurchase any shares in the quarter.
Turning to the overall outlook for 2011. We expect another strong year in subsea orders. As Peter mentioned, we could potentially reach the same record amount of orders as 2010, driving our subsea backlog to a record level. However, the situation in the Gulf presents a risk to that level of orders. On the top line, we expect improvement in all of our businesses even in Fluid Control, where we're coming off a record year in sales. 
Subsea and Surface Wellhead sales could also reach all-time highs. The Measurement Solutions and loading system sales will rebound and start to approach the levels they saw in 2008.

Measurement and Loading Systems had an outstanding fourth quarter, and while we expect them to improve their full year performance in 2011, it's not going to be as strong as their fourth quarter performance. So we anticipate that the Fluid business in 2011 will grow kind of in line with the rig count, and that the Loading and Measurement will improve their performance actually probably at the top line a little bit better than our Fluid Control business, and that will kind of dilute the margins a little bit.

On the Fluid Control side, we have a major capital expansion going on to increase our capacity for Well Service Pumps as well as our Flowline products. And that's in our existing facility in Stephenville, Texas, and that adds machine tools, as well as floor space and that sort of stuff. And then in the Far East, to continue to drive some of our low-cost items and sourcing, we are expanding in both Singapore and Malaysia in terms of our facilities there to continue to drive down our low-cost source strategy work. I think we've talked about before, we've taken a lot of standard products that maybe we had made in two or three different plants and we moved all that to one central location.

We're looking to reel those back in with the capacity expansions that we've got in process, which will be going on throughout this year. As it relates to the mix, we're still largely driven by the whole good pumps as our installed base grows. But to your point, the fluid cylinders, the fluid in aftermarket, which is the big component, is going to grow substantially as we get an installed base and the frac intensity continues to increase."

Clearly, Peter pointed out the fundamentals improving in subsea, and that's manifesting itself in the number of major projects over $100 million, which is -- the list of those projects is clearly larger than what we saw in 2010. We rebuilt our backlog in 2010. The other subsea suppliers can be expected to do the same thing in 2011. And I would think, like Bill said, towards the back end of 2011, we would expect pricing to improve as the tendering activity increases and everybody starts rebuilding their backlog. So that's what we would see in subsea pricing, start to improve towards the end of this year. Now on the cost side, nickel prices have gone up and nickel’s an important component in our subsea equipment. Steel prices have gone up near term, but they're actually expected to be flat for the year as the construction industry being down’s had a negative impact on steel. So we don't see big increases in steel prices for the full year. We have seen increases in nickel, but we've been able to lock in nickel prices last year for most of this year. So we don't see a real big impact, at least in the near term, on raw material prices. At least the price increases that we'll see, we think we can mitigate."

He has achieved an impressive list of accomplishments over his 40 years at FMC. During his 4 years as CEO, the market capitalization of the company has almost tripled. On behalf of all of the employees of the company, I thank Peter for his direction and contributions to our growth and success of the company.
Now let's focus on our results. Earnings for the quarter were $0.35 per diluted share that included a tax benefit of $0.03 that we disclosed previously in the fourth quarter call. We recorded $1.4 billion in orders for the first quarter, of which $940 million was for subsea systems that included 71 subsea trees.
Total company revenue was $1.1 billion. Subsea revenue for the quarter was $683 million, sequentially flat with the fourth quarter. Our first quarter subsea revenue performance reflects the early stages we are in with many of our subsea projects included over the past year. We still expect subsea sales to reach $3.3 billion for the full year.
Surface Wellhead revenue was up 5% from the first quarter of 2010 on strong North American activity, partially offset by lower international revenue caused by timing of shipments. Margins were lower than our full year guidance for energy production, but we still expect to achieve margins averaging 12% to 13% for the full year.
Fluid Control delivered record sales and earnings as the North America pressure pumping market continues to be strong. While results in the other Energy Processing businesses were flat with last year, orders were up, and backlog increased. For the total company, we anticipate the second half of the year to be stronger than the first half, driven primarily by subsea results. We continue to expect earnings to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.70 per diluted share. 
Looking at the overall economic environment, we have oil over $100 and uncertain economic recovery, unrest in North America and the Middle East, earthquakes in Japan, financial instability in Europe, hardly a normal economic environment. Yet the impact of these events in our business has been low, and the key reason is our subsea franchise is a long-cycle business. Our customers have a long-term focus based on demand forecast and the overall Deepwater economics driving their decisions. 
Deepwater reserves remain economical prices between $40 and $60 barrels per barrel as the technologies that we and others in the industry develop and deploy reduce costs and increase recovery rates. As a result of this, global capital spending of our customers remain strong and should continue.
Consistent with our comments during our last call, deep water drilling rigs continue to be ordered. During the first quarter of 2011 over 20 units by our count. The list of major subsea projects to be awarded over the next 12 to 15 months remains promising, but it is common and the timing is not always predictable. A number of major projects in team look as though they're being delayed from late 2011 into early 2012. However, even on these projects, the tender documents are out, and award processes is proceeding.
In line with the favorable long term view of the market, we inbounded $940 million in subsea orders during the quarter from a number of customers related to work in Brazil, Indonesia, Canada and Norway. It's important to note that the strong subsea inbound not include any major projects that exceeded $150 million and that we were confronted with largely dormant Gulf of Mexico market. 
Also in the quarter, we signed a global frame agreement with BP, 1 of the largest Deepwater operators in the world that we anticipate will add to our order flow. Although we're still uncertain about the drilling progress in the Gulf of Mexico, we're becoming more optimistic given that 11 drilling permits have been issued so far in 2011. While we have been successful rebuilding our subsea backlog since the downturn some of our competitors have yet to rebuild. And as a result, pricing will remain competitive. 
But as the major projects I mentioned earlier are awarded, we expect pricing to improve. We continue to be optimistic on the growth of subsea processing activity. A good example is the Congo project in Brazil, which we expect to be awarded this year. Petrobras is replacing an aging platform with a subsea processing facility.
Moving to our Energy Processing businesses. We had another strong quarter that exceeded last quarter's results. Fluid Control was higher than we expected as the North America pressure pumping market continues to point toward more sustainable growth. We've historically been cautious about the economics of gas drilling in North America and its impact on our Fluid Control business. But with more than 50% of the rigs drilling for either oil or plays with sizable liquid content, we have more confidence about the economic underpinnings of this market. As our expanded Fluid Control capacity comes online, we will better meet our customers' growing demands for our sought after pumps and treating iron and other new components such as our frac manifolds. 
In summary, first quarter finished with the largest subsea backlog in our company's history. Fluid Control delivered record results, and we continue to see good opportunities in Surface Wellhead and other Processing business. Bill will now take you through some of the financial details of the quarter."

Energy production sales for the first quarter were $856 million, down 4% from last year's first quarter and essentially even with the fourth quarter of 2010. The decrease from the prior year is primarily attributable to lower subsea sales. T",1090,"Thanks, John. Energy production sales for the first quarter were $856 million, down 4% from last year's first quarter and essentially even with the fourth quarter of 2010. The decrease from the prior year is primarily attributable to lower subsea sales. The lower subsea sales in the quarter were impacted by 2 factors. First, we're beginning many of our subsea projects that were awarded in 2010. Most of the work in the early stages of these projects is engineering. Consequently, in these early stages we recognize less costs, less progress and hence, lower income than in the later stages of these projects when higher costs are incurred. As these projects progress into the second half of the year, we expect the revenue to accelerate.
Second, and more related to the sequential revenue comparison, subsea sales tend to be somewhat seasonal with the fourth quarter normally our strongest quarter and the first quarter often the lightest. Subsea sales of $683 million in the quarter were essentially even or flat with sales in the fourth quarter 2010. Again, we expect sales to increase in the future quarters as progress increases and the seasonal effect of the first quarter is eliminated. For the full year, we still expect subsea sales of $3.3 billion.
Surface sales were up slightly over the first quarter of 2010 as North American sales increased but international sales declined as some delays impacted shipments. Energy production generated operating profit of $82 million in the quarter, down 48% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower margins in subsea projects. These margins were in part a function of the sales level, higher bidding expenses and some timing of items that we expect to improve later in the year. 
In surface and equally impacting margins, we also had lower margins due to sales mix, some execution issues along with some expenses associated with growth initiatives in North America. So in total, margins for the quarter were 9.6% in the segment.
For the full year, we expect margins to average 12% to 13% and as John mentioned, we expect the second half margins to be higher than the first half 2011. Inbound orders in energy production were $1.1 billion in the quarter, including subsea orders of $940 million. Backlog now stands at $4.2 billion, including records subsea backlog of $3.9 billion. 
Energy Processing sales were $226 million, up 35% from the prior year quarter and about even with the fourth quarter of 2010. The year-over-year increase was driven by record sales in our Fluid Control business led by weaker and flowline product and our Well Service Pumps. Fluid Control sales were also up significantly over a seasonally strong fourth quarter. As John mentioned, we're continuing to see orders from the pressure pumping market, and we are expanding capacity.
Energy Processing generate operating profit of $44 million. The first quarter margin remained above 19% helped by favorable resolution of a lawsuit. Last quarter, we indicated expectations that the full year margin for the segment would be in the range of 17% to 18%. In that guidance, we anticipated the mix between Fluid Control and the other Processing businesses would decline from the fourth quarter run rate. We continue to expect our other Processing businesses loading, measurement and material handling to increase throughout the year but with the growth we're seeing in Fluid Control, the impact and margins will not be as great. Consequently, we are now expecting margins to be in the range of 18% to 19% for the full year.
Total inbound orders for Energy Processing reached $267 million, up 48% from the prior year's first quarter. The improvement was led by Fluid Control, but all the other businesses contributed to that increase. Backlog ended the quarter at $342 million.
Now for the corporate items. Corporate expense in the quarter was $8.4 million. We expect to average closer to $10 million per quarter for the remainder of the year. Other expense net was $8.2 million. This amount was reduced by lower pension costs in the quarter. We expect this expense item to average about $8 million to $9 million per quarter subject to fluctuations for foreign exchange rates for the rest of the year.
Our first quarter tax rate of 20.9% was impacted by $7.3 million tax benefit that we talked about last quarter, and that's associated with an international tax holiday. We are narrowing our full year tax rate guidance to a range of 30% to 31% for the full year. Capital spending in the quarter was $41 million, primarily directed towards our Energy Production businesses. Capital expenditures for both production and processing should come in greater than this in coming quarters and put us well above the $200 million mark for the full year.
At the end of the quarter, we had a net debt position of $45 million, down only slightly from $48 million at year end. It was comprised of $377 million of cash and $422 million of debt. We averaged 243.8 million shares diluted outstanding in the quarter.
Overall, our outlook for 2011 is still very positive. In production, we expect another strong year in subsea growth, but realize that some of the large inbound orders originally scheduled for late this year are likely to move into 2012. Activity is starting to materialize again in the Gulf of Mexico, but the pace is unpredictable, and it'll likely be 2012 before we start to see significant growth in orders from that region. As the year progresses into the second half and our subsea projects advance, we expect subsea revenue to increase with the more rapid progress on our projects and for our margins to increase also.
Our Surface Wellhead business should improve from the first quarter and benefit from continued growth in North America. Additionally, we expect our strong international businesses to improve throughout the remainder of the year. In Energy Processing, Fluid Control is looking stronger than we originally expected with our capacity expansions coming on later this year, our ability to meet our customers demands will continue to improve.
We also expect our measurement, material and in loading systems businesses to follow their normal pattern of growth as the year goes on and contribute at greater levels during the coming quarters. Summing that all up, our current guidance for 2011 diluted earnings per share is $1.60 to $1.70 and essentially equivalent to our pre-split guidance of $3.20 to $3.40. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, and operator, you may now open up the call for questions."

I'll start the conversation then let Bill fill in. What we're saying is the number of projects that we received we see many of them about the same time they're in early stages of development, which is mostly design engineering, which drives the percentage of complete numbers fairly low until we get at the mid-cycle or later cycle of those projects when raw materials are received, another part is received, another percent complete starts to go up. We expect that to happen in the second half. So in the second half our revenue for Subsea businesses will be essentially higher than it was in the first half and we'll get leverage from that, which will drive the margins for subsea higher in the second half than they are in the first half. I'll let Bill add to that."

On our projects and our POC accounting we account for project at the same margin throughout its life. But what happened in the first quarter is again, as John mentioned, we had so many projects early in their stage that we didn't incur a lot of cost and therefore, didn't incur as much revenue as you might expect. Now why did that lower margins? Well, let me back up a minute and say the Subsea business for 2011 is really sized for $3.3 billion in sales in terms of staffing and SAR expense. And as you know, we have most of the backlog to enable us to reach that revenue number. But we have lower sales in the first half due to early stage due to some seasonality. Actually, our gross margins on projects are on budget, on the budget that will allow us to hit the 12% to 13%. But we had some under absorption of manufacturing overhead in the first quarter because of the lower revenue amounts, and we had some higher expenses associated with bidding for the large number of projects that are out there in award. So consequently, our margins in Q1 were lower than our average, we think our average for the full year and of course, last year. So as our sales increase during the year, assuming we've maintained the same gross margins and SAR expenses are under control, our margins and subsea should increase allowing us to hit the 12% to 13% margin for the full year. Obviously, that means we're going to have margins that are going to be higher in the second half of the year, materially higher than the first half."

I always thought of POC as that consistent margin profile, so that's interesting. If we stick with that then, there's obviously been a conversation that's run several quarters about very high margin that you realized over the last couple of years, say. What you're talking about in terms of that getting back to that absorption level, so what kind of margins you're guiding towards margins that are back into approaching the mid-teens I think. I haven't run the math. You can correct me, but presuming I have to approach the mid-teens so back to kind of high levels where you were. What is that saying about kind of your outlook, the position, the potential for margins even further out as we start to get into '12. Since you're starting from such a high base once the projects are in full swing."

Surface also hurt us pretty significantly in the quarter. We had a change in sales mix, which we had anticipated. North America grew very nicely in line with the rig count. But our International business, as you know, is larger and it's actually more profitable than our Domestic business. And so we got hurt a little bit on sales mix there, and we had some operational issues in surface that are expected to diminish as the year goes on not 1-time but certainly items that can be controlled. And we had some growth initiatives. We're investing in frac assets. We're investing in some additional training and some other assets. So the Surface business also hurt us pretty I, mean for its size, pretty significantly in the first quarter. But again, we expect that to reverse throughout the remainder of the year. So both those things impacted the first quarter margins. Now, John, to answer your other question, yes, as we get to the end of the year, we expect in order to average 12% to 13%, we're probably going to have margins above 13% at some quarter."

So that's what we're excited about is that these projects are being named, and it looks like we're gaining traction in the industry's acceptance of this technology.

So it's just understandable it's probably more important now that they rebuild their backlog as quickly as they can. A lot of the major projects that are being tendered in 2011 are towards the back end of the year. So we'd expect as the products many of the ones I mentioned like Wheatstone, Gina that'll all be tendered later this year that there would be a lot of competitive intensity as the other suppliers rebuild their backlog.

If you look at our first quarter inbound, we were excited to get close to that $1 billion, particularly when there was no major project. Of that almost $1 billion that we inbound for subsea, over 40% of it came from us either being an incumbent or from an alliance partner. And between getting $1 billion in inbound of relatively small projects and then having such a high percentage from our incumbency or being alliance or frame agreement partner is really encouraging to us because not only does it mean we can get, we're on track for the possibly $4 billion of inbound for this year. But the margin pressure when you're an incumbent or a frame agreement partner is a heck of a lot different than when you're intensely competitively bidding to fill your backlog on a $500 million project. So we're encouraged, and you're right. The addition of our global BP frame agreement just adds more business in that frame agreement category."

That's what in the near term is going to fill the backlogs of all the suppliers and that'll get them comfortable with higher pricing levels. So I think the Gulf of Mexico helps. But frankly, with these big projects in the next 12 to 18 months, there's $7 billion to $8 billion of major subsea projects. Very few to be awarded, very few of them in the Gulf of Mexico. That's what has to happen for pricing to improve. But clearly, the Gulf of Mexico helps. The only other thing I might mention about the Gulf of Mexico, Dave, is that the majors really haven't slowed up too much. As you know I think in the fourth quarter we picked up some fairly good-sized orders from Shell. Exxon is proceeding with their plans with Julia and Hadrian. BP has got plans. Chevron, of course, is proceeding with Jackson. Also the majors are proceeding with the project developments in the Gulf of Mexico, including even some awards. It's the independents like you suggested the onesies, twosies that we really need to come back and that's what uncertain. But I don't think it represents a huge part of the global market, which would drive pricing improvement. I do want to mention that we have a great position with the independents in the Gulf of Mexico so it's very helpful for us if the independents are able to come back and hopefully that will happen as these permits number of permits approved increases."

Service companies are working that equipment very hard out there with these multistage fracs. To give you an idea of kind of how it's going for us, our Q1 shipments were 45% of the total shipments we made in 2010. So in the first quarter alone, we've seen a significant uptick in the amount of shipments we're making. Obviously, on the kind of specific numbers about capacity, our organization works pretty hard to get that competitive intelligence from our competitors.

But when we start a project, it's primarily engineering, and engineering may be 10% to 20% of the total project costs.

And so consequently, we recognize 10% to 15% of the revenue from the project over that time period. Then we begin to receive raw material, completed sub assemblies. And our cost really begin to escalate during that time period when we're receiving equipment. And so our costs escalate and consequently, our progress and revenues increase. And at the end of the project when the assembly in test we're back again to it's primarily labor and the cost accumulation is relatively slow. So we have kind of an S-curve, if you will, for the total cost of each project. We're executing over 100 projects at any point in time, but there is a maturity issue here.

Welcome to our first quarter 2011 conference call. With me today are Bill Schumann, our CFO; and Bob Potter, our Executive Vice President.

With me today are Bill Schumann, our CFO; and Bob Potter, our Executive Vice President. First I'll share some highlights from the quarter, Bill will provide specifics on our financial performance and outlook for the remainder of 2011 and then we'll open up the call for questions. 
But before we begin our discussion of the quarter, I'd like to say a few words about Peter Kinnear who recently stepped down from his position as Chief Executive Officer. Peter is a true pioneer of the Subsea business, starting in 1988 with the Subsea business of $40 million. He oversaw the growth of the business to over $3 billion today. He has achieved an impressive list of accomplishments over his 40 years at FMC. During his 4 years as CEO, the market capitalization of the company has almost tripled. On behalf of all of the employees of the company, I thank Peter for his direction and contributions to our growth and success of the company.
Now let's focus on our results. Earnings for the quarter were $0.35 per diluted share that included a tax benefit of $0.03 that we disclosed previously in the fourth quarter call. We recorded $1.4 billion in orders for the first quarter, of which $940 million was for subsea systems that included 71 subsea trees.
Total company revenue was $1.1 billion. Subsea revenue for the quarter was $683 million, sequentially flat with the fourth quarter. Our first quarter subsea revenue performance reflects the early stages we are in with many of our subsea projects included over the past year. We still expect subsea sales to reach $3.3 billion for the full year.
Surface Wellhead revenue was up 5% from the first quarter of 2010 on strong North American activity, partially offset by lower international revenue caused by timing of shipments. Margins were lower than our full year guidance for energy production, but we still expect to achieve margins averaging 12% to 13% for the full year.
Fluid Control delivered record sales and earnings as the North America pressure pumping market continues to be strong. While results in the other Energy Processing businesses were flat with last year, orders were up and backlog increased. For the total company, we anticipate the second half of the year to be stronger than the first half, driven primarily by subsea results. We continue to expect earnings to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.70 per diluted share. 
Looking at the overall economic environment, we have oil over $100, an uncertain economic recovery, unrest in North America and the Middle East, earthquakes in Japan, financial instability in Europe, hardly a normal economic environment. Yet the impact of these events on our business has been low, and the key reason is our subsea franchise is a long-cycle business. Our customers have a long-term focus based on demand forecast and the overall Deepwater economics driving their decisions. 
Deepwater reserves remain economical, with prices between $40 and $60 barrels per barrel as the technologies that we and others in the industry develop and deploy reduced costs and increased recovery rates. As a result of this, global capital spending of our customers remain strong and should continue.
Consistent with our comments during our last call, deep water drilling rigs continued to be ordered. During the first four months of 2011, over 20 units by our count. The list of major subsea projects to be awarded over the next 12 to 15 months remains promising, but it is common and the timing is not always predictable. A number of major projects: [indiscernible] team look as though they're being delayed from late 2011 into early 2012. However, even on these projects, the tender documents are out and award process is proceeding.
In line with the favorable long-term view of the market, we inbounded $940 million in subsea orders during the quarter from a number of customers related to work in Brazil, Indonesia, Canada and Norway. It's important to note that the strong subsea inbound did not include any major projects that exceeded $150 million, and that we were confronted with largely dormant Gulf of Mexico market. Also in the quarter, we signed a global frame agreement with BP, 1 of the largest Deepwater operators in the world that we anticipate will add to our order flow. 
Although we're still uncertain about the drilling progress in the Gulf of Mexico, we're becoming more optimistic given that 11 drilling permits have been issued so far in 2011. While we have been successful rebuilding our subsea backlog since the downturn, some of our competitors have yet to rebuild. And as a result, pricing will remain competitive. 
But as the major projects I mentioned earlier are awarded, we expect pricing to improve. We continue to be optimistic on the growth of subsea processing activity. A good example is the Congro project in Brazil, which we expect to be awarded this year. Here, Petrobras is replacing an aging platform with a subsea processing facility.
Moving to our Energy Processing businesses. We had another strong quarter that exceeded last quarter's results. Fluid Control was higher than we expected as the North America pressure pumping market continues to point towards more sustainable growth. We've historically been cautious about the economics of gas drilling in North America and its impact on our Fluid Control business. But with more than 50% of the rigs drilling for either oil or plays with sizable liquid content, we have more confidence about the economic underpinnings of this market. As our expanded Fluid Control capacity comes online, we will better meet our customers' growing demands for our sought-after pumps[, WECO/Chiksan treating iron and other new components such as our frac manifolds. 
In summary, first quarter finished with the largest subsea backlog in our company's history. Fluid Control delivered record results, and we continue to see growth opportunities in Surface Wellhead and other Processing businesses. 
Bill will now take you through some of the financial details of the quarter."
972117,128419928,118192,"FMC Technologies, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2011",2011-04-27,"Earnings Calls","FMC Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. Energy production sales for the first quarter were $856 million, down 4% from last year's first quarter and essentially even with the fourth quarter of 2010. The decrease from the prior year is primarily attributable to lower subsea sales. T",1093,"Thanks, John. Energy production sales for the first quarter were $856 million, down 4% from last year's first quarter and essentially even with the fourth quarter of 2010. The decrease from the prior year is primarily attributable to lower subsea sales. The lower subsea sales in the quarter were impacted by 2 factors. First, we're at the beginning many of our subsea projects that were awarded in 2010. Most of the work in the early stages of these projects is engineering. Consequently, in these early stages, we recognize less costs, less progress and hence, lower income than in the later stages of these projects when higher costs are incurred. As these projects progress into the second half of the year, we expect the revenue to accelerate.
Second and more related to the sequential revenue comparison, subsea sales tend to be somewhat seasonal with the fourth quarter normally our strongest quarter and the first quarter often the lightest. Subsea sales of $683 million in the quarter were essentially even or flat with sales in the fourth quarter of 2010. Again, we expect sales to increase in the future quarters as progress increases and the seasonal effect of the first quarter is eliminated. For the full year, we still expect subsea sales of $3.3 billion.
Surface sales were up slightly over the first quarter of 2010 as North American sales increased, but international sales declined as some delays impacted shipments. Energy production generated operating profit of $82 million in the quarter, down 48% from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to lower margins in subsea projects. These margins were in part a function of the sales level, higher bidding expenses and some timing of items that we expect to improve later in the year. In Surface and equally impacting margins, we also had lower margins due to sales mix, some execution issues along with some expenses associated with growth initiatives in North America. So in total, margins for the quarter were 9.6% in the segment.
For the full year, we expect margins to average 12% to 13% and as John mentioned, we expect the second half margins to be higher than the first half of 2011. Inbound orders in energy production were $1.1 billion in the quarter, including subsea orders of $940 million. Backlog now stands at $4.2 billion, including record subsea backlog of $3.9 billion. 
Energy Processing sales were $226 million, up 35% from the prior-year quarter and about even with the fourth quarter of 2010. The year-over-year increase was driven by record sales in our Fluid Control business led by WECO/Chiksan flow line products and our Well Service Pumps. Fluid Control sales were also up sequentially over a seasonally strong fourth quarter. As John mentioned, we're continuing to see strong orders from the pressure pumping market, and we are expanding capacity.
Energy Processing generated operating profit of $44 million. The first quarter margin remained above 19%, helped by a favorable resolution of a lawsuit. Last quarter, we indicated expectations that the full year margin for the segment would be in the range of 17% to 18%. In that guidance, we anticipated the mix between Fluid Control and the other Processing businesses would decline from the fourth quarter run rate. We continue to expect our other Processing businesses Loading, Measurement and Material Handling to increase throughout the year. But with the growth we're seeing in Fluid Control, the impact and margins will not be as great. Consequently, we are now expecting margins to be in the range of 18% to 19% for the full year.
Total inbound orders for Energy Processing reached $267 million, up 48% from the prior-year's first quarter. The improvement was led by Fluid Control, but all the other businesses contributed to that increase. Backlog ended the quarter at $342 million.
Now for the corporate items. Corporate expense in the quarter was $8.4 million. We expect to average closer to $10 million per quarter for the remainder of the year. Other expense net was $8.2 million. This amount was reduced by lower pension costs in the quarter. We expect this expense item to average about $8 million to $9 million per quarter subject to fluctuations of the foreign exchange rates for the rest of the year.
Our first quarter tax rate of 20.9% was impacted by $7.3 million tax benefit that we talked about last quarter, and that's associated with an international tax holiday. We're narrowing our full year tax rate guidance to a range of 30% to 31% for the full year. Capital spending in the quarter was $41 million, primarily directed towards our Energy Production businesses. Capital expenditures for both production and processing should come in greater than this in coming quarters and put us well above the $200 million mark for the full year.
At the end of the quarter, we had a net debt position of $45 million, down only slightly from $48 million at year end. It was comprised of $377 million of cash and $422 million of debt. We averaged 243.8 million shares diluted outstanding in the quarter.
Overall, our outlook for 2011 is still very positive. In production, we expect another strong year in subsea growth, but realize that some of the large inbound orders originally scheduled for late this year are likely to move into 2012. Activity is starting to materialize again in the Gulf of Mexico but the pace is unpredictable, and it'll likely be 2012 before we start to see significant growth in orders from that region. As the year progresses into the second half and our subsea projects advance, we expect subsea revenue to increase with the more rapid progress on our projects and for our margins to increase also.
Our Surface Wellhead business should improve from the first quarter and benefit from continued growth in North America. Additionally, we expect our strong international businesses to improve throughout the remainder of the year. In Energy Processing, Fluid Control is looking stronger than we originally expected. With our capacity expansions coming on later this year, our ability to meet our customers' demands will continue to improve. We also expect our Measurement, Material, Handling and Loading Systems businesses to follow their normal pattern of growth as the year goes on and contribute at greater levels during the coming quarters. 
Summing that all up, our current guidance for 2011 diluted earnings per share is $1.60 to $1.70 and essentially equivalent to our pre-split guidance of $3.20 to $3.40. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, and operator, you may now open up the call for questions."

I'll start the conversation then let Bill fill in. What we're saying is the number of projects that we received, with many of them about the same time, they're in their early stages of development, which is mostly design engineering, which drives the percentage of complete numbers fairly low until we get to the mid-cycle or later cycle of those projects when raw material is received, another part is received and then the percent complete starts to go up. We expect that to happen in the second half. So in the second half, our revenue for Subsea businesses will be substantially higher than it was in the first half and we'll get leverage from that, which will drive the margins for Subsea higher in the second half than they are in the first half. I'll let Bill add to that."

On our projects and our POC accounting, we account for project at the same margin throughout its life.

On our projects and our POC accounting, we account for project at the same margin throughout its life. But what happened in the first quarter is again, as John mentioned, we had so many projects early in their stage that we didn't incur a lot of costs and therefore, didn't incur as much revenue as you might expect. Now why did that lower margins? Well, let me back up a minute and say the Subsea business for 2011 is really sized for $3.3 billion in sales in terms of staffing and  SAR expense. And as you know, we have most of the backlog to enable us to reach that revenue number. But we had lower sales in the first half due to early stage due to some seasonality. Actually, our gross margins on projects are on budget, on the budget that will allow us to hit the 12% to 13%. But we had some under-absorption of manufacturing overhead in the first quarter because of the lower revenue amounts, and we had some higher expenses associated with bidding for the large number of projects that are out there in award. So consequently, our margins in Q1 were lower than our average, we think our average for the full year and of course, last year. So as our sales increase during the year, assuming we've maintained the same gross margins and SAR [stock appreciation right] expenses are under control, our margins and subsea should increase, allowing us to hit the 12% to 13% margin for the full year. So obviously, that means we're going to have margins that are going to be higher in the second half of the year, materially higher than the first half."

If we stick with that then, there's obviously been a conversation that's run several quarters about very high margins that you had realized over the last couple of years, say. What you're talking about in terms of getting back to that absorption level, so what kind of margins -- you're guiding towards margins that are back into approaching the mid-teens I think. I haven't run the math, you can correct me, but presuming I have to approach the mid-teens, so back to kind of high levels where you were. What is that saying about kind of your outlook, the position, the potential for margins even further out as we start to get into '12, since you're starting from such a high base once the projects are in full swing?"

Surface also hurt us pretty significantly in the quarter. We had a change in sales mix, which we had anticipated. North America grew very nicely, in line with the rig count. But our International business, as you know, is larger and it's actually more profitable than our Domestic business. And so we got hurt a little bit on sales mix there, and we had some operational issues in Surface that are expected to diminish as the year goes on, not 1-time but certainly items that can be controlled. And we had some growth initiatives. We're investing in frac assets. We're investing in some additional training and some other assets. So the Surface business also hurt us pretty -- I mean for its size, pretty significantly in the first quarter. But again, we expect that to reverse throughout the remainder of the year. So both those things impacted the first quarter margins. Now, John, to answer your other question, yes, as we get to the end of the year, we expect, in order to average 12% to 13%, we're probably going to have margins above 13% at some quarter."

Congro uses a little different technology than some of the other systems, both in terms of separation and boosting, and I understand from Petrobras that it will be awarded this year."

In 2009, there were only 5 subsea projects that were awarded. Everybody wore down their backlog. It was no different for us. Last year, we were successful in rebuilding backlog, which we were pleased to do. But the other suppliers didn't, and they continued to work down their backlog. So it's just understandable that it's probably more important now that they rebuild their backlog as quickly as they can. A lot of the major projects that are being tendered in 2011 are towards the back end of the year. So we'd expect as the products, many of the ones I mentioned, like Wheatstone and Gina [ph], that'll all be tendered later this year, that there would be a lot of competitive intensity as the other suppliers rebuild their backlog. We've seen that in some of the big projects that have bid over the last year. So we have to get deeper into the air when these major projects are bid. We expect them to be fairly competitive while people rebuild their backlogs. And then as that happens, which will be later this year and into early next year with backlogs built, then we'd see some of that pricing pressure come off, which is why we expect pricing to improve in 2012 once these major projects are awarded.

Of that almost $1 billion that we inbound for subsea, over 40% of it came from us either being an incumbent or from an alliance partner. And between getting $1 billion in inbound of relatively small projects and then having such a high percentage, be from our incumbency or being alliance or frame agreement partner, is really encouraging to us because not only does it mean that we can get -- we're on track for the possibly $4 billion of inbound for this year.

Chevron, of course, is proceeding with Jackson. So the majors are proceeding with the project developments in the Gulf of Mexico, including even some awards. It's the independents, like you suggested, the onesie, twosies, that we really need to come back, and that's what uncertain. But I don't think it represents a huge part of the global market, which would drive pricing improvement. I do want to mention that we have a great position with the independents in the Gulf of Mexico. So it's very helpful for us if the independents are able to come back and hopefully, that will happen as these permits number of permits approved increases."

We expect to see some of the capacity additions that we've invested in beginning to show up in early third quarter, which is going to contribute to higher throughput and reduce some of the lead times. You asked about lead times. They're still running about 12 months. Demand for frac pumps continues to be very strong. Service companies are working that equipment very hard out there with these multistage fracs. To give you an idea of kind of how it's going for us, our Q1 shipments were 45% of the total shipments we made in 2010. So in the first quarter alone, we've seen a significant uptick in the amount of shipments we're making. Obviously, on the kind of specific numbers about capacity, our organization works pretty hard to get that competitive intelligence from our competitors. So I'd really prefer not to make it so easy on them by giving it out publicly. But obviously, our capacity expansion has been targeted to meet our growth and share expectations over the next 2 to 3 years. So we think we're in good shape. We've got to get it on line begins in early third quarter, and that capacity expansion will extend through in the first quarter of 2012."

And engineering may be 10% to 20% of the total project costs. But the initial say, 3 months of the project, maybe even 6 months, almost entirely engineering. And therefore, you're only accumulating costs of at most 10% to 15% of the whole project. And so consequently, we recognize 10% to 15% of the revenue from the project over that time period. Then we begin to receive raw material, completed sub assemblies. And our cost really begin to escalate during that time period when we're receiving equipment. And so our costs escalate and consequently, our progress and revenues increase. And at the end of the project when the assembly in test, we're back again so it's primarily labor, and the cost accumulation is relatively slow. So we have kind of an S-curve, if you will, for the total cost of each project. We're executing over 100 projects at any point in time, but there is a maturity issue here. And given the amount of backlog that we received, orders I should say that we received in 2010, in the early stage of those, we've got a lot more engineering content, and  we're not receiving as much material and subassemblies as we would normally receive during an average quarter."

With me today are Bill Schumann, our CFO; and Bob Potter, our Executive Vice President. First I'll share some highlights from the quarter, Bill will provide specifics on our financial performance and outlook for the remainder of 2011, and then we'll open up the call for questions. 
But before we begin our discussion of the quarter, I'd like to say a few words about Peter Kinnear who recently stepped down from his position as Chief Executive Officer. Peter is a true pioneer of the subsea business. Starting in 1988 with the Subsea business of $40 million, he oversaw the growth of the business to over $3 billion today. He has achieved an impressive list of accomplishments over his 40 years at FMC. During his 4 years as CEO, the market capitalization of the company has almost tripled. On behalf of all of the employees of the company, I thank Peter for his direction and contributions to our growth and success of the company.
Now let's focus on our results. Earnings for the quarter were $0.35 per diluted share that included a tax benefit of $0.03 that we disclosed previously in the fourth quarter call. We recorded $1.4 billion in orders for the first quarter, of which $940 million was for subsea systems that included 71 subsea trees.
Total company revenue was $1.1 billion. Subsea revenue for the quarter was $683 million, sequentially flat with the fourth quarter. Our first quarter subsea revenue performance reflects the early stages we are in with many of our subsea projects included over the past year. We still expect subsea sales to reach $3.3 billion for the full year.
Surface Wellhead revenue was up 5% from the first quarter of 2010 on strong North American activity, partially offset by lower international revenue caused by timing of shipments. Margins were lower than our full year guidance for energy production, but we still expect to achieve margins averaging 12% to 13% for the full year.
Fluid Control delivered record sales and earnings as the North America pressure pumping market continues to be strong. While results in the other Energy Processing businesses were flat with last year, orders were up, and backlog increased. For the total company, we anticipate the second half of the year to be stronger than the first half, driven primarily by subsea results. We continue to expect earnings to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.70 per diluted share. 
Looking at the overall economic environment, we have oil over $100, an uncertain economic recovery, unrest in North America and the Middle East, earthquakes in Japan, financial instability in Europe, hardly a normal economic environment. Yet the impact of these events on our business has been low, and the key reason is our subsea franchise is a long-cycle business. Our customers have a long-term focus based on demand forecast and the overall deepwater economics driving their decisions. 
Deepwater reserves remain economical, with prices between $40 and $60 barrels per barrel as the technologies that we and others in the industry develop and deploy reduce cost and increase recovery rates. As a result of this, global capital spending of our customers remains strong and should continue.
Consistent with our comments during our last call, deepwater drilling rigs continued to be ordered. During the first 4 months of 2011, over 20 units by our count. The list of major subsea projects to be awarded over the next 12 to 15 months remains promising, but it is common and the timing is not always predictable. A number of major projects: [indiscernible] look as though they're being delayed from late 2011 into early 2012. However, even on these projects, the tender documents are out, and the award process is proceeding.
In line with the favorable long-term view of the market, we inbounded $940 million in subsea orders during the quarter from a number of customers related to work in Brazil, Indonesia, Canada and Norway. It's important to note that the strong subsea inbound did not include any major projects that exceeded $150 million and that we were confronted with largely dormant Gulf of Mexico market. Also in the quarter, we signed a global frame agreement with BP, 1 of the largest deepwater operators in the world, that we anticipate will add to our order flow. 
Although we're still uncertain about the drilling progress in the Gulf of Mexico, we're becoming more optimistic given that 11 drilling permits have been issued so far in 2011. While we have been successful rebuilding our subsea backlog since the downturn, some of our competitors have yet to rebuild. And as a result, pricing will remain competitive. 
But as the major projects I mentioned earlier are awarded, we expect pricing to improve. We continue to be optimistic on the growth of subsea processing activity. A good example is the Congro project in Brazil, which we expect to be awarded this year. Here, Petrobras is replacing an aging platform with a subsea processing facility.
Moving to our Energy Processing businesses. We had another strong quarter that exceeded last quarter's results. Fluid Control was higher than we expected as the North America pressure pumping market continues to point towards more sustainable growth. We've historically been cautious about the economics of gas drilling in North America and its impact on our Fluid Control business. But with more than 50% of the rigs drilling for either oil or plays with sizable liquid content, we have more confidence about the economic underpinnings of this market. As our expanded Fluid Control capacity comes online, we will better meet our customers' growing demands for our sought-after pumps, WECO/Chiksan treating iron and other new components such as our frac manifolds. 
In summary, first quarter finished with the largest subsea backlog in our company's history. Fluid Control delivered record results, and we continue to see growth opportunities in Surface Wellhead and other Processing businesses. 
Bill will now take you through some of the financial details of the quarter."
972117,128419928,118230,"FMC Technologies, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2011",2011-04-27,"Earnings Calls","FMC Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. Energy production sales for the first quarter were $856 million, down 4% from last year's first quarter and essentially even with the fourth quarter of 2010. The decrease from the prior year is primarily attributable to lower subsea sales. T",1096,"Thanks, John. Energy production sales for the first quarter were $856 million, down 4% from last year's first quarter and essentially even with the fourth quarter of 2010. The decrease from the prior year is primarily attributable to lower subsea sales. The lower subsea sales in the quarter were impacted by 2 factors. First, we're at the beginning of many of our subsea projects that were awarded in 2010. Most of the work in the early stages of these projects is engineering. Consequently, in these early stages, we recognize less costs, less progress and, hence, lower income than in the later stages of these projects when higher costs are incurred. As these projects progress into the second half of the year, we expect the revenue to accelerate.
Second and more related to the sequential revenue comparison, subsea sales tend to be somewhat seasonal with the fourth quarter normally our strongest quarter and the first quarter often the lightest. Subsea sales of $683 million in the quarter were essentially even or flat with sales in the fourth quarter of 2010. Again, we expect sales to increase in the future quarters as progress increases and the seasonal effect of the first quarter is eliminated. For the full year, we still expect subsea sales of $3.3 billion.
Surface sales were up slightly over the first quarter of 2010 as North American sales increased, but international sales declined as some delays impacted shipments. Energy production generated operating profit of $82 million in the quarter, down 48% from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to lower margins in subsea projects. These margins were in part a function of the sales level, higher bidding expenses and some timing of items that we expect to improve later in the year. In Surface and equally impacting margins, we also had lower margins due to sales mix, some execution issues, along with some expenses associated with growth initiatives in North America. So in total, margins for the quarter were 9.6% in the segment.
For the full year, we expect margins to average 12% to 13%, and as John mentioned, we expect the second half margins to be higher than the first half of 2011. Inbound orders in energy production were $1.1 billion in the quarter, including subsea orders of $940 million. Backlog now stands at $4.2 billion, including record subsea backlog of $3.9 billion. 
Energy Processing sales were $226 million, up 35% from the prior-year quarter and about even with the fourth quarter of 2010. The year-over-year increase was driven by record sales in our Fluid Control business led by WECO/Chiksan flow line products and our Well Service Pumps. Fluid Control sales were also up sequentially over a seasonally strong fourth quarter. As John mentioned, we're continuing to see strong orders from the pressure pumping market, and we are expanding capacity.
Energy Processing generated operating profit of $44 million. The first quarter margin remained above 19%, helped by a favorable resolution of a lawsuit. Last quarter, we indicated expectations that the full year margin for the segment would be in the range of 17% to 18%. In that guidance, we anticipated the mix between Fluid Control and the other Processing businesses would decline from the fourth quarter run rate. We continue to expect our other Processing businesses, Loading, Measurement and Material Handling, to increase throughout the year. But with the growth we're seeing in Fluid Control, the impact and margins will not be as great. Consequently, we are now expecting margins to be in the range of 18% to 19% for the full year.
Total inbound orders for Energy Processing reached $267 million, up 48% from the prior-year's first quarter. The improvement was led by Fluid Control, but all the other businesses contributed to that increase. Backlog ended the quarter at $342 million.
Now for the corporate items. Corporate expense in the quarter was $8.4 million. We expect to average closer to $10 million per quarter for the remainder of the year. Other expense net was $8.2 million. This amount was reduced by lower pension costs in the quarter. We expect this expense item to average about $8 million to $9 million per quarter, subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for the rest of the year.
Our first quarter tax rate of 20.9% was impacted by a $7.3 million tax benefit that we talked about last quarter, and that's associated with an international tax holiday. We're narrowing our full year tax rate guidance to a range of 30% to 31% for the full year. Capital spending in the quarter was $41 million, primarily directed towards our Energy Production businesses. Capital expenditures for both production and processing should come in greater than this in coming quarters and put us well above the $200 million mark for the full year.
At the end of the quarter, we had a net debt position of $45 million, down only slightly from $48 million at year end. It was comprised of $377 million of cash and $422 million of debt. We averaged 243.8 million shares -- diluted shares outstanding in the quarter.
Overall, our outlook for 2011 is still very positive. In production, we expect another strong year in subsea growth but realize that some of the large inbound orders originally scheduled for late this year are likely to move into 2012. Activity is starting to materialize again in the Gulf of Mexico but the pace is unpredictable, and it'll likely be 2012 before we start to see significant growth in orders from that region. As the year progresses into the second half and our subsea projects advance, we expect subsea revenue to increase with the more rapid progress on our projects and for our margins to increase also.
Our Surface Wellhead business should improve from the first quarter and benefit from continued growth in North America. Additionally, we expect our strong international businesses to improve throughout the remainder of the year. In Energy Processing, Fluid Control is looking stronger than we originally expected. With our capacity expansions coming on later this year, our ability to meet our customers' demands will continue to improve. We also expect our Measurement, Material, Handling and Loading Systems businesses to follow their normal pattern of growth as the year goes on and contribute at greater levels during the coming quarters. 
Summing that all up, our current guidance for 2011 diluted earnings per share is $1.60 to $1.70 and essentially equivalent to our pre-split guidance of $3.20 to $3.40. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, and operator, you may now open up the call for questions."

I'll start the conversation then let Bill fill in. What we're saying is the number of projects that we received, many of them about the same time, they're in their early stages of development, which is mostly design engineering, which drives the percentage of complete numbers fairly low until we get to the mid-cycle or later cycle of those projects when raw material is received, another part is received and then the percent complete starts to go up. We expect that to happen in the second half. So in the second half, our revenue for Subsea businesses will be substantially higher than it was in the first half, and we'll get leverage from that, which will drive the margins for Subsea higher in the second half than they are in the first half. I'll let Bill add to that."

On our projects and our POC accounting, we account for a project at the same margin throughout its life. But what happened in the first quarter is again, as John mentioned, we had so many projects early in their stage that we didn't incur a lot",288,"Yes, Brad. On our projects and our POC accounting, we account for a project at the same margin throughout its life. But what happened in the first quarter is again, as John mentioned, we had so many projects early in their stage that we didn't incur a lot of costs and, therefore, didn't incur as much revenue as you might expect. Now why did that lower margins? Well, let me back up a minute and say the Subsea business for 2011 is really sized for $3.3 billion in sales in terms of staffing and SAR expense. And as you know, we have most of the backlog to enable us to reach that revenue number. But we had lower sales in the first half due to early stage due to some seasonality. Actually, our gross margins on projects are on budget, on the budget that will allow us to hit the 12% to 13%. But we had some under-absorption of manufacturing overhead in the first quarter because of the lower revenue amounts, and we had some higher expenses associated with bidding for the large number of projects that are out there in award. So consequently, our margins in Q1 were lower than our average -- we think our average for the full year and, of course, last year. So as our sales increase during the year, assuming we've maintained the same gross margins and SAR [stock appreciation right] expenses are under control, our margins in subsea should increase, allowing us to hit the 12% to 13% margin for the full year. So obviously, that means we're going to have margins that are going to be higher in the second half of the year, materially higher than the first half."

I'd always thought of POC as that consistent margin profile, so that's interesting. If we stick with that then, there's obviously been a conversation that's run several quarters about very high margins that you had realized over the last couple of years, say. How does what you're talking about in terms of getting back to that absorption level, so what kind of margins -- you're guiding towards margins that are back into approaching the mid-teens I think. I haven't run the math, you can correct me, but it would presumably have to approach the mid-teens, so back to kind of high levels where you were. What is that saying about kind of your outlook, the position, the potential for margins even further out as we start to get into '12, since you're starting from such a high base once the projects are in full swing?"

Surface also hurt us pretty significantly in the quarter. We had a change in sales mix, which we had anticipated. North America grew very nicely, in line with the rig count. But our International business, as you know, is larger, and it's actually more profitable than our Domestic business. And so we got hurt a little bit on sales mix there, and we had some operational issues in Surface that are expected to diminish as the year goes on, not onetime but certainly items that can be controlled. And we had some growth initiatives. We're investing in frac assets. We're investing in some additional training and some other assets. So the Surface business also hurt us pretty -- I mean, for its size, pretty significantly in the first quarter. But again, we expect that to reverse throughout the remainder of the year. So both those things impacted the first quarter margins. Now, John, to answer your other question, yes, as we get to the end of the year, we expect, in order to average 12% to 13%, we're probably going to have to have margins above 13% at some quarter."

In 2009, there were only 5 subsea projects that were awarded. Everybody wore down their backlog. It was no different for us. Last year, we were successful in rebuilding backlog, which we were pleased to do. But the other suppliers didn't, and they continued to work down their backlog. So it's just understandable that it's probably more important now that they rebuild their backlog as quickly as they can. A lot of the major projects that are being tendered in 2011 are towards the back end of the year. So we'd expect as the products, many of the ones I mentioned, like Wheatstone, Angina [ph], Ichthus [ph], that'll all be tendered later this year, that there would be a lot of competitive intensity as the other suppliers rebuild their backlog. We've seen that in some of the big projects that have bid over the last year. So we have to get deeper into the year when these major projects are bid. We expect them to be fairly competitive while people rebuild their backlogs. And then as that happens, which will be later this year and into early next year with backlogs built, then we'll see some of that pricing pressure come off, which is why we expect pricing to improve in 2012 once these major projects are awarded.

If you look at our first quarter inbound, which we were excited to get close to that $1 billion, particularly when there was no major project. Of that almost $1 billion that we inbound for subsea, over 40% of it came from us either being an incumbent or from an alliance partner. And between getting $1 billion in inbound of relatively small projects and then having such a high percentage be from our incumbency or being alliance or frame agreement partner is really encouraging to us because not only does it mean that we can get -- we're on track for the possibly $4 billion of inbound for this year. But the margin pressure, when you're an incumbent or a frame agreement partner, is a heck of a lot different than when you're intensely competitively bidding to fill your backlog on a $500 million project. So we're encouraged, and you're right. The addition of our global BP frame agreement just adds more business in that frame agreement category."

But frankly, with these big projects, there’s -- in the next 12 to 18 months, there's $7 billion to $8 billion of major subsea projects, very few to be awarded, very few of them in the Gulf of Mexico. That's what has to happen for pricing to improve. But clearly, the Gulf of Mexico helps. The only other thing I might mention about the Gulf of Mexico, Dave, is that the majors really haven't slowed up too much. As you know, I think in the fourth quarter we picked up some fairly good-sized orders from Shell. Exxon is proceeding with their plans with Julia and Hadrian. BP has got plans. Chevron, of course, is proceeding with Jackson [ph]. So the majors are proceeding with the project developments in the Gulf of Mexico, including even some awards. It's the independents, like you suggested, the onesie, twosies, that we really need to come back, and that's what’s uncertain. But I don't think it represents a huge part of the global market, which would drive pricing improvement. I do want to mention that we have a great position with the independents in the Gulf of Mexico.

And engineering may be 10% to 20% of the total project costs. But the initial, say, 3 months of a project, maybe even 6 months, are almost entirely engineering. And therefore, you're only accumulating costs of at most 10% to 15% of the whole project. And so consequently, we recognize 10% to 15% of the revenue from the project over that time period. Then we begin to receive raw material, completed sub assemblies. And our costs really begin to escalate during that time period when we're receiving equipment. And so our costs escalate and, consequently, our progress and revenues increase. And then at the end of the project when the assembly in test, we're back again, so it's primarily labor, and the cost accumulation is relatively slow. So we have kind of an S-curve, if you will, for the total cost of each project. We're executing over 100 projects at any point in time, but there is a maturity issue here. And given the amount of backlog that we received -- orders, I should say, that we received in 2010, in the early stage of those, we've got a lot more engineering content, and  we're not receiving as much material and subassemblies as we would normally receive during an average quarter."

With me today are Bill Schumann, our CFO; and Bob Potter, our Executive Vice President.
I'll share with you some highlights from the quarter. Bill will provide specifics on our financial performance and outlook for the second half of 2011, and then we'll open up the call for questions.
First, the results for the quarter. Earnings were $0.39 per diluted share. Subsea performance was largely on track as sales increased 16% sequentially with growth expected to continue through the remainder of the year. However, overall energy production performance was negatively impacted as our Surface Wellhead business continued to experience execution issues. 
Energy processing continued to perform at record levels during the quarter as fluid control benefited from the strength of the North America pressure pumping market. We recorded $1.5 billion in orders during the second quarter, of which $939 million was for the subsea systems and included 20 subsea treaties. Subsea backlog now stands at a record level $4.2 billion. 
Total company revenue was $1.2 billion subsea revenue for the quarter was $795 million reflecting the growth of activity in inbound orders booked over the past several quarters. We expect our subsea sales to reach $3.3 billion for the full year as the conversion of subsea backlog accelerates in the second half of the year. 
Surface Wellhead revenue was up 13% from the second quarter of 2010, driven by strong North American activity. It fell short of our expectations. The international execution issues we discussed during the first quarter call continue to weigh on our results.
We expect international sales to improve in the second half based on orders received in the second quarter, and we also expect execution to improve. Fluid control delivered record sales and earnings again as demand for both our WECO/Chiksan flowline products and our Well Service Pumps continues at unprecedented levels. Results in our other processing businesses grew was expected but did not dilute margins as fluid control continued to represent more of the business than anticipated. As we continue to see the growth of our overall business entering the second half of 2011, we feel confident in maintaining our full year earnings guidance of $1.60 to $1.70 per diluted share.
We believe subsea activity will continue to grow as oil and gas fundamentals remain strong, and the major E&P operators around the world stay committed to deepwater projects. Over the next 3 years, the industry will see more than 70 deepwater drilling rigs enter the market, a 27% increase from where we started in 2011. In the second quarter alone, a net of 11 new deepwater rigs were announced. Although capital spending by our customers is expected to grow at 15% from 2011 to 2012. Preawards in 2012 could increase by as much as 50% but the major project awards could more than double.
Additionally in 2012, we expect to see the expansion of the subsea processing market. As we see the market now, 2012 should be a very strong year for subsea awards. We continue to demonstrate our market-leading position by inbounding more than $900 million subsea orders. More than 50% of this total relates to frame agreements with our partners. In the first half of 2011, we inbounded approximately $1.9 billion of subsea orders, and we believe we can reach $4 billion for the full year.
Let me now talk about 2Q orders we received during the second quarter. Shell Prelude and Petrobras Congro. The Shell Prelude project off the coast of Australia includes a subsea production system to support the world's first floating LNG terminal. Through our exclusive frame agreements we receive a direct award from Shell but we will supply 7 large core production treaties along with production manifold subsea control systems and other related equipment. Ultimately, this project will play a significant role in supplying Asia with the natural gas it needs.
The Petrobras Congro Corvina project represents both the industries and hours seek subsea separation projects. We're supplying 2 systems to perform gas liquid separation for a total of 20 wells in Brazil. Subsea separation and manifold systems that comprise Congro Corvina result in the decommissioning of a platform of these new systems perform other necessary activities on the seabed.
Robotics technology we were able to eliminate multiple actuators and associated controls, allowing us to provide a cost-effective solution for Petrobras. Regarding the Gulf of Mexico, only 7 new permits have been issued for the Gulf of Mexico since our last call. This slow pace has had a negative effect on our aftermarket and equipment orders. Major operators like Chevron, Exxon Mobil, BP and Shell are proceeding with some of their projects even though they have yet to receive permits. And of the independents however, are taking a more cautious approach.
Our Energy Processing business continues to be driven by the exceptional performance fluid control. As our flowline of Well Service Pumps capacity expansion comes online over the next 12 months, we look forward to capitalizing on our customers growing demands. North America shale market is driving the growth in fluid control, is also positively impacting our North America service surface results as demand for our frac assets and surface wellheads in this market continues to grow.
In summary, our market-leading subsea orders were $939 million in the second quarter and are on track to reach $4 billion. Subsea revenue in the quarter grew sequentially by more than $100 million and is on path for $3.3 billion for the year. Fluid control pushed for processing business largest quarter industry and we're adding capacity. Therefore, we're well positioned for a strong second half of the year. Bill will now take you through some of the financial details in the quarter."

Energy production sales for the second quarter were $968 million, an increase of 18% from last year's second quarter and 13% from the first quarter of 2011. Subsea grew both year-over-year and sequentially. As discussed during last quarter",766,"Thanks, John. Energy production sales for the second quarter were $968 million, an increase of 18% from last year's second quarter and 13% from the first quarter of 2011. Subsea grew both year-over-year and sequentially. 
As discussed during last quarter's call, we have a steep revenue growth curve in front of us to reach a $3.3 billion in full year subsea revenue. Our second quarter subsea sales of $795 million keep us on course to achieve the target. This is also consistent with the rapid increase in revenue we expected as our projects proceed through the initial engineering phase.
Surface sales were above the second quarter of 2010, as North American sales increased but sequentially, sales were flat. The majority of the issues that impacted the first quarter results continued, including both delayed shipments and unfavorable mix on international markets. Energy Production generated operating profit of $97 million in the quarter, down 25% from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower margins on both subsea projects and surface. Sequentially, profit increased 18% consistent with the increase in subsea revenue. Margins were 10.1% in the quarter.
For the full year, we now expect these margins to be between 11.5% and 12.5%. This decline is primarily due to the slower than anticipated recovery of our Surface Wellhead business which just had a greater impact on our full year expectations than we thought last quarter. Additionally in subsea, our project cost in the second quarter were higher than we expected.
Both of these businesses should improve in the second half of 2011. Inbound orders in Energy Production were $1.2 billion in the quarter, including subsea orders of $939 million and record orders for our Surface Wellhead business. Backlog now stands at a record $4.5 billion, including a record subsea backlog of $4.2 billion. 
Energy Processing sales were $263 million, up 37% from the prior year quarter and 16% from the first quarter. The year-over-year increase was driven by record sales in our Fluid Control business, led by WECO/Chiksan flowline products and well service pumps. Sequentially almost all the business units in the segment experienced double-digit growth. Energy Processing generated operating profit of $54 million, second quarter margin exceeded 20% as Fluid Control continues to expand. 
The North American market is still growing at levels beyond what we forecasted. Barring some unanticipated interruption to this pattern, we now expect full year margins in the range of 19% to 20% for this segment.
Total inbound orders for Energy Processing reached $340 million, up 51% from last year's second quarter. Majority of the increase came from Fluid Control. Backlog ended the quarter at $421 million.
Now for the corporate items. Corporate expense in the quarter was $10.6 million. We expect to average about $10 million per quarter for the rest of the year. Other expense net was $2 million. This amount was less than expected due to some foreign currency gains of about $4 million during the quarter and lower medical expenses. Our second quarter tax rate was 30.9%. We should average approximately 31% for the remainder of the year.
Capital spending this quarter was $62 million, primarily directed towards our Energy Production businesses. For the full year, our capital spending will range between $200 million and $250 million related to our capacity expansions for facilities in Brazil and Asia Pacific for subsea, and in the U.S. for Fluid Control. 
Additionally, we are adding frac assets to our Surface Wellhead business, primarily in the U.S. At the end of the second quarter, we had net debt position of $45 million. It was comprised of $428 million of cash and $473 million of debt. We averaged 243.8 million of shares outstanding in the quarter. Midway through 2011, our Subsea business is performing consistent with what we expected at the beginning of the year. Our Surface business has underperformed however, but we're confident that this will reverse as we expand our operations in North America and land and our traditionally strong international franchise recoveries, principally on the strength of orders that we received in the second quarter.
In Energy Processing, Fluid Control continues to grow at exceptional levels. With our capacity expansions beginning to come online, our ability to capitalize on increasing customer demands will improve. We're now also starting to see our measurement and material handling and loading systems businesses begin to grow and expect them to contribute at greater levels in the second half of the year. Our guidance for 2011 diluted earnings per share remains at $1.60 to $1.70 per share. Operator, you may now open up the call for questions."

And we mentioned execution issues in the first call, which resulted in delayed shipments. We made a lot of improvements, and we expect the execution issues to be largely behind us in the second half. The other thing that happened is, and we also mentioned this in the first call, was the timing of new inbound for Surface. We'd expected to get the new inbound in earlier so we could convert it to revenue and profits earlier this year. We've now received those orders, and if you kind of back out the Subsea revenue versus or Subsea orders versus production orders, you can see surface inbound was almost record levels. And so we finally got the inbound and our challenge is to convert it to revenue in the balance of the year. So we're pretty confident now that we have the inbound that we can convert it and the Surface performance will improve. The third thing, and we mentioned this also in the first call, is we're ramping up in our North America frac business for Surface, and that includes some expenses, training expenses, setting up new bases and those are largely onetime investments that we're making to support the growth in frac and those will come down over time as well. So those are the 3 areas of Surface execution that we're pretty confident will improve in the second half."

So we're counting and if you look at the details of that, it came from very strong aftermarket revenue. It came a lot from smaller awards from our partners, and to the extent that that continues and it probably will, and then we get the balance of Prelude in the second half, we're really just kind of one modest sized project away from hitting our $4 billion.

So we're pretty much on target for the $4 billion that's where the confidence comes from for 2011. Now the confidence on 2012 is almost a different matter. Because these projects are slipping, some of them has slipped from the end of 2011 into 2012. It really sets 2012 up as a very strong year. If I look at just the number of projects over $100 million, it looks now like maybe there will be 12 to 14 that will be awarded in 2011, which is about the same level we had in 2010.

But the sure least of subsea processing projects that we've talked about before continues to grow and I'd say they are kind of across the board there. They're extensions of existing processing projects subsequent phases, brownfield applications, greenfield applications and pretty much across the spectrum of operators and geography. But the next 2 are probably with Shell and Total West African and the North Sea and that is a healthy list.

Because of it is my project it but your on the right track, Brian. If there are call offs, they're typically coming from partners where they are already incumbent the designs are done maybe we're even using our standard designs for some of these call offs. So the lead time for the conversion from inbound is going to be much shorter. If you take a major EPC contract that includes manifolds, all the infrastructure which is designed to order, you're talking about a much longer period of time and conversion is going to be spread over a long period of time and it won't be even. We've talked about this before that in the early cycle of a major subsea project, mostly doing engineering and based on 100% complete processed, we're not going to convert a lot in the early cycle but when that raw materials most expensive component starts arriving and we start moving real quickly up the conversion curve. And then at a very end while we're doing testing it starts to slow down again. That varies by major project, it's a little hard to predict, but you're on the right track. If they're small orders that are call-offs, they're likely to be converted faster than the major EPC project."

When you have a big large tender that's being competitively bid and with multiple suppliers as they try to rebuild their backlog then you're going to have competitive pricing intensity associated with that very large award. And so in that situation, then frame agreements, which are negotiated are probably going to be, the margins are probably going to be a little more favorable. The other thing is usually our frame agreements are based on standardization, a lot of repeatability. Our cost position is a lot better and again the margins are probably a little bit better for that reason. Now obviously as the market moves in the different direction, that the tendered projects would probably improving pricing and might start to look more similar to a frame agreement ago seated price. So kind of depends on the market environment right now, we're coming out of the downturn so I'd say the frame agreement numbers are better. And may approach more equal to tendered projects particularly in 2012 when we definitely expect pricing to improve as all these awards get made in 2012."

First of all, does the lack of orders in the first half of the year internationally, which really cost some absorption projects in the international locations. And then secondly and not to be underestimated is the investment we're making in North America to fuel the growth. I mean Bill talked about new facilities. He talked about training. He didn't touch on the number of people we're hiring. We're adding significant numbers of people to our service training and apprentice programs, all of which are designed to support the growth that we expect to continue to see in North America. Most of those are big items."

But we see pricing improving in 2012 after the initial tranche of major awards are made, which would improve margins. I think, on the Subsea side, our ability to execute is getting better and better because we have the backlog, our organization is intact. It's prepared for the growth, and I'm very confident that our execution in Subsea will only improve, plus we have the advantage because we'll be going in 2012 presumably with higher backlog. We'll be in a position to convert that backlog of revenue levels that should allow us more leverage in 2012 than what we saw in 2011, that will contribute to better margins. On the Surface side, I think as we pointed out, a lot of it's timing, we've now got the awards and backlog and will be converting back. And the execution is just, which delayed some shipments increased cost, those are largely going to be behind us in the second half of this year. So no, I think 2012 is set up for good execution and not a continuation of what we've experienced this year."

With me today are Bill Schumann, our CFO; and Bob Potter, our Executive Vice President. I'll share with you some highlights from the quarter, bill will provide specifics on our financial performance and outlook for the second half of 2011, and then we'll open up the call for your questions.
First, the results for the quarter. Earnings were $0.39 per diluted share. Subsea performance was largely on track as sales increased 16% sequentially with the growth expected to continue through the remainder of the year. However, overall Energy Production performance was negatively impacted as our Surface Wellhead business continued to experience execution issues. 
Energy Processing continued to perform at record levels during the quarter as Fluid Control benefited from the strength of the North America pressure pumping market. We recorded $1.5 billion in orders during the second quarter, of which $939 million was for the subsea systems and included 20 subsea trees. Subsea backlog now stands at a record level $4.2 billion. 
Total company revenue was $1.2 billion. Subsea revenue for the quarter was $795 million, reflecting the growth of activity in inbound orders booked over the past several quarters. We expect our subsea sales to reach $3.3 billion for the full year as the conversion of subsea backlog accelerates in the second half of the year. 
Surface Wellhead revenue was up 13% from the second quarter of 2010, driven by strong North American activity. It fell short of our expectations. The international execution issues we discussed during the first quarter call continued to weigh on our results. We expect international sales to improve in the second half based on orders received in the second quarter, and we also expect execution to improve. 
Fluid Control delivered record sales and earnings again, as demand for both our WECO/Chiksan flowline products and our Well Service Pumps continues at unprecedented levels. Results in our other processing businesses grew was expected but did not dilute margins as Fluid Control continued to represent more of the business than anticipated. As we continue to see the growth of our overall business entering the second half of 2011, we feel confident maintaining our full year earnings guidance of $1.60 to $1.70 per diluted share.
We believe subsea activity will continue to grow as oil and gas fundamentals remain strong, and the major E&P operators around the world stay committed to deepwater projects. Over the next 3 years, the industry will see more than 70 deepwater drilling rigs enter the market, a 27% increase from where we started 2011. In the second quarter alone, a net of 11 new deepwater rigs were announced. Global capital spending by our customers is expected to grow at 15% from 2011 to 2012. Preawards in 2012 could increase by as much as 50%, while the major project awards could more than double.
Additionally in 2012, we expect to see the expansion of the subsea processing market. As we see the market now, 2012 should be a very strong year for subsea awards. We continue to demonstrate our market-leading position by inbounding more than $900 million in subsea orders. More than 50% of this total relates to frame agreements with our partners. In the first half of 2011, we inbounded approximately $1.9 billion of subsea orders, and we believe we can reach $4 billion for the full year.
Let me now talk about 2Q orders we received during the second quarter. Shell's Prelude and Petrobras' Congro, Corvina. The Shell Prelude project off the coast of Australia includes a subsea production system to support the world's first floating LNG terminal. Through our exclusive frame agreement, we receive a direct award from Shell that we will supply 7 large bore production trees, along with production manifolds, subsea control systems and other related equipment. Ultimately, this project will play a significant role in supplying Asia with the natural gas it needs.
The Petrobras Congro, Corvina project represents both the industry's and our 6 subsea separation projects. We're supplying 2 systems to perform gas liquid separation for a total of 20 wells in Brazil. Subsea separation and manifold systems that comprise Congro, Corvina result in the decommissioning of a platform, as these new systems perform all the necessary activities on the seabed.
Using Shilling Robotics technology, we were able to eliminate multiple actuators and associated controls, allowing us to provide a cost-effective solution for Petrobras. Regarding the Gulf of Mexico, only 7 new permits have been issued for the Gulf of Mexico since our last call. This slow pace has had a negative effect on our aftermarket and equipment orders. Major operators like Chevron, Exxon Mobil, BP and Shell are proceeding with some of their projects even though they have yet to receive permits. Many of the independents, however, are taking a more cautious approach.
Our Energy Processing business continues to be driven by the exceptional performance Fluid Control. As our flowline of well service pump capacity expansion comes online over the next 12 months, we look forward to capitalizing on our customers' growing demands. North America shale market is driving the growth in Fluid Control, is also positively impacting our North America surface results as the demand for our frac assets and surface wellheads in this market continue to grow.
In summary, our market-leading subsea orders were $939 million in the second quarter and are on track to reach $4 billion. Subsea revenue in the quarter grew sequentially by more than $100 million and is on path for $3.3 billion for the year. Fluid Control pushed our processing business to its largest quarter in history and were adding capacity. Therefore, we're well positioned for a strong second half of the year. Bill will now take you through some of the financial details in the quarter."

Energy Production sales for the second quarter were $968 million, an increase of 18% from last year's second quarter and 13% from the first quarter of 2011. Subsea grew both year-over-year and sequentially. As discussed during last quarter",762,"Thanks, John. Energy Production sales for the second quarter were $968 million, an increase of 18% from last year's second quarter and 13% from the first quarter of 2011. Subsea grew both year-over-year and sequentially. 
As discussed during last quarter's call, we have a steep revenue growth curve in front of us to reach $3.3 billion in full year subsea revenue. Our second quarter subsea sales of $795 million keep us on course to achieve this target. This is also consistent with the rapid increase in revenue we expected as our projects proceed through the initial engineering phases.
Surface sales were above the second quarter of 2010, as North American sales increased, but sequentially, sales were flat. The majority of the issues that impacted the first quarter results continued, including both delayed shipments and unfavorable mix on international markets. Energy Production generated operating profit of $97 million in the quarter, down to 25% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower margins on both subsea projects and surface. Sequentially, profit increased 18% consistent with the increase in subsea revenue. Margins were 10.1% in the quarter.
For the full year, we now expect these margins to be between 11.5% and 12.5%. This decline is primarily due to the slower-than-anticipated recovery of our Surface Wellhead business, which just had a greater impact on our full year expectations than we thought last quarter. Additionally in subsea, our project costs in the second quarter were higher than we expected.
Both of these businesses should improve in the second half of 2011. Inbound orders in Energy Production were $1.2 billion in the quarter, including subsea orders of $939 million and record orders for our Surface Wellhead business. Backlog now stands at a record $4.5 billion, including a record subsea backlog of $4.2 billion. 
Energy Processing sales were $263 million, up 37% from the prior year quarter and 16% from the first quarter. The year-over-year increase was driven by record sales in our Fluid Control business, led by WECO/Chiksan flowline products and Well Service Pumps. Sequentially almost all the business units in the segment experienced double-digit growth. Energy Processing generated operating profit of $54 million, second quarter margin exceeded 20% as Fluid Control continues to expand. 
The North American market is still growing at levels beyond what we forecasted. Barring some unanticipated interruption to this pattern, we now expect full year margins in the range of 19% to 20% for this segment. Total inbound orders for Energy Processing reached $340 million, up 51% from last year's second quarter. Majority of the increase came from Fluid Control. Backlog ended the quarter at $421 million.
Now for the corporate items. Corporate expense in the quarter was $10.6 million. We expect to average about $10 million per quarter for the rest of the year. Other expense net was $2 million. This amount was less than expected due to some foreign currency gains of about $4 million during the quarter and lower medical expenses. Our second quarter tax rate was 30.9%. We should average approximately 31% for the remainder of the year.
Capital spending this quarter was $62 million, primarily directed towards our Energy Production businesses. For the full year, our capital spending will range between $200 million and $250 million, related to our capacity expansions for facilities in Brazil and Asia Pacific for subsea, and in the U.S. for Fluid Control. 
Additionally, we're adding frac assets to our Surface Wellhead business, primarily in the U.S. At the end of the second quarter, we had net debt position of $45 million. It was comprised of $428 million of cash and $473 million of debt. We averaged 243.8 million shares outstanding in the quarter. Midway through 2011, our subsea business is performing consistent with what we expected at the beginning of the year. Our surface business has underperformed, however, but we're confident that this will reverse as we expand our operations in North American land and our traditionally strong international franchise recovers, principally on the strength of orders that we received in the second quarter.
In Energy Processing, Fluid Control continues to grow at exceptional levels. With our capacity expansions beginning to come online, our ability to capitalize on increasing customer demands will improve. We're now also starting to see our measurement and material handling and loading systems businesses begin to grow and expect them to contribute at greater levels in the second half of the year. Our guidance for 2011 diluted earnings per share remains at $1.60 to $1.70 per share. Operator, you may now open up the call for questions."

And we mentioned the execution issues in the first call, which resulted in delayed shipments. We made a lot of improvements, and we expect the execution issues to be largely behind us in the second half. The other thing that happened is, and we also mentioned this in the first call, was the timing of new inbound for surface. We'd expected to get the new inbound in earlier, so we could convert it to revenue and profits earlier this year. We've now received those orders, and if you kind of back out the subsea revenue versus or subsea orders versus production orders, you can see surface inbound was almost record levels. And so we finally got the inbound, and now our challenge is to convert it to revenue in the balance of the year. So we're pretty confident now that we have the inbound that we can convert it and the surface performance will improve. The third thing, and we mentioned this also in the first call, is we're ramping up in our North America frac business for surface, and that includes expenses, training expenses, setting up new bases. And those are largely onetime investments that we're making to support the growth in frac, and those will come down over time as well. So those are the 3 areas of surface execution that we're pretty confident will improve in the second half."

So that one could go either way. Wheatstone is another big one, the tender has all been done. They're well through the process, you'd expect that to occur before the end of the year. Still a number, Ichthus [ph] is another one, the bids have been submitted. But then again, this is one that's been delayed in the past. And because it's so close to the end of the year, it could either go into 2011 or slip into 2012. So those are some of the big ones that are still out there.

We had no, I'll call them a mega award of $300 million, $400 million project, single project that was inbound in the second quarter. Yet we almost hit our target of $1 billion. So we're counting and if you look at the details of that, it came from very strong aftermarket revenue. It came a lot from smaller awards from our partners. And to the extent that, that continues and it probably will, and then we get the balance of Prelude in the second half, we're really just kind of 1 modest-sized project away from hitting our $4 billion. And if they don't happen at the very end of 2011, it's likely to happen at the very beginning of 2012. So we're pretty much on target for the $4 billion. That's where the confidence comes from for 2011. Now the confidence on 2012 is almost a different matter. Because these projects are slipping, some of them has slipped from the end of 2011 into 2012. It really sets 2012 up as a very strong year. If I look at just the number of projects over $100 million, it looks now like maybe there will be 12 to 14 that will be awarded in 2011, which is about the same level we had in 2010. Then you get to 2012 and that number almost doubles. And it's evenly distributed throughout the year, so they're not all bunched up like they were in 2011 at the very end. And that's what gives me confidence in the 2012 number being so strong."

That complicated because it varies by project and so forth. But you're on the right track, Brian. If there are call-offs, they're typically coming from partners, they're coming from where we're already incumbent, the designs are done. Maybe we're even using our standard designs for some of these call-offs. So the lead time for the conversion from inbound is going to be much shorter. If you take a major EPC contract that includes trees, manifolds, all the infrastructure, which is designed to order, you're talking about a much longer period of time. And conversion is going to be spread over a long period of time, and it won't be even. We've talked about this before, that in the early cycle of a major subsea project, we're mostly doing engineering. And based on our percent complete processed, we're not going to convert a lot in the early cycle. But when that raw materials, most expensive component, starts arriving, then we start moving real quickly up to the conversion curve. And then at the very end while we're doing testing, it starts to slow down again. So that varies by major project, it's a little hard to predict, but you're on the right track.

When you have a big large tender that's being competitively bid and with multiple suppliers as they try to rebuild their backlog then you're going to have competitive pricing intensity associated with that very large award. And so in that situation, then the frame agreements, which are negotiated awards, are probably going to be, the margins are probably going to be a little more favorable. The other thing is usually our frame agreements are based on standardization, a lot of repeatability. Our cost position is a lot better and again, the margins are probably a little bit better for that reason. Now obviously as the market moves in a different direction, then the tendered projects would probably improve in pricing and might start to look more similar to a frame agreement negotiated price. So it kind of depends on the market environment. Right now, we're coming out of the downturn, so I'd say the frame agreement numbers are better. And may approach more equal to tendered projects, particularly in 2012 when we definitely expect pricing to improve as all these awards get made in 2012."

For whatever reason, subsea always had a big fourth quarter. I think the logic on the big fourth quarter for subsea is reflected in our accounting and the fact that our suppliers wanted to deliver the product to us in their calendar year. And if they deliver inventory to us, we recorded the cost and then include it as progress on our contracts and constantly recognize revenue. And I don't think this year is going to be any different from that. I would expect subsea, which is now a larger part of the total to have a big fourth quarter, and that would drive the whole company to have a big fourth quarter. The flowline business, I think, because of the growth of it, I'm not confident that the fourth quarter is going to be much different than the third quarter.

When you look at 2012, one of the reasons it'll make it such a strong year for subsea awards for the industry is that the expectation that there will be some big numbers for Brazil. As you know, Brazil had their multiyear contracts for their conventional equipment in 2010. We believe that it's time now for Petrobras to award some more trees for presalt. We've heard from Petrobras that they're considering more multiyear contracts, aggregating the requirements for both conventional and pre-salt. The numbers that we're hearing about are very large so the combination of Petrobras needing to get some more trees on order for presalt and this conversation about aggregating the requirements in multiyear contracts is going to be achieved in 2012, that would certainly contribute to 2012 being a very strong year. And then the same is true with Nigeria. We know we've got a big project in Ghana [ph], Erha and so forth. And these projects, which again are largely absent in 2010 and '11 would show up in 2012. And they would contribute to the strong 2012 numbers. So you're right. I think between Brazil and Nigeria, and even some more projects in Angola, for that matter, would definitely contribute to the strong 2012 versus 2011."

I think, on the subsea side, where our ability to execute is getting better and better, and because we have the backlog, our organization is intact. It's prepared for the growth. And I'm very confident that our execution in subsea will only improve, plus we have the advantage because we'll be going in 2012 presumably with higher backlog. We'll be in a position to convert that backlog of revenue levels that should allow us more leverage in 2012 than what we saw in 2011, and that'll contribute to better margins.

With me today are Bill Schumann, our CFO; and Bob Potter, our Executive Vice President. I'll share with you some highlights from the quarter, Bill will provide specifics on our financial performance and outlook for the second half of 2011, and then we'll open up the call for your questions.
First, the results for the quarter. Earnings were $0.39 per diluted share. Subsea performance was largely on track as sales increased 16% sequentially with growth expected to continue through the remainder of the year. However, overall Energy Production performance was negatively impacted as our Surface Wellhead business continued to experience execution issues. 
Energy Processing continued to perform at record levels during the quarter as Fluid Control benefited from the strength of the North America pressure pumping market. We recorded $1.5 billion in orders during the second quarter, of which $939 million was for the subsea systems and included 20 subsea trees. Subsea backlog now stands at a record level $4.2 billion. 
Total company revenue was $1.2 billion. Subsea revenue for the quarter was $795 million, reflecting the growth of activity in inbound orders booked over the past several quarters. We expect our subsea sales to reach $3.3 billion for the full year as the conversion of subsea backlog accelerates in the second half of the year. 
Surface Wellhead revenue was up 13% from the second quarter of 2010, driven by strong North American activity. It fell short of our expectations. The international execution issues we discussed during the first quarter call continued to weigh on our results. We expect international sales to improve in the second half based on orders received in the second quarter, and we also expect execution to improve. 
Fluid Control delivered record sales and earnings again, as demand for both our WECO/Chiksan flowline products and our Well Service Pumps continues at unprecedented levels. Results in our other processing businesses grew as expected but did not dilute margins as Fluid Control continued to represent more of the business than anticipated. As we continue to see the growth of our overall business entering the second half of 2011, we feel confident maintaining our full year earnings guidance of $1.60 to $1.70 per diluted share.
We believe subsea activity will continue to grow as oil and gas fundamentals remain strong, and the major E&P operators around the world stay committed to deepwater projects. Over the next 3 years, the industry will see more than 70 deepwater drilling rigs enter the market, a 27% increase from where we started 2011. In the second quarter alone, a net of 11 new deepwater rigs were announced. Global capital spending by our customers is expected to grow at 15% from 2011 to 2012. Preawards in 2012 could increase by as much as 50%, while the major project awards could more than double.
Additionally in 2012, we expect to see the expansion of the subsea processing market. As we see the market now, 2012 should be a very strong year for subsea awards. We continue to demonstrate our market-leading position by inbounding more than $900 million in subsea orders. More than 50% of this total relates to frame agreements with our partners. In the first half of 2011, we inbounded approximately $1.9 billion of subsea orders, and we believe we can reach $4 billion for the full year.
Let me now talk about 2Q orders we received during the second quarter. Shell's Prelude and Petrobras' Congro, Corvina. The Shell Prelude project off the coast of Australia includes a subsea production system to support the world's first floating LNG terminal. Through our exclusive frame agreement, we received a direct award from Shell that we will supply 7 large bore production trees, along with production manifolds, subsea control systems and other related equipment. Ultimately, this project will play a significant role in supplying Asia with the natural gas it needs.
The Petrobras Congro, Corvina project represents both the industry's and our 6 subsea separation projects. We're supplying 2 systems to perform gas liquid separation for a total of 20 wells in Brazil. Subsea separation and manifold systems that comprise Congro, Corvina result in the decommissioning of a platform, as these new systems perform all the necessary activities on the seabed.
Using Shilling Robotics technology, we were able to eliminate multiple actuators and associated  controls, allowing us to provide a cost-effective solution for Petrobras. Regarding the Gulf of Mexico, only 7 new permits have been issued for the Gulf of Mexico since our last call. This slow pace has had a negative effect on our aftermarket and equipment orders. Major operators like Chevron, Exxon Mobil, BP and Shell are proceeding with some of their projects even though they have yet to receive permits. Many of the independents, however, are taking a more cautious approach.
Our Energy Processing business continues to be driven by the exceptional performance of Fluid Control. As our flowline well service pump capacity expansion comes online over the next 12 months, we look forward to capitalizing on our customers' growing demands. North America shale market is driving the growth in Fluid Control, is also positively impacting our North America surface results as the demand for our frac assets and surface wellheads in this market continue to grow.
In summary, our market-leading subsea orders were $939 million in the second quarter and are on track to reach $4 billion. Subsea revenue in the quarter grew sequentially by more than $100 million and is on path for $3.3 billion for the year. Fluid Control pushed our processing business to its largest quarter in history and we're adding capacity. Therefore, we're well positioned for a strong second half of the year. Bill will now take you through some of the financial details in the quarter."

Energy Production sales for the second quarter were $968 million, an increase of 18% from last year's second quarter and 13% from the first quarter of 2011. Subsea grew both year-over-year and sequentially. As discussed during last quarter",763,"Thanks, John. Energy Production sales for the second quarter were $968 million, an increase of 18% from last year's second quarter and 13% from the first quarter of 2011. Subsea grew both year-over-year and sequentially. 
As discussed during last quarter's call, we have a steep revenue growth curve in front of us to reach $3.3 billion in full year subsea revenue. Our second quarter subsea sales of $795 million keep us on course to achieve this target. This is also consistent with the rapid increase in revenue we expected as our projects proceed through the initial engineering phases.
Surface sales were above the second quarter of 2010, as North American sales increased, but sequentially, sales were flat. The majority of the issues that impacted the first quarter results continued, including both delayed shipments and unfavorable mix on our international markets. Energy Production generated operating profit of $97 million in the quarter, down to 25% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower margins on both subsea projects and surface. Sequentially, profit increased 18% consistent with the increase in subsea revenue. Margins were 10.1% in the quarter.
For the full year, we now expect these margins to be between 11.5% and 12.5%. This decline is primarily due to the slower-than-anticipated recovery of our Surface Wellhead business, which has had a greater impact on our full year expectations than we thought last quarter. Additionally in subsea, our project costs in the second quarter were higher than we expected.
Both of these businesses should improve in the second half of 2011. Inbound orders in Energy Production were $1.2 billion in the quarter, including subsea orders of $939 million and record orders for our Surface Wellhead business. Backlog now stands at a record $4.5 billion, including a record subsea backlog of $4.2 billion. 
Energy Processing sales were $263 million, up 37% from the prior year quarter and 16% from the first quarter. The year-over-year increase was driven by record sales in our Fluid Control business, led by WECO/Chiksan flowline products and Well Service Pumps. Sequentially almost all the business units in the segment experienced double-digit growth. Energy Processing generated operating profit of $54 million, second quarter margin exceeded 20% as Fluid Control continues to expand. 
The North American market is still growing at levels beyond what we forecasted. Barring some unanticipated interruption to this pattern, we now expect full year margins in the range of 19% to 20% for this segment. Total inbound orders for Energy Processing reached $340 million, up 51% from last year's second quarter. Majority of the increase came from Fluid Control. Backlog ended the quarter at $421 million.
Now for the corporate items. Corporate expense in the quarter was $10.6 million. We expect to average about $10 million per quarter for the rest of the year. Other expense net was $2 million. This amount was less than expected due to some foreign currency gains of about $4 million during the quarter and lower medical expenses. Our second quarter tax rate was 30.9%. We should average approximately 31% for the remainder of the year.
Capital spending this quarter was $62 million, primarily directed towards our Energy Production businesses. For the full year, our capital spending will range between $200 million and $250 million, related to our capacity expansions for facilities in Brazil and Asia Pacific for subsea, and in the U.S. for Fluid Control. 
Additionally, we're adding frac assets to our Surface Wellhead business, primarily in the U.S. At the end of the second quarter, we had net debt position of $45 million. It was comprised of $428 million of cash and $473 million of debt. We averaged 243.8 million shares outstanding in the quarter. Midway through 2011, our subsea business is performing consistent with what we expected at the beginning of the year. Our surface business has underperformed, however, but we're confident that this will reverse as we expand our operations in North American land and our traditionally strong international franchise recovers, principally on the strength of orders that we received in the second quarter.
In Energy Processing, Fluid Control continues to grow at exceptional levels. With our capacity expansions beginning to come online, our ability to capitalize on increasing customer demands will improve. We're now also starting to see our measurement and material handling and loading systems businesses begin to grow and expect them to contribute at greater levels in the second half of the year. Our guidance for 2011 diluted earnings per share remains at $1.60 to $1.70 per share. Operator, you may now open up the call for questions."

And we mentioned the execution issues in the first call, which resulted in delayed shipments. We made a lot of improvements, and we expect the execution issues to be largely behind us in the second half. The other thing that happened is, and we also mentioned this in the first call, was the timing of new inbound for Surface. We'd expected to get the new inbound in earlier, so we could convert it to revenue and profits earlier this year. We've now received those orders, and if you kind of back out the subsea revenue versus or subsea orders versus production orders, you can see Surface inbound was almost record levels. And so we finally got the inbound, and now our challenge is to convert it to revenue in the balance of the year. So we're pretty confident now that we have the inbound that we can convert it and the Surface performance will improve. The third thing, and we mentioned this also in the first call, is we're ramping up in our North America frac business for Surface, and that includes expenses, training expenses, setting up new bases. And those are largely onetime investments that we're making to support the growth in frac, and those will come down over time as well. So those are the 3 areas of Surface execution that we're pretty confident will improve in the second half."

We had no, I'll call them a mega award of $300 million, $400 million project, single project that was inbound in the second quarter, yet we almost hit our target of $1 billion. So we're counting -- and if you look at the details of that, it came from very strong aftermarket revenue. It came a lot from smaller awards from our partners. And to the extent that, that continues and it probably will, and then we get the balance of Prelude in the second half, we're really just kind of 1 modest-sized project away from hitting our $4 billion. And if they don't happen at the very end of 2011, it's likely to happen at the very beginning of 2012. So we're pretty much on target for the $4 billion. That's where the confidence comes from for 2011. Now the confidence on 2012 is almost a different matter. If you look at -- because these projects are slipping, some of them have slipped from the end of 2011 into 2012, it really sets 2012 up as a very strong year. If I look at just the number of projects over $100 million, it looks now like maybe there will be 12 to 14 that will be awarded in 2011, which is about the same level we had in 2010. Then you get to 2012 and that number almost doubles. And it's evenly distributed throughout the year, so they're not all bunched up like they were in 2011 at the very end.

That's complicated because it varies by project and so forth. But you're on the right track, Brian. If they're are call-offs, they're typically coming from partners, they're coming from where we're already the incumbent, the designs are done. Maybe we're even using our standard designs for some of these call-offs. So the lead time for the conversion from inbound is going to be much shorter. If you take a major EPC contract that includes trees, manifolds, all the infrastructure, which is designed to order, you're talking about a much longer period of time. And conversion is going to be spread over a long period of time, and it won't be even. We've talked about this before, that in the early cycle of a major subsea project, we're mostly doing engineering. And based on our percent complete processed, we're not going to convert a lot in the early cycle. But when that raw material and those expensive components start arriving, then we start moving real quickly up to the conversion curve. And then at the very end while we're doing testing, it starts to slow down again. So that varies by major project, it's a little hard to predict, but you're on the right track. If they're small orders that are call-offs, they're likely to be converted faster than a major EPC project."

When you have a big large tender that's being competitively bid and with multiple suppliers as they try to rebuild their backlog then you're going to have competitive pricing intensity associated with that very large award. And so in that situation, then the frame agreements, which are negotiated awards, are probably going to be, the margins are probably going to be a little more favorable. The other thing is usually our frame agreements are based on standardization, a lot of repeatability. Our cost position is a lot better and again, the margins are probably a little bit better for that reason. Now obviously as the market moves in a different direction, then the tendered projects would probably improve in pricing and might start to look more similar to a frame agreement negotiated price. So it kind of depends on the market environment. Right now, we're coming out of the downturn, so I'd say the frame agreement numbers are better and may approach more equal to tendered projects, particularly in 2012 when we definitely expect pricing to improve as all these awards get made in 2012."

When you look at 2012, one of the reasons it'll make it such a strong year for subsea awards for the industry is that the expectation that there will be some big numbers for Brazil. As you know, Brazil had their multiyear contracts for their conventional equipment in 2010. We believe that it's time now for Petrobras to award some more trees for pre-salt. We've heard from Petrobras that they're considering more multiyear contracts, aggregating the requirements for both conventional and pre-salt. The numbers that we're hearing about are very large so the combination of Petrobras needing to get some more trees on order for pre-salt and this conversation about aggregating the requirements in multiyear contracts, if that were to get achieved in 2012, that would certainly contribute to 2012 being a very strong year. And then the same is true with Nigeria. We know we've got a big project in Ghana [ph], Erha and so forth. And these projects, which again are largely absent in 2010 and '11 would show up in 2012. And they would contribute to the strong 2012 numbers. So you're right. I think between Brazil and Nigeria, and even some more projects in Angola, for that matter, would definitely contribute to the strong 2012 versus 2011."

I think, on the subsea side, where our ability to execute is getting better and better, and because we have the backlog, our organization is intact. It's prepared for the growth. And I'm very confident that our execution in subsea will only improve, plus we have the advantage because we'll be going in 2012 presumably with higher backlog. We'll be in a position to convert that backlog at revenue levels that should allow us more leverage in 2012 than what we saw in 2011, and that'll contribute to better margins. On the surface side, I think, as we pointed out, a lot of it is timing. We've now got the awards and backlog and we'll be converting that.

With me today are Bill Schumann, our CFO; and Bob Potter, our Executive Vice President. I'll share with you some highlights from the quarter, Bill will provide specifics on our financial performance and expectations for the remainder of the year and then we'll open up the call for your questions. First, the results for the quarter.
Earnings were $0.50 per diluted share. We recorded $1.3 billion in orders during the third quarter of which $731 million or for subsea systems and included 31 subsea trees. Subsea backlog now stands at $3.8 billion.
For the quarter, total company revenue was $1.2 billion and subsea revenue for the quarter was $824 million. Subsea sales increased 33% over last year and 4% sequentially. While this volume was a record, it was below our expectations. Margins were also both our expectations due to volume and execution. We continue to expect our subsea sales will reach $3.3 billion for the full year as our fourth quarter subsea revenue should approach $1 billion. This expectation is consistent with the fourth quarter, typically being our strongest of the year.
Surface Wellhead revenue was up 16% from the third quarter of 2010, driven largely by North American activity. We're starting to see some of the international timing and execution issues we've experienced in prior quarters improve and believe results away forward looking to reflect this improvement. While we will be able to fully recover from these issues in 2011, they will possibly impact our 2012 results.
Fluid Control continues to see a record event driven by North America pressure pumping activity as orders for both our WECO/Chiksan full of products and our Well Service Pumps are at unprecedented levels. We continue to expand our capacity in these areas to better serve this market.
Results on our other processing businesses grew sequentially and almost the same rate as our Fluid Control and margins improved. Entering the fourth quarter in 2011, we expect quarterly earnings to be between $0.46 and $0.51 as improved operational results are offset by less favorable corporate items, therefore, increasing our full year earnings guidance image of $1.70 to $1.75 per diluted share.
During the quarter, we saw increased the volatility in the oil and natural gas prices. At the current price levels however, onshore developments remain economically attractive for our customers. Subsea is a long cycle business with operators taking a longer-term view and therefore, remaining committed to their subsea developers. Operators are now in the stage of their tendering process where they typically begin to announce subsea awards.
Usual operator patterns give us confidence that 2012 should be a very strong year for inbound in the subsea industry. We inbounded $731 million subsea orders during the quarter with no orders in excess of $150 million. Our year-to-date subsea inbound is now at $2.6 billion. We continue to believe we will approach $4 billion and subsea orders for the year as we inbound the remaining portion of shells really project along with an expected additional larger order before year end.
We're starting to see improvement in our Gulf of Mexico order activity. It also appears to pace as permitting is improving. During the quarter, 15 new deepwater permits were issued or 70% of the pre-Macondo average. Large operators proceeded with development plans in the Gulf of Mexico and we're now seeing the independence and gain more confidence as well. Deepwater recounts are also trending favorably, approximately 20 deepwater rigs were working in the Gulf of Mexico at the end of the quarter or about 2/3 of the pre-Macondo total. I'd now like to turn to the subsea processing market and discuss the Petrobras Marlim project.
Last week, we delivered the Marlim subsea process systems to Petrobras on schedule following successful qualification testing. Petrobras is now planing to install this pilot project in November. The Marlim project has been a collaborative effort between Petrobras and FMC to design the world's deepest water and oil separation unit. The ability to separate water from oil at the seafloor provides a solution that boost production rates and extended the financial viability of the Marlim field. The longer-term prospects for these types of systems are encouraging as Petrobras has an excess of 70 wells where similar characteristics with this technology could be applied.
Moving to our Fluid Control business. We continue to perform at record levels and believe this should continue. Our industry-leading WECO/Chiksan flowline equipment continues to be in strong demand. The industry reaction to our well service pump has been positive and as our capacity expansion comes on stream, we should be able to further improve our market position.
In summary, our market-leading subsea orders were $731 million in the third quarter and we think we will approach the $4 billion level for the full year. Subsea revenue in the quarter of a $24 million was our largest ever and we expect $3.3 billion for the year. Fluid Control continues to perform at record levels and we're raising our full year guidance to a range of $1.70 to $1.75 per diluted share. Bill will now take you through some of the financial details in the quarter."
972117,138564195,178036,"FMC Technologies, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2011",2011-10-26,"Earnings Calls","FMC Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. Energy Production sales for the third quarter was slightly above $1 billion, an increase of 32% from last year's third quarter and 5% from the second quarter of 2011. Our third quarter subsea sales of $824 million were up from the second qua",804,"Thanks, John. Energy Production sales for the third quarter was slightly above $1 billion, an increase of 32% from last year's third quarter and 5% from the second quarter of 2011. Our third quarter subsea sales of $824 million were up from the second quarter but as John said, below our estimates. We're still optimistic we can deliver our fourth quarter that reaches our target of $3.3 billion for the full year. We're now in the stages of subsea projects to drive large revenue increases.
However, we are facing some headwinds from the impact of the stronger dollar. Surface sales were 16% above the third quarter of 2010 and increased 7% sequentially on the strength of North American activity. The delayed international orders that impacted the first half of 2011 have now been received and we now have backlog to support continued growth. Energy Production generated operating profits of $115 million in the quarter, an increase of 8% from the prior year quarter as sales increased. Sequentially, profit increased 18%. Production margins at 11.3% in the quarter were below our estimates. Subsea profitability improved sequentially but fell short of our expectations.
While we did gain the benefits of leveraging our SG&A spend in the quarter, we suffered some delays in projects and incurred increased project costs as we ramped up subsea volume to record levels. Surface operations profitability improved sequentially but we are not where we expected to be here either. We anticipate further progress in the fourth quarter in both these businesses.
We now expect Energy Production margins to be between 10.5% and 11.5% for the full year with fourth quarter margins coming in around 12%. Inbound orders in Energy Production were $934 million in the quarter, including subsea orders of $731 million. Backlog now stands at $4.1 billion, including subsea backlog of $3.8 billion. Backlog was impacted by approximately $320 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation as the dollar strengthened during the quarter. For the full year, foreign exchange has impacted backlog negatively by only $18 million.
Energy Processing sales were $286 million, up 48% from the prior quarter and 9% from the second quarter. The year-over-year increase was again driven by record sales in our Fluid Control business. Measurement solutions, loading systems and the other Energy Processing businesses also contributed to the year-over-year increase with over 20% growth.
Energy Processing generated operating profit of $61 million in the quarter, the third quarter margin was 21%. We now expect our fourth quarter margins to be around 20%. Total inbound orders for Energy Processing were $332 million, up 71% from last year's third quarter. The increase came from Fluid Control and measurement solutions. Backlog ended the quarter at a record $459 million.
Now for the corporate items. Corporate expense in the quarter was $9.3 million. Other expense and revenue net reflects income of $2.7 million. This amount was more favorable than expected due to foreign currency gains of $6.3 million. The quarter also benefited from reduced unqualified benefit plan expense and a change in earnout consideration related to an acquisition.
Our third quarter tax rate was 27.4%. The lower rate was reflective of changes in the country mix of our income. We should finish the year with a tax rate of approximately 29% in the fourth quarter.
Capital spending this quarter was $84 million primarily directed towards our Energy Production businesses and again for the full year, we expect our capital spending to come in near $250 million. At the end of the quarter, we had a net debt position of $194 million, this was comprised of $306 million of cash and $530 million of debt.
We averaged to 243.3 million diluted shares outstanding during the quarter, and we repurchased 1.5 million shares of stock during the quarter at an average price of approximately $40 per share. We finished the quarter with 3.3 million shares remaining in our share repurchase program.
Looking at the fourth quarter, our EPS guidance is $0.46 to $0.51 per diluted share. Compared to the third quarter, this guidance includes increased surface and subsea sales and improvements in Energy Production margins in addition to some improvements in the Energy Processing segment. In the fourth quarter though, some of these operational improvements will be offset by increased expenses associated with corporate items. Excluding foreign exchange and some of the special adjustments we had in the third quarter, our normal level of other expense and revenue is $8 million to $9 million per quarter.
In the fourth quarter, we expect there will be $10 million or $0.03 per share above this level and this estimate is included in our EPS guidance. Accordingly, we are adjusting our full year 2011 diluted earnings per share guidance to a range of $1.70 to $1.75.

In the third quarter, we booked about 3 subsea trees related to the Gulf of Mexico but the Gulf of Mexico was strong particularly we had a good aftermarket business in the Gulf of Mexico in addition to the 3 trees.

So even if they move out a quarter, so they can still say in the year And the second thing with regard to the 20 plus projects, many of them are well into the tendering process and so they're at this stage where the vis-à-vis has been submitted or they're under evaluation So that gives us the confidence that not only is the number of projects over $100 million for 2012 larger than 2011 but the likelihood of them being awarded is strong. The other thing is that in 2011, there was a very little Petrobras activity. If you remember, physical, Petrobras came up with multiyear contracts. Those multiyear contracts are largely be completed or consumed and we believe the Petrobras in 2012 needs to start ordering trees and manifolds not only for the conventional equipment but also for pre-salt.

We're going to be selective going into this very strong market for 2012 to be sure that we preserve our margins, if not improve our pricing. So we're going to be selective. But the key to a material price increase in subsea will be those other suppliers who have not rebuild their backlog and I'm sure they need to do that, so they need a couple of awards for each supplier to date where they start feeling that their backlogs are sufficiently rebuilt and then we'll start to see at least I hope anyway, that we'll start to see some pricing change as the other suppliers realize that they're starting to fill up their capacity. So I don't want to necessarily predict the timing and the calendar but I think its safe to say that we're going to have to see a handful, maybe 4 or 5 major awards left next year and distributed over the remaining some supplier before we see some pricing improvement.

So we have reduced our expectations. We've talked a fair amount about the surface issues that we've had. We've had some execution issues on our international business, those have reduced the magnitude but we're still suffering a little bit on the international side of the service business. We expect that by the end of the year that will be remediated. Then comes subsea third quarter and in subsea, I want to be pretty specific here. Let's talk about the top line first It wasn't pricing. The projects we're executing today were generally priced a year ago. It has been entirely our execution. And we had some unplanned expenses in the quarter and we expect those expenses to continue at least through the fourth quarter associated with increased volume. We had revenues of $683 million in then first quarter, we expect $1 billion in the fourth quarter, that's a 45% increase I think in activity from the first quarter to fourth quarter. We've hired 1,500 employees from subsea, up 20% increase in our population. And we haven't executed as well as we anticipated. And that's largely the reason for the reduction from kind of the 11.5% area. And we expect those added expenditures to go away based on increased efficiency of the workforce as we get used  to operating at this higher level. And that's kind of the what happened in the second half of the year."

So assuming that we stay in that range of a small call-offs, and then we add the remainder of Prelude, which was not entered in the third quarter and we definitely expect the remainder of Prelude, which is an amount we still need to spend for that project that being added in the fourth quarter, and then we had a major award, which I'll talk more about, you can get to over $1 billion and that starts to get closer to the $4 billion that we've been talking about. Now what that was that major award? Well, there's 3 that could potentially be awarded in the fourth quarter. Gas pump from the Stockman project. The is under evaluation. It has a chance to get into the fourth quarter probably maybe the lower probability just because it's gas pump and they haven't done a lot of subsea projects. In Western Australia, that project has been tendered under evaluation for the over months. I know the target was originally for that to be awarded in the fourth quarter. So that's still a possibility. And then there's Chevron Wheatstone where the bids have been submitted. It's been under evaluation recently Chevron announced their approval of the go-ahead for that project and I have a lot of confidence that the Wheatstone project in particular will be awarded in the fourth quarter. We're in good positions on all 3 of those projects so we're hopeful that one of those will result in a large order that we need to get close to the $4 billion."

On the non-Petrobras processing opportunities, in 2000 -- there's 1 or 2 that could possibly be still awarded at the end of this year but looking forward to 2012 there's 10 processing projects split evenly between Brownfield and Greenfield, maybe the majority is bursting but there's at least 4 or 5 that has separation components to it.

And so I think what's happened is we've devoted a lot of effort to execution and in Brazil, we've been there long time. We've made a lot of changes so that we could perform at very high levels in a highly active market and I think we're starting to see that especially on our performance to Petrobras. I think Petrobras is so pleased with our performance on Marlim and as well as our projects we're doing for Petrobras and it reflects the investments we've made over the years I'll tell you the one thing that we do worry about and that's the supply chain in Brazil. We've taken a lot of action to shore that up including insourcing and removing things that are out of the supply chain back at our own facility to ensure that our execution is what Petrobras expects. Now I'm not suggesting that we will never have slip-up in Brazil because it is a challenging environment and Petrobras will impose liquidated managed damages.

With me today are Bill Schumann, our CFO; and Bob Potter, our Executive Vice President. I'll share with you some highlights from the quarter, Bill will provide specifics on our financial performance and expectations for the remainder of the year, and then we'll open up the call for your questions. First, the results for the quarter.
Earnings were $0.50 per diluted share. We recorded $1.3 billion in orders during the third quarter, of which $731 million was for subsea systems and included 31 subsea trees. Subsea backlog now stands at $3.8 billion. For the quarter, total company revenue was $1.3 billion and subsea revenue for the quarter was $824 million. Subsea sales increased 33% over last year and 4% sequentially. While this volume was a record, it was below our expectations. Margins were also below our expectations due to both volume and execution. We continue to expect our subsea sales will reach $3.3 billion for the full year as our fourth quarter subsea revenue should approach $1 billion. This expectation is consistent with the fourth quarter typically being our strongest of the year.
Surface Wellhead revenue was up 16% from the third quarter of 2010, driven largely by North American activity. We're starting to see some of the international timing and execution issues we've experienced in prior quarters improve and believe results going forward will continue to reflect this improvement. While we won't be able to fully recover from these issues in 2011, they will possibly impact our 2012 results. Fluid Control continues to see record demand, driven by North America pressure pumping activity, as orders for both our WECO/Chiksan Flowline Products and our Well Service Pumps are at unprecedented levels. We're continuing to expand our capacity in these areas to better serve this market. 
Results on our other processing businesses grew sequentially at almost the same rate as Fluid Control and margins improved. Entering the fourth quarter in 2011, we expect quarterly earnings to be between $0.46 and $0.51 as improved operational results are offset by less favorable corporate items, therefore, increasing our full year earnings guidance image of $1.70 to $1.75 per diluted share.
During the quarter, we saw increased volatility in the oil and natural gas prices. At the current price levels, however, offshore developments remain economically attractive for our customers. Subsea is a long-cycle business with the operators taking a longer-term view and therefore, remaining committed to their subsea developments. Operators are now at the stage in the tendering process, where they typically begin to announce subsea awards. Usual operator patterns give us confidence that 2012 should be a very strong year for inbound in the subsea industry. We inbounded $731 million in subsea orders during the quarter with no orders in excess of $150 million. Our year-to-date subsea inbound is now at $2.6 billion. We continue to believe we will approach $4 billion in subsea orders for the year as we inbound the remaining portion of Shell's Prelude project, along with an expected additional large award before year end.
We're starting to see improvement in our Gulf of Mexico order activity. It also appears the pace of permitting is improving. During the quarter, 15 new deepwater permits were issued or 70% of the pre-Macondo average. Large operators have proceeded with development plans in the Gulf of Mexico, and we're now seeing the independents gain more confidence as well. Deepwater recounts are also trending favorably. Approximately 20 deepwater rigs were working in the Gulf of Mexico at the end of the quarter or about 2/3 of the pre-Macondo total. I'd now like to turn to the subsea processing market and discuss the Petrobras Marlim project.
Last week, we delivered the Marlim subsea process systems to Petrobras on schedule following successful qualification testing. Petrobras is now planning to install this pilot project in November. The Marlim project has been a collaborative effort between Petrobras and FMC to design the world's deepest water and oil separation unit. The ability to separate water from oil at the seafloor provides a solution that boosts production rates and extends the financial viability of the Marlim field. The longer-term prospects for this type of system are encouraging as Petrobras has in excess of 70 wells with similar characteristics where this new technology could be applied.
Moving to our Fluid Control business. We continue to perform at record levels and believe this should continue. Our industry-leading WECO/Chiksan flowline equipment continues to be in strong demand. The industry reaction to our Well Service Pump has been positive. And as our capacity expansion comes on stream, we should be able to further improve our market position.
In summary, our market-leading subsea orders were $731 million in the third quarter, and we think we will approach the $4 billion level for the full year. Subsea revenue in the quarter of $824 million was our largest ever, and we expect $3.3 billion for the year. Fluid Control continues to perform at record levels, and we're raising our full year guidance to a range of $1.70 to $1.75 per diluted share. Bill will now take you through some of the financial details in the quarter."

Energy Production sales for the third quarter was slightly above $1 billion, an increase of 32% from last year's third quarter and 5% from the second quarter of 2011. Our third quarter subsea sales of $824 million were up from the second quarter, but as John said, below our estimates. We're still optimistic we can deliver a fourth quarter that reaches our target of $3.3 billion for the whole year. We're now in the stages of subsea projects that drive large revenue increases. However, we are facing some headwinds from the impact of a stronger dollar. 
Surface sales were 16% above the third quarter of 2010 and increased 7% sequentially on the strength of North American activity. The delayed international orders that impacted the first half of 2011 have now been received, and we now have backlog to support continued growth. Energy Production generated operating profits of $115 million in the quarter, an increase of 8% from the prior year quarter as sales increased. Sequentially, profit increased 18%. Production margins at 11.3% in the quarter were below our estimates. Subsea profitability improved sequentially but fell short of our expectations.
While we did gain the benefits of leveraging our SG&A spend in the quarter, we suffered some delays in projects and incurred increased project costs as we ramped up subsea volume to record levels. Surface operations' profitability improved sequentially, but we are not where we expected to be here either. We anticipate further progress in the fourth quarter in both these businesses.
We now expect Energy Production margins to be between 10.5% and 11.5% for the full year with fourth quarter margins coming in around 12%. Inbound orders in Energy Production were $934 million in the quarter, including subsea orders of $731 million. Backlog now stands at $4.1 billion, including subsea backlog of $3.8 billion. Backlog was impacted by approximately $320 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation as the dollar strengthened during the quarter. For the full year, foreign exchange has impacted backlog negatively by only $108 million.
Energy Processing sales were $286 million, up 48% from the prior quarter and 9% from the second quarter. The year-over-year increase was again driven by record sales in our Fluid Control business. Measurement Solutions, Loading Systems and the other Energy Processing businesses also contributed to the year-over-year increase with over 20% growth.
Energy Processing generated operating profit of $61 million in the quarter, the third quarter margin was 21%. We now expect our fourth quarter margins to be around 20%. Total inbound orders for Energy Processing were $332 million, up 71% from last year's third quarter. The increase came from Fluid Control and Measurement Solutions. Backlog ended the quarter at a record $459 million.
Now for the corporate items. Corporate expense in the quarter was $9.3 million. Other expense and revenue net reflects income of $2.7 million. This amount was more favorable than expected due to foreign currency gains of $6.3 million. The quarter also benefited from reduced nonqualified benefit plan expense and a change in earnout consideration related to an acquisition.
Our third quarter tax rate was 27.4%. The lower rate was reflective of changes in the country mix of our income. We should finish the year with a tax rate of approximately 29% in the fourth quarter. Capital spending this quarter was $84 million primarily directed towards our Energy Production businesses. And again for the full year, we expect our capital spending to come in near $250 million. 
At the end of the quarter, we had a net debt position of $194 million. This was comprised of $336 million of cash and $530 million of debt. We averaged to 243.3 million diluted shares outstanding during the quarter, and we repurchased 1.5 million shares of stock during the quarter at an average price of approximately $40 per share. We finished the quarter with 3.3 million shares remaining in our share repurchase program.
Looking at the fourth quarter, our EPS guidance is $0.46 to $0.51 per diluted share. Compared to the third quarter, this guidance includes increased surface and subsea sales and improvements in Energy Production margins, in addition to some improvements in the Energy Processing segment. In the fourth quarter, though, some of these operational improvements will be offset by increased expenses associated with corporate items. Excluding foreign exchange and some of the special adjustments we had in the third quarter, our normal level of other expense and revenue is $8 million to $9 million per quarter.
In the fourth quarter, we expect that we'll be $10 million or $0.03 per share above this level, and this estimate is included in our EPS guidance. Accordingly, we are adjusting our full year 2011 diluted earnings per share guidance to a range of $1.70 to $1.75. Operator, you may now open up the call for questions."

I think I mentioned in earlier calls that the major operators were generally proceeding with their big developments in the Gulf of Mexico kind of despite the slow pace of permitting. It was the independents that I was a little more concerned about. And quite frankly, over the last quarter, we're seeing the independents start to move out, get permits approved and proceed with their projects. In the third quarter, we booked about 3 subsea trees related to the Gulf of Mexico. But the Gulf of Mexico was strong, particularly in -- we had a good aftermarket business in the Gulf of Mexico in addition to the 3 trees. And you're right, I think typically the Gulf of Mexico is more onesie, twosies because they have the infrastructure. They're tying back to it as opposed to, say, West Africa, where you're going to have a much larger, complex projects. So yes, smaller orders in the Gulf.

When I look at the project list for 2012, it is 20-plus and perhaps just as importantly, it's more evenly distributed over the year. More than half of those 20-plus awards are at least scheduled to be awarded in the first half of the year. So even if they move out a quarter or so, they could still stay in the year. The second thing with regard to the 20-plus projects, many of them are well into the tendering process. And so they're at a stage where the bids have either been submitted or they're under evaluation. So that gives us the confidence that not only is the number of projects over $100 million for 2012 larger than 2011, but the likelihood of them being awarded is strong. The other thing is that in 2011, there was very little Petrobras activity. If you remember, 3 years ago, Petrobras came out with multiyear contracts. Those multiyear contracts would largely be completed or consumed, and we believe that Petrobras in 2012 needs to start ordering trees and manifolds, not only for the conventional equipment but also for pre-salt. So you kind of put that together, plus maybe some improvement in the Gulf of Mexico, and you get a very strong 2012 for subsea awards."

We're going to be selective going into this very strong market in 2012 to be sure that we preserve our margins, if not improve our pricing. So we're going to be selective. But the key to a material price increase in subsea will be those other suppliers who have not rebuilt their backlog. And I'm sure they need to do that. So we need a couple of awards for each supplier to date where they start feeling that their backlogs are sufficiently rebuilt and then we'll start to see, at least I hope anyway, that we'll start to see some pricing change as the other suppliers realize that they're starting to fill up their capacity. So I don't want to necessarily predict the timing in the calendar. But I think it's safe to say that we're going to have to see a handful, maybe 4 or 5 major awards left next year and then distributed over the remaining subsea supplier before we see some pricing improvement. And I think that sort of means that it'd be later in the year possibly. And then we'd have to be able to convert those orders with better pricing pretty darn fast to get into 2012 revenues.

Increasingly, we see more majors and NOCs in the shale plays that we think plays well for us. And that's really more dead center for our kind of customer base, and so that's working well for us. And as John said, we're continuing to invest aggressively, not only in the equipment to be utilized on the drilling applications but also in facilities. We're continuing to expand our footprint particularly in the liquid-rich shale environment."

Our guidance had implied about a 13% margin in the second half of 2011, Q3 and Q4. And our current results in Q3 plus our guidance for Q4 would imply about 11.5% margin. So we have reduced our expectations. We've talked a fair amount about the surface issues that we've had. We've had some execution issues in our international business. Those have reduced in magnitude, but we're still suffering a little bit on the international side of the surface business. We expect that by the end of the year that will be remediated. Then comes subsea. And in subsea, I want to be pretty specific here. Let's talk about the top line first. It wasn't pricing, the projects we're executing today were generally priced a year ago. It has been entirely our execution. And we had some unplanned expenses in the quarter and we expect those expenses to continue at least through the fourth quarter associated with increased volume. We had revenues of $683 million in the first quarter. We expect $1 billion in the fourth quarter. That's a 45% increase, I think, in activity from the first quarter to fourth quarter. We've hired 1,500 employees in subsea, about 20% increase in our population. And we haven't executed as well as we anticipated. And that's largely the reason for the reduction from kind of the 13% area to the 11.5% area. And we expect those added expenditures to go away based on increased efficiency of the workforce as we get used to operating at this higher level. And that's kind of the -- what happened in the second half of the year."

And I think the third quarter is a good example, in that we entered $731 million without a project over $150 million. So assuming that we stay in that range of small call-offs, and then we add the remainder of Prelude, which was not entered in the third quarter. And we definitely expect the remainder of Prelude, which is the manifolds which they need for that project, that being entered into the fourth quarter. And then we add a major award, which I'll talk more about, you can get to over $1 billion, and that starts to get closer to the $4 billion that we've been talking about. Now what is that major award? Well, there's 3 that could potentially be awarded in the fourth quarter. Gazprom Stockman project, the bids have been submitted, it's under evaluation. It has a chance to get into the fourth quarter, probably maybe the lower probability just because it's Gazprom and they haven't done a lot of subsea projects. INPEX Ichthys in Western Australia, that project has been tendered. It's been under evaluation for 3 or 4 months. I know the target was originally for that to be awarded in the fourth quarter. So that's still a possibility. And then there's Chevron Wheatstone, where the bids have been submitted. It's been under evaluation. Recently Chevron announced their approval of the go-ahead for that project. And I have a lot of confidence that the Wheatstone project, in particular, will be awarded in the fourth quarter. We're in good positions on all 3 of those projects, so we're hopeful that one of those results in a large order that we need to get close to the $4 billion."

And again, we should expect that once the pilot is complete, that they'll move ahead and apply that technology to their other fields where the application is similar. On non-Petrobras processing opportunities, in 2000 -- there's 1 or 2 that could possibly be still awarded at the end of this year. But looking forward to 2012, there's almost 10 named processing projects split evenly between brownfield and greenfield.

By building our backlog, to a large extent through our frame agreements with our suppliers, we're in a position to be selective on these certain projects that are coming up and to demonstrate that leadership as we've done on a number of projects that we walked away from last year because we weren't satisfied with the pricing, while others picked that up. There's been some of the more notable ones are in Petrobras' multiyear award, where although we're the market leader in Brazil, we chose to focus on the higher-end technology projects rather than the more price-sensitive conventional equipment. So I think we've demonstrated strongly our leadership by walking away from certain projects that don't meet our pricing expectations and focusing on where we're strong, on the high technology side, where we can earn better margins. So I think Marlim is a wonderful example of that. We're supporting Petrobras on the high-end equipment where we can get better pricing."

Almost 1/2 of it, frankly, is in Norwegian krona and about 25% is in Brazilian reais. And I'm talking about subsea backlog now. And so during the quarter, with the strength of the dollar, those projects that were in backlog declined by, I think, $308 million. So if you took our beginning backlog at the end of Q2 and added our inbound and subtracted our sales, you'd still have to take $308 million off to make it all fit to the $3.8 billion that we ended the quarter with. Now that's backlog. When it flows through our income statement, for instance, in a Norwegian krona contract, we've got costs in dollars, euros and pounds. And so we hedge all of those back into NOKs, so that the contract itself has NOK revenue and NOK costs. So we don't have any margin exposure to currency. But when it does flow through the income statement, if the dollar strengthens, it comes through as lower sales and lower earnings but the same margin as a percent."

And I think we're seeing the results of it, that now when our on-time delivery performance to Petrobras, despite our high activity rate, is one of the best we've ever been at. And then I think Marlim again, not to harp too much on that, but that's a really good example. Here's a brand-new technology, the designs are new, the manufacturing was all new, and it's delivered on schedule and on budget. And so I think what's happened is that we've devoted a lot of effort to execution in Brazil. We've been there a long time. We've made a lot of changes so that we could perform at very high levels in a highly active market. And I think we're starting to see that, especially on our performance to Petrobras. I think Petrobras is so pleased with our performance on Marlim and as well as our projects we're doing for Petrobras. And it reflects the investments that we've made over the years. I'll tell you the one thing that we do worry about, and that's the supply chain in Brazil. We've taken a lot of action to shore that up, including insourcing and removing things that we're out in the supply chain back into our own facility to ensure that our execution is what Petrobras expects. Now I'm not suggesting we will never have a slip-up in Brazil because it is a challenging environment and Petrobras will impose liquidated managed damages.

Our level of local content, I think, is one of the highest in the industry. We're the only company I know of that actually assembles and tests subsea controls in-country. To get it a lot higher is going to be a challenge for the whole industry because a lot of the stuff that's not currently done in Brazil is because there isn't a capability. So it's going to be a real challenge to take it a lot higher. But there's pressure from Petrobras to try to do that.

With me today are Bill Schumann, our CFO; and Bob Potter, our Executive Vice President. I'll share with you some highlights from the quarter, Bill will provide specifics on our financial performance and expectations for the remainder of the year, and then we'll open up the call for your questions. First, the results for the quarter.
Earnings were $0.50 per diluted share. We recorded $1.3 billion in orders during the third quarter, of which $731 million was for subsea systems and included 31 subsea trees. Subsea backlog now stands at $3.8 billion. For the quarter, total company revenue was $1.3 billion and subsea revenue for the quarter was $824 million. Subsea sales increased 33% over last year and 4% sequentially. While this volume was a record, it was below our expectations. Margins were also below our expectations due to both volume and execution. We continue to expect our subsea sales will reach $3.3 billion for the full year as our fourth quarter subsea revenue should approach $1 billion. This expectation is consistent with the fourth quarter typically being our strongest of the year.
Surface Wellhead revenue was up 16% from the third quarter of 2010, driven largely by North American activity. We're starting to see some of the international timing and execution issues we've experienced in prior quarters improve and believe results going forward will continue to reflect this improvement. While we won't be able to fully recover from these issues in 2011, they will positively impact our 2012 results. Fluid Control continues to see record demand, driven by North America pressure pumping activity, as orders for both our WECO/Chiksan Flowline Products and our Well Service Pumps are at unprecedented levels. We're continuing to expand our capacity in these areas to better serve this market. 
Results on our other processing businesses grew sequentially at almost the same rate as Fluid Control and margins improved. Entering the fourth quarter of 2011, we expect quarterly earnings to be between $0.46 and $0.51 as improved operational results are offset by less favorable corporate items, therefore, increasing our full year earnings guidance to a range of $1.70 to $1.75 per diluted share.
During the quarter, we saw increased volatility in oil and natural gas prices. At the current price levels, however, offshore developments remain economically attractive for our customers. Subsea is a long-cycle business with the operators taking a longer-term view and therefore, remaining committed to their subsea developments. Operators are now at the stage in the tendering process, where they typically begin to announce subsea awards. Usual operator patterns give us confidence that 2012 should be a very strong year for inbound in the subsea industry. We inbounded $731 million in subsea orders during the quarter with no orders in excess of $150 million. Our year-to-date subsea inbound is now at $2.6 billion. We continue to believe we will approach $4 billion in subsea orders for the year as we inbound the remaining portion of Shell's Prelude project, along with an expected additional large award before year end.
We're starting to see improvement in our Gulf of Mexico order activity. It also appears the pace of permitting is improving. During the quarter, 15 new deepwater permits were issued or 70% of the pre-Macondo average. Large operators have proceeded with development plans in the Gulf of Mexico, and we're now seeing the independents gain more confidence as well. Deepwater recounts are also trending favorably. Approximately 20 deepwater rigs were working in the Gulf of Mexico at the end of the quarter or about 2/3 of the pre-Macondo total. 
I'd now like to turn to the subsea processing market and discuss the Petrobras Marlim project. Last week, we delivered the Marlim subsea process system to Petrobras on schedule following successful qualification testing. Petrobras is now planning to install this pilot project in November. The Marlim project has been a collaborative effort between Petrobras and FMC to design the world's deepest water and oil separation unit. The ability to separate water from oil at the seafloor provides a solution that boosts production rates and extends the financial viability of the Marlim field. The longer-term prospects for this type of system are encouraging as Petrobras has in excess of 70 wells with similar characteristics where this new technology could be applied.
Moving to our Fluid Control business. We continue to perform at record levels and believe this should continue. Our industry-leading WECO/Chiksan Flowline equipment continues to be in strong demand. The industry reaction to our Well Service Pump has been positive. And as our capacity expansion comes on stream, we should be able to further improve our market position.
In summary, our market-leading subsea orders were $731 million in the third quarter, and we think we will approach the $4 billion level for the full year. Subsea revenue in the quarter of $824 million was our largest ever, and we expect $3.3 billion for the year. Fluid Control continues to perform at record levels, and we're raising our full year guidance to a range of $1.70 to $1.75 per diluted share. Bill will now take you through some of the financial details in the quarter."

Energy Production sales for the third quarter was slightly above $1 billion, an increase of 32% from last year's third quarter and 5% from the second quarter of 2011. Our third quarter subsea sales of $824 million were up from the second quarter, but as John said, below our estimates. We're still optimistic we can deliver a fourth quarter that reaches our target of $3.3 billion for the whole year. We're now in the stages of subsea projects that drive large revenue increases. However, we are facing some headwinds from the impact of a stronger dollar. 
Surface sales were 16% above the third quarter of 2010 and increased 7% sequentially on the strength of North American activity. The delayed international orders that impacted the first half of 2011 have now been received, and we now have backlog to support continued growth. Energy Production generated operating profits of $115 million in the quarter, an increase of 8% from the prior year quarter as sales increased. Sequentially, profit increased 18%. Production margins at 11.3% in the quarter were below our estimates. Subsea profitability improved sequentially but fell short of our expectations.
While we did gain the benefits of leveraging our SG&A spend in the quarter, we suffered some delays in projects and incurred increased project costs as we ramped up subsea volume to record levels. Surface operations' profitability improved sequentially, but we are not where we expected to be here either. We anticipate further progress in the fourth quarter in both these businesses.
We now expect Energy Production margins to be between 10.5% and 11.5% for the full year with fourth quarter margins coming in around 12%. Inbound orders in Energy Production were $934 million in the quarter, including subsea orders of $731 million. Backlog now stands at $4.1 billion, including subsea backlog of $3.8 billion. Backlog was impacted by approximately $320 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation as the dollar strengthened during the quarter. For the full year, foreign exchange has impacted backlog negatively by only $108 million.
Energy Processing sales were $286 million, up 48% from the prior year quarter and 9% from the second quarter. The year-over-year increase was again driven by record sales in our Fluid Control business. Measurement Solutions, Loading Systems and the other Energy Processing businesses also contributed to the year-over-year increase with over 20% growth. Energy Processing generated operating profit of $61 million in the quarter, the third quarter margin was 21%. We now expect our fourth quarter margins to be around 20%. Total inbound orders for Energy Processing were $332 million, up 71% from last year's third quarter. The increase came from Fluid Control and Measurement Solutions. Backlog ended the quarter at a record $459 million.
Now for the corporate items. Corporate expense in the quarter was $9.3 million. Other expense in revenue net reflects income of $2.7 million. This amount was more favorable than expected due to foreign currency gains of $6.3 million. The quarter also benefited from reduced nonqualified benefit plan expense and a change in earnout consideration related to an acquisition.
Our third quarter tax rate was 27.4%. The lower rate was reflective of changes in the country mix of our income. We should finish the year with a tax rate of approximately 29% in the fourth quarter. Capital spending this quarter was $84 million primarily directed towards our Energy Production businesses. And again for the full year, we expect our capital spending to come in near $250 million. 
At the end of the quarter, we had a net debt position of $194 million. This was comprised of $336 million of cash and $530 million of debt. We averaged 243.3 million diluted shares outstanding during the quarter, and we repurchased 1.5 million shares of stock during the quarter at an average price of approximately $40 per share. We finished the quarter with 3.3 million shares remaining in our share repurchase program.
Looking at the fourth quarter, our EPS guidance is $0.46 to $0.51 per diluted share. Compared to the third quarter, this guidance includes increased surface and subsea sales and improvements in Energy Production margins, in addition to some improvements in the Energy Processing segment. In the fourth quarter, though, some of these operational improvements will be offset by increased expenses associated with corporate items. Excluding foreign exchange and some of the special adjustments we had in the third quarter, our normal level of other expense and revenue is $8 million to $9 million per quarter.
In the fourth quarter, we expect that we'll be $10 million or $0.03 per share above this level, and this estimate is included in our EPS guidance. Accordingly, we are adjusting our full year 2011 diluted earnings per share guidance to a range of $1.70 to $1.75. Operator, you may now open up the call for questions."

In the third quarter, we booked about 3 subsea trees related to the Gulf of Mexico. But the Gulf of Mexico was strong, particularly in -- we had a good aftermarket business in the Gulf of Mexico in addition to the 3 trees.

More than half of those 20-plus awards are at least scheduled to be awarded in the first half of the year. So even if they move out a quarter or so, they could still stay in the year. The second thing with regard to the 20-plus projects, many of them are well into the tendering process. And so they're at a stage where the bids have either been submitted or they're under evaluation. So that gives us confidence that not only is the number of projects over $100 million for 2012 larger than 2011, but the likelihood of them being awarded is strong. The other thing is that in 2011, there was very little Petrobras activity. If you'll remember, 3 years ago, Petrobras came out with multiyear contracts. Those multiyear contracts would largely be completed or consumed, and we believe that Petrobras in 2012 needs to start ordering trees and manifolds, not only for the conventional equipment but also for pre-salt. So you kind of put that together, plus maybe some improvement in the Gulf of Mexico, and you get a very strong 2012 for subsea awards."

But the key to a material price increase in subsea will be those other suppliers who have not rebuilt their backlog. And I'm sure they need to do that. So we need a couple of awards for each supplier so they -- where they start feeling that their backlogs are sufficiently rebuilt and then we'll start to see, at least I hope anyway, that we'll start to see some pricing change as the other suppliers realize that they're starting to fill up their capacity. So I don't want to necessarily predict the timing and the calendar. But I think it's safe to say that we're going to have to see a handful, maybe 4 or 5 major awards left next year and then distributed over the remaining subsea supplier before we see some pricing improvement. And I think that sort of means that it'd be later in the year possibly. And then we'd have to be able to convert those orders with better pricing pretty darn fast to get into 2012 revenues.

Historically, our surface business had been more weighed toward the international side, where we have very strong positions. But because of the North America activity, we've seen substantial growth. And in fact, the Surface Wellhead inbound increase has come almost exclusively from North America and that's because of our success in participation in the shale plays. In particular, we've had a lot of success in frac rental equipment. And throughout the year, we've increased our investment in these assets. So I think it's been very, very positive for us. It's allowed us to increase our market share in North America because we've been able to respond to the growth, especially in this frac rental equipment. So I think -- I mean, I don't necessarily want to predict North America activity, but I think quarter-over-quarter, we saw a big improvement in Surface Wellhead."

Our guidance had implied about a 13% margin in the second half of 2011, Q3 and Q4. And our current results in Q3 plus our guidance for Q4 would imply about 11.5% margin. So we have reduced our expectations. We've talked a fair amount about the surface issues that we've had. We've had some execution issues in our international business. Those have reduced in magnitude, but we're still suffering a little bit on the international side of the surface business. We expect that by the end of the year that will be remediated. Then comes subsea. And in subsea, I want to be pretty specific here. Let's talk about the top line first. It wasn't pricing. The projects we're executing today were generally priced a year ago. It has been entirely our execution. And we had some unplanned expenses in the quarter and we expect those expenses to continue at least through the fourth quarter associated with increased volume. We had revenues of $683 million in the first quarter. We expect $1 billion in the fourth quarter. That's a 45% increase, I think, in activity from the first quarter to the fourth quarter. We've hired 1,500 employees in subsea, about 20% increase in our population. And we haven't executed as well as we anticipated. And that's largely the reason for the reduction from kind of the 13% area to the 11.5% area. And we expect those added expenditures to go away based on increased efficiency of the workforce as we get used to operating at this higher level. And that's kind of the -- what happened in the second half of the year."

And I think the third quarter is a good example, in that we entered $731 million without a project over $150 million. So assuming that we stay in that range of small call-offs, and then we add the remainder of Prelude, which was not entered in the third quarter, and we definitely expect the remainder of Prelude, which is the manifolds which they need for that project, that being entered into the fourth quarter. And then we add a major award, which I'll talk more about, you get to over $1 billion, and that starts to get closer to the $4 billion that we've been talking about. Now what is that major award? Well, there's 3 that could potentially be awarded in the fourth quarter. Gazprom Stockman project, the bids have been submitted, it's under evaluation. It has a chance to get into the fourth quarter, probably maybe the lower probability just because it's Gazprom and they haven't done a lot of subsea projects. INPEX Ichthys in Western Australia, that project has been tendered. It's been under evaluation for 3 or 4 months. I know the target was originally for that to be awarded in the fourth quarter. So that's still a possibility. And then there's Chevron Wheatstone, where the bids have been submitted. It's been under evaluation. Recently Chevron announced their approval of the go-ahead for that project. And I have a lot of confidence that the Wheatstone project, in particular, will be awarded in the fourth quarter. We're in good positions on all 3 of those projects, so we're hopeful that one of those results in a large order that we need to get closer to $4 billion."

But then they'll be very anxious to start expanding the application of that technology to their 70 other wells. And I can't predict when that will happen. But assuming the pilot goes well, we should expect that to happen. So they're very interested and it's very important to them. And again, we should expect that once the pilot is complete, that they'll move ahead and apply that technology to their other fields where the application is similar. On non-Petrobras processing opportunities, in 2000 -- there's 1 or 2 that could possibly be still awarded at the end of this year. But looking forward to 2012, there's almost 10 named processing projects split evenly between brownfield and greenfield. Maybe the majority is boosting, but there's at least 4 or 5 that have separation components to it. These will move around a lot, and I'm not sure all 10 will survive in 2012.

We are showing leadership on the pricing side. And I think I referred to that earlier. By building our backlog, to a large extent through our frame agreements and our suppliers, we're in a position to be selective on these certain projects that are coming up and to demonstrate that leadership as we've done on a number of projects that we walked away from last year because we weren't satisfied with the pricing, while others picked that up. Some of the more notable ones are in Petrobras' multiyear award, where although we're the market leader in Brazil, we chose to focus on the higher-end technology projects rather than the more price-sensitive conventional equipment. So I think we've demonstrated strongly our leadership by walking away from certain projects that don't meet our pricing expectations and focusing on where we're strong, on the high technology side, where we can earn better margins. So I think Marlim is a wonderful example of that. We're supporting Petrobras on the high-end equipment where we can get better pricing."

As a matter of fact, in this quarter -- well, first of all, we carry our backlog in multiple currencies. Almost 1/2 of it, frankly, is in Norwegian krona and about 25% is in Brazilian reais.

Almost 1/2 of it, frankly, is in Norwegian krona and about 25% is in Brazilian reais. And I'm talking about subsea backlog now. And so during the quarter, with the strength of the dollar, those projects that were in backlog declined by, I think, $308 million. So if you took our beginning backlog at the end of Q2 and added our inbound and subtracted our sales, you'd still have to take $308 million off to make it all fit to the $3.8 billion that we ended the quarter with. Now that's backlog. When it flows through our income statement, for instance, in a Norwegian krona contract, we've got costs in dollars, euros and pounds. And so we hedge all of those back into NOKs, so that the contract itself has NOK revenue and NOK costs. So we don't have any margin exposure to currency. But when it does flow through the income statement, if the dollar strengthens, it comes through as lower sales and lower earnings but the same margin as a percent. And that impacted backlog in the third quarter. Some of that has already reversed. The dollar has weakened, given about half of what they took in the Norwegian krona in the third quarter."

And I think we're seeing the results of it, that now when our on-time delivery performance to Petrobras, despite our high activity rate, is one of the best we've ever been at. And then I think Marlim again, not to harp too much on that, but that's a really good example. Here's brand-new technology, the designs are new, the manufacturing was all new and it's delivered on schedule and on budget. And so I think what's happened is that we've devoted a lot of effort to execution in Brazil. We've been there a long time. We've made a lot of changes so that we could perform at very high levels in a highly active market. And I think we're starting to see that, especially in our performance to Petrobras. I think Petrobras is so pleased with our performance on Marlim and as well as our other projects we're doing for Petrobras. And it reflects the investments that we've made over the years. I'll tell you the one thing that we do worry about, and that's the supply chain in Brazil. We've taken a lot of action to shore that up, including insourcing and removing things that were out in the supply chain back into our own facility to ensure that our execution is what Petrobras expects. Now I'm not suggesting we will never have a slip-up in Brazil because it is a challenging environment and Petrobras will impose liquidated managed damages.

Our level of local content, I think, is one of the highest in the industry. We're the only company I know of that actually assembles and tests subsea controls in-country. To get it a lot higher is going to be a challenge for the whole industry because a lot of the stuff that's not currently done in Brazil is because there isn't the capability.
