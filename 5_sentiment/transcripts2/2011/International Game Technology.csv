I would characterize our fiscal first quarter as a reflection of the remarkable improvement we have made in our profitability and in our internal processes. I would also characterize this quarter as quiet, no big surprises, not a lot of negative noise and a clear indication that we are headed in the right direction. 
While the top line continues to reflect the sluggish market, we continue to make progress towards our objective of delivering more meaningful revenue growth and healthier game operation deals in the future. 
In the current global economic environment, it is absolutely the right decision to be customer-minded and incorporate feedback from the market into our business plans. We need to ensure that we are doing the right things in the most efficient manner in every part of our business. We have improved internal processes and positioned ourselves to capture increased earnings and cash flows when customer demand returns. 
Additionally, we have worked to put our cost structure and balance sheet into the best shape possible. Our products are much improved, and they are delivering the excitement that players expect. We are poised to capture the exciting opportunities in front of us, and we are confident in our ability to further demonstrate our position as an industry leader. 
Importantly exhibited the potential of our product development process at G2E with our incredible lineup of new products. It's very rewarding to see the fruits of our labors. The recent opening of the Trojan Casino in Lisbon, Portugal, where we captured 70% of the floor and the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, where we deployed 50% of the machines on the floor, showcase our unique ability to serve all access of the next generation casino. In both cases, our server-based systems, combined with our games, allow us to help our partners differentiate themselves with the market-leading slot floor. 
We have also seen incredible levels of server-based adoption in the high limit area of slot floors across the country. The order volume for our server-based Tier 1 installs has never been better. We have always believed that sbX was one to be a best-in-class solution and now, our customers can adopt it much more quickly and inexpensively. 
Following G2E, we deployed our American Idol and Wheel of Fortune Triple Spin games on our new Centerstage platforms. Both new games are performing much better than floor averages and above our lofty expectations. We have quickly established this platform as a much-needed fixture on slot floors across the country, and we are readying a spectacular lineup of games to further strengthen this format. 
Our Centerstage platform is upgradable, with minimal capital costs and limited downtime, improving returns for both our customers and our shareholders. Our 30-day exclusive with MGM Properties on our American Idol game could not have gone better. You will soon see the American Idol game prevalent around the globe. 
Our high-performing Sex and the City Game has now reached an installed base count of over 1,800 and continues to outperform our wildest expectations. 
While our International business had a respectable quarter, the installation of Casino Rosario in our first fiscal quarter of 2010 creates a difficult benchmark for this year's results. We have built a very formidable international presence, but going forward,  will drive increased sales and enhanced profits around the globe. I will now ask Pat to go over some of the financial details of the first quarter. Pat?"
281438,117653366,93348,"International Game Technology, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 20, 2011",2011-01-20,"Earnings Calls","International Game Technology","Executives","Thanks, Patti, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter earnings from continuing operations totaled $73 million or $0.25 per share, exclusive of $0.04 per share related to certain tax benefits and a gain from the sale of our equity investments in C",899,"Thanks, Patti, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter earnings from continuing operations totaled $73 million or $0.25 per share, exclusive of $0.04 per share related to certain tax benefits and a gain from the sale of our equity investments in China LotSynergy Holdings. The details are provided in this afternoon's press release. 
This quarter's earnings compared to income from continuing operations at $75 million or $0.26 in last year's first quarter. As Patti mentioned, I think it was definitely a good quarter on the gross margin line but left room for improvement on the top line. It is also our first quarter in quite some time without a lot of negative noise, possibly indicative of better times on the horizon. 
Our consolidated revenues for the first quarter were $465 million, of which 56% were generated by gaming operations, and the remainder came from product sales. Gross margins for the company was at 59%, which is up 200 basis points year-on-year, mainly due to increased gross profit margin and product sales. That said, gross margins were up company-wide. 
We also had a respectable quarter on our gaming operations business, and we continue to see stabilization yields with a return hopefully to more normal seasonal patterns. Game ops revenues were $261 million in the first quarter, which was down 3% sequentially and 6% year-on-year, mainly due to a lower installed base in both periods and decreased revenue compared to the sequential quarter. 
Gross margins increased 100 basis points to 63% over the prior year quarter, primarily due to the removal of lower yield and charitable games in Alabama. We earned an average of $50.38 on revenue per unit per day, which is up $1.13 compared to last year's first quarter. While the installed base isn't expected to grow meaningfully this year, we have begun in earnest to replace some of our older participation games with new titles and platforms, a trend that should continue and may accelerate. 
IGT's installed base ended the first quarter at 56,700 units, down 5,400 units over the prior year, largely attributable to the closing of Alabama and the conversion of leased units to for sale in Mexico. Approximately 82% of our installed base is comprised of variable fee games that earn a percentage of machine play rather than a fixed daily fee. 
Product sales revenues totaled $204 million for the quarter compared to $238 million in the first quarter last year, mainly due to softer sales internationally. Worldwide, we recognized 9,400 machines during the quarter, down from the prior year 11,900. International product sales revenue totaled $70 million on volume of 4,300 units for the current quarter compared to $103 million and 6,400 units in the prior year quarter. The decrease in revenues is primarily due to fewer new openings and expansions in the quarter versus last year. 
Fiscal year 2011 is expected to be a lighter and in expansion units versus last year or next year. Worldwide non-machine revenues, mainly from the sales of systems, conversions and intellectual property fees, came in at $81 million for the quarter or 40% of total product sales compared to $77 million or 32% of total product sales in the previous year. Product sales gross margins were 55% for the quarter, up 300 basis points from the prior year, due to a stronger mix of non-machine sales combined with an improved geographic mix. 
First quarter operating expenses were $155 million, up slightly versus last year's first quarter due to higher R&D costs. We expect total R&D expenses for the full year to remain similar to fiscal 2010. Total SG&A was down $2.4 million, primarily due to lower bad debt expenses. We expect to see SG&A stay about flat on a dollar basis when compared to fiscal '10 as we invest in the people and processes necessary to take advantage of the expected industry turnaround and new business opportunities. Overall, operating expenses were 33% of total revenues this quarter, roughly in line with the prior sequential quarters. 
In the quarter, we recognized tax benefits of $7 million or approximately $0.03 per share from the implementation of certain tax strategies and the reinstatement of the research and development tax credit. As a result, the tax rate for the current quarter was 29%. We expect the tax rate to be 36% in each of the next three quarters or approximately 34% for the full year. 
Cash and equivalents and short-term investments, inclusive of restricted amounts, totaled $254 million at December 31, 2010, compared to $249 million at September 30, 2010. Contractual debt obligations totaled $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter compared to $1.8 billion at the end of September. We have now reached a significant goal on our cash management strategy. We now have virtually our entire revolver available, giving us more options for our cash. 
In the first quarter, we generated $42 million on free cash flow after dividends, down from $98 million last year, mainly due to higher inventories and jackpot payments. The inventory increase was due to our strong rollout of new platforms and games and to the timing of shipments around quarter end. We also had a higher proportion of people taking upfront lump-sum payments for our jackpots during the quarter. This concludes my prepared remarks regarding our first quarter results. Thanks for your time and attention. I'll now turn it back over to Patti."

For the first time in quite a while and certainly during my tenure, we now have enhanced flexibility in our balance sheet. We have prioritized opportunities to deliver positive and accretive returns through organic growth, as well as from outside activity, always with return to shareholders in mind. 
Currently, we are looking at ways to drive our game of yield ahead of a full economic recovery. With the standardization of our platforms and a significant list of exciting new games, we could begin to accelerate the process of converting older titles and boxes to newer versions. We are also considering an increase in the use of financing to help our customers refresh their floors on a selective basis. 
We are always looking to add to our creative resources, which is the heartbeat of IGT, and we are constantly evaluating ways to obtain access to emerging technology-based intellectual property. We see plenty of opportunities to supplement our interactive business. We believe that the future will require a more robust interactive platform. It's just a matter of finding the situation that is right for IGT and our shareholders. 
Given appropriate returns, our preference will always be to apply cash to strengthen our market position with better products, a broader talent pool and an eye towards the future. At the end of last year, I articulated our five primary objectives for fiscal 2011. I will now ask Eric Tom to give you a quick update. Eric?"
281438,117653366,93348,"International Game Technology, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 20, 2011",2011-01-20,"Earnings Calls","International Game Technology","Executives","Thank you, Patti.

We continue to reduce our reliance on the North American replacement cycle toward the improvement of getting operations yield, improving our core and system products and growing our interactive business and IT portfolios. I'd say we're off to a great start in 2011. 
In our participation business, the acceptance of our new games has been very promising and our yields are increasing. Over the past three years, our yield has fallen by an average of 8% from quarter four to quarter one. This year, it's still less than 1% sequentially and was up 2.3% over the prior year's first quarter. As Pat said, this feels like a more normal seasonal decline and perhaps a sign of better times ahead. 
The launch of our Centerstage platform, as well as our easily convertible G23 machines have been very well received in the marketplace. We have supported those platforms with an ample supply of new games. Installed base has shrunk recently, mainly due to some large closures. 
We're also proactively removing older lower-yielding games and replacing them with fresh, higher-performing games. While within the current CapEx budgets, this will take some time to complete. We are looking for many new creative ways to accelerate this process. 
On the core side of our business, our Reel Edge product won the prestigious first place honor for the best slot product at G2E. This product is in the final stages of regulatory approval and should hit the slot floor soon. Initial demand for Reel Edge has been above expectations. 
We are optimistic regarding potential sales opportunities in Illinois, and thereafter in Ohio, in Canada, although none of these are in the fiscal year's plan. IGT's product breadth and experience make us a logical choice for many new customers. Our pipeline of core games and the speed to which we are coming to market makes us poised for growth moving forward. 
Our system installs in North America and internationally are growing. During the first quarter, we added seven new Advantage systems and eight new sbX installations. To highlight the power of our broad portfolio, of these seven new Advantage customers, five also installed sbX. 
Additionally, there are more than 70 North American sbX and Tier 1 opportunities that we are working on. Please understand that these are only opportunities, and there's no guarantee that we will close any of these. 
We will also continue to grow globally. For example, we continue to perform well in Australia, in South America. As Patti said, we rang in the New Year in Portugal at Casino Trojan with a successful installation of sbX in over 70% of the floor, represented by IGT games. 
We're lifting to our customers and positioning our international sales force to be more nimble and responsive. We're communicating, we're committed to developing games that meet our international customers' expectations and exceed the desires of specific regions players, while also reducing costs and inventories and driving higher returns over time. 
In Mexico, we proactively converted older leased machines to for-sale product, as the country moved to Class III games. We are confident we will follow that up with a higher-yielding these machines using the capital generated to improve returns. Our geographic reach of our international operations is a competitive advantage, and we are definitely gaining momentum. 
Our focus on profitability and processes also contributed to strong free cash flow in the quarter. In the first quarter, inventories were up on expected shipments in the near future. Our returns were faster than a year ago, both domestically and abroad. As Patti mentioned, we are looking at a myriad of opportunities to deploy our significant cash flow back into our business to grow our revenues and earnings more quickly. 
Finally, our primary focus is improving our returns on investment. For this quarter, as we figure it internally, it was higher than last year at this time and is moving in the right direction. As we deploy cash, continue to drive higher returns will be a primary driver in the decision process. 
Overall in the first quarter, we have made solid progress on our 2011 objectives. Rather than merely focusing on the short term, we are investing in the long term, and we believe we are moving in the right direction. With that, I will turn it back over to Patti for her closing comments."

And I couldn't agree more, setting our sights on the long term is in the best interest of all of our stakeholders. The current environment requires that we remain prudent, conservative and focused first on managing what is within our control. 
For the current fiscal year 2011, we are updating our earnings guidance to $0.79 to $0.87 per share, excluding the $0.03 per share from our lower tax rate in the first quarter and the $0.01 gain on an investment sale. That said, these are both equity and cash accretive items reflective of deliberate business decisions. Moving forward, we may continue to have earnings events that may make direct comparisons difficult, but we think most of that is behind us. 
And I'd also point out that downside risks and uncertainty still exists, and visibility is as limited as ever. Overall, we expect to see positive top line contribution this fiscal 2011 in the form of furthering our international growth, leveraging our industry-leading participation business, increasing our non-boxed revenues and garnering our expected market share in new jurisdictions. We'll continue to take advantage of our significant cash flows, further strengthening our balance sheet, investing in new technologies and leading the industry as gaming transforms around the globe. We expect the further improvement in our efficiencies, focused on driving higher returns and investments, growing operating costs and harvesting stranded capital. 
And finally, we are confident that opportunities for replacement sales will return. When our customers re-invest in their slot floors, IGT will be there as always with leading products and solutions. So Katherine, we'll turn it the call back over to you and we'll take questions. Thank you."

It was down sequentially, primarily driven by a handful of very large orders that came in the fourth quarter. And of course, the year-on-year comparisons are just challenged because of the large Casino Rosario opening that we had a year ago. The competition is fierce everywhere, whether you're in the United States or you're in the international markets. The competition is different region to region but it's fierce everywhere with good products from multiple vendors. It looks very similar though. When you get into a given market, it looks similar relative to the number of competitors and the characteristics that you're competing on looks very similar market-to-market. Our real benefit in the international space is that we have deployed our resources close to the customer over the years, and so the number of resources that we have out in the marketplace are fairly significant vis-a-vis our competitors. And the feedback we continue to get, as Eric mentioned, we're on the road a lot, spend a lot of time outside the United States. The feedback we get from customers continues to be outside of the United States, and our products are always their preferred products and the products are improving. So I would say it's fierce everywhere, not different outside the U.S. than inside the U.S.. And you might, Eric, want to comment about the U.S. competitive environment?"

And the one thing that you can count on is that if you develop better games like Konami is right now, if you develop better games to bring them into market, your customers would buy them because they're very interested in making a profit, and so I don't think they'd buy so much as beer brands but really on performance on floor. So with that in mind, we're pretty excited about some of the things that we're bringing to market. We have a number of for-sale games that are performing well above floor average, and our customers are to hear about it. And we have a pretty strong backlog. We deployed 24 new games this quarter. Many of them, we expect to be top-notch performers."

I would characterize our fiscal first quarter as a reflection of the remarkable improvement we have made in our profitability and in our internal processes. I would also characterize this quarter as quiet, no big surprises, not a lot of negative noise and a clear indication that we are headed in the right direction. 
While the top line continues to reflect the sluggish market, we continue to make progress towards our objective of delivering more meaningful revenue growth and healthier game operation deals in the future. In the current global economic environment, it is absolutely the right decision to be customer-minded and incorporate feedback from the market into our business plans. We need to ensure that we are doing the right things in the most efficient manner in every part of our business. We have improved internal processes and positioned ourselves to capture increased earnings and cash flows when customer demand return. 
Additionally, we have worked to put our cost structure and balance sheet into the best shape possible. Our products are much improved, and they are delivering the excitement that players expect. We are poised to capture the exciting opportunities in front of us, and we are confident in our ability to further demonstrate our position as an industry leader. 
We clearly exhibited the potential of our product development process at G2E with our incredible lineup of new products. It's very rewarding to see the fruits of our labors. The recent opening of the Troia Casino in Lisbon, Portugal, where we captured 70% of the floor and the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, where we deployed 50% of the machines on the floor, showcase our unique ability to serve all access of the next-generation casino. In both cases, our server-based systems, combined with our games, allow us to help our partners differentiate themselves with the market-leading slot floor. 
We have also seen incredible levels of server-based adoption in the high-limit area of slot floors across the country. The order volume for our server-based Tier 1 installs has never been better. We have always believed that sbX was going to be a best-in-class solution and now, our customers can adopt it much more quickly and inexpensively. 
Following G2E, we deployed our American Idol and Wheel of Fortune Triple Spin games on our new Center Stage platforms. Both new games are performing much better than floor averages and above our lofty expectations. We have quickly established this platform as a much-needed fixture on slot floors across the country, and we are readying a spectacular lineup of games to further strengthen this format. 
Our Center Stage platform is upgradable, with minimal capital costs and limited downtime, improving returns for both our customers and our shareholders. Our 30-day exclusive with MGM Properties on our American Idol game could not have gone better. You will soon see the American Idol game prevalent around the globe. Our high-performing Sex and the City Game has now reached an installed base count of over 1,800 and continues to outperform our wildest expectations. 
While our International business had a respectable quarter, the installation of Casino Rosario in our first fiscal quarter of 2010, creates a difficult benchmark for this year's results. We have built a very formidable international presence, and going forward,  will drive increased sales and enhanced profits around the globe. I will now ask Pat to go over some of the financial details of the first quarter. Pat?"
281438,117653366,93554,"International Game Technology, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 20, 2011",2011-01-20,"Earnings Calls","International Game Technology","Executives","Thanks, Patti, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter earnings from continuing operations totaled $73 million or $0.25 per share, exclusive of $0.04 per share related to certain tax benefits and a gain from the sale of our equity investments in C",904,"Thanks, Patti, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter earnings from continuing operations totaled $73 million or $0.25 per share, exclusive of $0.04 per share related to certain tax benefits and a gain from the sale of our equity investments in China LotSynergy Holdings. The details are provided in this afternoon's press release. 
This quarter's earnings compared to income from continuing operations at $75 million or $0.26 in last year's first quarter. As Patti mentioned, I think it was definitely a good quarter on the gross margin line, but left room for improvement on the top line. It is also our first quarter in quite some time without a lot of negative noise, possibly indicative of better times on the horizon. 
Our consolidated revenues for the first quarter were $465 million, of which 56% were generated by gaming operations, and the remainder came from product sales. Gross margins for the company was at 59%, which is up 200 basis points year-on-year, mainly due to increased gross profit margin and product sales. That said, gross margins were up company-wide. 
We also had a respectable quarter on our Gaming Operations business, and we continue to see stabilization yields with a return hopefully to more normal seasonal patterns. Game ops revenues were $261 million in the first quarter, which was down 3% sequentially and 6% year-on-year, mainly due to a lower installed base in both periods and decreased revenue per unit compared to the sequential quarter. 
Gross margins increased 100 basis points to 63% over the prior year quarter, primarily due to the removal of lower yield and charitable bingo games in Alabama. We earned an average of $50.38 in revenue per unit per day, which is up $1.13 compared to last year's first quarter. While the installed base isn't expected to grow meaningfully this year, we have begun in earnest to replace some of our older participation games with new titles and platforms, a trend that should continue and may accelerate. 
IGT's installed base ended the first quarter at 56,700 units, down 5,400 units over the prior year, largely attributable to the closing of Alabama and the conversion of leased units to for sale in Mexico. Approximately 82% of our installed base is comprised of variable fee games that earn a percentage of machine play, rather than a fixed daily fee. 
Product sales revenues totaled $204 million for the quarter compared to $238 million in the first quarter last year, mainly due to softer sales internationally. Worldwide, we recognized 9,400 machines during the quarter, down from the prior year 11,900. International product sales revenue totaled $70 million on volume of 4,300 units for the current quarter compared to $103 million and 6,400 units in the prior year quarter. The decrease in revenues is primarily due to fewer new openings and expansions in the quarter versus last year. 
Fiscal year 2011 is expected to be a lighter in new and expansion units versus last year or next year. Worldwide non-machine revenues, mainly from the sales of systems, conversions and intellectual property fees, came in at $81 million for the quarter or 40% of total product sales compared to $77 million or 32% of total product sales in the previous year. Product sales gross margins were 55% for the quarter, up 300 basis points from the prior year, due to a stronger mix of non-machine sales combined with an improved geographic mix. 
First quarter operating expenses were $155 million, up slightly versus last year's first quarter due to higher R&D costs. We expect total R&D expenses for the full year to remain similar to fiscal 2010. Total SG&A was down $2.4 million, primarily due to lower bad debt expenses. We expect to see SG&A stay about flat on a dollar basis when compared to fiscal '10 as we invest in the people and processes necessary to take advantage of the expected industry turnaround and in new business opportunities. Overall, operating expenses were 33% of total revenues this quarter, roughly in line with the prior sequential quarters. 
In the quarter, we recognized tax benefits of $7 million or approximately $0.03 per share from the implementation of certain tax-planning strategies and the reinstatement of the research and development tax credit. As a result, the tax rate for the current quarter was 29%. We expect the tax rate to be 36% in each of the next three quarters or approximately 34% for the full year. 
Cash and equivalents and short-term investments, inclusive of restricted amounts, totaled $254 million at December 31, 2010, compared to $249 million at September 30, 2010. Contractual debt obligations totaled $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter compared to $1.8 billion at the end of September. We have now reached a significant goal on our cash management strategy. We now have virtually our entire revolver available, giving us more options for our cash. 
In the first quarter, we generated $42 million on free cash flow after dividends, down from $98 million last year, mainly due to higher inventories and jackpot payments. The inventory increase was due to our strong rollout of new platforms and games and to the timing of shipments around quarter end. We also had a higher proportion of people taking upfront lump-sum payments for our jackpots during the quarter. This concludes my prepared remarks regarding our first quarter results. Thanks for your time and attention. I'll now turn it back over to Patti."

For the first time in quite a while and certainly during my tenure, we now have enhanced flexibility in our balance sheet. We have prioritized opportunities to deliver positive and accretive returns through organic growth, as well as from outside activity, always with return to shareholders in mind. 
Currently, we are looking at ways to drive our game ops yields higher, ahead of a full economic recovery. With the standardization of our platforms and a significant list of exciting new games, we could begin to accelerate the process of converting older titles and boxes to newer versions. We are also considering an increase in the use of financing to help our customers refresh their floors on a selective basis. 
We are always looking to add to our creative resources, which is the heartbeat of IGT, and we are constantly evaluating ways to obtain access to emerging technology-based intellectual property. We see plenty of opportunities to supplement our Interactive business. We believe that the future will require a more robust interactive platform, it's just a matter of finding the situation that is right for IGT and our shareholders. 
Given appropriate returns, our preference will always be to apply cash to strengthen our market position with better products, a broader talent pool and an eye towards the future. At the end of last year, I articulated our five primary objectives for fiscal 2011. I will now ask Eric Tom to give you a quick update. Eric?"

We continue to reduce our reliance on the North American replacement cycle, through the improvement of gaining operations yield, improving our core and system products and growing our Interactive business and IT portfolios. I'd say we're off to a great start in 2011. 
In our Participation business, the acceptance of our new games has been very promising and our yields are increasing. Over the past three years, our yield has fallen by an average of 8% from quarter four to quarter one. This year, it's still less than 1% sequentially and was up 2.3% over the prior year's first quarter. As Pat said, this feels like a more normal seasonal decline and perhaps, a sign of better times ahead. 
The launch of our Center Stage platform, as well as our easily-convertible G23 machines have been very well received in the marketplace. We have supported those platforms with an ample supply of new games. Installed base has shrunk recently, mainly due to some large closures. 
We're also proactively removing older lower-yielding games and replacing them with fresh, higher-performing games. While within the current CapEx budget, this will take some time to complete. We are looking for many new creative ways to accelerate this process. 
On the core side of our business, our Reel Edge product won the prestigious first place honor for the best slot product at G2E. This product's in the final stages of regulatory approval and should hit the slot floor soon. Initial demand for Reel Edge has been above expectations. 
We are optimistic regarding potential sales opportunities in Illinois, and thereafter in Ohio and Canada, although none of these are in the fiscal year's plan. IGT's product breadth and experience make us a logical choice for many new customers. Our pipeline of core games and the speed to which we are coming to market makes us poised for growth moving forward. 
Our system installs in North America and internationally are growing. During the first quarter, we added seven new Advantage systems and eight new sbX installations. To highlight the power of our broad portfolio, of these seven new Advantage customers, five also installed sbX. 
Additionally, there are more than 70 North American sbX and Tier 1 opportunities that we are working on. But please understand that these are only opportunities, and there's no guarantee that we will close any of these. We will also continue to grow globally. For example, we continue to perform well in Australia, in South America. As Patti said, we rang in the New Year in Portugal at Casino Troia with a successful installation of sbX in over 70% of the floor, represented by IGT games. 
We're lifting to our customers and positioning our international sales force to be more nimble and responsive. We're communicating, we're committed to developing games that meet our international customers' expectations and exceed the desires of specific regions players, while also reducing costs and inventories and driving higher returns over time. 
In Mexico, we proactively converted older leased machines to for-sale product, as the country moves to Class III games. We are confident we will follow that up with higher-yielding lease machines, using the capital generated to improve returns. Our geographic reach of our international operations is a competitive advantage, and we are definitely gaining momentum. 
Our focus on profitability and processes also contributed to strong free cash flow in the quarter. In the first quarter, inventories were up on expected shipments in the near future. Our returns were faster than a year ago, both domestically and abroad. As Patti mentioned, we are looking at a myriad of opportunities to deploy our significant cash flow back into our business to grow our revenues and earnings more quickly. 
Finally, our primary focus is improving our returns on investment. For this quarter, as we figure it internally, it was higher than last year at this time and is moving in the right direction. As we deploy cash, continue to drive higher returns will be a primary driver in the decision process. 
Overall in the first quarter, we have made solid progress on our 2011 objectives. Rather than merely focusing on the short term, we are investing in the long term, and we believe we are moving in the right direction. With that, I will turn it back over to Patti for her closing comments."

And I couldn't agree more, setting our sights on the long term is in the best interest of all of our stakeholders. The current environment requires that we remain prudent, conservative and focused first on managing what is within our control. 
For the current fiscal year 2011, we are updating our earnings guidance to $0.79 to $0.87 per share, excluding the $0.03 per share from our lower tax rate in the first quarter and the $0.01 gain on an investment sale. That said, these are both equity and cash accretive items, reflective of deliberate business decisions. Moving forward, we may continue to have earnings events that may make direct comparisons difficult, but we think most of that is behind us. 
I'd like to also point out that downside risks and uncertainty still exists, and visibility is as limited as ever. Overall, we expect to see positive top line contribution this fiscal 2011 in the form of furthering our international growth, leveraging our industry-leading Participation business, increasing our non-boxed revenues and garnering our expected market share in new jurisdictions. We will continue to take advantage of our significant cash flows, further strengthening our balance sheet, investing in new technology and leading the industry as gaming transforms around the globe. We expect to see further improvement in our efficiencies, focused on driving higher return on investments, lowering operating costs and harvesting stranded capital. 
And finally, we are confident that opportunities for replacement sales will return. When our customers re-invest in their slot floors, IGT will be there as always with leading products and solutions. So Katherine, we'll turn the call back over to you and take questions. Thank you."

So today, in places like the display technology, social interaction, communal types of technology, but display technology is a very hot area right now. As you see with our MLD technology, that will just go to the next level. And then in the interactive space, it's around platform, access to platform technologies. So those are the areas that we've been most focused on, have not made any moves as you've seen but we've been very focused to the extent we see a technology out there that we think is leverage-able broadly in our business, would be something we'd be interested in."

It was down sequentially, primarily driven by a handful of very large orders that came in the fourth quarter. And of course, the year-on-year comparisons are just challenged because of the large Casino Rosario opening that we had a year ago. The competition is fierce everywhere, whether you're in United States or you're in the international markets. The competition is different region-to-region but it's fierce everywhere with good products from multiple vendors. It looks very similar though. When you get into a given market, it looks similar relative to the number of competitors and the characteristics that you're competing on looks very similar market-to-market. Our real benefit in the international space is that we have deployed our resources close to the customer over the years, and so the number of resources that we had out in the marketplace are fairly significant, vis-a-vis our competitors. And the feedback we continue to get, as Eric mentioned, we're on the road a lot, spend a lot of time outside the United States.

I would characterize our fiscal first quarter as a reflection of the remarkable improvement we have made in our profitability and in our internal processes. I would also characterize this quarter as quiet, no big surprises, not a lot of negative noise and a clear indication that we are headed in the right direction. 
While the top line continues to reflect the sluggish market, we continue to make progress towards our objective of delivering more meaningful revenue growth and healthier game operation deals in the future. In the current global economic environment, it is absolutely the right decision to be customer-minded and incorporate feedback from the market into our business plans. We need to ensure that we are doing the right things in the most efficient manner in every part of our business. We have improved internal processes and positioned ourselves to capture increased earnings and cash flows when customer demand returns. 
Additionally, we have worked to put our cost structure and balance sheet into the best shape possible. Our products are much improved, and they are delivering the excitement that players expect. We are poised to capture the exciting opportunities in front of us, and we are confident in our ability to further demonstrate our position as an industry leader. 
We clearly exhibited the potential of our product development process at G2E with our incredible lineup of new products. It's very rewarding to see the fruits of our labors. The recent opening of the Troia Casino in Lisbon, Portugal, where we captured 70% of the floor and the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, where we deployed 50% of the machines on the floor, showcase our unique ability to serve all aspects of the next-generation casino. In both cases, our server-based systems, combined with our games, allow us to help our partners differentiate themselves with the market-leading slot floor. 
We have also seen incredible levels of server-based adoption in the high-limit area of slot floors across the country. The order volume for our server-based Tier 1 installs has never been better. We have always believed that sbX was going to be a best-in-class solution and now, our customers can adopt it much more quickly and inexpensively. 
Following G2E, we deployed our American Idol and Wheel of Fortune Triple Spin games on our new Center Stage platforms. Both new games are performing much better than floor averages and above our lofty expectations. We have quickly established this platform as a much-needed fixture on slot floors across the country, and we are readying a spectacular lineup of games to further strengthen this format. 
Our Center Stage platform is upgradable, with minimal capital costs and limited downtime, improving returns for both our customers and our shareholders. Our 30-day exclusive with MGM Properties on our American Idol game could not have gone better. You will soon see the American Idol game prevalent around the globe. Our high-performing Sex and the City Game has now reached an installed base count of over 1,800 and continues to outperform our wildest expectations. 
While our International business had a respectable quarter, the installation of Casino Rosario in our first fiscal quarter of 2010, creates a difficult benchmark for this year's results. We have built a very formidable international presence, and going forward,  will drive increased sales and enhanced profits around the globe. I will now ask Pat to go over some of the financial details of the first quarter. Pat?"

Our first quarter earnings from continuing operations totaled $73 million or $0.25 per share, inclusive of $0.04 per share related to certain tax benefits and a gain from the sale of our equity investments in C",903,"Thanks, Patti, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter earnings from continuing operations totaled $73 million or $0.25 per share, inclusive of $0.04 per share related to certain tax benefits and a gain from the sale of our equity investments in China LotSynergy Holdings. The details are provided in this afternoon's press release. 
This quarter's earnings compared to income from continuing operations at $75 million or $0.26 in last year's first quarter. As Patti mentioned, I think it was definitely a good quarter on the gross margin line, but left room for improvement on the top line. It is also our first quarter in quite some time without a lot of negative noise, possibly indicative of better times on the horizon. 
Our consolidated revenues for the first quarter were $465 million, of which 56% were generated by gaming operations, and the remainder came from product sales. Gross margins for the company was at 59%, which is up 200 basis points year-on-year, mainly due to increased gross profit margin and product sales. That said, gross margins were up company-wide. 
We also had a respectable quarter on our Gaming Operations business, and we continue to see stabilization yields with a return hopefully to more normal seasonal patterns. Game ops revenues were $261 million in the first quarter, which was down 3% sequentially and 6% year-on-year, mainly due to a lower installed base in both periods and decreased revenue per unit compared to the sequential quarter. 
Gross margins increased 100 basis points to 63% over the prior year quarter, primarily due to the removal of lower yield and charitable bingo games in Alabama. We earned an average of $50.38 in revenue per unit per day, which is up $1.13 compared to last year's first quarter. While the installed base isn't expected to grow meaningfully this year, we have begun in earnest to replace some of our older participation games with new titles and platforms, a trend that should continue and may accelerate. 
IGT's installed base ended the first quarter at 56,700 units, down 5,400 units over the prior year, largely attributable to the closing of Alabama and the conversion of leased units to for sale in Mexico. Approximately 82% of our installed base is comprised of variable fee games that earn a percentage of machine play, rather than a fixed daily fee. 
Product sales revenues totaled $204 million for the quarter compared to $238 million in the first quarter last year, mainly due to softer sales internationally. Worldwide, we recognized 9,400 machines during the quarter, down from the prior year 11,900. International product sales revenue totaled $70 million on volume of 4,300 units for the current quarter compared to $103 million and 6,400 units in the prior year quarter. The decrease in revenues is primarily due to fewer new openings and expansions in the quarter versus last year. 
Fiscal year 2011 is expected to be a lighter in new and expansion units versus last year or next year. Worldwide non-machine revenues, mainly from the sales of systems, conversions and intellectual property fees, came in at $81 million for the quarter or 40% of total product sales compared to $77 million or 32% of total product sales in the previous year. Product sales gross margins were 55% for the quarter, up 300 basis points from the prior year, due to a stronger mix of non-machine sales combined with an improved geographic mix. 
First quarter operating expenses were $155 million, up slightly versus last year's first quarter due to higher R&D costs. We expect total R&D expenses for the full year to remain similar to fiscal 2010. Total SG&A was down $2.4 million, primarily due to lower bad debt expenses. We expect to see SG&A stay about flat on a dollar basis when compared to fiscal '10 as we invest in the people and processes necessary to take advantage of the expected industry turnaround and new business opportunities. Overall, operating expenses were 33% of total revenues this quarter, roughly in line with the prior sequential quarters. 
In the quarter, we recognized tax benefits of $7 million or approximately $0.03 per share from the implementation of certain tax-planning strategies and the reinstatement of the research and development tax credit. As a result, the tax rate for the current quarter was 29%. We expect the tax rate to be 36% in each of the next three quarters or approximately 34% for the full year. 
Cash and equivalents and short-term investments, inclusive of restricted amounts, totaled $254 million at December 31, 2010, compared to $249 million at September 30, 2010. Contractual debt obligations totaled $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter compared to $1.8 billion at the end of September. We have now reached a significant goal on our cash management strategy. We now have virtually our entire revolver available, giving us more options for our cash. 
In the first quarter, we generated $42 million on free cash flow after dividends, down from $98 million last year, mainly due to higher inventories and jackpot payments. The inventory increase was due to our strong rollout of new platforms and games and to the timing of shipments around quarter end. We also had a higher proportion of people taking upfront lump-sum payments for our jackpots during the quarter. This concludes my prepared remarks regarding our first quarter results. Thanks for your time and attention. I'll now turn it back over to Patti."

For the first time in quite a while and certainly during my tenure, we now have enhanced flexibility in our balance sheet. We have prioritized opportunities to deliver positive and accretive returns through organic growth, as well as from outside activities, always with return to shareholders in mind. 
Currently, we are looking at ways to drive our game ops yields higher, ahead of a full economic recovery. With the standardization of our platforms and a significant list of exciting new games, we could begin to accelerate the process of converting older titles and boxes to newer versions. We are also considering an increase in the use of financing to help our customers refresh their floors on a selective basis. 
We are always looking to add to our creative resources, which is the heartbeat of IGT, and we are constantly evaluating ways to obtain access to emerging technology-based intellectual property. We see plenty of opportunities to supplement our Interactive business. We believe that the future will require a more robust interactive platform, it's just a matter of finding the situation that is right for IGT and our shareholders. 
Given appropriate returns, our preference will always be to apply cash to strengthen our market position with better products, a broader talent pool and an eye towards the future. At the end of last year, I articulated our five primary objectives for fiscal 2011. I will now ask Eric Tom to give you a quick update. Eric?"
281438,117653366,93568,"International Game Technology, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 20, 2011",2011-01-20,"Earnings Calls","International Game Technology","Executives","Thank you, Patti.

We continue to reduce our reliance on the North American replacement cycle, through the improvement of gaining operations yield, improving our core and system products and growing our Interactive business and IT portfolios. I'd say we're off to a great start in 2011. 
In our Participation business, the acceptance of our new games has been very promising and our yields are increasing. Over the past three years, our yield has fallen by an average of 8% from quarter four to quarter one. This year, it's still less than 1% sequentially and was up 2.3% over the prior year's first quarter. As Pat said, this feels like a more normal seasonal decline and perhaps, a sign of better times ahead. 
The launch of our Center Stage platform, as well as our easily-convertible G23 machines have been very well received in the marketplace. We have supported those platforms with an ample supply of new games. Installed base has shrunk recently, mainly due to some large closures. 
We're also proactively removing older lower-yielding games and replacing them with fresh, higher-performing games. While within the current CapEx budget, this will take some time to complete. We are looking for many new creative ways to accelerate this process. 
On the core side of our business, our Reel Edge product won the prestigious first place honor for the best slot product at G2E. This product's in the final stages of regulatory approval and should hit the slot floor soon. Initial demand for Reel Edge has been above expectations. 
We are optimistic regarding potential sales opportunities in Illinois, and thereafter in Ohio and Canada, although none of these are in the fiscal year's plan. IGT's product breadth and experience make us a logical choice for many new customers. Our pipeline of core games and the speed to which we are coming to market makes us poised for growth moving forward. 
Our system installs in North America and internationally are growing. During the first quarter, we added seven new Advantage systems and eight new sbX installations. To highlight the power of our broad portfolio, of these seven new Advantage customers, five also installed sbX. 
Additionally, there are more than 70 North American sbX and Tier 1 opportunities that we are working on. But please understand that these are only opportunities, and there's no guarantee that we will close any of these. We will also continue to grow globally. For example, we continue to perform well in Australia, in South America. As Patti said, we rang in the New Year in Portugal at Casino Troia with a successful installation of sbX and over 70% of the floor, represented by IGT games. 
We're listening to our customers and positioning our international sales force to be more nimble and responsive. We're communicating, we're committed to developing games that meet our international customers' expectations and exceed the desires of specific regions' players, while also reducing costs and inventories and driving higher returns over time. 
In Mexico, we proactively converted older leased machines to for-sale product, as the country moves to Class III games. We are confident we will follow that up with higher-yielding lease machines, using the capital generated to improve returns. Our geographic reach of our international operations is a competitive advantage, and we are definitely gaining momentum. 
Our focus on profitability and processes also contributed to strong free cash flow in the quarter. In the first quarter, inventories were up on expected shipments in the near future. Our returns were faster than a year ago, both domestically and abroad. As Patti mentioned, we are looking at a myriad of opportunities to deploy our significant cash flow back into our business to grow our revenues and earnings more quickly. 
Finally, our primary focus is improving our returns on investment. For this quarter, as we figure it internally, it was higher than last year at this time and is moving in the right direction. As we deploy cash, continuing to drive higher returns will be a primary driver in the decision process. 
Overall in the first quarter, we have made solid progress on our 2011 objectives. Rather than merely focusing on the short term, we are investing in the long term, and we believe we are moving in the right direction. With that, I will turn it back over to Patti for her closing comments."

And I couldn't agree more, setting our sights on the long term is in the best interest of all of our stakeholders. The current environment requires that we remain prudent, conservative and focused first on managing what is within our control. 
For the current fiscal year 2011, we are updating our earnings guidance to $0.79 to $0.87 per share, excluding the $0.03 per share from our lower tax rate in the first quarter and the $0.01 gain on an investment sale. That said, these are both equity and cash accretive items, reflective of deliberate business decisions. Moving forward, we may continue to have earnings events that may make direct comparisons difficult, but we think most of that is behind us. 
I'd like to also point out that downside risks and uncertainty still exists, and visibility is as limited as ever. Overall, we expect to see positive top line contribution this fiscal 2011 in the form of furthering our international growth, leveraging our industry-leading Participation business, increasing our non-boxed revenues and garnering our expected market share in new jurisdictions. We will continue to take advantage of our significant cash flows, further strengthening our balance sheet, investing in new technologies and leading the industry as gaming transforms around the globe. We expect to see further improvement in our efficiencies, focused on driving higher returns on investments, lowering operating costs and harvesting stranded capital. 
And finally, we are confident that opportunities for replacement sales will return. When our customers re-invest in their slot floors, IGT will be there as always with leading products and solutions. So Katherine, we'll turn the call back over to you and take questions. Thank you."

When you get into a given market, it looks similar relative to the number of competitors and the characteristics that you're competing on looks very similar market-to-market. Our real benefit in the international space is that we have deployed our resources close to the customer over the years, and so the number of resources that we had out in the marketplace are fairly significant, vis-a-vis our competitors.

We continue to leverage and diversify what we believe to be the best business model in the industry. While at the same time, we continue to capitalize on the inroads we have made in markets around the globe. 
Our revenue is beginning to better reflect the progress we have made in improving game performance by leveraging the capability of new platforms, both in gaming operations and in product sales. 
Looking ahead, visibility remains limited, and we expect continued pressure from the macroeconomic environment in the second half of the year. With that said, we are focused on the assets of our business that are within our control, keeping our customers and our partners at the core of every decision we make.

Our second quarter earnings from continuing operations totaled $70 million or $0.23 per share versus $26 million or $0.08 per share on last year's second quarter, the details of which are provided in this after",957,"Thanks, Patti, and good afternoon, everyone. Our second quarter earnings from continuing operations totaled $70 million or $0.23 per share versus $26 million or $0.08 per share on last year's second quarter, the details of which are provided in this afternoon's press release. This quarter, there wasn't much noise in the numbers, and we are seeing improvements in many areas. Generally speaking, we saw improved revenues in margins. We had better game ops performance in our International business, especially in gaming operations was a nice contributor. 
Our total revenues for the second quarter increased 1% to $492 million, of which 56% were generated by gaming operations and the balance came from product sales. Gross margin for the company was 59%, up about 300 basis points year-on-year, mainly due to improved geographic and product mix. 
We had another improving quarter in our gaming operations business with sequential improvement in both the installed base and yield. Gaming operations revenues were $278 million in the second quarter, which was up 7% versus the first quarter and down only slightly year-on-year. 
Sequentially, we saw moderate growth in the installed base and a higher mix of MegaJackpot games. Gross profit and margin were flat compared to last year. We generated an average of $53.62 in revenue per unit per day, which is up $2.66 compared to last year's quarter and up $3.24 versus the immediately preceding quarter, due to an increased mix of newer, higher-yielding gains, higher play level and expected normal seasonality. Our yield should continue their modest sequential improvement assuming normal seasonal trends continue. 
IGT's installed base ended the second quarter at 57,100 units, up 400 units versus the first quarter and down 1,600 units versus a year ago. Year-over-year decreases were largely related to the charitable bingo facility closures in Alabama and lease unit conversions to for sale in Mexico. These were partially offset by international installed base increases. Approximately 82% of our installed base is comprised of variable fee games that earn a percentage of machine play levels rather than a fixed daily fee. For the remainder of the year, we expect our gaming operations in installed base to continue its moderate growth. 
Consolidated product sales revenue increased 4% to $250 million for the quarter, compared to $207 million in the second quarter of last year, primarily driven by stronger sales, particularly Network Systems. Worldwide, we recognized the sale of 10,200 machines during the quarter, up 9% quarter-on-quarter and down 1% from last year's second quarter. Both American machine sales revenue were up 5% over the prior year quarter to $78 million or an increase of 500 units. North America's average selling price was down 4% year-on-year and down 8% from the first quarter, reflective of the current promotional environment. 
North America's product sales gross margin was up 600 basis points year-over-year but down 200 basis points sequentially. The average selling price reduction was the primary factor in the lower gross margin but lower nonstandard costs such as obsolescence and rework drove margin improvement over the same quarter last year. Given the current selling environment and volume levels, we expect average selling prices to rebound modestly from this quarter's level, mainly due to mix but margins to be under pressure for the remainder of the year. 
International product sales revenue totaled $80 million on volume of 4,500 units recognized for the current quarter compared to $83 million and 5,100 units in the prior year quarter. In our international core business, excluding the lower price market, we had a record second quarter for revenues. In addition, we also had an all-time record core profits product sales gross margin and total gross margin. 
Internationally, the average selling price was up 10% year-over-year to 13,000 due to favorable geographic mix, specifically higher shipments in Argentina and Australia. Worldwide non-machine revenues mainly from the sales of systems, conversions and intellectual property fees grew 8% to $78 million for the quarter or 36% of product sales, compared to $72 million and 35% of product sales in the prior year. 
Second quarter operating expenses were $161 million, up 4% compared to last year's quarter, excluding the $53 million Alabama impairment and roughly flat with last year's percentage of total revenues. Total SG&A was up 10% in dollars and 100 basis points as a percentage of revenues due to the expansion of our interactive gaming initiatives and higher variable compensation. We expect a modest upward trend in SG&A for the remainder of this year as we invest in people and processes necessary to take advantage of new business opportunities. 
Cash equivalents and short-term investments, inclusive of restricted amounts, totaled $373 million at March 31, 2011, compared to $249 million at September 30, 2010. Contractual debt obligations totaled $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter. In the second quarter, we generated $161 million on operating cash flow, up from $108 million last year, mainly due to higher earnings. 
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we entered into a new $750 million, five-year credit facility with a syndicate of banks replacing our previous $1.25 billion credit facility. The new unsecured facility provides a lower all-in drawn interest rate, extends the maturity to April 2016 and allows for additional capacity and structural flexibility. We currently have no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility. The new facility will reduce interest expense, including deferred offering cost amortization by about approximately $13.5 million on an annual basis. 
Additionally, in April, we entered into arrangements to swap fix rate interest for variable rate interest, which is expected to save an incremental $7 million on annual interest expense at today's rates. This concludes my prepared remarks regarding our second quarter. Thanks for your time and attention and back to you, Patti."

At the beginning of our fiscal year, we set out with a clear plan: to generate strong cash flow and improve our balance sheet; to increase the profitability and innovation of our gaming operations business; to expand our international presenc",490,"Thanks, Pat. At the beginning of our fiscal year, we set out with a clear plan: to generate strong cash flow and improve our balance sheet; to increase the profitability and innovation of our gaming operations business; to expand our international presence and to accelerate our interactive growth. We are delivering against these objectives everyday. 
Our new credit facility marks an inflection point in the area of cash management throughout IGT. Over the last two years, we have reduced our contractual debt obligations by nearly $600 million, and now we have much for flexibility to invest in high returning opportunities. These opportunities could include increasing our investment in gaming operations, augmenting our product offering in the interactive space, expanding the capabilities of our studios and potentially, enhancing our international distribution. 
In gaming operations, we have increased the velocity of game releases, created a common platform on which these games are played and focused more of our content offerings around exciting popular culture themes and brands. 
Roughly 12 months ago, we installed our very first Center Stage platform, and we now have over 500 units on that platform, with another 500 units on order. Our domestic MegaJackpot revenue increased 8% sequentially despite a reduction in the overall installed base. We now have over 33% of our installed base on our G23 platform and ready for simple and elegant upgrades to new themes and titles. 
We've also launched a new product sales platform called the Universal. This platform can support multiple game configurations and is supported by an impressive portfolio of over 20 new games, with market-leading performance of up to 4x floor averages on the top titles. 
Internationally, we achieved a product sales gross margin of 56%, a record for IGT's international growth. We expect our international unit sales to keep pace with our North American sales for the remainder of the fiscal year, which is another testament to the strength of our global reach. We will combine that with growth in international gaming operations to further enhance our strength outside North America. 
We view our interactive business as a potential source of long-term growth. Late last week, there was some news in the online gambling space in the United States. Let me say that IGT is the most licensed and regulated gaming company on the planet, and we are proud of the commitment we have made to operating in a transparent and ethical fashion. Our regulatory position is not something we take for granted. We have a long history and strong base of experience to build from in the online world. As Continental Europe and other jurisdictions continue on the path of legalization of online gaming, we see tremendous growth opportunities for us and expect to be a major supplier to our growing list of customers. I will now turn the call over to Eric Tom, our Chief Operating Officer, to provide you of further examples of our progress. Eric?"

We are taking advantage of our diverse revenue sources by leveraging our industry-leading gaming operations business, improving our product sales and systems products, building overseas opportunities and growing our interactive business.",860,"Thank you, Patti. We are taking advantage of our diverse revenue sources by leveraging our industry-leading gaming operations business, improving our product sales and systems products, building overseas opportunities and growing our interactive business. We participate in just about every facet of the industry where IGT can provide differentiated products. This helps us produce more consistent financial results when any one area in the industry is lagging. 
While Patti highlighted some of the strides we have made in areas of strategic focus, I thought I would drill down a little deeper into key drivers that are enabling these initiatives. First, in gaming operations, our quick changeover platform based on the new G23 box, including our exclusive 3D Multi-Layer Display technology, is demonstrating its expected value. We can deploy new games onto the platform onto the floor in just a few hours and has significantly reduced our conversion cost. This keeps the unit on the floor more days in the quarter, which keeps the capital on the floor and earnings with no interruptions. The placements of the G23 boxes are up 16% year-to-date, and we have over 3,000 additional units on order. 
The Wheel of Fortune franchise continues its long history of positive returns. We have been deploying Wheel of Fortune Triple Spin onto the Center Stage platform and in many instances, seeing meaningful increases in daily play levels versus older versions. Sex and the City continues to perform well, and we have the big Diamond Sequel coming behind it soon. We are anticipating the upcoming releases of the Hangover, Ghostbusters, Dark Knight and Dirty Dancing, which is being placed on floors as we speak. 
In our domestic Wide Area Progressive business, while overall coin-in was down 4% year-over-year, reflective of the lower installed base, the coin-in per machine per day was up nearly 15%. We're committed to having a strong pipeline of games, and I know our studios are busy creating the next string of big hits. 
In product sales, the new universal is designed and engineered to help our partner customers upgrade their floor with a product that can be all things to all players. This singular box can be ordered with Video Poker or Stepper or Video Reels with Multi-Layer Display and subsequently converted to any one of the other game platforms with ease. Casino operators like the box because of its ease of service, its refined harnessing and improved ventilation. 
Early in the second quarter, we began selling our much awaited G23 Version 2 platform, an improved version of our MegaJackpot slot machine. On a macro level, we are still very much in a promotional environment for the replacement business and it may become more so in the coming quarters. Today, we have had some well-received promotions that generally speaking of increase our ship share and generated sales in other areas as we bundle our offerings. To help offset these promotions, we continue to gain efficiencies in our manufacturing processes. In the quarter, we had a meaningful drop in non-standard costs due to lower inventory obsolescence and rework. Over the past two years, we have removed significant amounts of cost previously embedded in our business by simplifying and standardizing our products and processes. It is a testament to our people that we are meeting or exceeding previous profit margin levels on much lower historical volumes. Increases in our Intellectual Property revenues were also a positive contributor to the margins in the quarter. 
All that said, for the remainder of fiscal year 2011, we see very limited opportunities for new and expansion shipments in the for-sale business. For fiscal year 2012, there is more optimism but still no certainty. 
Included in our product sales, our systems business is also performing well. Year-to-date, our consolidated system revenue have grown in the high single-digit range. We are recently awarded or have installed our sbX system not only in many locations throughout the U.S., but also in places like Macau, Malaysia, South Africa, the Philippines, Portugal, Mexico, the Bahamas and Chile. We currently have 65 sbX contracts in our sales funnel from all over the world, indicative of potential future revenue opportunities. This is another area of our business that we anticipate seeing earnings leverage as the overall gaming environment improves. 
We anticipate continuing to grow globally. For example, we had a record second quarter for our international product sales in the core casino market, led by Latin America and Australia. In international gaming operations, our installed base group and now represents approximately 30% of our consolidated base of games. While these games typically have a low overall yield, they do generally produce strong margins and returns. The geographic reach of our international operations is a competitive advantage, and we are definitely gaining momentum. 
Overall in the second quarter, we took positive strides towards our 2011 objectives, and while the future is especially uncertain right now and visibility continues to be limited, we anticipate leveraging our diverse revenue base and making some more investments in the right places that should produce consistent financial returns over the long term. With that, I'll turn it back over to Patti for her closing comments."

In summary, we are generating strong operating cash flow. We are improving our gaming operations and product sales businesses. We are harvesting opportunities around the globe, and we continue to execute against our mission of becoming a global, full-service partner in the interactive space.

So your second question is, it is just increasing our resources in our China R&D center. We went through a workforce reduction in our U.S.-based systems development group and redirected that work to our R&D center in China so that's really what that is. As far as the competitive environment in Macau, I mean, I'm not telling you anything new I don't know, it's just very different competitive environment. You're competing more with tables. You're competing with junkets. You're competing with a very different business model. So a couple of things we're doing, I think, to really address that market, we're working on some more localized themed product, which we expect to introduce in the marketplace number one. Number two, we're taking a look at some of our systems functionality derivatives is the way I would describe it to make certain that it encompasses the Asian marketplace and the need to be Asian marketplace. So I would say, we're not moving towards focusing on the table games market again. We're more focused on things. The competitive environment is so different there because we're fighting from a lower place in the market shares so we think there's actually more room for us there than there is in some of the markets where we have more outside market share. So we expect to put together a plan in 2012 for our Asia group and expects that they will pick up market share in 2012."

So I think that's actually been one of the changes that our key Technology Officer has been very successful at accomplishing, which is really looking at R&D dollars as more fungible than we had historically looked at them, moving them on a dynamic basis around the business to match market opportunities. So we don't manage our R&D and its high it was once managed. So I do think that it's probably more about gaming efficiency, we've been very, very successful at moving the common platform, tools, market of the products, compliance, much better than it has been. And all of that stuff chews up R&D money is not necessary. So we've been able to, I think, gain some efficiencies. We've been able to treat it more fungibly and move it around so that it matches more closely with opportunities, manage it a little bit more dynamically and we'll continue to do that. I think as we move forward, you'll find it moving more R&D spending to the online world.

And welcome to IGT's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2011 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with me today are Patti Hart, President and CEO; Pat Cavanaugh, Chief Financial Officer; and Eric Tom, Chief Operating Officer.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind listeners, our discussion will contain forward-looking statements concerning matters such as our expected financial and operational performance, our expectations for the economy in general, and the gaming industry in particular, expected interest expense reductions from the new credit facility, recent interest rate swaps and our strategic operational and product plans. Actual results may differ materially from the expected results and reported results should not be considered as indicative of future performance. 
Potential risk and uncertainties that could cause our business and financial results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements are included in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. All information discussed on this call is as of today, April 21, 2011, and IGT does not intend and undertakes no obligation to update this information to reflect future events or circumstances. 
In addition, on today's call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the GAAP measures we consider most comparable, can be found in today's earnings release, which is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.igt.com, and included with the Form 8-K which we furnished today to the SEC. 
With that in mind, I'll turn the call over to Patti."

The results that we reported today are both a reflection of the advancements we have made in improving our profitability and internal processes and evidence of progress made towards strengthening the financial health of IGT. We continue to leverage and diversify what we believe to be the best business model in the industry. While at the same time, we continue to capitalize on the inroads we have made in markets around the globe. 
Our revenue is beginning to better reflect the progress we have made in improving game performance by leveraging the capability of new platforms, both in gaming operations and in product sales. Looking ahead, visibility remains limited, and we expect continued pressure from the macroeconomic environment in the second half of the year. With that said, we are focused on the assets of our business that are within our control, keeping our customers and our partners at the core of every decision we make. 
We expect our current trends of moderate revenue and earnings growth to continue for the remainder of this year and into fiscal year 2012. I recently returned from a trip to Asia, and I can tell you that I am quite enthusiastic about our international business opportunities. We are beginning the deployment of resources closer to our customers and expect to make significant progress across all dimensions of our International business, games and systems in Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean. We are working hard for you, our shareholder, in every corner of the globe. 
With that, I would like to ask Pat to provide you a few more details on our financial performance. Pat?"

Our second quarter earnings from continuing operations totaled $70 million or $0.23 per share versus $26 million or $0.08 per share on last year's second quarter, the details of which are provided in this after",962,"Thanks, Patti, and good afternoon, everyone. Our second quarter earnings from continuing operations totaled $70 million or $0.23 per share versus $26 million or $0.08 per share on last year's second quarter, the details of which are provided in this afternoon's press release. This quarter, there wasn't much noise in the numbers, and we are seeing improvements in many areas. Generally speaking, we saw improved revenues in margins. We had better game ops -- game performance in our International business, especially in gaming operations, was a nice contributor. 
Our total revenues for the second quarter increased 1% to $492 million, of which 56% were generated by gaming operations and the balance came from product sales. Gross margin for the company was 59%, up about 300 basis points year-on-year, mainly due to improved geographic and product mix. We had another improving quarter in our Gaming Operations business with sequential improvement in both the installed base and yield. Gaming operations revenue were $278 million in the second quarter, which was up 7% versus the first quarter and down only slightly year-on-year. 
Sequentially, we saw moderate growth in the installed base and a higher mix of MegaJackpot games. Gross profit and margin were flat compared to last year. We generated an average of $53.62 in revenue per unit per day, which is up $2.66 compared to last year's quarter and up $3.24 versus the immediately preceding quarter, due to an increased mix of newer, higher-yielding gains, higher play level and expected normal seasonality. Our yield should continue their modest sequential improvement assuming normal seasonal trends continue. 
IGT's installed base ended the second quarter at 57,100 units, up 400 units versus the first quarter and down 1,600 units versus a year ago. Year-over-year, decreases were largely related to the charitable bingo facility closures in Alabama and lease unit conversions to for-sale in Mexico. These were partially offset by international installed base increases. Approximately 82% of our installed base is comprised of variable fee games that earn a percentage of machine play levels rather than a fixed daily fee. For the remainder of the year, we expect our gaming operations in installed base to continue its moderate growth. 
Consolidated product sales revenue increased 4% to $215 million for the quarter, compared to $207 million in the second quarter of last year, primarily driven by non-box stronger sales, particularly Network Systems. Worldwide, we recognized the sale of 10,200 machines during the quarter, up 9% quarter-on-quarter and down 1% from last year's second quarter. 
North American machine sales revenue were up 5% over the prior-year quarter to $78 million on an increase of 500 units. North America's average selling price was down 4% year-on-year and down 8% from the first quarter, reflective of the current promotional environment. 
North America's product sales gross margin was up 600 basis points year-over-year but down 200 basis points sequentially. The average selling price reduction was the primary factor on the lower gross margin, but lower nonstandard costs such as obsolescence and rework drove margin improvement over the same quarter last year. Given the current selling environment and volume levels, we expect the average selling prices to rebound modestly from this quarter's level, mainly due to mix but margins to be under pressure for the remainder of the year. 
International product sales revenue totaled $80 million on volume of 4,500 units recognized for the current quarter compared to $83 million and 5,100 units in the prior-year quarter. In our International core business, excluding the lower-priced pub and tabbing market, we had a record second quarter for revenues. In addition, we also had an all-time record core profits -- product sales gross margin and total gross margin. 
Internationally, the average selling price was up 10% year-over-year to 13,000 due to favorable geographic mix, specifically higher shipments into Argentina and Australia. Worldwide non-machine revenues mainly from the sales of systems, conversions and intellectual property fees grew 8% to $78 million for the quarter or 36% of product sales, compared to $72 million and 35% of product sales in the prior year. 
Second quarter operating expenses were $161 million, up 4% compared to last year's quarter, excluding the $53 million Alabama impairment and roughly flat with last year's percentage of total revenues. Total SG&A was up 10% in dollars and 100 basis points as a percentage of revenues due to the expansion of our interactive gaming initiatives and higher variable compensation. We expect a modest upward trend in SG&A for the remainder of this year as we invest in people and processes necessary to take advantage of new business opportunities. 
Cash equivalents and short-term investments, inclusive of restricted amounts, totaled $373 million at March 31, 2011, compared to $249 million at September 30, 2010. Contractual debt obligations totaled $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter. In the second quarter, we generated $161 million on operating cash flow, up from $108 million last year, mainly due to higher earnings. 
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we entered into a new $750 million, five-year credit facility with a syndicate of banks replacing our previous $1.25 billion credit facility. The new, unsecured facility provides a lower, all-in, drawn interest rate, extends the maturity to April 2016 and allows for additional capacity and structural flexibility. We currently have no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility. The new facility will reduce interest expense, including deferred offering cost amortization by about -- approximately $13.5 million on an annual basis. Additionally, in April, we entered into arrangements to swap fixed rate interest for variable rate interest, which is expected to save an incremental $7 million on annual interest expense at today's rates. 
This concludes my prepared remarks regarding our second quarter. Thanks for your time and attention, and back to you, Patti."

At the beginning of our fiscal year, we set out with a clear plan: To generate strong cash flow and improve our balance sheet; to increase the profitability and innovation of our Gaming Operations business; to expand our international presence; and to accelerate our interactive growth. We are delivering against these objectives everyday. 
Our new credit facility marks an inflection point in the area of cash management throughout IGT. Over the last two years, we have reduced our contractual debt obligations by nearly $600 million, and now we have much for flexibility to invest in high returning opportunities. These opportunities could include: Increasing our investment in gaming operations; augmenting our product offering in the interactive space; expanding the capabilities of our studios; and potentially, enhancing our international distribution. 
In gaming operations, we have increased the velocity of game releases, created a common platform on which these games are played and focused more of our content offerings around exciting popular culture themes and brands. Roughly 12 months ago, we installed our very first Center Stage platform, and we now have over 500 units on that platform, with another 500 units on order. Our domestic MegaJackpot revenue increased 8% sequentially despite a reduction in the overall installed base. We now have over 33% of our installed base on our new G23 platform and ready for simple and elegant upgrades to new themes and titles. 
We've also launched a new product sales platform called the Universal Slant Top. This platform can support multiple game configurations and is supported by an impressive portfolio of over 20 new games, with market-leading performance of up to 4x floor averages on the top titles. Internationally, we achieved a product sales gross margin of 56%, a record for IGT's international growth. We expect our international unit sales to keep pace with our North American sales for the remainder of the fiscal year, which is another testament to the strength of our global reach. We will combine that with growth in international gaming operations to further enhance our strength outside North America. 
We view our Interactive business as a potential source of long-term growth. Late last week, there was some news in the online gambling space in the United States. Let me say that IGT is the most licensed and regulated gaming company on the planet, and we are proud of the commitment we have made to operating in a transparent and ethical fashion. Our regulatory position is not something we take for granted. We have a long history and strong base of experience to build from in the online world. As Continental Europe and other jurisdictions continue on the path of legalization of online gaming, we see tremendous growth opportunities for us, and expect to be a major supplier to our growing list of customers. 
I will now turn the call over to Eric Tom, our Chief Operating Officer, to provide you further examples of our progress. Eric?"

We are taking advantage of our diverse revenue sources by leveraging our industry-leading Gaming Operations business, improving our product sales and systems products, building overseas opportunities and growing our Interactive business.",862,"Thank you, Patti. We are taking advantage of our diverse revenue sources by leveraging our industry-leading Gaming Operations business, improving our product sales and systems products, building overseas opportunities and growing our Interactive business. We participate in just about every facet of the industry where IGT can provide differentiated products. This helps us produce more consistent financial results when any one area in the industry is lagging. 
While Patti highlighted some of the strides we have made in areas of strategic focus, I thought I would drill down a little deeper into key drivers that are enabling these initiatives. First, in gaming operations, our quick changeover platform based on the new G23 box, including our exclusive 3D Multi-Layer Display technology, is demonstrating its expected value. We can deploy new games onto the platform onto the floor in just a few hours and has significantly reduced our conversion cost. This keeps the unit on the floor more days in the quarter, which keeps the capital on the floor and earnings with no interruptions. The placements of the G23 boxes are up 16% year-to-date, and we have over 3,000 additional units on order. 
The Wheel of Fortune franchise continues its long history of positive returns. We have been deploying the Wheel of Fortune Triple Spin onto the Center Stage platform, and in many instances, seeing meaningful increases in daily play levels versus older versions. Sex and the City continues to perform well, and we have the big Diamond sequel coming behind it soon. We are anticipating the upcoming releases of the Hangover, Ghostbusters, Dark Knight and Dirty Dancing, which is being placed on floors as we speak. 
In our domestic Wide Area Progressive business, while overall coin-in was down 4% year-over-year, reflective of the lower installed base, the coin-in per machine per day was up nearly 15%. We're committed to having a strong pipeline of games, and I know our studios are busy creating the next string of big hits. 
In product sales, the new Universal Slant Top is designed and engineered to help our partner customers upgrade their floor with a product that can be all things to all players. This singular box can be ordered with video poker or stepper or video reels with Multi-Layer Display and subsequently converted to any one of the other game platforms with ease. Casino operators like the box because of its ease of service, its refined harnessing and improved ventilation. 
Early in the second quarter, we began selling our much awaited G23 version 2 platform, an improved version of our MegaJackpot slot machine. On a macro level, we are still very much in a promotional environment for the Replacement business and it may become more so in the coming quarters. To-date, we have had some well-received promotions that, generally speaking, have increased our ship share and generated sales in other areas as we bundle our offerings. To help offset these promotions, we continue to gain efficiencies in our manufacturing processes. In the quarter, we had a meaningful drop in non-standard costs due to lower inventory obsolescence and rework. 
Over the past two years, we have removed significant amounts of cost previously embedded in our business by simplifying and standardizing our products and processes. It is a testament to our people that we are meeting or exceeding previous profit margin levels on much lower historical volumes. Increases in our intellectual property revenues were also a positive contributor to the margins in the quarter. All that said, for the remainder of fiscal year 2011, we see very limited opportunities for new and expansion shipments in the For-Sale business. For fiscal year 2012, there is more optimism but still no certainty. 
Included in our product sales, our Systems business is also performing well. Year-to-date, our consolidated systems revenues have grown in the high single-digit range. We are recently awarded or have installed our sbX system not only in many locations throughout the U.S., but also in places like Macau, Malaysia, South Africa, the Philippines, Portugal, Mexico, the Bahamas and Chile. We currently have 65 sbX contracts in our sales funnel from all over the world, indicative of potential future revenue opportunities. This is another area of our business that we anticipate seeing earnings leverage as the overall gaming environment improves. 
We anticipate continuing to grow globally. For example, we had a record second quarter for our international product sales in the core casino market, led by Latin America and Australia. In international gaming operations, our installed base grew and now represents approximately 30% of our consolidated base of games. While these games typically have a low overall yield, they do generally produce strong margins and returns. The geographic reach of our international operations is a competitive advantage, and we are definitely gaining momentum. 
Overall, in the second quarter, we took positive strides towards our 2011 objectives, and while the future is especially uncertain right now and visibility continues to be limited, we anticipate leveraging our diverse revenue base and making smart investments in the right places that should produce consistent financial returns over the long term. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Patti for her closing comments."

In the quarter, the ASPs that we experienced were a combination of promotional activity and mix. We're expecting our mix in the back half of the year to be much more -- have much more of a representation of our MLD product. I think the MLD product was down at about 37% or so this year, and we had about -- I can't remember, I'm going to guess the number, 1,500 units that slipped from lease ops. Is about that number? Yes. So we had about 1,500 units that slipped from lease ops in the product sales at very low ASPs. So the ASPs are a combination of those things so we would expect that we'll see those come back a bit in the back half the year. The competition is doing what the competition is doing, and we respond where we think it's responsible to respond, but we don't respond in areas where we feel like it's not in our shareholders' best interest. So we always balance the need to maintain our real estate on the floor with what we think is returning to our shareholders' value. So that and we'll continue to make our decisions that way."

Even though our competitors might be substantially lower than that, we find that our customers resonate with the value proposition of quality games at a fair price.

You know, you're competing more with tables, you're competing with junkets, you're competing with a very different business model. So a couple of things we're doing, I think, to readdress that market, we're working on some more localized themed product, which we expect to introduce to the marketplace, number one. And number two, we're taking a look at some of our systems feature functionality derivatives, is the way I would describe it, to make certain that it encompasses the Asian marketplace and the needs of the Asian marketplace. So I would say, we're not moving towards focusing on the table games market again. We're more focused on themes. The competitive environment is so different there because we're fighting from a lower place in the market shares stack so we think there's actually more room for us there than there is in some of the markets where we have more outside market share.

And all of that stuff, chews up R&D money, is not necessary. So we've been able to, I think, gain some efficiencies. We've been able to treat it more fungibly and move it around so that it matches more closely with opportunities, manage it a little bit more dynamically and we'll continue to do that.

Before we begin, I'd like to remind listeners, our discussion will contain forward-looking statements concerning matters such as our expected financial and operational performance, our expectations for the economy in general, and the gaming industry in particular, expected interest expense reductions from the new credit facility, recent interest rate swaps and our strategic operational and product plans. Actual results may differ materially from the expected results and reported results should not be considered as indicative of future performance. 
Potential risk and uncertainties that could cause our business and financial results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements are included in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. All information discussed on this call is as of today, April 21, 2011, and IGT does not intend and undertakes no obligation to update this information to reflect future events or circumstances. 
In addition, on today's call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the GAAP measures we consider most comparable, can be found in today's earnings release, which is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.igt.com, and included with the Form 8-K which we furnished today to the SEC.

The results that we reported today are both a reflection of the advancements we have made in improving our profitability and internal processes and evidence of progress made towards strengthening the financial health of IGT. We continue to leverage and diversify what we believe to be the best business model in the industry. While at the same time, we continue to capitalize on the inroads we have made in markets around the globe. 
Our revenue is beginning to better reflect the progress we have made in improving game performance by leveraging the capability of new platforms, both in gaming operations and in product sales. Looking ahead, visibility remains limited, and we expect continued pressure from the macroeconomic environment in the second half of the year. With that said, we are focused on the assets of our business that are within our control, keeping our customers and our partners at the core of every decision we make. 
We expect our current trends of moderate revenue and earnings growth to continue for the remainder of this year and into fiscal year 2012. I recently returned from a trip to Asia, and I can tell you that I am quite enthusiastic about our international business opportunities. We are beginning the deployment of resources closer to our customers and expect to make significant progress across all dimensions of our International business, games and systems in Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean. We are working hard for you, our shareholder, in every corner of the globe. 
With that, I would like to ask Pat to provide you a few more details on our financial performance. Pat?"
281438,129299383,116825,"International Game Technology, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2011",2011-04-21,"Earnings Calls","International Game Technology","Executives","Thanks, Patti, and good afternoon, everyone. Our second quarter earnings from continuing operations totaled $70 million or $0.23 per share versus $26 million or $0.08 per share on last year's second quarter, the details of which are provided in this after",962,"Thanks, Patti, and good afternoon, everyone. Our second quarter earnings from continuing operations totaled $70 million or $0.23 per share versus $26 million or $0.08 per share on last year's second quarter, the details of which are provided in this afternoon's press release. This quarter, there wasn't much noise in the numbers, and we are seeing improvements in many areas. Generally speaking, we saw improved revenues in margins. We had better game ops -- game performance in our International business, especially in gaming operations, was a nice contributor. 
Our total revenues for the second quarter increased 1% to $492 million, of which 56% were generated by gaming operations and the balance came from product sales. Gross margin for the company was 59%, up about 300 basis points year-on-year, mainly due to improved geographic and product mix. We had another improving quarter in our Gaming Operations business with sequential improvement in both the installed base and yield. Gaming operations revenue were $278 million in the second quarter, which was up 7% versus the first quarter and down only slightly year-on-year. 
Sequentially, we saw moderate growth in the installed base and a higher mix of MegaJackpot games. Gross profit and margin were flat compared to last year. We generated an average of $53.62 in revenue per unit per day, which is up $2.66 compared to last year's quarter and up $3.24 versus the immediately preceding quarter, due to an increased mix of newer, higher-yielding gains, higher play level and expected normal seasonality. Our yield should continue their modest sequential improvement assuming normal seasonal trends continue. 
IGT's installed base ended the second quarter at 57,100 units, up 400 units versus the first quarter and down 1,600 units versus a year ago. Year-over-year, decreases were largely related to the charitable bingo facility closures in Alabama and lease unit conversions to for-sale in Mexico. These were partially offset by international installed base increases. Approximately 82% of our installed base is comprised of variable fee games that earn a percentage of machine play levels rather than a fixed daily fee. For the remainder of the year, we expect our gaming operations in installed base to continue its moderate growth. 
Consolidated product sales revenue increased 4% to $215 million for the quarter, compared to $207 million in the second quarter of last year, primarily driven by stronger non-box sales, particularly Network Systems. Worldwide, we recognized the sale of 10,200 machines during the quarter, up 9% quarter-on-quarter and down 1% from last year's second quarter. 
North American machine sales revenue were up 5% over the prior-year quarter to $78 million on an increase of 500 units. North America's average selling price was down 4% year-on-year and down 8% from the first quarter, reflective of the current promotional environment. 
North America's product sales gross margin was up 600 basis points year-over-year but down 200 basis points sequentially. The average selling price reduction was the primary factor on the lower gross margin, but lower nonstandard costs such as obsolescence and rework drove margin improvement over the same quarter last year. Given the current selling environment and volume levels, we expect the average selling prices to rebound modestly from this quarter's level, mainly due to mix but margins to be under pressure for the remainder of the year. 
International product sales revenue totaled $80 million on volume of 4,500 units recognized for the current quarter compared to $83 million and 5,100 units in the prior-year quarter. In our International core business, excluding the lower-priced pub and tavern market, we had a record second quarter for revenues. In addition, we also had an all-time record core profits -- product sales gross margin and total gross margin. 
Internationally, the average selling price was up 10% year-over-year to 13,000 due to favorable geographic mix, specifically higher shipments into Argentina and Australia. Worldwide non-machine revenues mainly from the sales of systems, conversions and intellectual property fees grew 8% to $78 million for the quarter or 36% of product sales, compared to $72 million and 35% of product sales in the prior year. 
Second quarter operating expenses were $161 million, up 4% compared to last year's quarter, excluding the $53 million Alabama impairment and roughly flat with last year's percentage of total revenues. Total SG&A was up 10% in dollars and 100 basis points as a percentage of revenues due to the expansion of our interactive gaming initiatives and higher variable compensation. We expect a modest upward trend in SG&A for the remainder of this year as we invest in people and processes necessary to take advantage of new business opportunities. 
Cash equivalents and short-term investments, inclusive of restricted amounts, totaled $373 million at March 31, 2011, compared to $249 million at September 30, 2010. Contractual debt obligations totaled $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter. In the second quarter, we generated $161 million in operating cash flow, up from $108 million last year, mainly due to higher earnings. 
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we entered into a new $750 million, five-year credit facility with a syndicate of banks replacing our previous $1.25 billion credit facility. The new, unsecured facility provides a lower, all-in, drawn interest rate, extends the maturity to April 2016 and allows for additional capacity and structural flexibility. We currently have no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility. The new facility will reduce interest expense, including deferred offering cost amortization by about -- approximately $13.5 million on an annual basis. Additionally, in April, we entered into arrangements to swap fixed rate interest for variable rate interest, which is expected to save an incremental $7 million on annual interest expense at today's rates. 
This concludes my prepared remarks regarding our second quarter. Thanks for your time and attention, and back to you, Patti."

At the beginning of our fiscal year, we set out with a clear plan: To generate strong cash flow and improve our balance sheet; to increase the profitability and innovation of our Gaming Operations business; to expand our international presenc",493,"Thanks, Pat. At the beginning of our fiscal year, we set out with a clear plan: To generate strong cash flow and improve our balance sheet; to increase the profitability and innovation of our Gaming Operations business; to expand our international presence; and to accelerate our interactive growth. We are delivering against these objectives every day. 
Our new credit facility marks an inflection point in the area of cash management throughout IGT. Over the last two years, we have reduced our contractual debt obligations by nearly $600 million, and now we have much for flexibility to invest in high returning opportunities. These opportunities could include: Increasing our investment in gaming operations; augmenting our product offering in the interactive space; expanding the capabilities of our studios; and potentially, enhancing our international distribution. 
In gaming operations, we have increased the velocity of game releases, created a common platform on which these games are played and focused more of our content offerings around exciting popular culture themes and brands. Roughly 12 months ago, we installed our very first Center Stage platform, and we now have over 500 units on that platform, with another 500 units on order. Our domestic MegaJackpot revenue increased 8% sequentially despite a reduction in the overall installed base. We now have over 33% of our installed base on our new G23 platform and ready for simple and elegant upgrades to new themes and titles. 
We've also launched a new product sales platform called the Universal Slant Top. This platform can support multiple game configurations and is supported by an impressive portfolio of over 20 new games, with market-leading performance of up to 4x floor averages on the top titles. Internationally, we achieved a product sales gross margin of 56%, a record for IGT's international growth. We expect our international unit sales to keep pace with our North American sales for the remainder of the fiscal year, which is another testament to the strength of our global reach. We will combine that with growth in international gaming operations to further enhance our strength outside North America. 
We view our Interactive business as a potential source of long-term growth. Late last week, there was some news in the online gambling space in the United States. Let me say that IGT is the most licensed and regulated gaming company on the planet, and we are proud of the commitment we have made to operating in a transparent and ethical fashion. Our regulatory position is not something we take for granted. We have a long history and strong base of experience to build from in the online world. As Continental Europe and other jurisdictions continue on the path of legalization of online gaming, we see tremendous growth opportunities for us, and expect to be a major supplier to our growing list of customers. 
I will now turn the call over to Eric Tom, our Chief Operating Officer, to provide you further examples of our progress. Eric?"

We are taking advantage of our diverse revenue sources by leveraging our industry-leading Gaming Operations business, improving our product sales and systems products, building overseas opportunities and growing our Interactive business.",863,"Thank you, Patti. We are taking advantage of our diverse revenue sources by leveraging our industry-leading Gaming Operations business, improving our product sales and systems products, building overseas opportunities and growing our Interactive business. We participate in just about every facet of the industry where IGT can provide differentiated products. This helps us produce more consistent financial results when any one area in the industry is lagging. 
While Patti highlighted some of the strides we have made in areas of strategic focus, I thought I would drill down a little deeper into key drivers that are enabling these initiatives. First, in gaming operations, our quick changeover platform based on the new G23 box, including our exclusive 3D Multi-Layer Display technology, is demonstrating its expected value. We can deploy new games onto the platform onto the floor in just a few hours and it significantly reduced our conversion cost. This keeps the unit on the floor more days in the quarter, which keeps the capital on the floor and earnings with no interruptions. The placements of the G23 boxes are up 16% year-to-date, and we have over 3,000 additional units on order. 
The Wheel of Fortune franchise continues its long history of positive returns. We have been deploying the Wheel of Fortune Triple Spin onto the Center Stage platform, and in many instances, seeing meaningful increases in daily play levels versus older versions. Sex and the City continues to perform well, and we have the big Diamond sequel coming behind it soon. We are anticipating the upcoming releases of the Hangover, Ghostbusters, Dark Knight and Dirty Dancing, which is being placed on floors as we speak. 
In our domestic Wide Area Progressive business, while overall coin-in was down 4% year-over-year, reflective of the lower installed base, the coin-in per machine per day was up nearly 15%. We are committed to having a strong pipeline of games, and I know our studios are busy creating the next string of big hits. 
In product sales, the new Universal Slant Top is designed and engineered to help our partner customers upgrade their floor with a product that can be all things to all players. This singular box can be ordered with video poker or stepper or video reels with Multi-Layer Display and subsequently converted to any one of the other game platforms with ease. Casino operators like the box because of its ease of service, its refined harnessing and improved ventilation. 
Early in the second quarter, we began selling our much awaited G23 version 2 platform, an improved version of our MegaJackpot slot machine. On a macro level, we are still very much in a promotional environment for the Replacement business and it may become more so in the coming quarters. To-date, we have had some well-received promotions that, generally speaking, have increased our ship share and generated sales in other areas as we bundle our offerings. To help offset these promotions, we continue to gain efficiencies in our manufacturing processes. In the quarter, we had a meaningful drop in non-standard costs due to lower inventory obsolescence and rework. 
Over the past two years, we have removed significant amounts of cost previously embedded in our business by simplifying and standardizing our products and processes. It is a testament to our people that we are meeting or exceeding previous profit margin levels on much lower historical volumes. Increases in our intellectual property revenues were also a positive contributor to the margins in the quarter. All that said, for the remainder of fiscal year 2011, we see very limited opportunities for new and expansion shipments in the For-Sale business. For fiscal year 2012, there is more optimism but still no certainty. 
Included in our product sales, our Systems business is also performing well. Year-to-date, our consolidated systems revenues have grown in the high single-digit range. We are recently awarded or have installed our sbX system not only in many locations throughout the U.S., but also in places like Macau, Malaysia, South Africa, the Philippines, Portugal, Mexico, the Bahamas and Chile. We currently have 65 sbX contracts in our sales funnel from all over the world, indicative of potential future revenue opportunities. This is another area of our business that we anticipate seeing earnings leverage as the overall gaming environment improves. 
We anticipate continuing to grow globally. For example, we had a record second quarter for our international product sales in the core casino market, led by Latin America and Australia. In international gaming operations, our installed base grew and now represents approximately 30% of our consolidated base of games. While these games typically have a low overall yield, they do generally produce strong margins and returns. The geographic reach of our international operations is a competitive advantage, and we are definitely gaining momentum. 
Overall, in the second quarter, we took positive strides towards our 2011 objectives, and while the future is especially uncertain right now and visibility continues to be limited, we anticipate leveraging our diverse revenue base and making smart investments in the right places that should produce consistent financial returns over the long term. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Patti for her closing comments."

And I agree, setting our sights on our long-term performance is in the best interest of all of our stakeholders. We remain cautious on the outlook for the remainder of this year due to possible increased macroeconomic and market pressures. That said, we're always prudent and conservative, focused first on managing what is within our control. For the current fiscal year 2011, we are raising our earnings guidance to $0.84 to $0.90 per share, excluding the $0.04 of special items for the first quarter. 
In summary, we are generating strong operating cash flow. We are improving our Gaming Operations and Product Sales businesses. We are harvesting opportunities around the globe, and we continue to execute against our mission of becoming a global, full-service partner in the interactive space. 
With that, we thank you and we'd like to take your questions."

And number two, we're taking a look at some of our systems feature functionality derivatives, is the way I would describe it, to make certain that it encompasses the Asian marketplace and the needs of the Asian marketplace. So I would say, we're not moving towards focusing on the table games market again. We're more focused on themes.

So we don't manage our R&D in its high as silos [ph] to it was once managed. So I do think that it's probably more about gaining efficiency -- we've been very, very successful at moving the common platforms, common tools, seed to market of the products, seed through casting, seed through compliance, much better than it has been. And all of that stuff, chews up R&D money, it's not necessary. So we've been able to, I think, gain some efficiencies. We've been able to treat it more fungibly and move it around so that it matches more closely with opportunities, manage it a little bit more dynamically and we'll continue to do that. I think as we move forward, you'll find us moving more R&D spending to the online world. You'll also finding us moving more R&D spending into applications.

Actual results may differ materially from the expected results, and reported results should not be considered as indicative of future performance.  Potential risks and uncertainties that could cause our business and financial results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements are included in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.

As you can see from our third quarter results, we are delivering and the commitment we have made to all of our stakeholders with solid revenue growth, stable product margins, tightly manage expenses and an operating margin of 29%, our best in over 3 years. We believe the improvements we are driving across the organization have the potential to generate steady, attractive returns. 
We have adjusted our business portfolio to better align our assets with our future vision. The acquisition of Entraction is expected to enhance our interactive market position by adding poker, bingo and sports betting to our industry-leading online casino products. This is a clear example of our plan to prioritize higher growth opportunity in a responsible manner.  We believe that our interactive business will be an important contributor to revenue and earnings growth in the coming years. 
Our agreement to sell the Barcrest Group is expected to close in our fiscal fourth quarter. This transaction will allow us to reinvest the proceeds to drive enhanced products for our customers. Strong cash generation continued to be one of the strengths of our business model, evident again this quarter. 
Consistent with our cash management strategy, our Board has authorized a $500 million share repurchase. We acted quickly in the quarter by applying $25 million to the buyback of IGT stock. We will continue to remain focused on efficiently deploying capital to drive positive returns for our shareholders. 
With that, I'd like to ask Pat to provide you with the details on our third quarter financial performance. Pack?"

Our adjusted third quarter earnings continuing operations grew 22% to $78 million or $0.26 per share versus $64 million or $0.21 per share in last year's third quarter. A table reconciling the adjusted earnings",691,"Thanks, Patti, and good afternoon, everyone. Our adjusted third quarter earnings continuing operations grew 22% to $78 million or $0.26 per share versus $64 million or $0.21 per share in last year's third quarter. A table reconciling the adjusted earnings to GAAP earnings is available in this afternoon's press release. All periods presented have been adjusted to classify the Barcrest Group and discontinued operations. 
At a high level, the growth in earnings was driven by higher product sales revenues coupled with exceptional margin performance. Our total revenues for the third quarter increased 3% to $489 million. Result of stronger product sales in Latin America, North America and Europe combined with higher average selling prices. 
Gross margin for the company was 59%, up 300 basis points year on year mainly due to higher performance in our North American gaming operations and growth in international selling prices. 
Gaming operations revenues were $267 million in the third quarter, down 1% sequentially and from the prior year. We generated an average of $55.55 in revenue per unit per day, which is up 3% compared to last year's third quarter. Strong performance for our domestic, wider progressive games positively contributed to the increase in yield. 
Consistent with last quarter, our coin per machine per day was up 13% in our Wide Area Progressive units. Average revenue per day decreased sequentially due to higher mix of lower yields and international units. 
Gaming operations gross margin was 62%, up 400 basis points versus last year on improved performance and lower jackpot expense. If you remember, in last year's third quarter, we had an unfavorable move in interest rates that temporarily suppressed the margin. 
IGT's consolidated install base ended the third quarter 53,300 units, which is up 800 units sequentially. 
Consolidated product sales revenues increased 8% to $222 million for the quarter compared to $206 in last year's third quarter. Globally, we recognized 8,900 units in the quarter, up 7% from last year's third quarter primarily driven by higher domestic replacements and Latin American sales. 
North America's machine sales revenues were up 11% over the prior year quarter, a $70 million on an increase of 400 units. North America's average selling price in the quarter increased 2% compared to last year on a higher mix of new cabinets. Specifically, the new Universal Slant and the G23 Multi-Layer Display model combined with lower average discounts. 
North America's products those gross margins were strong, again at 55%. International products sales revenue increased to $86 million on volume of 4,000 units recognized for the current quarter compared to 82 million and 3,800 units, respectively, in the prior year quarter. 
Internationally, average selling price was up 16% year-over-year primarily due to favorable shifts in product mix and foreign exchange rates. Worldwide non-machine revenues namely in the sales of systems conversions and intellectual properties declined 4% present to $85 million for the quarter or 38% of products sales compared to $88 million or 43% in the prior year quarter, mainly due to a large international system sale recognized in the last year's third quarter. 
Third quarter operating expenses were $148 million, flat when compared to last year's third quarter and down 100 basis points as a percentage of total revenues. Total SG&A as 17% of revenues was also flat compared to last year as lower bad debt expense offset higher variable compensation expenses. 
Cash equivalents and short-term investments inclusive of restricted amounts totaled $401 million at June 30 of this year compared to $249 million at September 30, 2010.  Contractual debt obligations totaled 1.7 billion at the end of the quarter. 
In the third quarter, we generated $185 million in operating cash flow, up 26% compared to last year. Also in the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $16.25 per share. 
In summary, our consolidated revenue has shown good sequential growth during the year. We are generating sustainable efficiencies all throughout the company and improved in our profitability. 
This concludes my prepared remarks regarding our third quarter results. Thank you for your time and attention, and I'll now turn the call back over to Patti."

At the start of fiscal 2011, we set out to grow and improve our gaming operations, expand our international presence and accelerate our Interactive business. We are driving the desired outcome across each of these priorities. 
In gaming operations, we have over 1,000 units installed on a Center Stage platform, including the recently released Dark Knight. The game at the Center Stage are performing extremely well. We expect to leverage this platform by introducing new content and sense to extend the life of the hardware. Of our core products business has also elevated. We began shipping our Universal Slant product the strong portfolio of new games. Our legendary wolf-run game, the #1 performing title for many, many years, was surpassed by 2 titles this quarter: Golden goddess and black widow of the which are playing significantly above floor averages. 
We are improving our game development process, bringing better performing titles to market much faster, while converting more of our research and development spending to revenue. 
Our international organization continued to break records. Driven by strong replacement demand for our premium products in Europe and Australia, we achieve an average selling price of $16,600 in international product sales, our highest ever. While our ASPs are setting new benchmarks our product gross margin is also healthy at 57%, a 400-basis-point improvement over last year. 
Early return on our 6 new Asian themed games are encouraging and a testament to the demand for localized content. We will continue to deliver games in greater volume that are specifically designed for our international markets. 
In comparison to last year, our Interactive business grew revenue over 20% and increased gross profit nearly 30%. We added Paddy power to our darndest of interactive customers as we launched a full slate of browser-based mobile games. Initial numbers are showing a significant increase in both total wagers an average bet. 
I will not turn the call over to Eric Ton, who will provide further context in our third quarter results. Eric?"

We solicit more feedback than we ever have, and we are using it to shape our product systems and services. 
In June, we also the global systems users conference to engage with our system customers, share best practices and showcase the latest advancement of our technology platforms. At this year's conference, which had a record attendance from around the world, we announced our open standard universal game adopter product. This product addresses or casino customer's desire to recede across an entire slot floor in a cost-efficient manner. 
The solution allows any game manufacturer to deliver safe compatibility of their slot machine with any casino management system, a first in the industry. 
Staying true to our word, of consistently increasing features and functionality of our system offerings, we also demonstrated several new applications for our sbx system. We expect to be delivering a steady flow of new bonus, community and game play applications in the coming quarters. 
Our Beijing research and development team plays a vital role in many of these applications, and our global R&D footprint will continue to be a strategic  competitive advantage for IGT. 
In the quarter, we jumped significant international system wins in Panama, Uruguay, Australia and the Netherlands. And our sbx system has now been sold on 6 continents. We have several exciting new releases in the quarter, helping drive the strong demand for our products. We released the highly anticipated hot rolled series, which features our first interactive touchscreen bonus. The brand-new encore progressive product is specifically designed to boost coin in on operators owned on games. Our customers can now play back 3-level mystery progresses over their players favorites loss. 
Engineered and designed with customer input, the Universal Slant top box has been also will received. Our customers love it serviceability and functionality. And the advanced design of this machine reduces its manufacturing time by as much as 50%. 
Exceeding our own expectations, we have already received orders for 2,300 units. 
In gaming operations, our convertible platforms enabled us to quickly switch titles right on the casino floor in about an hour, increasing our turns on capital. 
As in support of platforms, we have significantly improved our game development processes. For example, we have removed about 1/3 of the time it takes per game from market. This and other initiatives to are designed to reduce cost and increase the frequency of our successes. 
Our customer first principle is at the core of everything we do and will continue to partner with their customers in ways that were delivered the their relationships to improve products and markets isn't financial results over the long term.

And this pencils out based on our x-U.S. work. So what you'll see us doing is expanding from casino into poker bingo and sports betting on a B2B basis in legalized markets like outside the U.S. in the short term moving into the U.S. when and if those markets open.

As you can see from our third quarter results, we are delivering on the commitment we have made to all of our stakeholders, with solid revenue growth, stable product margins, tightly managed expenses and an operating margin of 29%, our best in over 3 years. We believe the improvements we are driving across the organization have the potential to generate steady, attractive returns. 
We have adjusted our business portfolio to better align our assets with our future vision. The acquisition of Entraction is expected to enhance our interactive market position by adding poker, bingo and sports betting to our industry-leading online casino products. This is a clear example of our plan to prioritize higher growth opportunity in a responsible manner.  We believe that our interactive business will be an important contributor to revenue and earnings growth in the coming years. 
Our agreement to sell the Barcrest Group is expected to close in our fiscal fourth quarter. This transaction will allow us to reinvest the proceeds to drive enhanced products for our customers. Strong cash generation continued to be one of the strengths of our business model, evident again this quarter. 
Consistent with our cash management strategy, our Board has authorized a $500 million share repurchase. We acted quickly in the quarter by applying $25 million to the buyback of IGT stock. We will continue to remain focused on efficiently deploying capital to drive positive returns for our shareholders. 
With that, I'd like to ask Pat to provide you with the details on our third quarter financial performance. Pat?"

Our adjusted third quarter earnings from continuing operations grew 22% to $78 million or $0.26 per share versus $64 million or $0.21 per share in last year's third quarter. A table reconciling the adjusted ear",692,"Thanks, Patti, and good afternoon, everyone. Our adjusted third quarter earnings from continuing operations grew 22% to $78 million or $0.26 per share versus $64 million or $0.21 per share in last year's third quarter. A table reconciling the adjusted earnings to GAAP earnings is available in this afternoon's press release. All periods presented have been adjusted to classify the Barcrest Group and discontinued operations. 
At a high level, the growth in earnings was driven by higher product sales revenues coupled with exceptional margin performance. Our total revenues for the third quarter increased 3% to $489 million, a result of stronger product sales in Latin America, North America and Europe combined with higher average selling prices. 
Gross margin for the company was 59%, up 300 basis points year-on-year, mainly due to higher performance in our North American gaming operations and growth in international selling prices. 
Gaming operations revenues were $267 million in the third quarter, down 1% sequentially and from the prior year. We generated an average of $55.55 in revenue per unit per day, which is up 3% compared to last year's third quarter. Strong performance for our domestic, Wide Area Progressive games positively contributed to the increase in yield. 
Consistent with last quarter, our coin-in per machine per day was up 13% in our Wide Area Progressive units. Average revenue per day decreased sequentially due to a higher mix of lower yields and international units. 
Gaming operations gross margin was 62%, up 400 basis points versus last year on improved performance and lower jackpot expense. If you remember, in last year's third quarter, we had an unfavorable move in interest rates that temporarily suppressed the margin. 
IGT's consolidated install base ended the third quarter at 53,300 units, which is up 800 units sequentially. Consolidated product sales revenues increased 8% to $222 million for the quarter compared to $206 million in last year's third quarter. Globally, we recognized 8,900 units in the quarter, up 7% from last year's third quarter primarily driven by higher domestic replacements and Latin American sales. 
North America's machine sales revenues were up 11% over the prior year quarter, to $70 million on an increase of 400 units. North America's average selling price in the quarter increased 2% compared to last year on a higher mix of new cabinets. Specifically, the new Universal Slant and the G23 Multi-Layer Display models combined with lower average discounts. 
North America's product sales gross margins were strong, again at 55%. International product sales revenue increased to $86 million on volume of 4,000 units recognized for the current quarter compared to $82 million and 3,800 units, respectively, in the prior year quarter. 
Internationally, average selling price was up 16% year-over-year primarily due to favorable shifts in product mix and foreign exchange rates. Worldwide non-machine revenues, mainly from the sales of systems conversions and intellectual property fees declined 4% to $85 million for the quarter or 38% of products sales compared to $88 million or 43% in the prior year quarter, mainly due to a large international system sale recognized in last year's third quarter. 
Third quarter operating expenses were $148 million, flat when compared to last year's third quarter and down 100 basis points as a percentage of total revenues. Total SG&A at 17% of revenues was also flat, compared to last year as lower bad debt expense offset higher variable compensation expenses. 
Cash equivalents and short-term investments inclusive of restricted amounts totaled $401 million at June 30 of this year compared to $249 million at September 30, 2010.  Contractual debt obligations totaled $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter. In the third quarter, we generated $185 million in operating cash flow, up 26% compared to last year. Also in the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $16.25 per share. 
In summary, our consolidated revenue has shown good sequential growth during the year. We are generating sustainable efficiencies all throughout the company and improving our profitability. 
This concludes my prepared remarks regarding our third quarter results. Thank you for your time and attention, and I'll now turn the call back to Patti."

At the start of fiscal 2011, we set out to grow and improve our gaming operations, expand our international presence and accelerate our Interactive business. We are driving the desired outcome across each of these priorities. 
In gaming operations, we have over 1,000 units installed on the Center Stage platform, including the recently released Dark Knight. The games that support Center Stage are performing extremely well. We expect to leverage this platform by introducing new content and themes to extend the life of the hardware. Our core products business has also elevated. We began shipping our Universal Slant product with a strong portfolio of new games. Our legendary Wolf Run game, the #1 performing title for many, many years, was surpassed by 2 titles this quarter: Golden Goddess and Black Widow, both of which are playing significantly above-floor averages. 
We are improving our game-development process, bringing better performing titles to market much faster, while converting more of our research and development spending to revenue. 
Our international organization continued to break records. Driven by strong replacement demand for our premium products in Europe and Australia, we achieved an average selling price of $16,600 in international product sales, our highest ever. While our ASPs are setting new benchmarks, our product gross margin is also healthy at 57%, a 400-basis-point improvement over last year. 
Early return on our 6 new Asian-themed games are encouraging and a testament to the demand for localized content. We will continue to deliver games in greater volume that are specifically designed for our international markets. 
In comparison to last year, our Interactive business grew revenue over 20% and increased gross profit nearly 30%. We added Paddy Power to our growing list of interactive customers as we launched a full slate of browser-based mobile games. Initial numbers are showing a significant increase in both total wagers an average bet. 
I will now turn the call over to Eric Tom, who will provide further context in our third quarter results. Eric?"

We solicit more feedback than we ever have, and we are using it to shape our product systems and services. 
In June, we hosted a Global Systems Users Conference to engage with our system customers, share best practices and showcase the latest advancement of our technology platforms. At this year's conference, which had a record attendance from around the world, we announced our open-standard Universal Game Adaptor product. This product addresses or casino customers' desire to add picture-in-picture of rich media across an entire slot floor in a cost-efficient manner.  This solution allows any game manufacturer to deliver safe compatibility of their slot machine with any casino management system, a first for the industry. 
Staying true to our word of consistently increasing features and functionality of our system offerings, we also demonstrated several new applications for our sbX system. We expect to be delivering a steady flow of new bonus, community and game play applications in the coming quarters. 
Our Beijing research and development team plays a vital role in many of these applications, and our global R&D footprint will continue to be a strategic  competitive advantage for IGT. 
In the quarter, we drove significant international system wins in Panama, Uruguay, Australia and the Netherlands. And our sbX system has now been sold on 6 continents. We have several exciting new releases in the quarter, helping drive strong demand for our products. We released the highly anticipated Hot Rolled series, which features our first interactive touchscreen bonus. The brand-new Encore Progressive product is specifically designed to boost coin-in on operator's own games. Our customers can now play bank 3-level mystery progresses over their players favorite slots. 
Engineered and designed with customer input, the Universal Slant Top box has been also well received. Our customers love its serviceability and functionality. And the advanced design of this machine reduces its manufacturing time by as much as 50%. Exceeding our own expectations, we have already received orders for 2,300 units. In gaming operations, our convertible platforms enabled us to quickly switch titles right on the casino floor in about an hour, increasing our returns on capital. 
In support of these platforms, we have significantly improved our game-development processes. For example, we have removed about 1/3 of the time it takes per game to go from idea to market. This and other initiatives still to come are designed to reduce cost and increase the frequency of our successes. 
Our customer-first principle is at the core of everything we do and we will continue to partner with our customers in ways that will deliver deeper relationships, improve products and more consistent financial results over the long term. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Patti for her closing comments."

And this pencils out based on our x U.S. work. So what you'll see us doing is expanding from casino into poker, bingo and sports betting on a B2B basis in legalized markets, like outside the U.S. in the short term moving into the U.S. when and if those markets open. So I think, we're nicely positioned with our land-based business, coupled with the Entraction perfect purchase and the good work that our Interactive group had been doing on a standalone basis.

Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as indicative of future performance.

As you can see from our third quarter results, we are delivering on the commitments we have made to all of our stakeholders, with solid revenue growth, stable product margins, tightly managed expenses and an operating margin of 29%, our best in over 3 years. We believe the improvements we are driving across the organization have the potential to generate steady, attractive returns. 
We have adjusted our business portfolio to better align our assets with our future vision. The acquisition of Entraction is expected to enhance our interactive market position by adding poker, bingo and sports betting to our industry-leading online casino products. This is a clear example of our plan to prioritize higher growth opportunities in a responsible manner. We believe that our interactive business will be an important contributor to revenue and earnings growth in the coming years. 
Our agreement to sell the Barcrest Group is expected to close in our fiscal fourth quarter. This transaction will allow us to reinvest the proceeds to drive enhanced products for our customers. Strong cash generation continued to be one of the strengths of our business model, evident again this quarter. 
Consistent with our cash management strategy, our Board has authorized a $500 million share repurchase. We acted quickly in the quarter by applying $25 million to the buyback of IGT stock. We will continue to remain focused on efficiently deploying capital to drive positive returns for our shareholders. 
With that, I'd like to ask Pat to provide you with the details on our third quarter financial performance. Pat?"

Our adjusted third quarter earnings from continuing operations grew 22% to $78 million or $0.26 per share versus $64 million or $0.21 per share in last year's third quarter. A table reconciling the adjusted ear",692,"Thanks, Patti, and good afternoon, everyone. Our adjusted third quarter earnings from continuing operations grew 22% to $78 million or $0.26 per share versus $64 million or $0.21 per share in last year's third quarter. A table reconciling the adjusted earnings to GAAP earnings is available in this afternoon's press release. All periods presented have been adjusted to classify the Barcrest Group and discontinued operations. 
At a high level, the growth in earnings was driven by higher product sales revenues coupled with exceptional margin performance. Our total revenues for the third quarter increased 3% to $489 million, a result of stronger product sales in Latin America, North America and Europe combined with higher average selling prices. 
Gross margin for the company was 59%, up 300 basis points year-on-year, mainly due to higher performance in our North American gaming operations and growth in international selling prices. 
Gaming operations revenues were $267 million in the third quarter, down 1% sequentially and from the prior year. We generated an average of $55.55 in revenue per unit per day, which is up 3% compared to last year's third quarter. Strong performance for our domestic, Wide Area Progressive games positively contributed to the increase in yield. 
Consistent with last quarter, our coin-in per machine per day was up 13% in our Wide Area Progressive units. Average revenue per day decreased sequentially due to a higher mix of lower yield in international units. 
Gaming operations gross margin was 62%, up 400 basis points versus last year on improved performance and lower jackpot expense. If you remember, in last year's third quarter, we had an unfavorable move in interest rates that temporarily suppressed the margin. 
IGT's consolidated install base ended the third quarter at 53,300 units, which is up 800 units sequentially. Consolidated product sales revenues increased 8% to $222 million for the quarter compared to $206 million in last year's third quarter. Globally, we recognized 8,900 units in the quarter, up 7% from last year's third quarter primarily driven by higher domestic replacements and Latin American sales. 
North America's machine sales revenues were up 11% over the prior year quarter, to $70 million on an increase of 400 units. North America's average selling price in the quarter increased 2% compared to last year on a higher mix of new cabinets. Specifically, the new Universal Slant and the G23 Multi-Layer Display models combined with lower average discounts. 
North America's product sales gross margins were strong, again at 55%. International product sales revenue increased to $86 million on volume of 4,000 units recognized for the current quarter compared to $82 million and 3,800 units, respectively, in the prior year quarter. 
Internationally, average selling price was up 16% year-over-year primarily due to favorable shifts in product mix and foreign exchange rates. Worldwide non-machine revenues, mainly from the sales of systems conversions and intellectual property fees declined 4% to $85 million for the quarter or 38% of products sales compared to $88 million or 43% in the prior year quarter, mainly due to a large international system sale recognized in last year's third quarter. 
Third quarter operating expenses were $148 million, flat when compared to last year's third quarter and down 100 basis points as a percentage of total revenues. Total SG&A at 17% of revenues was also flat, compared to last year as lower bad debt expense offset higher variable compensation expenses. 
Cash equivalents and short-term investments inclusive of restricted amounts totaled $401 million at June 30 of this year compared to $249 million at September 30, 2010. Contractual debt obligations totaled $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter. In the third quarter, we generated $185 million in operating cash flow, up 26% compared to last year. Also in the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $16.25 per share. 
In summary, our consolidated revenue has shown good sequential growth during the year. We are generating sustainable efficiencies all throughout the company and improving our profitability. 
This concludes my prepared remarks regarding our third quarter results. Thank you for your time and attention, and I'll now turn the call back to Patti."

At the start of fiscal 2011, we set out to grow and improve our gaming operations, expand our international presence and accelerate our Interactive business. We are driving the desired outcome across each of these priorities. 
In gaming operations, we have over 1,000 units installed on the Center Stage platform, including the recently released Dark Knight. The games that support Center Stage are performing extremely well. We expect to leverage this platform by introducing new content and themes to extend the life of the hardware. Our core products business has also elevated. We began shipping our Universal Slant product with a strong portfolio of new games. Our legendary Wolf Run game, the #1 performing title for many, many years, was surpassed by 2 titles this quarter: Golden Goddess and Black Widow, both of which are playing significantly above-floor averages. 
We are improving our game-development process, bringing better performing titles to market much faster, while converting more of our research and development spending to revenue. 
Our international organization continues to break records. Driven by strong replacement demand for our premium products in Europe and Australia, we achieved an average selling price of $16,600 in international product sales, our highest ever. While our ASPs are setting new benchmarks, our product gross margin is also healthy at 57%, a 400-basis-point improvement over last year. 
Early returns on our 6 new Asian-themed games are encouraging and a testament to the demand for localized content. We will continue to deliver games in greater volume that are specifically designed for our international markets. 
In comparison to last year, our Interactive business grew revenue over 20% and increased gross profit nearly 30%. We added Paddy Power to our growing list of interactive customers as we launched a full slate of browser-based mobile games. Initial numbers are showing a significant increase in both total wagers and average bet. 
I will now turn the call over to Eric Tom, who will provide further context on our third quarter results. Eric?"

We solicit more feedback than we ever have, and we are using it to shape our product systems and services. 
In June, we hosted a Global Systems Users Conference to engage with our system customers, share best practices and showcase the latest advancement of our technology platforms. At this year's conference, which had a record attendance from around the world, we announced our open-standard Universal Game Adaptor product. This product addresses or casino customers' desire to add picture-in-picture, rich media across an entire slot floor in a cost-efficient manner.  This solution allows any game manufacturer to deliver safe compatibility of their slot machines with any casino management system, a first for the industry. 
Staying true to our word of consistently increasing features and functionality of our system offerings, we also demonstrated several new applications for our sbX system. We expect to be delivering a steady flow of new bonus, community and game play applications in the coming quarters. 
Our Beijing research and development team plays a vital role in many of these applications, and our global R&D footprint will continue to be a strategic  competitive advantage for IGT. 
In the quarter, we drove significant international system wins in Panama, Uruguay, Australia and the Netherlands. And our sbX system has now been sold on 6 continents. We have several exciting new releases in the quarter, helping drive strong demand for our products. We released the highly anticipated Hot Roll series, which features our first interactive touchscreen bonus. The brand-new Encore Progressive product is specifically designed to boost coin-in on operator's own games. Our customers can now play bank 3-level mystery progresses over their players favorite slots. 
Engineered and designed with customer input, the Universal Slant Top box has been also well received. Our customers love its serviceability and functionality. And the advanced design of this machine reduces its manufacturing time by as much as 50%. Exceeding our own expectations, we have already received orders for 2,300 units. In gaming operations, our convertible platforms enable us to quickly switch titles right on the casino floor in about an hour, increasing our returns on capital. 
In support of these platforms, we have significantly improved our game-development processes. For example, we have removed about 1/3 of the time it takes for a game to go from idea to market. This and other initiatives still to come are designed to reduce cost and increase the frequency of our successes. 
Our customer-first principle is at the core of everything we do and we will continue to partner with our customers in ways that will deliver deeper relationships, improve products and more consistent financial results over the long term. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Patti for her closing comments."

Eric brings the successful track record of driving improved operating results at Fortune 500 companies, and I believe, he is perfectly suited to help advance IGT's future growth. 
We are 75% of the way through the fiscal year, and with a solid 3 quarters behind us, we are raising our 2011 earnings guidance to $0.89 to $0.93 per share on an adjusted basis. 
In summary, we are generating strong operating cash flow. Improving our gaming operations and product sales businesses, harvesting opportunities internationally and continuing to execute against our plan of becoming a full-service global partner in the interactive space.

I mean, we are very bullish as a company on the notion of convergence in this marketplace and the convergence for players to allow them to move from device to device over time. Our strategy and our purchase of Entraction and the work we're doing to integrate Entraction into IGT is a 100% x U.S. strategy. We're not counting on the U.S. opening. And this pencils-out based on our x U.S. work. So what you'll see us doing is expanding from casino into poker, bingo and sports betting on a B2B basis in legalized markets, likely outside the U.S. in the short term moving to the U.S. when and if those markets open. So I think, we're nicely positioned with our land-based business, coupled with the Entraction perfect -- purchase and the good work that our Interactive group has been doing on a standalone basis.

As you can see from our third quarter results, we are delivering on the commitments we have made to all of our stakeholders, with solid revenue growth, stable product margins, tightly managed expenses and an operating margin of 29%, our best in over 3 years. We believe the improvements we are driving across the organization have the potential to generate steady, attractive returns. 
We have adjusted our business portfolio to better align our assets with our future vision. The acquisition of Entraction is expected to enhance our interactive market position by adding poker, bingo and sports betting to our industry-leading online casino products. This is a clear example of our plan to prioritize higher growth opportunities in a responsible manner. We believe that our interactive business will be an important contributor to revenue and earnings growth in the coming years. 
Our agreement to sell the Barcrest Group is expected to close in our fiscal fourth quarter. This transaction will allow us to reinvest the proceeds to drive enhanced products for our customers. Strong cash generation continued to be one of the strengths of our business model, evident again this quarter. 
Consistent with our cash management strategy, our Board has authorized a $500 million share repurchase. We acted quickly in the quarter by applying $25 million to the buyback of IGT stock. We will continue to remain focused on efficiently deploying capital to drive positive returns for our shareholders. 
With that, I'd like to ask Pat to provide you with the details on our third quarter financial performance. Pat?"

Our adjusted third quarter earnings from continuing operations grew 22% to $78 million or $0.26 per share versus $64 million or $0.21 per share in last year's third quarter. A table reconciling the adjusted ear",692,"Thanks, Patti, and good afternoon, everyone. Our adjusted third quarter earnings from continuing operations grew 22% to $78 million or $0.26 per share versus $64 million or $0.21 per share in last year's third quarter. A table reconciling the adjusted earnings to GAAP earnings is available in this afternoon's press release. All periods presented have been adjusted to classify the Barcrest Group and discontinued operations. 
At a high level, the growth in earnings was driven by higher product sales revenues coupled with exceptional margin performance. Our total revenues for the third quarter increased 3% to $489 million, a result of stronger product sales in Latin America, North America and Europe combined with higher average selling prices. 
Gross margin for the company was 59%, up 300 basis points year-on-year, mainly due to higher performance in our North American gaming operations and growth in international selling prices. 
Gaming operations revenues were $267 million in the third quarter, down 1% sequentially and from the prior year. We generated an average of $55.55 in revenue per unit per day, which is up 3% compared to last year's third quarter. Strong performance for our domestic, Wide Area Progressive games positively contributed to the increase in yield. 
Consistent with last quarter, our coin-in per machine per day was up 13% in our Wide Area Progressive units. Average revenue per day decreased sequentially due to a higher mix of lower yield in international units. 
Gaming operations gross margin was 62%, up 400 basis points versus last year on improved performance and lower jackpot expense. If you remember, in last year's third quarter, we had an unfavorable move in interest rates that temporarily suppressed the margin. 
IGT's consolidated install base ended the third quarter at 53,300 units, which is up 800 units sequentially. Consolidated product sales revenues increased 8% to $222 million for the quarter compared to $206 million in last year's third quarter. Globally, we recognized 8,900 units in the quarter, up 7% from last year's third quarter primarily driven by higher domestic replacements and Latin American sales. 
North America's machine sales revenues were up 11% over the prior year quarter, to $70 million on an increase of 400 units. North America's average selling price in the quarter increased 2% compared to last year on a higher mix of new cabinets. Specifically, the new Universal Slant and the G23 Multi-Layer Display models combined with lower average discounts. 
North America's product sales gross margins were strong, again at 55%. International product sales revenue increased to $86 million on volume of 4,000 units recognized for the current quarter compared to $82 million and 3,800 units, respectively, in the prior year quarter. 
Internationally, average selling price was up 16% year-over-year primarily due to favorable shifts in product mix and foreign exchange rates. Worldwide non-machine revenues, mainly from the sales of systems conversions and intellectual property fees declined 4% to $85 million for the quarter or 38% of products sales compared to $88 million or 43% in the prior year quarter, mainly due to a large international system sale recognized in last year's third quarter. 
Third quarter operating expenses were $148 million, flat when compared to last year's third quarter and down 100 basis points as a percentage of total revenues. Total SG&A at 17% of revenues was also flat, compared to last year as lower bad debt expense offset higher variable compensation expenses. 
Cash equivalents and short-term investments inclusive of restricted amounts totaled $401 million at June 30 of this year compared to $249 million at September 30, 2010. Contractual debt obligations totaled $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter. In the third quarter, we generated $185 million in operating cash flow, up 26% compared to last year. Also in the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $16.25 per share. 
In summary, our consolidated revenue has shown good sequential growth during the year. We are generating sustainable efficiencies all throughout the company and improving our profitability. 
This concludes my prepared remarks regarding our third quarter results. Thank you for your time and attention, and I'll now turn the call back to Patti."

Our legendary Wolf Run game, the #1 performing title for many, many years, was surpassed by 2 titles this quarter: Golden Goddess and Black Widow, both of which are playing significantly above-floor averages. 
We are improving our game-development process, bringing better performing titles to market much faster, while converting more of our research and development spending to revenue. 
Our international organization continues to break records. Driven by strong replacement demand for our premium products in Europe and Australia, we achieved an average selling price of $16,600 in international product sales, our highest ever. While our ASPs are setting new benchmarks, our product gross margin is also healthy at 57%, a 400-basis-point improvement over last year. 
Early returns on our 6 new Asian-themed games are encouraging and a testament to the demand for localized content. We will continue to deliver games in greater volume that are specifically designed for our international markets. 
In comparison to last year, our Interactive business grew revenue over 20% and increased gross profit nearly 30%. We added Paddy Power to our growing list of interactive customers as we launched a full slate of browser-based mobile games. Initial numbers are showing a significant increase in both total wagers and average bet. 
I will now turn the call over to Eric Tom, who will provide further context on our third quarter results. Eric?"

We solicit more feedback than we ever have, and we are using it to shape our product systems and services. 
In June, we hosted a Global Systems Users Conference to engage with our system customers, share best practices and showcase the latest advancement of our technology platforms. At this year's conference, which had a record attendance from around the world, we announced our open-standard Universal Game Adaptor product. This product addresses or casino customers' desire to add picture-in-picture, rich media across an entire slot floor in a cost-efficient manner.  This solution allows any game manufacturer to deliver safe compatibility of their slot machines with any casino management system, a first for the industry. 
Staying true to our word of consistently increasing features and functionality of our system offerings, we also demonstrated several new applications for our sbX system. We expect to be delivering a steady flow of new bonus, community and game play applications in the coming quarters. 
Our Beijing research and development team plays a vital role in many of these applications, and our global R&D footprint will continue to be a strategic  competitive advantage for IGT. 
In the quarter, we drove significant international system wins in Panama, Uruguay, Australia and the Netherlands. And our sbX system has now been sold on 6 continents. We have several exciting new releases in the quarter, helping drive strong demand for our products. We released the highly anticipated Hot Roll series, which features our first interactive touchscreen bonus. The brand-new Encore Progressive product is specifically designed to boost coin-in on operator's own games. Our customers can now play bank 3-level mystery progresses over their players favorite slots. 
Engineered and designed with customer input, the Universal Slant Top box has been also well received. Our customers love its serviceability and functionality. And the advanced design of this machine reduces its manufacturing time by as much as 50%. Exceeding our own expectations, we have already received orders for 2,300 units. In gaming operations, our convertible platforms enable us to quickly switch titles right on the casino floor in about an hour, increasing our returns on capital. 
In support of these platforms, we have significantly improved our game-development processes. For example, we have removed about 1/3 of the time it takes for a game to go from idea to market. This and other initiatives still to come are designed to reduce cost and increase the frequency of our successes. 
Our customer-first principle is at the core of everything we do and we will continue to partner with our customers in ways that will deliver deeper relationships, improve products and more consistent financial results over the long term. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Patti for her closing comments."

We are very encouraged by the momentum we have generated over the first 9 months of this fiscal year. Equally as important, we have positioned ourselves to sustain and accelerate these returns into the future. With the addition of Eric Berg as our President, we have strengthened the IGT management team, with increased leadership capacity and global expertise. 
Eric brings the successful track record of driving improved operating results at Fortune 500 companies, and I believe, he is perfectly suited to help advance IGT's future growth. 
We are 75% of the way through the fiscal year, and with a solid 3 quarters behind us, we are raising our 2011 earnings guidance to $0.89 to $0.93 per share on an adjusted basis. 
In summary, we are generating strong operating cash flow. Improving our gaming operations and product sales businesses, harvesting opportunities internationally and continuing to execute against our plan of becoming a full-service global partner in the interactive space. 
With that, we thank you, and we'd like to take your questions."

And this pencils-out based on our x U.S. work. So what you'll see us doing is expanding from casino into poker, bingo and sports betting on a B2B basis in legalized markets, likely outside the U.S. in the short term moving to the U.S. when and if those markets open. So I think, we're nicely positioned with our land-based business, coupled with the Entraction perfect -- purchase and the good work that our Interactive group has been doing on a standalone basis.

Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as indicative of future performance. 
Potential risks and uncertainties that could cause our business and financial results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements are included in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.
All information discussed on this call is as of today, November 8, 2011, and IGT does not intend and undertakes no obligation to update this information to reflect future events or circumstances.
In addition, on today's call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the GAAP measures we consider most comparable can be found in today's earnings release, which is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.igt.com and included as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form 8-K we furnished today with the SEC.

The fiscal year 2011, we set out at IGT to drive higher revenue, grow our gaming operations, improve profitability, leverage our strong cash flows and increase our interactive presence. We delivered results in line with the commitments we made to our stakeholders by driving improvement across every aspect of our business. 
Our products are better than ever and our revenues are growing. Total fourth quarter revenues increased 14% year-over-year to $540 million. This represents our highest revenue quarter since the first quarter of fiscal 2009. 
We launched several of the most successful participation, for sale and interactive games in the company's history. Nearly 50% of our newly introduced core games are performing at least 1.5x the floor average, that's up from 33% just 3 years ago. 
Gaming operations continue to expand. We grew our average yield by 9% over the prior year quarter, and our domestic installed base was up for the year for the first time since 2007. Our profitability is improving. Full year consolidated gross profit margin increased 100 basis points to 58%, with strength in both product sales and gaming operation's gross margins. 
Our cash flows are unrivaled. We returned over $120 million in capital to our shareholders, decreased our borrowing costs and grew our cash position to over $500 million. Our interactive business is advancing, with the addition of Entraction, we have added poker, bingo and sports betting to our industry-leading online and mobile portfolio. 
Over the past 2 years, we have nearly doubled the earnings performance of the company. In 2009, with $2 billion in revenues, our GAAP EPS from continuing operations was just $0.50. This year, with similar revenues, our GAAP EPS from continuing operations is $0.97. We have added considerable earnings leverage to our business, and we expect this momentum to accelerate in 2012. 
I'd like to take a minute to express my gratitude to those who have made these results possible, our employees. 2011 is a testament to the collective effort of our global workforce, and I want to thank our employees for delivering financial results that remind us of the power of IGT. 
I'll now turn the call over to Pat for the financial details. Pat?"

Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings from continuing operations grew 44% to $73 million or $0.24 per share versus $51 million and $0.17 in last year's fourth quarter. The growth in adjusted earnings was driv",685,"Thank you, Patti, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings from continuing operations grew 44% to $73 million or $0.24 per share versus $51 million and $0.17 in last year's fourth quarter. The growth in adjusted earnings was driven by higher product sales revenue coupled with strong margin performance. Both periods presented in this release have been adjusted to classify the escrow and the discontinued operations. 
For the fiscal year, adjusted earnings from continuing operations grew 13% to $280 million or $0.93 per share versus $248 million and $0.84 in the prior year. Our total revenues for the fourth quarter increased 14% to $540 million year-over-year, a result of stronger product sales in North America and higher International Gaming operations. For fiscal 2011, total revenues grew 2% to $1.96 billion. 
Gaming operations revenues were $283 million on the fourth quarter, up 8% versus last year on higher MegaJackpots performance and increases in our international installed base. For the quarter, we generated an average of $58.08 in revenue per unit per day, which is up 9% compared to last year's fourth quarter. 
The strong performance of our domestic progressive games positively contributed to this increase in yield. IGT's consolidated installed base ended the fourth quarter at 53,900 units, up 1,000 units from a year ago and 600 units sequentially. Reported gaming operations gross margin was 57% in the fourth quarter, down from 58% to the same quarter last year. And intellectual property settlement and changes in interest rates reduce our gaming ops' gross margins by 240 basis points and 80 basis points, respectively. 
Consolidated product sales revenue increased 20% to $257 million for the quarter, compared to $213 million in the fourth quarter last year. Globally, we recognized 11,300 units in the quarter, up 38% from last year's fourth quarter, primarily driven by higher domestic replacement. In the quarter, we recognized 5,000 North American replacement units, the highest quarterly level in 4 years. We estimate our North American replacement share grew again and was 40% to 45% this quarter when including the 5 largest suppliers. 
North America's machine sales revenues were up 115% over the prior year quarter to $101 million or an increase of 3,800 units. North America's average selling price in the quarter was flat compared to last year. North America's product sales gross margins were up 500 basis points to 56% due to lower nonstandard costs, lower discounts and increased intellectual property fees. 
International product sales revenue decreased to $96 million on volume of 4,200 units recognized to the current quarter, compared to $101 million on 4,900 units respectively in the prior quarter due to new opening. International average selling price was up 4% year-over-year, primarily due to favorable foreign exchange rates. 
Worldwide, non-machine revenues mainly from the sale of the systems conversions and intellectual property fees declined 2% to $85 million for the quarter with 32% of product sales compared to $87 million or 41% of product sales in the prior year quarter. The decrease in domestic diversion kit sales was partially offset by a significant increase in domestic intellectual property risks. 
Fourth quarter operating expenses were $182 million or 34% of revenues compared to $169 million and 36% of revenues in last year's fourth quarter. This year's fourth quarter operating expenses included $16 million related to various asset impairments. SG&A excluding bad debt was $99 million, down slightly as a percentage of revenues. 
Cash equivalents, short-term investments inclusive of restricted amounts, totaled $552 million at September 30, 2011, compared to $249 million at September 30 of the year ago. Contractual debt obligations totaled $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter. 
For fiscal year 2011, we generated $612 million in operating cash flow, up 4% compared to last year. Also in the quarter, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of common stock at an average price of $15.30 per share. 
In summary, 2011 was a good year across nearly all financial metrics. We are generating sustainable efficiencies throughout the company and improving our profitability. Thank you for your time and attention. And with that, I'll turn it back to Patti."

While we were pleased with the results we delivered in 2011, we remain committed to growing our business and increasing our returns. With the improvements we've driven over the past several years, globalizing the business, instilling a customer first approach from top to bottom and deploying our research and development dollars in an efficient yet dynamic manner have uniquely positioned IGT for a very bright future. 
For 2012, our core objective will remain consistent as we look to grow revenues, build on the momentum of our internal improvement, leverage our income statement and energize our interactive business. We plan to enhance the velocity of our top line growth by driving increased penetration in new and existing international markets and by growing our non-boxed revenues. We will deploy sales and service personnel closer to our customers, introduce a robust portfolio of localized content and leverage our world-class product portfolio in an effort to increase our international shipments and revenues. 
We anticipate further improving our operating margin by growing our gaming operations installed base globally, increasing the profit per unit within that installed base and expanding our global process efficiencies. Given our return-oriented discipline, we expect our research and development investment to remain constant at about $200 million in 2012. 
Our strong cash flows serve as an unmatched competitive advantage, one that we will continue to leverage by investing in future growth opportunities, judiciously returning capital to shareholders and preparing for future debt maturities. We plan to strengthen our interactive business by enhancing our global platform capabilities, sustaining our poker liquidity and augmenting our product verticals with global partnerships in both sports betting and bingo. 
We remain committed to building out a full suite of casino products as we extend the thrill of gaming in all realized jurisdictions across the online and mobile world. I will now turn the call over to our President, Eric Berg."

External",494,"Thank you, Patti, and it's great to join you on my first IGT earnings call. I'm now in my fourth month and I couldn't be happier being part of the IGT team. Our employees are embracing the notion of ongoing change, making IGT stronger everyday. 
Externally, I've spent a great deal of time with our global customers. They're recognizing our commitment, and this partnership is showing up in improved operating performance. For example, our manufacturing operations team has changed their measurement system to track performance against customer requested delivery date has improved to significantly exceed 90% every month. 
Additionally, we recently announced a partnership with Holland Casinos involving the modernization of their systems with IGT's casino management tools across all of their Netherlands properties. This partnership is truly a win for both organizations. 
In response we received to G2E exceeded our expectations. We received initial orders for over 2,000 G23 machines from customers located all over the globe during our 3 days of the show. We demonstrated in every product line from gaming operations to for-sale games and systems that we can provide a premier world-class full floor solution. 
Over the past 4 months, I've been learning our business from the front lines back, spending time with customers and with our frontline employees, learning the core value delivery processes within IGT, understanding what needs to be preserved as well as what needs to be improved. 
To achieve the 2012 goals that Patti articulated, I wanted to highlight a few of our focus areas. We will be driving a tightly integrated operating model. This includes identifying our winning strategy in each area of the business, clarifying operational ownership, documenting key performance indicators, setting targets and driving an execution plan to improve performance and achieve results. We will be accelerating our path to operating as a truly global organization, as this agenda will enable us to capitalize on IGT scale advantages. This agenda encompasses sales, service delivery, procurement, manufacturing, marketing, IT, product management and every other aspect of our business. 
We are benchmarking against the best in the world. We will stay focused on delivering region-specific, localized product into every corner of the globe as efficiently as possible and provide our sales and service leaders the tools they need to grow our business. 
At IGT, we will always continue to put our customers first. Our growth opportunities will be designed to move our customers and our industry forward. For example, we recently entered into a multiyear, first look agreement with Sony, where we will have unique access to Sony's iconic film and television library as part of our predictable, efficient framework for providing innovative PDx content and experiences to every player around the world. I'm tremendously enthused to be part of the winning team at IGT, and I look forward to speaking with all of you more over the coming weeks and months. 
With that, I'll turn it back to you, Patti, for your closing remarks."

In summary for 2012, we expect to increase the pace of our revenue growth, further improve our operating margins, leverage our strong cash flows and energize the interactive business. 
Given that there is a lot of volatility in the capital markets, we are assuming a benign macroeconomic environment for the next 12 months. In some areas of the industry, we see expansion, and in others, we see uncertainty. Our differentiated business model and diverse global footprint should continue to help mitigate the impact of any large unforeseen events around the world. Our customers are responding positively to our high-performing products, and we believe we are well positioned to sustain and enhance our financial returns. 
For fiscal year 2012, we would like to offer adjusted earnings guidance from continuing operations of $0.93 to $1.03 per share. This guidance assumes a 37% tax rate and a share repurchase program consistent with the last 2 quarters. 
With that, we thank you for your time and we'd like to take your questions please."

When you think about the low end, Felicia, of the guidance, it really thinks about fiscal '12 looking similar to fiscal '11 from a replacement perspective, a bit of an uptick in the installed base for gaming operations and a bit of an uptick in yield on that base but nothing for Canada, Illinois or Ohio VLTs, the VLT portion of Ohio. So we're not counting on any of that coming into the year. We think that's upside to the plan but it's not in the low end. The high end assumes that the replacements uptick a bit, and installed base in yield but still no Canada, Illinois or Ohio. So as the year goes on and we see more certainty around those markets opening, we'll adjust as necessary but given the current uncertainty, we haven't included any of that in the guidance."

The fiscal year 2011, we set out, at IGT, to drive higher revenue, grow our gaming operations, improve profitability, leverage our strong cash flows, and increase our interactive presence. We delivered results in line with the commitments we made to our stakeholders by driving improvement across every aspect of our business. 
Our products are better than ever and our revenues are growing. Total fourth quarter revenues increased 14% year-over-year to $540 million. This represents our highest revenue quarter since the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We launched several of the most successful participation for sale and interactive games in the company's history. Nearly 50% of our newly introduced core games are performing at least 1.5x the floor average, that's up from 33% just 3 years ago. Gaming operations continue to expand. We grew our average yield by 9% over the prior year quarter, and our domestic installed base was up for the year, for the first time since 2007.Our profitability is improving. Full year consolidated gross profit margin increased 100 basis points to 58%, with strength in both product sales and gaming operation's gross margins. Our cash flows are unrivaled. We returned over $120 million in capital to our shareholders, decreased our borrowing cost and grew our cash position to over $500 million. Our interactive business is advancing, with the addition of Entraction, we have added poker, bingo, and sports betting to our industry-leading online and mobile portfolio. Over the past 2 years, we have nearly doubled the earnings performance of the company. In 2009, with $2 billion in revenues, our GAAP EPS from continuing operations was just $0.50. This year, with similar revenues, our GAAP EPS from continuing operations is $0.97. We have added considerable earnings leverage to our business and we expect this momentum to accelerate in 2012.
I'd like to take a minute to express my gratitude to those who have made these results possible, our employees. 2011 is a testament to the collective effort of our global workforce, and I want to thank our employees for delivering financial results that remind us of the power of IGT.

The growth in adjusted earnings was driv",690,"Thank you, Patti, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings from continuing operations grew 44% to $73 million or $0.24 per share versus $51 million and $0.17 in last year's fourth quarter. The growth in adjusted earnings was driven by higher product sales revenue coupled with strong margin performance. Both periods presented in this release have been adjusted to classify the Barcrest Group and discontinued operations. 
For the fiscal year, adjusted earnings from continuing operations grew 13% to $280 million or $0.93 per share versus $248 million and $0.84 in the prior year. Our total revenues for the fourth quarter increased 14% to $540 million year-over-year, a result of stronger product sales in North America and higher International Gaming operations. For fiscal 2011, total revenues grew 2% to $1.96 billion. Gaming operations revenues were $283 million in the fourth quarter, up 8% versus last year on higher MegaJackpots performance and increases in our international installed base. For the quarter, we generated an average of $58.08 in revenue per unit per day, which is up 9% compared to last year's fourth quarter. The strong performance of our domestic wide area progressive games positively contributed to this increase in yield. IGT's consolidated installed base ended the fourth quarter at 53,900 units, up 1,000 units from a year ago, and 600 units sequentially. Reported gaming operations gross margin was 57% in the fourth quarter, down from 58% to the same quarter last year. And intellectual property settlement and changes in interest rates reduced our gaming ops' gross margins by 240 basis points and 80 basis points, respectively. Consolidated product sales revenue increased 20% to $257 million for the quarter, compared to $213 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Globally, we recognized 11,300 units in the quarter, up 38% from last year's fourth quarter, primarily driven by higher domestic replacement. In the quarter, we recognized 5,000 North American replacement units, the highest quarterly level in 4 years. We estimate our North American replacement share grew again and was 40% to 45% this quarter when including the 5 largest suppliers. North America's machine sales revenues were up 115% over the prior year quarter to $101 million or an increase of 3,800 units. North America's average selling price in the quarter was flat compared to last year. North America's product sales gross margins were up 500 basis points to 56% due to lower nonstandard costs, lower discounts, and increased intellectual property fees. International product sales revenue decreased to $96 million on volume of 4,200 units recognized to the current quarter, compared to $101 million on 4,900 units respectively in the prior quarter due to new opening. International average selling price was up 4% year-over-year, primarily due to favorable foreign exchange rates.  Worldwide, non-machine revenues, mainly from the sale of the systems, conversions, and intellectual property fees declined 2% to $85 million for the quarter with 32% of product sales compared to $87 million or 41% of product sales in the prior year quarter. The decrease in domestic diversion kit sales was partially offset by a significant increase in domestic intellectual property revenues. 
Fourth quarter operating expenses were $182 million or 34% of revenues compared to $169 million and 36% of revenues in last year's fourth quarter. This year's fourth quarter operating expenses included $16 million related to various asset impairments. SG&A excluding bad debt was $99 million, down slightly as a percentage of revenues. Cash equivalents, short-term investments inclusive of restricted amounts, totaled $552 million at September 30, 2011, compared to $249 million at September 30 of the year ago. Contractual debt obligations totaled $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter. For fiscal year 2011, we generated $612 million in operating cash flow, up 4% compared to last year. Also in the quarter, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of common stock at an average price of $15.30 per share.
In summary, 2011 was a good year for us in nearly all financial metrics. We are generating sustainable efficiencies throughout the company and improving our profitability. Thank you for your time and attention. And with that, I'll turn it back to Patti."

Varied improvements we've driven over the past several years, globalizing the business, instilling a customer first approach from top to bottom, and deploying our research and development dollars in an efficient yet dynamic manner, have uniquely positioned IGT for a very bright future.
For 2012, our core objectives will remain consistent as we look to grow revenues, build on the momentum of our internal improvement, leverage our income statement and energize our interactive business. We plan to enhance the velocity of our top line growth by driving increased penetration in new and existing international markets and by growing our non-box revenues. We will deploy sales and service personnel closer to our customers, introduce a robust portfolio of localized content and leverage our world-class product portfolio in an effort to increase our international shipments and revenues. We anticipate further improving our operating margin by growing our gaming operations installed base globally, increasing the profit per unit within that installed base, and expanding our global process efficiencies. Given our return-oriented discipline, we expect our research and development investment to remain constant at about $200 million in 2012. Our strong cash flow serve as an unmatched competitive advantage, one that we will continue to leverage by investing in future growth opportunities, judiciously returning capital to shareholders, and preparing for future debt maturities. We plan to strengthen our interactive business by enhancing our poker platform's capabilities, sustaining our poker liquidity, and augmenting our product verticals with global partnerships in both sports betting and bingo. 
We remain committed to building out a full suite of casino products as we extend the thrill of gaming in all legalized jurisdictions across the online and mobile world. I will now turn the call over to our President, Eric Berg."

I'm now in my fourth month and I couldn't be happier of being part of the IGT team. Our employees are embracing the notion of ongoing change, making IGT stronger everyday.
Externally, I spent a great deal of time with our global customers. They're recognizing our commitment and this partnership is showing up in improved operating performance. For example, our manufacturing operations team has changed their measurement system to track performance against customer requested delivery date, has improved to significantly exceed 90% every month. Additionally, we recently announced a partnership with Holland Casinos, involving the modernization of their systems with IGT's casino management tools across all of their Netherlands properties. This partnership is truly a win for both organizations. And the response we received to G2E exceeded our expectations. We received initial orders for over 2,000 G23 machines from customers located all over the globe during our 3 days at the show. We demonstrated in every product line from gaming operations, to for-sale games, to systems that we can provide a premier world-class full floor solution. Over the past 4 months, I've been learning our business from the front line to back, spending time with customers and with our frontline employees, learning the core value delivery processes within IGT, understanding what needs to be preserved as well as what needs to be improved.
To achieve the 2012 goals that Patti articulated, I wanted to highlight a few of our focus areas. We will be driving a tightly integrated operating model. This includes identifying our winning strategy in each area of the business, clarifying operational ownership, documenting key performance indicators, setting targets, and driving an execution plan to improve performance and achieve results. We will be accelerating our path to operating as a truly global organization and this agenda will enable us to capitalize on IGT scale advantages. This agenda encompasses sales, service delivery, procurement, manufacturing, marketing, IT, product management, and every other aspect of our business. We are benchmarking against the best in the world. We will stay focused on delivering region-specific, localized product into every corner of the globe, as efficiently as possible and provide our sales and service leaders the tools they need to grow our business. At IGT, we will always continue to put our customers first. Our growth opportunities will be designed to move our customers and our industry forward. For example, we recently entered into a multiyear, first look agreement with Sony, where we will have unique access to Sony's iconic film and television library as part of our predictable, efficient framework for providing innovative media [ph] content and experiences to every player around the world.
I'm tremendously enthused to be part of the winning team at IGT, and I look forward to speaking with all of you more over the coming weeks and months. 
With that, I'll turn it back to you, Patti, for your closing remarks."

In summary for 2012, we expect to increase the pace of our revenue growth, further improve our operating margins, leverage our strong cash flows and energize the interactive business. 
Given that there is a lot of volatility in the capital markets, we are assuming a benign macroeconomic environment for the next 12 months. In some areas of the industry, we see expansion, and in others, we see uncertainty. Our differentiated business model and diverse global footprint should continue to help mitigate the impact of any large unforeseen events around the world. Our customers are responding positively to our high-performing products and we believe we are well positioned to sustain and enhance our financial returns. For fiscal year 2012, we would like to offer adjusted earnings guidance from continuing operations of $0.93 to $1.03 per share. This guidance assumes a 37% tax rate and a share repurchase program consistent with the last 2 quarters. 
With that, we thank you for your time and we'd like to take your questions please."

When you think about the low end, Felicia, of the guidance, it really thinks about fiscal '12 looking similar to fiscal '11 from a replacements perspective, a bit of an uptick in the installed base for gaming operations and a bit of an uptick in yield on that base but nothing for Canada, Illinois or Ohio VLT, the VLT portion of Ohio. So we're not counting on any of that coming in, in the year. We think that's upside to the plan but it's not in the low end. The high end assumes that the replacements uptick a bit and installed base in yield, but still no Canada, Illinois or Ohio. So as the year goes on and we see more certainty around those markets opening, we'll adjust as necessary but given the current uncertainty, we haven't included any of that in the guidance."

Reinvestment in the poker product which is good, and systems, and some new features.

Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as indicative of future performance.

All information discussed on this call is as of today, November 8, 2011, and IGT does not intend, and undertakes no obligation to update this information to reflect future events or circumstances.
In addition, on today's call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the GAAP measures we consider most comparable can be found in today's earnings release, which is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.igt.com and included as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form 8-K we furnished today with the SEC.

The fiscal year 2011, we set out, at IGT, to drive higher revenue, grow our gaming operations, improve profitability, leverage our strong cash flows, and increase our interactive presence. We delivered results in line with the commitments we made to our stakeholders by driving improvement across every aspect of our business. 
Our products are better than ever and our revenues are growing. Total fourth quarter revenues increased 14% year-over-year to $540 million. This represents our highest revenue quarter since the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We launched several of the most successful participation for sale and interactive games in the company's history. Nearly 50% of our newly introduced core games are performing at least 1.5x the floor average, that's up from 33% just 3 years ago. 
Gaming operations continue to expand. We grew our average yield by 9% over the prior year quarter, and our domestic installed base was up for the year, for the first time since 2007.Our profitability is improving. Full year consolidated gross profit margin increased 100 basis points to 58%, with strength in both product sales and gaming operation's gross margins. Our cash flows are unrivaled. We returned over $120 million in capital to our shareholders, decreased our borrowing cost and grew our cash position to over $500 million. 
Our interactive business is advancing, with the addition of Entraction, we have added poker, bingo, and sports betting to our industry-leading online and mobile portfolio. Over the past 2 years, we have nearly doubled the earnings performance of the company. In 2009, with $2 billion in revenues, our GAAP EPS from continuing operations was just $0.50. This year, with similar revenues, our GAAP EPS from continuing operations is $0.97. We have added considerable earnings leverage to our business and we expect this momentum to accelerate in 2012.
I'd like to take a minute to express my gratitude to those who have made these results possible, our employees. 2011 is a testament to the collective effort of our global workforce, and I want to thank our employees for delivering financial results that remind us of the power of IGT.

The growth in adjusted earnings was driv",690,"Thank you, Patti. And good afternoon, everyone. Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings from continuing operations grew 44% to $73 million or $0.24 per share versus $51 million and $0.17 in last year's fourth quarter. The growth in adjusted earnings was driven by higher product sales revenue coupled with strong margin performance. Both periods presented in this release have been adjusted to classify the Barcrest Group and discontinued operations. 
For the fiscal year, adjusted earnings from continuing operations grew 13% to $280 million or $0.93 per share versus $248 million and $0.84 in the prior year. Our total revenues for the fourth quarter increased 14% to $540 million year-over-year, a result of stronger product sales in North America and higher International Gaming operations. For fiscal 2011, total revenues grew 2% to $1.96 billion. Gaming operations revenues were $283 million in the fourth quarter, up 8% versus last year on higher MegaJackpots performance and increases in our international installed base. 
For the quarter, we generated an average of $58.08 in revenue per unit per day, which is up 9% compared to last year's fourth quarter. The strong performance of our domestic wide area progressive games positively contributed to this increase in yield. IGT's consolidated installed base ended the fourth quarter at 53,900 units, up 1,000 units from a year ago, and 600 units sequentially. Reported gaming operations gross margin was 57% in the fourth quarter, down from 58% to the same quarter last year. And intellectual property settlement and changes in interest rates reduced our gaming ops' gross margins by 240 basis points and 80 basis points, respectively. 
Consolidated product sales revenue increased 20% to $257 million for the quarter, compared to $213 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Globally, we recognized 11,300 units in the quarter, up 38% from last year's fourth quarter, primarily driven by higher domestic replacement. In the quarter, we recognized 5,000 North American replacement units, the highest quarterly level in 4 years. We estimate our North American replacement share grew again and was 40% to 45% this quarter when including the 5 largest suppliers. North America's machine sales revenues were up 115% over the prior year quarter to $101 million or an increase of 3,800 units. 
North America's average selling price in the quarter was flat compared to last year. North America's product sales gross margins were up 500 basis points to 56% due to lower nonstandard costs, lower discounts, and increased intellectual property fees. International product sales revenue decreased to $96 million on volume of 4,200 units recognized to the current quarter, compared to $101 million on 4,900 units respectively in the prior quarter due to new opening. International average selling price was up 4% year-over-year, primarily due to favorable foreign exchange rates.  
Worldwide, non-machine revenues, mainly from the sale of the systems, conversions, and intellectual property fees declined 2% to $85 million for the quarter with 32% of product sales compared to $87 million or 41% of product sales in the prior year quarter. The decrease in domestic diversion kit sales was partially offset by a significant increase in domestic intellectual property revenues. 
Fourth quarter operating expenses were $182 million or 34% of revenues compared to $169 million and 36% of revenues in last year's fourth quarter. This year's fourth quarter operating expenses included $16 million related to various asset impairments. SG&A excluding bad debt was $99 million, down slightly as a percentage of revenues. Cash equivalents, short-term investments inclusive of restricted amounts, totaled $552 million at September 30, 2011, compared to $249 million at September 30 of the year ago. Contractual debt obligations totaled $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter. For fiscal year 2011, we generated $612 million in operating cash flow, up 4% compared to last year. Also in the quarter, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of common stock at an average price of $15.30 per share.
In summary, 2011 was a good year for us in nearly all financial metrics. We are generating sustainable efficiencies throughout the company and improving our profitability. 
Thank you for your time and attention. And with that, I'll turn it back to Patti."

Varied improvements we've driven over the past several years, globalizing the business, instilling a customer first approach from top to bottom, and deploying our research and development dollars in an efficient yet dynamic manner, have uniquely positioned IGT for a very bright future.
For 2012, our core objectives will remain consistent as we look to grow revenues, build on the momentum of our internal improvement, leverage our income statement and energize our interactive business. We plan to enhance the velocity of our top line growth by driving increased penetration in new and existing international markets and by growing our non-box revenues. We will deploy sales and service personnel closer to our customers, introduce a robust portfolio of localized content and leverage our world-class product portfolio in an effort to increase our international shipments and revenues. 
We anticipate further improving our operating margin by growing our gaming operations installed base globally, increasing the profit per unit within that installed base, and expanding our global process efficiencies. Given our return-oriented discipline, we expect our research and development investment to remain constant at about $200 million in 2012. 
Our strong cash flow serve as an unmatched competitive advantage, one that we will continue to leverage by investing in future growth opportunities, judiciously returning capital to shareholders, and preparing for future debt maturities. We plan to strengthen our interactive business by enhancing our poker platform's capabilities, sustaining our poker liquidity, and augmenting our product verticals with global partnerships in both sports betting and bingo. 
We remain committed to building out a full suite of casino products as we extend the thrill of gaming in all legalized jurisdictions across the online and mobile world.

For example, our manufacturing operations team has changed their measurement system to track performance against customer requested delivery date, has improved to significantly exceed 90% every month. Additionally, we recently announced a partnership with Holland Casinos, involving the modernization of their systems with IGT's casino management tools across all of their Netherlands properties. This partnership is truly a win for both organizations. And the response we received to G2E exceeded our expectations. We received initial orders for over 2,000 G23 machines from customers located all over the globe during our 3 days at the show. We demonstrated in every product line from gaming operations, to for-sale games, to systems that we can provide a premier world-class full floor solution. 
Over the past 4 months, I've been learning our business from the front line to back, spending time with customers and with our frontline employees, learning the core value delivery processes within IGT, understanding what needs to be preserved as well as what needs to be improved. To achieve the 2012 goals that Patti articulated, I wanted to highlight a few of our focus areas. 
We will be driving a tightly integrated operating model. This includes identifying our winning strategy in each area of the business, clarifying operational ownership, documenting key performance indicators, setting targets and driving an execution plan to improve performance and achieve results. We will be accelerating our path to operating as a truly global organization as this agenda will enable us to capitalize on IGT scale advantages. This agenda encompasses sales, service delivery, procurement, manufacturing, marketing, IT, product management, and every other aspect of our business. 
We are benchmarking against the best in the world. We will stay focused on delivering region-specific, localized product into every corner of the globe as efficiently as possible, and provide our sales and service leaders the tools they need to grow our business. At IGT, we will always continue to put our customers first. Our growth opportunities will be designed to move our customers and our industry forward. For example, we recently entered into a multiyear, first look agreement with Sony, where we will have unique access to Sony's iconic film and television library as part of our predictable, efficient framework for providing innovative leading-edge content and experiences to every player around the world.
I'm tremendously enthused to be part of the winning team at IGT, and I look forward to speaking with all of you more over the coming weeks and months. 
With that, I'll turn it back to you, Patti, for your closing remarks."

In summary for 2012, we expect to increase the pace of our revenue growth, further improve our operating margins, leverage our strong cash flows and energize the interactive business. 
Given that there is a lot of volatility in the capital markets, we are assuming a benign macroeconomic environment for the next 12 months. In some areas of the industry, we see expansion, and in others, we see uncertainty. Our differentiated business model and diverse global footprint should continue to help mitigate the impact of any large unforeseen events around the world. Our customers are responding positively to our high-performing products and we believe we are well positioned to sustain and enhance our financial returns. For fiscal year 2012, we would like to offer adjusted earnings guidance from continuing operations of $0.93 to $1.03 per share. This guidance assumes a 37% tax rate and a share repurchase program consistent with the last 2 quarters. 
With that, we thank you for your time and we'd like to take your questions, please."

When you think about the low end, Felicia, of the guidance, it really thinks about fiscal '12 looking similar to fiscal '11 from a replacements perspective, a bit of an uptick in the installed base for gaming operations and a bit of an uptick in yield on that base but nothing for Canada, Illinois or Ohio VLT, the VLT portion of Ohio. So we're not counting on any of that coming in, in the year. We think that's upside to the plan but it's not in the low end. The high end assumes that the replacements uptick a bit and installed base in yield, but still no Canada, Illinois or Ohio. So as the year goes on and we see more certainty around those markets opening, we'll adjust as necessary but given the current uncertainty, we haven't included any of that in the guidance."

Secondly, we would look at any kind of access to resources, access to technology, access to markets that we're not serving through investments, acquisitions, strategic partnerships. And then, short those 2 things, any kind of significant R&D effort that we might have, we'd only really think about it to the extent we thought the existing R&D was being used sufficiently, and we're not using the most efficient destination yet on our R&D spending.

So sequentially, slight adjustments in gross margins in both places, we've talked about the gross margins and the game ops side of the business. The gross margins in product sales, most of the time, are a result of mix in the quarter.
