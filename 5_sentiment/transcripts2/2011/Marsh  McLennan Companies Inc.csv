I'm Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me in presenting on the call today's Vanessa Wittman,",857,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results as reported earlier today. I'm Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me in presenting on the call today's Vanessa Wittman, our CFO. I'd also like to welcome our operating companies CEOs to today's call, Dan Glaser of Marsh; Peter Zaffino of Guy Carpenter; Michelle Burns of Mercer; and John Drzik of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Mike Bischoff, our Head of Investor Relations.
So let's get right to it. I'm very pleased with our performance, not only in the fourth quarter, but for the full year as well. When we reported our results a year ago, we indicated that our primary goal for the year ahead was to drive top and bottom line growth across the enterprise. Our plan was to grow revenue organically and through strategic acquisitions. A year later, I'm delighted to be able to say we've met both our objectives. Let's start with the fourth quarter. We produced very strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter with reported growth of 9%. On an underlying basis, the overall increase for the company was 6%, including 6% growth at Marsh, 3% at Guy Carpenter, 5% at Mercer and 8% at Oliver Wyman. We're also very pleased with our level of revenue growth for the full year, which was 7% as reported and 3% on an underlying basis. Additionally, we encourage that revenue performance got stronger as the year progressed. In both the third and fourth quarters, all our operating companies produced revenue growth on both a reported and an underlying basis. And importantly, we achieved this solid revenue growth while effectively managing expenses. Overall, adjusted underlying expenses grew only 2% last year despite having to absorb a significant increase in pension costs. While we continue to manage our business efficiently, we have also been actively reinvesting in our future. Major investments, not only in 2010, but over the last three years, include key strategic hires, value-added technology for clients, product development and expanded analytical capabilities within each of our operating companies. By combining revenue growth with expense management, we produced excellent earnings growth in 2010. For example, adjusted operating income increased from $1.3 billion in 2009 to $1.5 billion in 2010, an increase of 14%. As you are aware, we decided, after a thorough, strategic review, to divest Kroll, a transaction we completed last August at a very satisfactory price. Aggregate cash proceeds, including the prior divestment of selected Kroll business units and related tax benefits, will be $1.6 billion. So overall, Marsh & McLennan Companies delivered a very impressive performance last year both from a financial and a strategic perspective.
Now let's turn to our operating segments. Both Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting produced good underlying revenue growth in 2010. Adjusted operating income increased 10% in Risk and Insurance Services and 16% at Consulting. Both segments also increased adjusted operating margins for the year. We were pleased with Marsh's underlying revenue growth rate increased each quarter during the year. This growth was fueled by new business development. Guy Carpenter also had an excellent year with good underlying revenue growth, continued focus on expense control and strong growth in adjusted operating income. We are especially pleased with the expansion of its international operations, reflecting one of Guy Carpenter's strategic initiatives. Our Consulting operations also performed well in 2010. Mercer reported underlying revenue growth of mid single-digits in both the third and fourth quarters, and Oliver Wyman's underlying revenue growth of 8% in the fourth quarter capped a very good year. Importantly, both companies grew adjusted operating income in 2010, and the segment margin rose 110 basis points.
Prudent and effective capital management, including disciplined redeployment of excess cash into accretive acquisitions and share repurchase, will also contribute to long-term earnings growth and increasing shareholder value. On the acquisition front, we continued the development of the Marsh & McLennan Agency with nine acquisitions over the past 15 months. These acquisitions are expected to add annualized revenue approaching $300 million. Additionally, in 2010, Mercer completed several acquisitions to broaden its client capabilities. The most recent acquisition of Hammon Associates, which established Mercer as the leader in investment consulting for balance and foundations. It's also worth noting that we initiated our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter.
As we indicated at Investor Day, our goal is to reestablish Marsh & McLennan Companies as an elite, global growth company, not just in relation to our direct competitors, but with respect to other leading global companies. Our strategy focuses on the characteristics that create exceptional value and superior return for investors, long-term growth, low capital requirements, high cash generation with disciplined capital management and a low risk profile. Emphasizing these four pillars should produce 10% organic growth in operating income over the long term. We view 2010 as a very successful year for the company, and we are confident about our prospects for the coming year. Now let me turn it over to Vanessa to review our fourth quarter and full year results in more detail."

I'll close with some observations regarding our financial position including pensions.
On a GAAP basis, earnings per share in the fourth quarter was $0.37, which included $0.34 from continuing operations. The $0.03 from discontinued operations was primarily insurance recoveries related to Putnam. On an adjusted basis, EPS in the fourth quarter of 2010 increased 8% to $0.41 from $0.38 in the fourth quarter of 2009. In September, we funded a $550 million debt maturity. This reduced our interest expense in the fourth quarter to $53 million from the prior run rate of $60 million per quarter. We have no debt maturing in 2011. Investment income was $19 million in the fourth quarter, largely due to gains in our private equity portfolio, which are recorded on a one quarter lag. In the fourth quarter of 2009, investment income was $23 million. Looking ahead to this year's first quarter, we anticipate investment income of approximately $50 million.
Let's turn to the results of our operations. Unless specifically indicated, my references will be to underlying revenue, underlying expenses and adjusted operating income. As Brian discussed, the financial performance of Marsh & McLennan was impressive in 2010. We achieved growth in both revenue and operating income in every one of our operating companies, not only in the quarter, but for the full year. On a consolidated basis, operating income in the fourth quarter rose 22% to $379 million compared with the prior year. For the full year, operating income increased 14% from $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion.
In Risk and Insurance Services, revenue in the fourth quarter rose 5% to $1.5 billion. Operating income increased 22% to $259 million from $213 million in the prior year, reflecting higher margins at both Marsh and Guy Carpenter. For the year, Risk and Insurance Services' growth in operating income was 10%, increasing from $985 million to $1.1 billion. Despite continuing soft market conditions, Marsh had another great quarter. Reflecting sequential improvement throughout the year, revenue rose a strong 6% in the fourth quarter to $1.3 billion. All geographic operations experienced revenue growth in the quarter with particularly strong growth in EMEA, Asia-Pacific and Latin America. The positive momentum in Marsh's new business generation through the first nine months continued in the fourth quarter. This resulted in global new business growth of 8% for the year.
Despite a significant increase in pension expense, Marsh increased its profitability as well as its margins in the fourth quarter.
Turning to reinsurance broking, Guy Carpenter continued its excellent performance, led by its international operations. Revenue was $184 million, growing 3% over last year's fourth quarter. This is especially notable considering current market conditions. In fact, this quarter marks Carpenter's eighth consecutive quarter of revenue growth, reflecting continuing strong new business and high client retention over the past two years. Ongoing expense discipline produced improved operating income for both the fourth quarter and the year.
In our Consulting segment, revenue in the fourth quarter rose 6% to $1.3 billion. Growth in operating expenses, including higher pension expense, was held to 4% in the quarter and was only 2% for the entire year. In the fourth quarter, operating income rose 17% from $142 million to $166 million. For the year, operating income increased 16% from $477 million to $553 million with margin improvement of 110 basis points.
Mercer's revenue increased 5% in the fourth quarter to $910 million, similar to the growth in the third quarter, highlighting the balanced portfolio Mercer has built over the past several years. Within Retirement Consulting, revenue growth in Canada and Latin America was more than offset by declines in the U.S. and EMEA. Health and Benefits Consulting continued its strong performance, matching its 8% growth in the third quarter.
All regions around the world showed strength, with the U.S. and Europe's growth improving an impressive growth in Canada, Latin America and Asia-Pacific. This performance reflects the recent investments made by Mercer, as well as a stabilizing global economy and employment market. Rewards talent and communications produced double-digit revenue growth for the second consecutive quarter, partly due to a resurgence in demand from Mercer's compensation surveys across all major geographic regions. Outsourcing revenues was up 5% in the quarter. Investment Consulting and Management increased 14%, affirming Mercer's strategy to provide enhanced investment solutions for their clients' retirement plans.
Even with higher pension expense, Mercer's operating income increased in both the fourth quarter and for the year. Oliver Wyman also generated strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter, which continues the positive performance that we saw throughout the year. Revenue increased 8% to $399 million, reflecting a broad-based growth in the business. Oliver Wyman's practices in the healthcare, transportation, consumer and communication sectors all generated double-digit increases. For the year, revenue increased 7%, including double-digit growth in the financing services, Oliver Wyman's largest industry specialty. Oliver Wyman also produced excellent growth in operating income for the fourth quarter and full year.
Turning to the cost of our defined benefit plan. As you know, higher pension expense impacted earnings per share in 2010 by slightly more than $0.10. We are projecting that pension expense will increase modestly in 2011, impacting earnings per share by $0.05. This increase reflects lower discount rates at December 31, 2010, compared with the end of 2009. Despite this increase, we expect to generate double-digit growth in earnings. From a funding perspective, we made a tax efficient $200 million discretionary contribution to our USA retirement plan last September. Combined with ongoing contributions to our worldwide plans, total cash contributions to our pension plans in 2010 was approximately $450 million. For 2011, we expect contributions to our global pension plans to be approximately $300 million.
And looking at our balance sheet. cash at the end of the year was $1.9 billion compared with $1.7 billion at the end of the third quarter. The major uses of our cash in the fourth quarter included approximately $245 million for acquisitions, $119 million for our fourth quarter dividend payment to shareholders, which reflects a 5% increase on a per share basis, and $86 million for the start of our $500 million share repurchase program. By year end, we purchased 3.4 million shares. In addition to our year-end's cash position of $1.9 billion, we expect to $230 million in the first half of this year from tax credits related to the Kroll disposition. For modeling purposes, you should continue to use a 31% adjusted tax rate for the year. With that, let me turn it back to Brian."

One, our overall business, as you know, is now the majority outside of the United States. And so when I look at my global business, I'm about 50-50 between fee and commission, and it's more like 60-40 in the U.S. and 40",319,"So let me take your first question. One, our overall business, as you know, is now the majority outside of the United States. And so when I look at my global business, I'm about 50-50 between fee and commission, and it's more like 60-40 in the U.S. and 40-60 in the rest of the world. And so I feel very well-balanced. In terms of your question on leverage, I think that the commission business is slightly more leverage to a hard market than the fee business. But having said that, fees are based upon value. And I think we demonstrate increased in a hard market and I feel that they would be upward momentum on the fee side as well as the market tightens and as our jobs serving clients become more complicated. You saw the reverse of that in the soft market. There was some downward pressure on fees through the soft market. And so it gives you some insulation, but I really like the way that we're positioned 50-50, and I feel levered enough to the market. 
In terms of expansion possibilities and leverage as we grow, we manage our expenses very carefully. I think some of our expansion is being masked right now. If I just look at the fourth quarter, our expense base, half of our expense growth in the fourth quarter was in Marsh was based on pension increase and some severance expenses that did not run through the restructuring line that ran through our operating line. So the other thing I would say is all throughout the downturn and over the last couple of years, we've continued to invest in the business. So I don't feel any pent-up requirement to have some sort of rebound and expense to get us back to some sort of a trajectory in investing in the business. We've been steady throughout, so I feel quite good about that."

What pension does for us is add a bit of volatility to our income, bottom line. The expense movements positive and negative, there's a bit of volatility to it. Overall, so far from what I can see, it is a reasonable approach for our employees and for our shareholders, but it does have this volatility to it. And what we did in the last year, and it was considerably volatile last year, the swing was considerable, was that we were able to manage that and still produce excellent growth and control of our expenses. And as we pointed out, it's going to be a bit of a drag this year coming. We gave you the number. But I think still, long term, it is reasonable for us to maintain. Now we'll constantly look at that, we'll never say never, but I think the volatility question is something we have been able to address and I expect that we will continue to address it.

In 2009, we were minus one, so our real focus in 2010 was to get growth going again. And for the year, we were at plus two on an underlying basis. What I'm looking forward, I would think we will do better than that, but I wouldn't necessarily extrapolate the fourth quarter and say that, that would be continuing.

But in addition, we made a decision to expand in our next-generation businesses, and those businesses are outsourcing, the outsourcing seller and the investment seller, and we've consistently done that. This quarter and last quarter, as matter-of-fact, as Dan would say, the full year reflects that strategy. You see growth in Consulting fares which are hardest hit by the recessionary period, but with good growth in outsourcing, outstanding growth in investments. And the blend is really giving her clients two things. Giving our clients a lot of stability with regards to how we service them, new product offerings that they're finding to be innovative, especially in the meeting space, as well as, and then for the investor, you get that same sense of stability to perform in different areas at different times and bundled products to produce this kind of revenue growth.

There is not any kind of for structural change among risk managers for multiyear deals. The reality is most multiyear deals have cancellation provisions.

And so, and we help them with those choices. So I wouldn't, in the tail-end of every soft market, you can to give some additional multiyear deals, and then there is a little bit of that up there, but I wouldn't say it's a rush to that level.

I think you could, certainly, as things improve economically, value start to change. So one would expect valuations would be slightly higher going forward than they have been certainly on the Consulting side. I think, to me, it's more important what we're buying and does it fit in our strategic positioning. And in that regard, I think we've done quite well so far and certainly a Consulting some very interesting acquisitions. I think the company is recognized as one to join again. And so we have that extra added benefit of being a place that would be a good home for a company that has limitations as to where they go but they're great people and they've got a great capability and they look around for what's the next step in their evolution, we're a good home for it. So I think our prospects actually are improving that not going the other way even if, say, with the economy changing. In insurance, we've committed to be agency development as our primary place for acquisitions. It's not exclusive. We're certainly looking internationally all the time as well, the HSBC is a good example of that. In that regard, I think, again, it's kind of an interesting issue. Do people expect this is sell it? Do they expect the economy is going to approve and the economy is going to approve? But again, what I said about Consulting is probably true in space with respect to the agency because we have now, I think, established the structure, a position in the marketplace that is attractive to those independent agency companies who were again looking for some next move, a way to grow. And what they're seeing is an organization that has the kind of qualities they're looking for. And so that's why Dan pointed out the pipeline is very good. And that's a long way of saying I feel, I certainly feel better this year than I did last year with all our prospects, and I think we're going to continue to find good acquisitions, organic growth acquisitions internally, they're always a little bit more difficult. We can do with routines and we can do it through products and everything. And so it doesn't get the same kind of Big Bang press that another acquisition does. But we try to point that out in the earlier remarks that when we look at where it is for the long haul and expense reduction alone doesn't get you anywhere. And so you've got to invest, and we've been investing. Investing in technology and investing in product, investing in people. So that's going to continue. And then my conversion to share buyback will also play a role."

And so I don't expect that you will see the raw demand change dramatically in the retirement business per se, in other words, the traditional business. But the segments that we are pursuing dropped quite heavily and the changes that we're making in our retirement business allow us to capture business across the demands that the clients have currently in the same space, but for different kind of service."

I'm Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me in presenting on the call today is Vanessa Wittman",858,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results as reported earlier today. I'm Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me in presenting on the call today is Vanessa Wittman, our CFO. I'd also like to welcome our operating companies' CEOs to today's call, Dan Glaser of Marsh, Peter Zaffino of Guy Carpenter, Michelle Burns of Mercer and John Drzik of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Mike Bischoff, our Head of Investor Relations.
So let's get right to it. I'm very pleased with our performance, not only in the fourth quarter, but for the full year as well. When we reported our results a year ago, we indicated that our primary goal for the year ahead was to drive top and bottom line growth across the enterprise. Our plan was to grow revenue organically and through strategic acquisitions. A year later, I'm delighted to be able to say we've met both our objectives. 
Let's start with the fourth quarter. We produced very strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter with reported growth of 9%. On an underlying basis, the overall increase for the company was 6%, including 6% growth at Marsh, 3% at Guy Carpenter, 5% at Mercer and 8% at Oliver Wyman. We're also very pleased with our level of revenue growth for the full year, which was 7% as reported and 3% on an underlying basis. Additionally, we're encouraged  that revenue performance got stronger as the year progressed. In both the third and fourth quarters, all our operating companies produced revenue growth on both a reported and an underlying basis. And importantly, we achieved this solid revenue growth while effectively managing expenses. Overall, adjusted underlying expenses grew only 2% last year despite having to absorb a significant increase in pension costs. While we continue to manage our business efficiently, we have also been actively reinvesting in our future. Major investments, not only in 2010, but over the last three years, include key strategic hires, value-added technology for clients, product development and expanded analytical capabilities within each of our operating companies. By combining revenue growth with expense management, we produced excellent earnings growth in 2010. For example, adjusted operating income increased from $1.3 billion in 2009 to $1.5 billion in 2010, an increase of 14%. As you are aware, we decided, after a thorough, strategic review, to divest Kroll, a transaction we completed last August at a very satisfactory price. Aggregate cash proceeds, including the prior divestment of selected Kroll business units and related tax benefits, will be $1.6 billion. So overall, Marsh & McLennan Companies delivered a very impressive performance last year both from a financial and a strategic perspective.
Now let's turn to our operating segments. Both Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting produced good underlying revenue growth in 2010. Adjusted operating income increased 10% at Risk and Insurance Services and 16% at Consulting. Both segments also increased adjusted operating margins for the year. We were pleased that Marsh's underlying revenue growth rate increased each quarter during the year. This growth was fueled by new business development. Guy Carpenter also had an excellent year with good underlying revenue growth, continued focus on expense control and strong growth in adjusted operating income. We are especially pleased with the expansion of its international operations, reflecting one of Guy Carpenter's strategic initiatives. Our Consulting operations also performed well in 2010. Mercer reported underlying revenue growth of mid-single digits in both the third and fourth quarters, and Oliver Wyman's underlying revenue growth of 8% in the fourth quarter capped a very good year. Importantly, both companies grew adjusted operating income in 2010, and the segment margin rose 110 basis points.
Prudent and effective capital management, including disciplined redeployment of excess cash into accretive acquisitions and share repurchase, will also contribute to long-term earnings growth and increasing shareholder value. On the acquisition front, we continued the development of the Marsh & McLennan Agency with nine acquisitions over the past 15 months. These acquisitions are expected to add annualized revenue approaching $300 million. Additionally, in 2010, Mercer completed several acquisitions to broaden its client capabilities. The most recent acquisition of Hammond Associates, which established Mercer as a leader in investment consulting for endowments and foundations. It's also worth noting that we initiated our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter.
As we indicated at Investor Day, our goal is to re-establish Marsh & McLennan Companies as an elite, global growth company, not just in relation to our direct competitors, but with respect to other leading global companies. Our strategy focuses on the characteristics that create exceptional value and superior return for investors, long-term growth, low capital requirements, high cash generation with disciplined capital management and a low risk profile. Emphasizing these four pillars should produce 10% organic growth in operating income over the long term. We view 2010 as a very successful year for the company, and we are confident about our prospects for the coming year. Now let me turn it over to Vanessa to review our fourth quarter and full year results in more detail."

I'll begin with an overview of Marsh & McLennan's results for the quarter, then I'll discuss the results of each operating company. I'll close with some observations regarding our financial position, including pensions.
On a GAAP basis, earnings per share in the fourth quarter was $0.37, which included $0.34 from continuing operations. The $0.03 from discontinued operations was primarily insurance recoveries related to Putnam. On an adjusted basis, EPS in the fourth quarter of 2010 increased 8% to $0.41 from $0.38 in the fourth quarter of 2009. In September, we funded a $550 million debt maturity. This reduced our interest expense in the fourth quarter to $53 million from the prior run rate of $60 million per quarter. We have no debt maturing in 2011. Investment income was $19 million in the fourth quarter, largely due to gains in our private equity portfolio, which are recorded on a one quarter lag. In the fourth quarter of 2009, investment income was $23 million. Looking ahead to this year's first quarter, we anticipate investment income of approximately $15 million.
Let's turn to the results of our operations. Unless specifically indicated, my references will be to underlying revenue, underlying expenses and adjusted operating income. As Brian discussed, the financial performance of Marsh & McLennan was impressive in 2010. We achieved growth in both revenue and operating income in every one of our operating companies, not only in the quarter, but for the full year. On a consolidated basis, operating income in the fourth quarter rose 22% to $379 million compared with the prior year. For the full year, operating income increased 14% from $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion.
In Risk and Insurance Services, revenue in the fourth quarter rose 5% to $1.5 billion. Operating income increased 22% to $259 million from $213 million in the prior year, reflecting higher margins at both Marsh and Guy Carpenter. For the year, Risk and Insurance Services' growth in operating income was 10%, increasing from $985 million to $1.1 billion. Despite continuing soft market conditions, Marsh had another great quarter. Reflecting sequential improvement throughout the year, revenue rose a strong 6% in the fourth quarter to $1.3 billion. All geographic operations experienced revenue growth in the quarter, with particularly strong growth in EMEA, Asia-Pacific and Latin America. The positive momentum in Marsh's new business generation through the first nine months continued in the fourth quarter. This resulted in global new business growth of 8% for the year. Despite a significant increase in pension expense, Marsh increased its profitability as well as its margins in the fourth quarter.
Turning to reinsurance broking, Guy Carpenter continued its excellent performance, led by its international operations. Revenue was $184 million, growing 3% over last year's fourth quarter. This is especially notable considering current market conditions. In fact, this quarter marks Carpenter's eighth consecutive quarter of revenue growth, reflecting continuing strong new business and high client retention over the past two years. Ongoing expense discipline produced improved operating income for both the fourth quarter and the year.
In our Consulting segment, revenue in the fourth quarter rose 6% to $1.3 billion. Growth in operating expenses, including higher pension expense, was held to 4% for the quarter and was only 2% for the entire year. In the fourth quarter, operating income rose 17% from $142 million to $166 million. For the year, operating income increased 16% from $477 million to $553 million, with margin improvement of 110 basis points.
Mercer's revenue increased 5% in the fourth quarter to $910 million, similar to the growth in the third quarter, highlighting the balanced portfolio Mercer has built over the past several years. Within Retirement Consulting, revenue growth in Canada and Latin America was more than offset by declines in the U.S. and EMEA. Health and Benefits Consulting continued its strong performance, matching its 8% growth in the third quarter.
All regions around the world showed strength, with the U.S. and Europe's growth improving and impressive growth in Canada, Latin America and Asia-Pacific. This performance reflects the recent investments made by Mercer, as well as a stabilizing global economy and employment market. Rewards, Talent and Communications produced double-digit revenue growth for the second consecutive quarter, partly due to a resurgence in demand from Mercer's compensation surveys across all major geographic regions. Outsourcing revenue was up 5% in the quarter. Investment Consulting and Management increased 14%, affirming Mercer's strategy to provide enhanced investment solutions for their clients' retirement plans.
Even with higher pension expense, Mercer's operating income increased in both the fourth quarter and for the year. Oliver Wyman also generated strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter, which continues the positive performance that we saw throughout the year. Revenue increased 8% to $399 million, reflecting a broad-based growth in the business. Oliver Wyman's practices in the healthcare, transportation, consumer and communication sectors all generated double-digit increases. For the year, revenue increased 7%, including double-digit growth in the financial services sector, Oliver Wyman's largest industry specialty. Oliver Wyman also produced excellent growth in operating income for the fourth quarter and full year.
Turning to the cost of our defined benefit plans. As you know, higher pension expense impacted earnings per share in 2010 by slightly more than $0.10. We are projecting that pension expense will increase modestly in 2011, impacting earnings per share by $0.05. This increase reflects lower discount rates at December 31, 2010, compared with the end of 2009. Despite this increase, we expect to generate double-digit growth in earnings. From a funding perspective, we made a tax-efficient $200 million discretionary contribution to our U.S. retirement plan last September. Combined with ongoing contributions to our worldwide plans, total cash contributions to our pension plans in 2010 was approximately $450 million. For 2011, we expect contributions to our global pension plans to be approximately $300 million.
And looking at our balance sheet, cash at the end of the year was $1.9 billion compared with $1.7 billion at the end of the third quarter. The major uses of our cash in the fourth quarter included approximately $245 million for acquisitions; $119 million for our fourth quarter dividend payment to shareholders, which reflects a 5% increase on a per share basis; and $86 million for the start of our $500 million share repurchase program. By year-end, we purchased 3.4 million shares. In addition to our year-end's cash position of $1.9 billion, we expect to receive $230 million in the first half of this year from tax credits related to the Kroll disposition. For modeling purposes, you should continue to use a 31% adjusted tax rate for the year. With that, let me turn it back to Brian."

One, our overall business, as you know, is now majority outside of the United States. And so when I look at my global business, I'm about 50-50 between fee and commission, and it's more like 60-40 in the U.S. and 40-60",316,"So let me take your first question. One, our overall business, as you know, is now majority outside of the United States. And so when I look at my global business, I'm about 50-50 between fee and commission, and it's more like 60-40 in the U.S. and 40-60 in the rest of the world. And so I feel very well-balanced. In terms of your question on leverage, I think that the commission business is slightly more leveraged to a hard market than the fee business. But having said that, fees are based upon value. And I think we demonstrate increased value in a hard market, and I feel that there would be upward momentum on the fee side as the market tightens and as our jobs, serving clients, become more complicated. You saw the reverse of that in the soft market. There was some downward pressure on fees through the soft market, and so it gives you some insulation. But I really like the way that we're positioned 50-50, and I feel levered enough to the market. In terms of expansion possibilities and leverage as we grow, we manage our expenses very carefully. I think some of our expansion is being masked right now. If I just look at the fourth quarter, our expense base, half of our expense growth in the fourth quarter, in Marsh, was based on pension increase and some severance expenses that did not run through the restructuring line that ran through our operating line. So the other thing I would say is all throughout the downturn and over the last couple of years, we've continued to invest in the business. So I don't feel any pent-up requirement to have some sort of rebound in expense to get us back to some sort of a trajectory in investing in the business. We've been steady throughout, so I feel quite good about that."

Overall, so far from what I can see, it is a reasonable approach for our employees and for our shareholders, but it does have this volatility to it. And what we did in the last year, and it was considerably volatile last year, the swing was considerable, was that we were able to manage that and still produce excellent growth and control of our expenses. And as we pointed out, it's going to be a bit of a drag this year coming. We gave you the number. But I think still, long term, it is reasonable for us to maintain. Now we'll constantly look at that.

And certainly, some of the those businesses, and to Keith's question earlier, are more highly levered because they're commission-based businesses and they're in the small commercial and middle market. So when I look at it, I would see there'd be a combination of organic growth, combined with -- in certain Marsh offices, we're handling some small business not as efficiently as the agency is. So over time, we would probably move some of the business around as we build out our platform and acquisitions. But acquisitions would be the principal source."

Well, what I was trying to emphasize is that personal experience here, it's more of the psyche of the market that drives hard and soft markets. And we always keep talking about it, we have this catastrophe, things will change. And I try to point out that in 2001, before 9/11, the rates just started going up. There was no catastrophe, it was just exhaustion. And in 2008, we had a cataclysm, with $100 billion of capital disappeared overnights almost, and the rates didn't change. So there's a couple of cases in point where it wasn't a catastrophe one way or the other. And so what I was trying to emphasize is that one needs to see or understand what the psyche of the market is and how people are feeling and is there exhaustion in the market. And I said, we didn't see that in '09. We didn't see it in '10. We don't see it so far in '11. So I'm not sure that the catastrophe itself would do something.

So no, I think at this point, I haven't seen exhaustion at the market yet. We're supposed to be able to perform in all weathers.

And they recognize that those relationships, contractual or not, will tend to go across many, many years. And we help them with those choices. In the tail-end of every soft market, you tend to get some additional multiyear deals, and then there's a little bit of that out there, but I wouldn't say it's a rush to that level.

Relative to three months ago, probably not much, not a huge difference in that time frame. A year ago or more might be different. I think you could -- certainly, as things improve economically, the value start to change. And so one would expect that the valuations would be slightly higher going forward than they have been certainly on the Consulting side. I think to me, it's more important what we're buying and does it fit in our strategic positioning. And in that regard, I think we've done quite well so far and certainly, in Consulting, some very interesting acquisitions. I think the company is recognized as one to join again. And so we have that extra added benefit of being a place that would be a good home for a company that has limitations as to where they go. But they're great people, and they've got a great capability, and they look around for what's the next step in their evolution, we're a good home for it. So I think our prospects actually are improving, not going the other way even with, say, the economy changing. In Insurance, we've committed to the agency development as a primary place for acquisitions. It's not exclusive. We're certainly looking internationally all the time as well. The HSBC is a good example of that. In that regard, I think, again, it's kind of an interesting issue. Do people expect -- this is the seller. Do they expect that the economy is going to improve and the market's going to improve? And in that case, maybe they'd be less interested. But again, what I said about Consulting is probably true in space with respect to the agency because we have now, I think, established the structure, a position in the marketplace that is attractive to those independent agency companies who were, again, looking for some next move, a way to grow. And what they're seeing is an organization that has the kind of qualities they're looking for. And so that's why Dan pointed out the pipeline is very good. And that's a long-winded way of saying I feel -- I certainly feel better this year than I did last year with all these prospects, and I think we're going to continue to find good acquisitions. Organic growth acquisitions internally, they're always a little bit more difficult. We can do it through teams, and we can do it through products and everything. And so it doesn't get the same kind of Big Bang press than another acquisition does. But we try to point that out in the earlier remarks that when we look at where it is for the long haul, and expense reduction alone doesn't get you anywhere. And so you've got to invest, and we've been investing. Investing in technology and investing in product, investing in people. So that's going to continue. And then my conversion to share buyback will also play a role."

But I think the focal point for Mercer is slightly different, which is we have taken intentionally and with great intention the portfolio of services we have and aligned them to the DB market, this defined-benefit market. So you may see that there are other places where we're seeing significant growth where we bundle these retirement services along with our investment services and our outsourcing services. And so I don't expect that you will see the raw demand change dramatically in the Retirement business per se, in other words, the traditional business. But the segments that we are pursuing dropped quite heavily, and the changes that we're making in our Retirement business allow us to capture business across the demands that the clients have currently in the same space, but for different kinds of services."

I'm Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me in presenting on the call today is Vanessa Wittman",857,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results as reported earlier today. I'm Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me in presenting on the call today is Vanessa Wittman, our CFO. I'd also like to welcome our operating companies' CEOs to today's call, Dan Glaser of Marsh, Peter Zaffino of Guy Carpenter, Michelle Burns of Mercer and John Drzik of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Mike Bischoff, our Head of Investor Relations.
So let's get right to it. I'm very pleased with our performance, not only in the fourth quarter, but for the full year as well. When we reported our results a year ago, we indicated our primary goal for the year ahead was to drive top and bottom line growth across the enterprise. Our plan was to grow revenue organically and through strategic acquisitions. A year later, I'm delighted to be able to say we've met both our objectives. 
Let's start with the fourth quarter. We produced very strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter with reported growth of 9%. On an underlying basis, the overall increase for the company was 6%, including 6% growth at Marsh, 3% at Guy Carpenter, 5% at Mercer and 8% at Oliver Wyman. We're also very pleased with our level of revenue growth for the full year, which was 7% as reported and 3% on an underlying basis. Additionally, we're encouraged that revenue performance got stronger as the year progressed. In both the third and fourth quarters, all our operating companies produced revenue growth on both a reported and an underlying basis. And importantly, we achieved this solid revenue growth while effectively managing expenses. Overall, adjusted underlying expenses grew only 2% last year despite having to absorb a significant increase in pension costs. While we continue to manage our business efficiently, we have also been actively reinvesting in our future. Major investments, not only in 2010, but over the last three years, include key strategic hires, value-added technology for clients, product development and expanded analytical capabilities within each of our operating companies. By combining revenue growth with expense management, we produced excellent earnings growth in 2010. For example, adjusted operating income increased from $1.3 billion in 2009 to $1.5 billion in 2010, an increase of 14%. As you are aware, we decided, after a thorough, strategic review, to divest Kroll, a transaction we completed last August at a very satisfactory price. Aggregate cash proceeds, including the prior divestment of selected Kroll business units and related tax benefits, will be $1.6 billion. So overall, Marsh & McLennan Companies delivered a very impressive performance last year both from a financial and a strategic perspective.
Now let's turn to our operating segments. Both Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting produced good underlying revenue growth in 2010. Adjusted operating income increased 10% at Risk and Insurance Services and 16% at Consulting. Both segments also increased adjusted operating margins for the year. We were pleased that Marsh's underlying revenue growth rate increased each quarter during the year. This growth was fueled by new business development. Guy Carpenter also had an excellent year with good underlying revenue growth, continued focus on expense control and strong growth in adjusted operating income. We are especially pleased with the expansion of its international operations, reflecting one of Guy Carpenter's strategic initiatives. Our Consulting operations also performed well in 2010. Mercer reported underlying revenue growth of mid-single digits in both the third and fourth quarters, and Oliver Wyman's underlying revenue growth of 8% in the fourth quarter capped a very good year. Importantly, both companies grew adjusted operating income in 2010, and the segment margin rose 110 basis points.
Prudent and effective capital management, including disciplined redeployment of excess cash into accretive acquisitions and share repurchase will also contribute to long-term earnings growth and increasing shareholder value. On the acquisition front, we continued the development of the Marsh & McLennan Agency with nine acquisitions over the past 15 months. These acquisitions are expected to add annualized revenue approaching $300 million. Additionally, in 2010, Mercer completed several acquisitions to broaden its client capabilities. The most recent acquisition of Hammond Associates, which established Mercer as a leader in investment consulting for endowments and foundations. It's also worth noting that we initiated our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter.
As we indicated at Investor Day, our goal is to re-establish Marsh & McLennan Companies as an elite, global growth company, not just in relation to our direct competitors, but with respect to other leading global companies. Our strategy focuses on the characteristics that create exceptional value and superior return for investors, long-term growth, low capital requirements, high cash generation with disciplined capital management and a low risk profile. Emphasizing these four pillars should produce 10% organic growth in operating income over the long term. We view 2010 as a very successful year for the company, and we are confident about our prospects for the coming year. Now let me turn it over to Vanessa to review our fourth quarter and full year results in more detail."

I'll begin with an overview of Marsh & McLennan's results for the quarter, then I'll discuss the results of each operating company. I'll close with some observations regarding our financial position, including pensions.
On a GAAP basis, earnings per share in the fourth quarter was $0.37, which included $0.34 from continuing operations. The $0.03 from discontinued operations was primarily insurance recoveries related to Putnam. On an adjusted basis, EPS in the fourth quarter of 2010 increased 8% to $0.41 from $0.38 in the fourth quarter of 2009. In September, we funded a $550 million debt maturity. This reduced our interest expense in the fourth quarter to $53 million from the prior run rate of $60 million per quarter. We have no debt maturing in 2011. Investment income was $19 million in the fourth quarter, largely due to gains in our private equity portfolio, which are recorded on a one quarter lag. In the fourth quarter of 2009, investment income was $23 million. Looking ahead to this year's first quarter, we anticipate investment income of approximately $15 million.
Let's turn to the results of our operations. Unless specifically indicated, my references will be to underlying revenue, underlying expenses and adjusted operating income. As Brian discussed, the financial performance of Marsh & McLennan was impressive in 2010. We achieved growth in both revenue and operating income in every one of our operating companies, not only in the quarter, but for the full year. On a consolidated basis, operating income in the fourth quarter rose 22% to $379 million compared with the prior year. For the full year, operating income increased 14% from $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion.
In Risk and Insurance Services, revenue in the fourth quarter rose 5% to $1.5 billion. Operating income increased 22% to $259 million from $213 million in the prior year, reflecting higher margins at both Marsh and Guy Carpenter. For the year, Risk and Insurance Services' growth and operating income was 10%, increasing from $985 million to $1.1 billion. Despite continuing soft market conditions, Marsh had another great quarter. Reflecting sequential improvement throughout the year, revenue rose a strong 6% in the fourth quarter to $1.3 billion. All geographic operations experienced revenue growth in the quarter, with particularly strong growth in EMEA, Asia-Pacific and Latin America. The positive momentum in Marsh's new business generation through the first nine months continued in the fourth quarter. This resulted in global new business growth of 8% for the year. Despite a significant increase in pension expense, Marsh increased its profitability as well as its margin in the fourth quarter.
Turning to reinsurance broking; Guy Carpenter continued its excellent performance, led by its international operations. Revenue was $184 million, growing 3% over last year's fourth quarter. This is especially notable considering current market conditions. In fact, this quarter marks Carpenter's eighth consecutive quarter of revenue growth, reflecting continuing strong new business and high client retention over the past two years. Ongoing expense discipline produced improved operating income for both the fourth quarter and the year.
In our Consulting segment, revenue in the fourth quarter rose 6% to $1.3 billion. Growth in operating expenses, including higher pension expense, was held to 4% for the quarter and was only 2% for the entire year. In the fourth quarter, operating income rose 17% from $142 million to $166 million. For the year, operating income increased 16% from $477 million to $553 million with margin improvement of 110 basis points.
Mercer's revenue increased 5% in the fourth quarter to $910 million. Similar to the growth in the third quarter, highlighting the balanced portfolio Mercer has built over the past several years. Within Retirement Consulting, revenue growth in Canada and Latin America was more than offset by declines in the U.S. and EMEA. Health and Benefits Consulting continued its strong performance, matching its 8% growth in the third quarter.
All regions around the world showed strength, with the U.S. and Europe's growth improving and impressive growth in Canada, Latin America and Asia-Pacific. This performance reflects the recent investments made by Mercer, as well as a stabilizing global economy and employment market. Rewards, Talent and Communications produced double-digit revenue growth for the second consecutive quarter, partly due to a resurgence in demand from Mercer's compensation surveys across all major geographic regions. Outsourcing revenue was up 5% in the quarter. Investment Consulting and Management increased 14%, affirming Mercer's strategy to provide enhanced investment solutions for their clients' retirement plans.
Even with higher pension expense, Mercer's operating income increased in both the fourth quarter and for the year. Oliver Wyman also generated strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter, which continues the positive performance that we saw throughout the year. Revenue increased 8% to $399 million, reflecting a broad-based growth in the business. Oliver Wyman's practices in the healthcare, transportation, consumer and communication sectors all generated double-digit increases. For the year, revenue increased 7%, including double-digit growth in the financial services sector, Oliver Wyman's largest industry specialty. Oliver Wyman also produced excellent growth in operating income for the fourth quarter and full year.
Turning to the cost of our defined benefit plans. As you know, higher pension expense impacted earnings per share in 2010 by slightly more than $0.10. We are projecting that pension expense will increase modestly in 2011, impacting earnings per share by $0.05. This increase reflects lower discount rates at December 31, 2010, compared with the end of 2009. Despite this increase, we expect to generate double-digit growth in earnings. From a funding perspective, we made a tax-efficient $200 million discretionary contribution to our U.S. retirement plan last September. Combined with ongoing contributions to our worldwide plans, total cash contributions to our pension plans in 2010 was approximately $450 million. For 2011, we expect contributions to our global pension plans to be approximately $300 million.
And looking at our balance sheet, cash at the end of the year was $1.9 billion compared with $1.7 billion at the end of the third quarter. The major uses of our cash in the fourth quarter included: approximately $245 million for acquisitions; $119 million for our fourth quarter dividend payment to shareholders, which reflects a 5% increase on a per share basis; and $86 million for the start of our $500 million share repurchase program. By year-end, we purchased 3.4 million shares. In addition to our year-end's cash position of $1.9 billion, we expect to receive $230 million in the first half of this year from tax credits related to the Kroll disposition. For modeling purposes, you should continue to use a 31% adjusted tax rate for the year. With that, let me turn it back to Brian."

One, our overall business, as you know, is now majority outside of the United States. And so when I look at my global business, I'm about 50-50 between fee and commission, and it's more like 60-40 in the U.S. and 40-60",318,"So let me take your first question. One, our overall business, as you know, is now majority outside of the United States. And so when I look at my global business, I'm about 50-50 between fee and commission, and it's more like 60-40 in the U.S. and 40-60 in the rest of the world. And so I feel very well-balanced. In terms of your question on leverage, I think that the commission business is slightly more leveraged to a hard market than the fee business. But having said that, fees are based upon value. And I think we demonstrate increased value in a hard market, and I feel that there would be upward momentum on the fee side as well as the market tightens and as our jobs, serving clients, become more complicated. You saw the reverse of that in the soft market. There was some downward pressure on fees through the soft market, and so it gives you some insulation. But I really like the way that we're positioned 50-50, and I feel levered enough to the market. In terms of expansion possibilities and leverage as we grow, we manage our expenses very carefully. I think some of our expansion is being masked right now. If I just look at the fourth quarter, our expense base, half of our expense growth in the fourth quarter within Marsh was based on pension increase and some severance expenses that did not run through the restructuring line that ran through our operating line. So the other thing I would say is all throughout the downturn and over the last couple of years, we've continued to invest in the business. So I don't feel any pent-up requirement to have some sort of rebound in expense to get us back to some sort of a trajectory in investing in the business. We've been steady throughout, so I feel quite good about that."

What pension does for us is add a bit of volatility to our income, bottom line. The expense movements, positive and negative, there's a bit of volatility to it. Overall, so far from what I can see, it is a reasonable approach for our employees and for our shareholders, but it does have this volatility to it. And what we did in the last year, and it was considerably volatile last year, the swing was considerable, was that we were able to manage that and still produce excellent growth and control of our expenses. And as we pointed out, it's going to be a bit of a drag this year coming. We gave you the number. But I think still, long term, it is reasonable for us to maintain. Now we'll constantly look at that.

Well, what I was trying to emphasize is that personal experience here, it's more of the psyche of the market that drives hard and soft markets. And we always keep talking about it, we have this catastrophe, things will change. And I try to point out that in 2001, before 9/11, the rates just started going up. There was no catastrophe, it was just exhaustion. And in 2008, we had a cataclysm, with $100 billion of capital disappeared overnights almost, and the rates didn't change. So there's a couple of cases in point where it wasn't a catastrophe one way or the other. And so what I was trying to emphasize is that one needs to see or understand what the psyche of the market is and how people are feeling and is there exhaustion in the market.

You see growth in Consulting pillar which was hardest hit by the recessionary period, but with good growth in outsourcing, outstanding growth in investments. And so the blend is really giving our clients two things: giving our clients a lot of stability with regard to how we service them, new product offerings that they are finding to be innovative, especially in the DB space, and then for the investor, you get that same sense of stability to perform in different areas at different times and bundled products to produce this kind of revenue growth.

I think the same. I mean, we're still in a soft market, and so that limits, to some degree, what we can do on the Insurance side. Consulting, will, I think, continue to take advantage of the things we pointed out, that Michelle and John pointed out. And the economy is improving, so that should benefit us. And Consulting is more of a late-stage buy in emerging markets. And so our international footprint will help in that regard. So I would say if it's a horse race, maybe Consulting wins by a nose."

One, if there's a multiyear deal done, the income is not all recognized in the first year. So that's point number one. There is not any kind of structural change amongst risk managers to multiyear deals. The reality is most multiyear deals have cancellation provisions. And so if you look in the large accounts space, I think the movement is more toward risk managers identifying two or three insurance companies who they want a broader, more strategic global relationship, and they're building those relationships and they recognize that those relationships, contractual or not, will tend to go across many, many years. And we help them with those choices. In the tail-end of every soft market, you tend to get some additional multiyear deals, and then there's a little bit of that out there, but I wouldn't say it's a rush to that level. And frankly, many multiyear deals have certain levels of cancellation provisions within them, either based upon loss ratios or market factors."

Relative to three months ago, probably not much, not a huge difference in that time frame, a year ago or more might be different. I think you could -- certainly, as things improve economically, the value start to change. And so one would expect that the valuations would be slightly higher going forward than they have been certainly on the Consulting side. I think to me, it's more important what we're buying and does it fit in our strategic positioning. And in that regard, I think we've done quite well so far and certainly, in Consulting, some very interesting acquisitions. I think the company is recognized as one to join again. And so we have that extra added benefit of being a place that would be a good home for a company that has limitations as to where they go. But they're great people, and they've got a great capability, and they look around for what's the next step in their evolution, we're a good home for it. So our prospects actually are improving, not going the other way even with, say, the economy changing. In Insurance, we've committed to the agency development as our primary place for acquisitions. It's not exclusive. We're certainly looking internationally all the time as well. The HSBC is a good example of that. In that regard, I think, again, it's kind of an interesting issue. This is the seller -- do they expect that the economy is going to improve and the market's going to improve? And in that case, maybe they'd be less interested. But again, what I said about Consulting is probably true in space with respect to the agency because we have now, I think, established the structure, a position in the marketplace that is attractive to those independent agency companies who were, again, looking for some next move, a way to grow. And what they're seeing is an organization that has the kind of qualities they're looking for. And so that's why Dan pointed out the pipeline is very good. And that's a long-winded way of saying I feel -- I certainly feel better this year than I did last year with all these prospects, and I think we're going to continue to find good acquisitions. Organic growth acquisitions internally, they're always a little bit more difficult. We can do it through teams, and we can do it through products and everything. And so it doesn't get the same kind of Big Bang press than another acquisition does. But we try to point that out in the earlier remarks that when we look at – we’re in this for the long haul, and expense reduction alone doesn't get you anywhere. And so you've got to invest, and we've been investing. Investing in technology and investing in product, investing in people. So that's going to continue. And then my conversion to share buyback will also play a role."

And so I don't expect that you will see this raw demand change dramatically in the Retirement business per se, in other words, the traditional business.

I'm Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me in presenting on the call today is Vanessa Wittman",859,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results as reported earlier today. I'm Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me in presenting on the call today is Vanessa Wittman, our CFO. I'd also like to welcome our operating companies' CEOs to today's call, Dan Glaser of Marsh, Peter Zaffino of Guy Carpenter, Michelle Burns of Mercer and John Drzik of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Mike Bischoff, our Head of Investor Relations. 
So let's get right to it. I'm very pleased with our performance, not only in the fourth quarter, but for the full year as well. When we reported our results a year ago, we indicated that our primary goal for the year ahead was to drive top and bottom line growth across the enterprise. Our plan was to grow revenue organically and through strategic acquisitions. A year later, I'm delighted to be able to say we've met both our objectives. 
Let's start with the fourth quarter. We produced very strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter with reported growth of 9%. On an underlying basis, the overall increase for the company was 6%, including 6% growth at Marsh, 3% at Guy Carpenter, 5% at Mercer and 8% at Oliver Wyman. We're also very pleased with our level of revenue growth for the full year, which was 7% as reported and 3% on an underlying basis.
Additionally, we're encouraged that revenue performance got stronger as the year progressed. In both the third and fourth quarters, all our operating companies produced revenue growth on both a reported and an underlying basis. And importantly, we achieved this solid revenue growth while effectively managing expenses. Overall, adjusted underlying expenses grew only 2% last year despite having to absorb a significant increase in pension costs. 
While we continue to manage our business efficiently, we have also been actively reinvesting in our future. Major investments, not only in 2010, but over the last three years, include key strategic hires, value-added technology for clients, product development and expanded analytical capabilities within each of our operating companies. By combining revenue growth with expense management, we produced excellent earnings growth in 2010. For example, adjusted operating income increased from $1.3 billion in 2009 to $1.5 billion in 2010, an increase of 14%. 
As you are aware, we decided, after a thorough, strategic review, to divest Kroll, a transaction we completed last August at a very satisfactory price. Aggregate cash proceeds, including the prior divestment of selected Kroll business units and related tax benefits, will be $1.6 billion. So overall, Marsh & McLennan Companies delivered a very impressive performance last year both from a financial and a strategic perspective. 
Now let's turn to our operating segments. Both Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting produced good underlying revenue growth in 2010. Adjusted operating income increased 10% at Risk and Insurance Services and 16% at Consulting. Both segments also increased adjusted operating margins for the year. 
We were pleased that Marsh's underlying revenue growth rate increased each quarter during the year. This growth was fueled by new business development. Guy Carpenter also had an excellent year with good underlying revenue growth, a continued focus on expense control and strong growth in adjusted operating income. We are especially pleased with the expansion of its international operations, reflecting one of Guy Carpenter's strategic initiatives. 
Our Consulting operations also performed well in 2010. Mercer reported underlying revenue growth of mid-single digits in both the third and fourth quarters, and Oliver Wyman's underlying revenue growth of 8% in the fourth quarter capped a very good year. Importantly, both companies grew adjusted operating income in 2010, and the segment margin rose 110 basis points. 
Prudent and effective capital management, including disciplined redeployment of excess cash into accretive acquisitions and share repurchase will also contribute to long-term earnings growth and increasing shareholder value. 
On the acquisition front, we continued the development of the Marsh & McLennan Agency with nine acquisitions over the past 15 months. These acquisitions are expected to add annualized revenue approaching $300 million. 
Additionally, in 2010, Mercer completed several acquisitions to broaden its client capabilities. The most recent acquisition of Hammond Associates, which established Mercer as a leader in investment consulting for endowments and foundations. It's also worth noting that we initiated our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter. 
As we indicated at Investor Day, our goal is to re-establish Marsh & McLennan Companies as an elite, global growth company, not just in relation to our direct competitors, but with respect to other leading global companies. Our strategy focuses on the characteristics that create exceptional value and superior return for investors, long-term growth, low capital requirements, high cash generation with disciplined capital management and a low risk profile. Emphasizing these four pillars should produce 10% organic growth in operating income over the long term. 
We view 2010 as a very successful year for the company, and we are confident about our prospects for the coming year. Now let me turn it over to Vanessa to review our fourth quarter and full year results in more detail."

I'll begin with an overview of Marsh & McLennan's results for the quarter, then I'll discuss the results of each operating company. I'll close with some observations regarding our financial position, including pensions. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share in the fourth quarter was $0.37, which included $0.34 from continuing operations. The $0.03 from discontinued operations was primarily insurance recoveries related to Putnam. 
On an adjusted basis, EPS in the fourth quarter of 2010 increased 8% to $0.41 from $0.38 in the fourth quarter of 2009. In September, we funded a $550 million debt maturity. This reduced our interest expense in the fourth quarter to $53 million from the prior run rate of $60 million per quarter. We have no debt maturing in 2011. 
Investment income was $19 million in the fourth quarter, largely due to gains in our private equity portfolio, which are recorded on a one quarter lag. In the fourth quarter of 2009, investment income was $23 million. Looking ahead to this year's first quarter, we anticipate investment income of approximately $15 million. 
Let's turn to the results of our operations. Unless specifically indicated, my references will be to underlying revenue, underlying expenses and adjusted operating income. As Brian discussed, the financial performance of Marsh & McLennan was impressive in 2010. We achieved growth in both revenue and operating income in every one of our operating companies, not only in the quarter, but for the full year. On a consolidated basis, operating income in the fourth quarter rose 22% to $379 million compared with the prior year. For the full year, operating income increased 14% from $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. 
In Risk and Insurance Services, revenue in the fourth quarter rose 5% to $1.5 billion. Operating income increased 22% to $259 million from $213 million in the prior year, reflecting higher margins at both Marsh and Guy Carpenter. For the year, Risk and Insurance Services' growth and operating income was 10%, increasing from $985 million to $1.1 billion. 
Despite continuing soft market conditions, Marsh had another great quarter. Reflecting sequential improvement throughout the year, revenue rose a strong 6% in the fourth quarter to $1.3 billion. All geographic operations experienced revenue growth in the quarter, with particularly strong growth in EMEA, Asia-Pacific and Latin America. The positive momentum in Marsh's new business generation through the first nine months continued in the fourth quarter. This resulted in global new business growth of 8% for the year. 
Despite a significant increase in pension expense, Marsh increased its profitability as well as its margin in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to reinsurance broking. Guy Carpenter continued its excellent performance, led by its international operations. Revenue was $184 million, growing 3% over last year's fourth quarter. This is especially notable considering current market conditions. In fact, this quarter marks Carpenter's eighth consecutive quarter of revenue growth, reflecting continuing strong new business and high client retention over the past two years. Ongoing expense discipline produced improved operating income for both the fourth quarter and the year. 
In our Consulting segment, revenue in the fourth quarter rose 6% to $1.3 billion. Growth in operating expenses, including higher pension expense, was held to 4% for the quarter and was only 2% for the entire year. In the fourth quarter, operating income rose 17% from $142 million to $166 million. For the year, operating income increased 16% from $477 million to $553 million with margin improvement of 110 basis points. Mercer's revenue increased 5% in the fourth quarter to $910 million, similar to the growth in the third quarter, highlighting the balanced portfolio Mercer has built over the past several years. 
Within Retirement Consulting, revenue growth in Canada and Latin America was more than offset by declines in the U.S. and EMEA. Health and Benefits Consulting continued its strong performance, matching its 8% growth in the third quarter. All regions around the world showed strength, with the U.S. and Europe's growth improving and impressive growth in Canada, Latin America and Asia-Pacific. This performance reflects the recent investments made by Mercer, as well as a stabilizing global economy and employment market. 
Rewards, Talent and Communications produced double-digit revenue growth for the second consecutive quarter, partly due to a resurgence in demand for Mercer's compensation surveys across all major geographic regions. 
Outsourcing revenue was up 5% in the quarter. Investment Consulting and Management increased 14%, affirming Mercer's strategy to provide enhanced investment solutions for their clients' retirement plans. Even with higher pension expense, Mercer's operating income increased in both the fourth quarter and for the year. 
Oliver Wyman also generated strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter, which continues the positive performance that we saw throughout the year. Revenue increased 8% to $399 million, reflecting a broad-based growth in the business. Oliver Wyman's practices in the healthcare, transportation, consumer and communication sectors all generated double-digit increases. For the year, revenue increased 7%, including double-digit growth in the financial services sector, Oliver Wyman's largest industry specialty. Oliver Wyman also produced excellent growth in operating income for the fourth quarter and full year. 
Turning to the cost of our defined benefit plans. As you know, higher pension expense impacted earnings per share in 2010 by slightly more than $0.10. We are projecting that pension expense will increase modestly in 2011, impacting earnings per share by $0.05. This increase reflects lower discount rates at December 31, 2010, compared with the end of 2009. Despite this increase, we expect to generate double-digit growth in earnings. From a funding perspective, we made a tax-efficient $200 million discretionary contribution to our U.S. retirement plan last September. 
Combined with ongoing contributions to our worldwide plans, total cash contributions to our pension plans in 2010 was approximately $450 million. For 2011, we expect contributions to our global pension plans to be approximately $300 million. And looking at our balance sheet, cash at the end of the year was $1.9 billion compared with $1.7 billion at the end of the third quarter. The major uses of our cash in the fourth quarter included approximately $245 million for acquisitions; $119 million for our fourth quarter dividend payment to shareholders, which reflects a 5% increase on a per share basis; and $86 million for the start of our $500 million share repurchase program. By year-end, we purchased 3.4 million shares. 
In addition to our year-end's cash position of $1.9 billion, we expect to receive $230 million in the first half of this year from tax credits related to the Kroll disposition. For modeling purposes, you should continue to use a 31% adjusted tax rate for the year. 
With that, let me turn it back to Brian."

One, our overall business, as you know, is now majority outside of the United States. And so when I look at my global business, I'm about 50-50 between fee and commission, and it's more like 60-40 in the U.S. and 40-60",318,"So let me take your first question. One, our overall business, as you know, is now majority outside of the United States. And so when I look at my global business, I'm about 50-50 between fee and commission, and it's more like 60-40 in the U.S. and 40-60 in the rest of the world. And so I feel very well-balanced. In terms of your question on leverage, I think that the commission business is slightly more leveraged to a hard market than the fee business. But having said that, fees are based upon value. And I think we demonstrate increased value in a hard market, and I feel that there would be upward momentum on the fee side as well as the market tightens and as our jobs, serving clients, become more complicated. You saw the reverse of that in the soft market. There was some downward pressure on fees through the soft market, and so it gives you some insulation. But I really like the way that we're positioned 50-50, and I feel levered enough to the market. In terms of expansion possibilities and leverage as we grow, we manage our expenses very carefully. I think some of our expansion is being masked right now. If I just look at the fourth quarter, our expense base, half of our expense growth in the fourth quarter within Marsh was based on pension increase and some severance expenses that did not run through the restructuring line that ran through our operating line. So the other thing I would say is all throughout the downturn and over the last couple of years, we've continued to invest in the business. So I don't feel any pent-up requirement to have some sort of rebound in expense to get us back to some sort of a trajectory in investing in the business. We've been steady throughout, so I feel quite good about that."

What pension does for us is add a bit of volatility to our income, bottom line. The expense movements, positive and negative, there's a bit of volatility to it. Overall, so far from what I can see, it is a reasonable approach for our employees and for our shareholders, but it does have this volatility to it. And what we did in the last year, and it was considerably volatile last year, the swing was considerable, was that we were able to manage that and still produce excellent growth and control of our expenses. And as we pointed out, it's going to be a bit of a drag this year coming. We gave you the number. But I think still, long term, it is reasonable for us to maintain. Now we'll constantly look at that.

Well, what I was trying to emphasize is that personal experience here, it's more of the psyche of the market that drives hard and soft markets. And we always keep talking about it, we have this catastrophe, things will change. And I try to point out that in 2001, before 9/11, the rates just started going up. There was no catastrophe, it was just exhaustion. And in 2008, we had a cataclysm, with $100 billion of capital disappeared overnights almost, and the rates didn't change. So there's a couple of cases in point where it wasn't a catastrophe one way or the other.

I would say our new business generation would be first and foremost. We had $276 million of new business in the quarter, which is the highest quarter of new business since all the way back in 2007. Our past and present hiring of top-tier talent, our success in generating enhanced commission and fee-for-services agreements with carriers, all of those contributed to our overall performance. I've been in the business a long time, so I don't get overly excited about growth in any one quarter. I look at it for the year. In 2009, we were minus one, so our real focus in 2010 was to get growth going again. And for the year, we were at plus two on an underlying basis. Looking forward, I would think we will do better than that, but I wouldn't necessarily extrapolate the fourth quarter and say that, that would be continuing. I mean, hope so, and we're out there plugging away, but it was a terrific quarter, and a lot of things broke our way."

We've made decisions to expand our core Consulting units, and continued to invest in it, and several of the organic and inorganic investments that we've made at Mercer were inter-core Consulting. But in addition, we made a decision to expand in our next-generation businesses, and those businesses are outsourcing, the outsourcing pillar and the investment pillar, and we've consistently done that. This quarter and last quarter, as matter of fact, as Dan said, the full year reflects that strategy. You see growth in Consulting pillar which was hardest hit by the recessionary period, but with good growth in outsourcing and outstanding growth in investments. And so the blend is really giving our clients two things: giving our clients a lot of stability with regard to how we service them, new product offerings that they are finding to be innovative, especially in the DB space, and then for the investor, you get that same sense of stability to perform in different areas at different times and bundle products to produce this kind of revenue growth. So from our perspective, we believe that the strategy has been confirmed, and we expect that this will continue into the future as a good, balanced portfolio with which to serve our human resource client."

One, if there's a multiyear deal done, the income is not all recognized in the first year. So that's point number one. There is not any kind of structural change amongst risk managers to multiyear deals. The reality is most multiyear deals have cancellation provisions. And so if you look in the large accounts space, I think the movement is more toward risk managers identifying two or three insurance companies who they want a broader, more strategic global relationship, and they're building those relationships and they recognize that those relationships, contractual or not, will tend to go across many, many years. And we help them with those choices. In the tail-end of every soft market, you tend to get some additional multiyear deals, and then there's a little bit of that out there, but I wouldn't say it's a rush to that level. And frankly, many multiyear deals have certain levels of cancellation provisions within them, either based upon loss ratios or market factors."

Relative to three months ago, probably not much, not a huge difference in that time frame, a year ago or more might be different. I think you could -- certainly, as things improve economically, the value start to change. And so one would expect that the valuations would be slightly higher going forward than they have been certainly on the Consulting side. I think to me, it's more important what we're buying and does it fit in our strategic positioning. And in that regard, I think we've done quite well so far and certainly, in Consulting, some very interesting acquisitions. I think the company is recognized as one to join again. And so we have that extra added benefit of being a place that would be a good home for a company that has limitations as to where they go. But they're great people, and they've got a great capability, and they look around for what's the next step in their evolution, we're a good home for it. So our prospects actually are improving, not going the other way even with, say, the economy changing. In Insurance, we've committed to the agency development as our primary place for acquisitions. It's not exclusive. We're certainly looking internationally all the time as well. The HSBC is a good example of that. In that regard, I think, again, it's kind of an interesting issue. This is the seller -- do they expect that the economy is going to improve or the market's going to improve? And in that case, maybe they'd be less interested. But again, what I said about Consulting is probably true in spades with respect to the agency because we have now, I think, established a structure, a position in the marketplace that is attractive to those independent agency companies who were, again, looking for some next move, a way to grow. And what they're seeing is an organization that has the kind of qualities they're looking for. And so that's why Dan pointed out the pipeline is very good. And that's a long-winded way of saying I feel -- I certainly feel better this year than I did last year with our prospects, and I think we're going to continue to find good acquisitions. Organic growth acquisitions internally, they're always a little bit more difficult. We can do it through teams, and we can do it through products and everything. And so it doesn't get the same kind of big bang press that another acquisition does. But we try to point that out in the earlier remarks that when we look at -- we’re in this for the long haul, and expense reduction alone doesn't get you anywhere. And so you've got to invest, and we've been investing: Investing in technology and investing in product, investing in people. So that's going to continue. And then my conversion to share buyback will also play a role."

I'm Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me and presenting on the call today is Vanessa Wittman, our CFO. Also I'd like to welcome Dan Glaser, Group President and Chief Operating Officer of Marsh & McLennan Companies, as well as our operating companies CEOs, Peter Zaffino of Marsh; Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter; Michele Burns of Mercer; and John Drzik of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Mike Bischoff. 
Our first quarter results show that we're off to a very good start this year. We reported a strong increase in revenue with growth of 9%. In fact this is the third consecutive quarter that each of our operating companies produce revenue growth on both a reported and an underlying basis. And importantly, we can continue to achieve revenue growth while maintaining effective control over operating expenses. 
As a result, we produced 10% growth in adjusted EPS for the quarter, a solid start for the year. The positive momentum in Marsh continued with good underlying revenue growth, fueled by New business Development and high client revenue retention rates. 
Guy Carpenter also produced excellent quarterly underlying revenue growth as for more than 2 years now led by its international operations. Mercer generated underlying revenue growth of mid-single digits for the third consecutive quarter. And Oliver Wyman's underlying revenue growth was its strongest since 2007. So we're very pleased with our operating performance in the first quarter. 
I'd now like to expand on some recent management changes at the company. The 4 pillars I discussed in Investor Day last September are the foundation for Marsh & McLennan's Companies to produce outstanding performance on the long-term basis, reestablishing us as a global growth company. 
Our strategy focus is on the characteristics that create exceptional value and superior returns for investors, long-term growth, low capital requirement, side cash generation with disciplined capital management and low risk profile. Based on our strong performance last year and our excellent start this year, I'm confident that the turnaround we began 3 years ago was complete. 
Now that we've managed effectively through the great recession in each of our businesses is on an upward trajectory, I thought it was an opportune time to make changes to our leadership structure. These changes further enhance our strong management team by providing expanded responsibilities and broaden scope for certain key executives. This will allow them to utilize their unique perspectives to further refine our operating model, while at the same time maintaining the continuity and strong cohesive working relationship among the senior management team. 
So as we announced last month, Dan Glaser is named Group President, Chief Operating Officer of Marsh & McLennan Companies. We believe his appointment will accelerate our progress towards growth in revenue and profitability across all our operating companies, and sharpen our focus as an organization. As you know, Dan is a seasoned executive with 30 years experience in the Insurance business, including senior management positions both as a broker and as an underwriter. In his newly created role, Dan will have operational and strategic oversight of our 4 operating companies as well as certain functional areas. Under Dan's leadership, Marsh dramatically improved profitability and performance. And we have every confidence that he brings the same leadership qualities, strategic thinking and operational excellence to his new role. 
Peter Zaffino was named CEO of Marsh. One of the best decisions I made when I joined Marsh & McLennan was to name Peter CEO of Guy Carpenter in early 2008. During his tenure, Peter built and led a team that significantly improve performance, solidified Guy Carpenter's standing as one of the world's leading insurance intermediaries and position the company as a broad-based risk advisor for the insurance industry. Building on its strong foundation, Dan created at Marsh, Peter will draw on his 20 years of experience in the insurance and reinsurance industry to bring the same vision inside and drive to his new role. 
Alex Moczarski  will now lead Guy Carpenter. Alex have been CEO of the International division of Marsh and was instrumental in the building its substantial presence in markets throughout the world. Under his leadership, Marsh's international operations have been a strong contributor to Marsh's performance over the past 3 years. Alex has worked tirelessly to build a cohesive international team, spanning several continents and he has the passion for the business that always takes into account what is in the best interest of Marsh & McLennan Companies. With more than 30 years in the insurance industry, 18 years at Marsh and before that, with AIG, Alex is an internationalist. He spent time in Latin America and Europe, as well as the United States gaining valuable experience and perspective needed to guide to lead Guy Carpenter as it focuses on the enormous potential of international growth. 
I want to emphasize that our strong management team includes our colleagues within Mercer and Oliver Wyman, led by Michelle and John. The entire senior management team will continue working together with a long-term focus driving performance. And before anyone asks, I couldn't be more engaged and energized about the company's prospects than I am today. 
With that, let me turn it over to Vanessa to review our first quarter results in more detail."
473342,130383021,121967,"Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 04, 2011",2011-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm delighted to report that the financial performance of Marsh & McLennan Companies in the first quarter was strong.

I'm delighted to report that the financial performance of Marsh & McLennan Companies in the first quarter was strong. We achieved solid revenue growth and increased operating income in each of our operating companies. 
On a GAAP basis, earnings per share in the first quarter was $0.58 including $0.56 from continuing operations, discontinued operations of $0.02 related largely to Putnam. And it's important to note that our adjusted EPS equaled GAAP EPS from continuing operations. 
On an adjusted basis, first quarter EPS increased 10% to $0.56. First, let's go into a little more detail on our consolidated results. Unless specifically indicated, my references will be to underlying revenue, underlying expenses and adjusted operating income. 
Investment income rose to $19 million from $8 million last year. In the second quarter, we anticipate a slight loss due to a mark-to-market declines in our private equity portfolio, which are recorded on a one quarter lag. In the first quarter, interest income rose to $7 million due to higher cash balances compared with last year and slightly higher interest rates. Interest expense decreased to $51 million in the first quarter from $60 million a year ago due to the payment of a $550 million senior note last September.  Our next debt maturity is at $250 million note due in March of next year. 
Let's turn to the results of our operations. In Risk and Insurance Services, both Marsh and Guy Carpenter contributed to strong revenue growth in the first quarter. Operating income increased 7% to $383 million. This growth and profitability was achieved despite higher pension costs and the negative impact to foreign currency translation. The euro and the British pound were weak relative to the U.S. dollar in January, which is a major renewal period for Guy Carpenter and the largest period of profitability for Marsh's European operations. 
Had it not been for the effects of foreign exchange, Risk and Insurance Services would have achieved slight margin improvement instead of the slight decline. Even taking this into account, Marsh had another solid quarter. 
Revenue rose 4% in the first quarter to $1.3 billion, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of growth. Everyone at Marsh's major geographic operations experienced revenue growth in the quarter with particularly strong growth in Asia-Pacific and Latin America. Additionally, U.S., Canada generated revenue growth of 3% for the third consecutive quarter, a real achievement considering the market conditions. 
Turning to Reinsurance Broking. Guy Carpenter continued to build on its very strong performance in 2010. Revenue was $340 million, reflecting strong growth of 7% led by the International operations and global specialties. This quarter marks Carpenter's ninth consecutive quarter of revenue growth, reflecting continuing strong new business and high client retentions. 
Our Consulting segment continue to generate strong revenue growth. In the first quarter, revenue rose 6% to $1.3 billion. Growth in operating expenses was 5%, including the impact of higher pension expense. Operating income rose 13%. Mercer's revenue increased 5% in the first quarter to $922 million, continuing its strong performance from the second half of last year. 
Within Retirement, revenue growth in EMEA, Asia-Pacific and Latin America was offset by declines in North America. Health and benefits continued its outstanding performance, matching its 8% growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2010. All global regions showed strength, particularly the U.S., Latin America and Asia Pacific. 
Rewards, Talent and Communications produced double-digit revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter. This was due to continuing demand for Mercer's compensation surveys, as well as higher demands for consulting services in all major geographies. In the quarter, outsourcing revenue was negatively impacted by the loss of 2 clients due to M&A. The double-digit growth in investment consulting and management continue to trend but is now extended for more than a year. 
Oliver Wyman's 9% growth rate in this quarter was in its highest since 2007. This impressive growth was led by a number of industry sectors that achieved double-digit increases, including healthcare, transportation and retail. Oliver Wyman's close management of operating expenses also contributed to excellent growth and operating income. 
Debt at the end of the first quarter was $3 billion, unchanged from year end. Average diluted shares rose due to 3 factors: one, acquisitions, two, an increase in common share equivalents due to a higher share price; and three, the normal vesting of equity awards. 
The increase was partially offset by share repurchases. Quarter end's cash was $1.3 billion compared with $1.1 billion a year ago. Our cash utilization is typically greatest in the first quarter, primarily due to the payment of incentive compensation awards. Other major uses of cash in the first quarter included $120 million for acquisitions and dividend payments of $117 million. We delayed repurchasing shares due to our normal heavy cash uses in the first quarter. But now in the second quarter, with bonus payments behind us and the anticipation of a tax refund in June related to the accrual of this position, we plan to resume repurchasing our shares. 
With that, let me turn it back to Brian."

So again, it's very strong is coming from everywhere. Our competitors, we've had driven significant value to client that created new reinsurance opportunities. So there is no one specific trend as we think we've been executing very well on new business. In terms of RMS, it's not quite clear and certain how that's going to impact reinsurance purchasing or the industry as of yet. But we have been working very closely with all of our clients running a series of our mess and other vendor models to understand the changes and how they impact our clients into what specific trends there are. And we're starting to see a lot of the inland exposures being driven off in some of the peak zones 15-plus percent. And so on as renewals come up, we will certainly react to that floor of the big one on June 1 and we'll have others on 71. So I think there will be a gradual impact as we move into the year."

Our revenue retention level, which really is the revenue we get on accounts on sort of a same-store basis has been increasing as well. That is, where you could see some mild stabilization of rates, the mild increases in exposure units and expanded new sales to existing customers. So if you look at our growth in the quarter, it was very broadly distributed. We have 32 countries that grew organically 5% or more. And we have very strong new business both internationally and in the U.S., Canada. Our new business for the quarter is about $240 million."

We've seen what happened in Japan but as we see the earnings calls for reinsurance, many of them increased their all estimates on what Japan means and what the expected losses. So we have that coupled with RMS, coupled with the largest quarter catastrophes outside of the U.S. industry are of reinsurance.

I'm Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me and presenting on the call today is Vanessa Wittman, our CFO. Also I'd like to welcome Dan Glaser, Group President and Chief Operating Officer of Marsh & McLennan Companies; as well as our operating companies CEOs, Peter Zaffino of Marsh; Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter; Michele Burns of Mercer; and John Drzik of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Mike Bischoff.
Our first quarter results show that we're off to a very good start this year. We reported a strong increase in revenue with growth of 9%. In fact this is the third consecutive quarter that each of our operating companies produce revenue growth on both a reported and on underlying basis. And importantly, we can continue to achieve revenue growth while maintaining effective control over operating expenses.
As a result, we produced 10% growth in adjusted EPS for the quarter, a solid start for the year. The positive momentum at Marsh continued, with good underlying revenue growth, fueled by new business development and high client revenue retention rates. Guy Carpenter also produced excellent quarterly underlying revenue growth as it has for more than 2 years now led by its international operations. Mercer generated underlying revenue growth of mid-single digits for the third consecutive quarter. And Oliver Wyman's underlying revenue growth was its strongest since 2007. So we're very pleased with our operating performance in the first quarter.
I'd now like to expand on some recent management changes at the company. The 4 pillars I discussed in Investor Day last September are the foundation for Marsh & McLennan Companies to produce outstanding performance on a long-term basis, reestablishing us as a global growth company.
Our strategy focuses on the characteristics that create exceptional value and superior returns for investors, long-term growth, low capital requirement, high cash generation with disciplined capital management and low risk profile. Based on our strong performance last year and our excellent start this year, I am confident that the turnaround we've began 3 years ago was complete.
Now that we've managed effectively through the great recession and each of our businesses is on an upward trajectory, I thought it was an opportune time to make changes to our leadership structure. These changes further enhance our strong management team by providing expanded responsibilities and broadened scope for certain key executives. This will allow them to utilize their unique perspectives to further refine our operating model, while at the same time maintaining the continuity and strong cohesive working relationship among the senior management team.
So as we announced last month, Dan Glaser is named Group President, Chief Operating Officer of Marsh & McLennan Companies. We believe his appointment will accelerate our progress towards growth in revenue and profitability across all our operating companies, and sharpen our focus as an organization. As you know, Dan is a seasoned executive with 30 years experience in the insurance business, including senior management positions both as a broker and as an underwriter. In his newly created role, Dan will have operational and strategic oversight of our 4 operating companies as well as certain functional areas. Under Dan's leadership, Marsh dramatically improved profitability and performance. And we have every confidence that he brings the same leadership qualities, strategic thinking and operational excellence to his new role.
Peter Zaffino is named CEO of Marsh. One of the best decisions I made when I joined Marsh & McLennan was to name Peter as CEO of Guy Carpenter in early 2008. During his tenure, Peter built and led a team that significantly improved performance, solidified Guy Carpenter's standing as one of the world's leading reinsurance intermediaries and position the company as a broad-based risk advisor for the insurance industry. Building on the strong foundation, Dan created at Marsh, Peter will draw on his 20 years of experience in the insurance and reinsurance industry to bring the same vision inside and drive to his new role.
Alex Moczarski  will now lead Guy Carpenter. Alex had been CEO of the International division of Marsh, and was instrumental in the building its substantial presence in markets throughout the world. Under his leadership, Marsh's International operations have been a strong contributor to Marsh's performance over the past 3 years. Alex has worked tirelessly to build a cohesive international team, spanning several continents and he has the passion for the business that always takes into account what is in the best interest of Marsh & McLennan Companies. With more than 30 years in the insurance industry, 18 years at Marsh and before that, with AIG, Alex is an internationalist. He spent time in Latin America and Europe, as well as the United States gaining invaluable experience and perspective needed to guide to lead Guy Carpenter as it focuses on the enormous potential of international growth.
I want to emphasize that our strong management team includes our colleagues within Mercer and Oliver Wyman, led by Michele and John. The entire senior management team will continue working together with a long-term focus driving performance. And before anyone asks, I couldn't be more engaged and energized about the company's prospects than I am today.
With that, let me turn it over to Vanessa to review our first quarter results in more detail."
473342,130383021,122158,"Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 04, 2011",2011-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm delighted to report that the financial performance of Marsh & McLennan Companies in the first quarter was strong. We achieved solid revenue growth and increased operating income in each of our operating co",847,"Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm delighted to report that the financial performance of Marsh & McLennan Companies in the first quarter was strong. We achieved solid revenue growth and increased operating income in each of our operating companies.
On a GAAP basis, earnings per share in the first quarter was $0.58, including $0.56 from continuing operations, discontinued operations of $0.02 related largely to Putnam. And it's important to note that our adjusted EPS equaled GAAP EPS from continuing operations. On an adjusted basis, first quarter EPS increased 10% to $0.56. First, let's go into a little more detail on our consolidated results. Unless specifically indicated, my references will be to underlying revenue, underlying expenses and adjusted operating income.
Investment income rose to $19 million from $8 million last year. In the second quarter, we anticipate a slight loss due to a mark-to-market declines in our private equity portfolio, which are recorded on a one quarter lag. In the first quarter, interest income rose to $7 million due to higher cash balances compared with last year and slightly higher interest rates. Interest expense decreased to $51 million in the fourth -- first quarter from $60 million a year ago due to the payment of a $550 million senior note last September.  Our next debt maturity is a $250 million note due in March of next year.
Let's turn to the results of our operations. In Risk and Insurance Services, both Marsh and Guy Carpenter contributed to strong revenue growth in the first quarter. Operating income increased 7% to $383 million. This growth in profitability was achieved despite higher pension costs and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. The euro and the British pound were weak relative to the U.S. dollar in January, which is a major renewal period for Guy Carpenter and the largest period of profitability for Marsh's European operations. Had it not been for the effects of foreign exchange, Risk and Insurance Services would have achieved slight margin improvement instead of the slight decline.
Even taking this into account, Marsh had another solid quarter. Revenue rose 4% in the first quarter to $1.3 billion, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of growth. Everyone of Marsh's major geographic operations experienced revenue growth in the quarter with particularly strong growth in Asia-Pacific and Latin America. Additionally, U.S./Canada generated revenue growth of 3% for the third consecutive quarter, a real achievement considering the market conditions.
Turning to Reinsurance Broking. Guy Carpenter continued to build on its very strong performance in 2010. Revenue was $340 million, reflecting strong growth of 7% led by its International operations and global specialties. This quarter marks Carpenter's ninth consecutive quarter of revenue growth, reflecting continuing strong new business and high client retentions.
Our Consulting segment continued to generate strong revenue growth. In the first quarter, revenue rose 6% to $1.3 billion. Growth in operating expenses was 5%, including the impact of higher pension expense. Operating income rose 13%. Mercer's revenue increased 5% in the first quarter to $922 million, continuing its strong performance from the second half of last year. Within Retirement, revenue growth in EMEA, Asia-Pacific and Latin America was offset by declines in North America. Health and Benefits continued its outstanding performance, matching its 8% growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2010. All global regions showed strength, particularly the U.S., Latin America and Asia Pacific. 
Rewards, Talent & Communications produced double-digit revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter. This was due to continuing demand for Mercer's compensation surveys, as well as higher demands for consulting services in all major geographies. In the quarter, outsourcing revenue was negatively impacted by the loss of 2 clients due to M&A. The double-digit growth in Investment Consulting & Management continue to trend that has now extended for more than a year.
Oliver Wyman's 9% growth rate in this quarter was in its highest since 2007. This impressive growth was led by a number of industry sectors that achieved double-digit increases, including healthcare, transportation and retail. Oliver Wyman's close management of operating expenses also contributed to excellent growth and operating income. Debt at the end of the first quarter was $3 billion, unchanged from year end. 
Average diluted shares rose due to 3 factors: one, acquisitions; two, an increase in common share equivalents due to a higher share price; and three, the normal vesting of equity awards. The increase was partially offset by share repurchases. 
Quarter-end's cash was $1.3 billion compared with $1.1 billion a year ago. Our cash utilization is typically greatest in the first quarter, primarily due to the payment of incentive compensation awards. Other major uses of cash in the first quarter included $120 million for acquisitions and dividend payments of $117 million. We delayed repurchasing shares due to our normal heavy cash uses in the first quarter. But now in the second quarter, with bonus payments behind us and the anticipation of a tax refund in June related to the Kroll disposition, we plan to resume repurchasing our shares. 
With that, let me turn it back to Brian."

Our competitors, we've had driven significant value to client that created new reinsurance opportunities. So there is no one specific trend and I think we've been executing very well on new business. In terms of RMS, it's not quite clear and certain how that's going to impact reinsurance purchasing or the industry as of yet. But we have been working very closely with all of our clients running a series of RMS and other vendor models to understand the changes and how they impact our clients and what specific trends there are. And we're starting to see a lot of the inland exposures being driven off in some of the peak zones, 15-plus percent. And so as renewals come up, we will certainly react to that floor to the big one on June 1, and then we'll have others on 7, 1. So I think that's going to be a gradual impact as we look into the year."

But similar to what Dan is saying, there are signs that rate reductions are starting to slow down, we still saw that in the first quarter on property cap and there will be a confluence of events. We've seen what happened in Japan, but as we see the earnings calls for reinsurers, many of them increased their own estimates on what Japan means and what the expected losses. So we have that coupled with RMS, coupled with the largest quarter catastrophes outside of the U.S. in the history of reinsurance. So, now all those confluence of events are going to have companies taking a hard look at how they're going to deploy their capital and how they are going to price the business going forward, so it's a very similar theme."

With regard to Specialty Consulting, clearly, there is a pent-up demand where people have taken an opportunity to step back in to their talent management space, especially both in the United States and around the world. I just recently completed a trip that covered Mexico to Argentina and met with a number of CEOs and CFOs and CHR.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results as reported earlier today. I'm Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me and presenting on the call today is Vane",903,"Thank you. Good morning. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results as reported earlier today. I'm Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me and presenting on the call today is Vanessa Wittman, our CFO. Also I'd like to welcome Dan Glaser, Group President and Chief Operating Officer of Marsh & McLennan Companies; as well as our operating companies CEOs, Peter Zaffino of Marsh; Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter; Michele Burns of Mercer; and John Drzik of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Mike Bischoff.
Our first quarter results show that we're off to a very good start this year. We reported a strong increase in revenue with growth of 9%. In fact, this is the third consecutive quarter that each of our operating companies produce revenue growth on both a reported and on underlying basis. And importantly, we can continue to achieve revenue growth while maintaining effective control over operating expenses.
As a result, we produced 10% growth in adjusted EPS for the quarter, a solid start for the year. The positive momentum at Marsh continued with good underlying revenue growth, fueled by new business development and high client revenue retention rates. Guy Carpenter also produced excellent quarterly underlying revenue growth, as it has for more than 2 years now led by its international operations. Mercer generated underlying revenue growth of mid-single digits for the third consecutive quarter. And Oliver Wyman's underlying revenue growth was its strongest since 2007. So we're very pleased with our operating performance in the first quarter.
I'd now like to expand on some recent management changes at the company. The 4 pillars I discussed in Investor Day last September are the foundation for Marsh & McLennan Companies to produce outstanding performance on a long-term basis, re-establishing us as a global growth company.
Our strategy focuses on the characteristics that create exceptional value and superior returns for investors, long-term growth, low capital requirements, high cash generation with disciplined capital management and low risk profile. Based on our strong performance last year and our excellent start this year, I am confident that the turnaround we began 3 years ago is complete.
Now that we've managed effectively through the great recession and each of our businesses is on an upward trajectory, I thought it was an opportune time to make changes to our leadership structure. These changes further enhance our strong management team by providing expanded responsibilities and broadened scope for certain key executives. This will allow them to utilize their unique perspectives to further refine our operating model, while at the same time maintaining the continuity and strong cohesive working relationship among the senior management team.
So as we announced last month, Dan Glaser is named Group President, Chief Operating Officer of Marsh & McLennan Companies. We believe his appointment will accelerate our progress towards growth in revenue and profitability across all our operating companies, and sharpen our focus as an organization. As you know, Dan is a seasoned executive with 30 years’ experience in the insurance business, including senior management positions both as a broker and as an underwriter. In his newly created role, Dan will have operational and strategic oversight of our 4 operating companies as well as certain functional areas. Under Dan's leadership, Marsh dramatically improved profitability and performance. And we have every confidence that he brings the same leadership qualities, strategic thinking and operational excellence to his new role.
Peter Zaffino is named CEO of Marsh. One of the best decisions I made when I joined Marsh & McLennan was to name Peter as CEO of Guy Carpenter in early 2008. During his tenure, Peter built and led a team that significantly improved performance, solidified Guy Carpenter's standing as one of the world's leading reinsurance intermediaries and positioned the company as a broad-based risk advisor for the insurance industry. Building on the strong foundation, Dan created at Marsh, Peter will draw on his 20 years of experience in the insurance and reinsurance industry to bring the same vision, insight and drive to his new role.
Alex Moczarski  will now lead Guy Carpenter. Alex had been CEO of the International division of Marsh, and was instrumental in the building its substantial presence in markets throughout the world. Under his leadership, Marsh's International operations have been a strong contributor to Marsh's performance over the past 3 years. Alex has worked tirelessly to build a cohesive international team spanning several continents and he has a passion for the business that always takes into account what is in the best interest of Marsh & McLennan Companies. With more than 30 years in the insurance industry, 18 years at Marsh and before that, with AIG, Alex is an internationalist. He spent time in Latin America and Europe, as well as the United States, gaining invaluable experience and perspective needed to guide to lead Guy Carpenter as it focuses on the enormous potential of international growth.
I want to emphasize that our strong management team includes our colleagues within Mercer and Oliver Wyman, led by Michele and John. The entire senior management team will continue working together with a long-term focus driving performance. And before anyone asks, I couldn't be more engaged and energized about the company's prospects than I am today.
With that, let me turn it over to Vanessa to review our first quarter results in more detail."

I'm delighted to report that the financial performance of Marsh & McLennan Companies in the first quarter was strong. We achieved solid revenue growth and increased operating income in each of our operating co",847,"Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm delighted to report that the financial performance of Marsh & McLennan Companies in the first quarter was strong. We achieved solid revenue growth and increased operating income in each of our operating companies.
On a GAAP basis, earnings per share in the first quarter was $0.58, including $0.56 from continuing operations, discontinued operations of $0.02 related largely to Putnam. And it's important to note that our adjusted EPS equaled GAAP EPS from continuing operations. On an adjusted basis, first quarter EPS increased 10% to $0.56. First, let's go into a little more detail on our consolidated results. Unless specifically indicated, my references will be to underlying revenue, underlying expenses and adjusted operating income.
Investment income rose to $19 million from $8 million last year. In the second quarter, we anticipate a slight loss due to a mark-to-market declines in our private equity portfolio, which are recorded on a one quarter lag. In the first quarter, interest income rose to $7 million due to higher cash balances compared with last year and slightly higher interest rates. Interest expense decreased to $51 million in the fourth -- first quarter from $60 million a year ago due to the payment of a $550 million senior note last September.  Our next debt maturity is a $250 million note due in March of next year.
Let's turn to the results of our operations. In Risk and Insurance Services, both Marsh and Guy Carpenter contributed to strong revenue growth in the first quarter. Operating income increased 7% to $383 million. This growth in profitability was achieved despite higher pension costs and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. The euro and the British pound were weak, relative to the U.S. dollar in January, which is a major renewal period for Guy Carpenter and the largest period of profitability for Marsh's European operations. Had it not been for the effects of foreign exchange, Risk and Insurance Services would have achieved slight margin improvement instead of the slight decline.
Even taking this into account, Marsh had another solid quarter. Revenue rose 4% in the first quarter to $1.3 billion, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of growth. Every one of Marsh's major geographic operations experienced revenue growth in the quarter, with particularly strong growth in Asia-Pacific and Latin America. Additionally, U.S./Canada generated revenue growth of 3% for the third consecutive quarter, a real achievement considering the market conditions.
Turning to Reinsurance Broking. Guy Carpenter continued to build on its very strong performance in 2010. Revenue was $340 million, reflecting strong growth of 7% led by its International operations and global specialties. This quarter marks Carpenter's ninth consecutive quarter of revenue growth, reflecting continuing strong new business and high client retentions.
Our Consulting segment continued to generate strong revenue growth. In the first quarter, revenue rose 6% to $1.3 billion. Growth in operating expenses was 5%, including the impact of higher pension expense. Operating income rose 13%. Mercer's revenue increased 5% in the first quarter to $922 million, continuing its strong performance from the second half of last year. Within Retirement, revenue growth in EMEA, Asia-Pacific and Latin America was offset by declines in North America. Health and Benefits continued its outstanding performance, matching its 8% growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2010. All global regions showed strength, particularly the U.S., Latin America and Asia Pacific. 
Rewards, Talent & Communications produced double-digit revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter. This was due to continuing demand for Mercer's compensation surveys, as well as higher demands for consulting services in all major geographies. In the quarter, outsourcing revenue was negatively impacted by the loss of 2 clients due to M&A. The double-digit growth in Investment Consulting & Management continued a trend that has now extended for more than a year.
Oliver Wyman's 9% growth rate in this quarter was its highest since 2007. This impressive growth was led by a number of industry sectors that achieved double-digit increases, including healthcare, transportation and retail. Oliver Wyman's close management of operating expenses also contributed to excellent growth and operating income. Debt at the end of the first quarter was $3 billion, unchanged from year end. 
Average diluted shares rose due to 3 factors: one, acquisitions; two, an increase in common share equivalents due to a higher share price; and three, the normal vesting of equity awards. The increase was partially offset by share repurchases. 
Quarter-end's cash was $1.3 billion compared with $1.1 billion a year ago. Our cash utilization is typically greatest in the first quarter, primarily due to the payment of incentive compensation awards. Other major uses of cash in the first quarter included $120 million for acquisitions and dividend payments of $117 million. We delayed repurchasing shares due to our normal heavy cash uses in the first quarter. But now in the second quarter, with bonus payments behind us and the anticipation of a tax refund in June related to the Kroll disposition, we plan to resume repurchasing our shares. 
With that, let me turn it back to Brian."

Again, our success over many quarters has been focusing on driving value to clients. And this quarter is no exception.

Our competitors, we've had driven significant value to client that created new reinsurance opportunities. So there is no one specific trend, I think we've been executing very well on new business. In terms of RMS, it's not quite clear and certain how that's going to impact reinsurance purchasing or the industry as of yet. But we have been working very closely with all of our clients running a series of RMS and other vendor models to understand the changes and how they impact our clients and what specific trends there are. And we're starting to see a lot of the inland exposures being driven off in some of the peak zones, 15-plus percent. And so as renewals come up, we will certainly react to that, floor is the big one on June 1, and then we'll have others on 7, 1. So I think that's going to be a gradual impact as we look into the year."

So which company can help them on a global platform basis? Which company can drive product to them, which they could sell on to their customer base?

Our revenue retention level, which really is the revenue we get on accounts on sort of the same-store basis, has been increasing as well. And that is where you could see some mild stabilization of rates, some mild increases in exposure units and expanded new sales to existing customers.

The true story won't be told until next year. But similar to what Dan is saying, there are signs that rate reductions are starting to slow down, we still saw that in the first quarter on property cap and there will be a confluence of events. We've seen what happened in Japan. But as we see the earnings calls for reinsurers, many of them have increased their own estimates on what Japan means and what the expected loss is. So we have that coupled with RMS, coupled with the largest quarter catastrophes outside of the U.S. in the history of reinsurance. So, now all those confluence of events are going to have companies taking a hard look at how they're going to deploy their capital and how they are going to price the business going forward, so it's a very similar theme."

With regard to Specialty Consulting, clearly, there is a pent-up demand where people have taken an opportunity to step back in to their talent management space, especially, both in the United States and around the world. I just recently completed a trip that covered Mexico to Argentina and met with a number of CEOs and CFOs and CHR. Those Chief Human Resource Officers seek consistent demand from them, bar none, was Talent Management, talent advice around their workforce strategies, and so yes, they have taken their eye off of that for a while, as we will all weather in the great recession, but have moved back into that space."

I am Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me and presenting on the call today is Dan Glaser, Group President",687,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results as reported earlier today. I am Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me and presenting on the call today is Dan Glaser, Group President and Chief Operating Officer; and Vanessa Wittman, our CFO. Also, I'd like to welcome our operating companies' CEOs, Peter Zaffino of Marsh, Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter, Michele Burns of Mercer and John Drzik of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Mike Bischoff. 
Following my comments, Dan will discuss our operating results in more detail, Vanessa will then update you on our financial position. Let me begin by saying our second quarter results were outstanding and illustrate the excellent progress we have made over the past year. We reported a strong increase in revenue with growth of 12%, and growth was 5% on an underlying basis for the second quarter in a row. In fact, this is the fourth consecutive quarter that each of our operating companies produce revenue growth on both a reported and underlying basis. And we continue to achieve this growth while maintaining control over our operating expenses. As a result, we produced strong growth in adjusted operating income. In the first 6 months of this year, underlying revenue growth of 5% and adjusted underlying expense growth of 4% produced 13% growth in adjusted operating income, an excellent first half of the year. The positive momentum at Marsh continued this quarter with underlying revenue growth driven by new strong new business development and increased client revenue rates. Guy Carpenter also produced excellent underlying revenue growth as it has for 10 straight quarters. Mercer generated underlying revenue growth of mid-single digits for the fourth consecutive quarter, and Oliver Wyman string of solid revenue growth continued, driven by Financial Services, its largest industry sector. So as we look across the breadth of the company, we're very pleased with the performance of everyone of our operating companies. As you heard me say a number of time since our Investor Day last September, our plan is to establish Marsh & McLennan Companies as an elite business enterprise, valued by our clients, our colleagues and our shareholders. And we have articulated our growth strategy that will guide us in realizing this aspiration. Our strategy focuses on the characteristics that create exceptional value and superior returns for investors, sustained long-term growth in revenue and earnings per share, low capital requirements, high cash generation and reducing the risk profile of the company. Some of these pillars are interrelated. For example, our positive cash flow has allowed us within the past several quarters to increase our dividend, make attractive acquisitions and institute a share repurchase program. Our excess cash also allowed us to strengthen our balance sheet, which lowers the risk profile of the company. 
Another example of how we are developing into an elite organization is the articulation to our colleagues throughout the world about our corporate philosophy, which we referred to as the greater good. This philosophy is designed to assist our colleagues with respect to the legal, ethical and risk issues that may arise in the course of doing business. This enhanced approach reinforces our business standards as we operate globally. As part of this effort, we produced a documentary to creatively represent the essence of our corporate philosophy. We encourage you to visit our website to learn more about the Greater Good and to view the informative trailer for the award-winning film, titled: Basis of Marsh & McLennan. So you see we take produce it our 4 pillars of investment to the investor community 10 months ago. Not only are we producing strong results, we are implementing a variety of initiatives to better position the company for growth. 
In summary, our excellent performance in the first half of the year demonstrates the type of performance the senior leadership is striving for. Sustaining this performance over the long term should translate into outstanding results for our shareholders. And with that, let me turn it over to Dan to review our second quarter results in more detail."
473342,137363024,151190,"Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2011",2011-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm delighted to talk to you about the outstanding financial performance of our operating companies in the second quarter.

I'm delighted to talk to you about the outstanding financial performance of our operating companies in the second quarter. First, let's go into a little more detail on our consolidated operating results. We achieved solid revenue growth, an increase in adjusted operating income at each of our operating companies for the fourth consecutive quarter. This quarter, revenue increased 12% to $2.9 billion, and underlying revenue growth was 5%. We also produced a robust increase in adjusted operating income of 17%. 
Risk and Insurance Services revenue increased 11% to $1.6 billion with underlying revenue growth of 5%. Continued expense discipline held adjusted underlying expense growth to 3%. Adjusted operating income increased 16% to $352 million with Marsh and Guy Carpenter both contributing double-digit growth. And the adjusted operating margin increased 100 basis points to 21.7% reflecting higher margins at both operating companies. For the first half of the year, the adjusted operating margin for the segment increased sight slightly despite the effects of higher pension expense and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. 
Marsh had another strong quarter any way you look at it. Revenue increased 12% to $1.4 billion, and underlying revenue rose 5% marking the fifth consecutive quarter of growth. Every one of Marsh major geographic operations experienced underlying revenue growth in the quarter with particularly strong growth of 18% in Latin America. In fact, throughout Marsh's global operations, 27 countries produced underlying revenue growth that exceeded 10%. Additionally, U.S. Canada generated revenue growth of 3% for the fourth consecutive quarter. On a year-to-date basis, Marsh's growth rate slowed by 500 basis points compared with the first 6 months of last year, an impressive performance considering market conditions. Global new business development continues to be strong. In the second quarter, Marsh's new business was up 8% on an underlying basis with similar growth in both U.S., Canada and international operations. For the first 6 months, Marsh generated over $500 million in new business. And with disciplined expense control, the result is double-digit growth and adjusted operating income, not just for the quarter but the year-to-date as well. 
Now turning to reinsurance brokering. Guy Carpenter continues to build our last year's very strong performance. Revenue was $257 million reflecting the underlying growth of 5% led by global specialties, Latin America, Continental Europe and U.S. facultative reinsurance broking. Guy Carpenter had particularly strong revenue growth for sales of its new will or county weighted loss product. Over the last 2.5 years Carpenter has produced 10 consecutive quarters of underlying revenue growth. It was able to accomplish this through a continuing strong new business development and very high client retention. So in summary, Marsh and Guy Carpenter both produced strong financial results not only in the second quarter but throughout the first half of this year. 
Turning to our Consulting segment. I am pleased that our Consulting operations continued to generate strong revenue growth as well. In the second quarter, revenue rose 13% to $1.3 billion with underlying growth of 5%. Growth in adjusted underlying expenses was 4%. Adjusted operating income increased 21%, and year-to-date growth was 17%. And the Consulting adjusted margin rose 80 basis points in the current quarter. The impact of higher pension expense in the quarter was offset by a benefit of foreign currency translation. 
Mercer had a strong second quarter. Mercer's revenue increased 13% this quarter to $945 million, and underlying revenue growth was 4%. Mercer continued the solid performance we have seen over the past year. Within Retirement, growth in the U. K. and Latin America was offset by declines in the U.S. and Ireland. Health and Benefits continued its good performance with growth in all regions of the world and particular strength in the U.S., Latin America, Canada and Asia-Pacific. Rewards, Talent and Communications produced double-digit revenue growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. Outsourcing's underlying growth of 2% primarily reflecting growth in Australia, partially offset by a decline in the U.S. The 13% underlying revenue growth in investment consulting and management continued to trend at it extended for more than a year. Mercer has assets under management of $44 billion as of June 30. And Mercer produced margin improvement and double-digit growth in adjusted operating income. 
Oliver Wyman also had an excellent quarter, continuing to produce strong revenue growth with an increase of 14%. On an underlying basis, it's growth was 8%, which represents Oliver Wyman's sixth consecutive quarter of high single-digit revenue growth, an impressive performance. In the latest quarter, Oliver Wyman's growth was diversified with strong growth from its largest industry sector, Financial Services. It also had solid growth from the healthcare, manufacturing and transportation industry sectors. Oliver Wyman's close management of operating expenses also contributed to double-digit growth in adjusted operating income with a healthy increase in its margin. 
So in summary, we are very pleased with the performance of each of our operating companies, not only this quarter but also over the first 6 months of the year. In aggregate, our operating companies produced adjusted income growth of 17% for the quarter and 13% for the first half of the year, an excellent performance. Now let me turn it over to Vanessa."

As Brian and Dan have indicated, the financial performance at Marsh & McLennan Companies in the second quarter was very strong. We produced earnings per share of $0.50 in the second quarter on both the GAAP and adjusted basis. And despite the year-over-year decline in investment income of $24 million or $0.03 per share, the increase in adjusted EPS was 9%. We anticipated adjusted income in the third quarter to be a slight loss, similar to the third quarter of 2010. In the second quarter, net interest expense decreased to $44 million from $57 million a year ago. This was due to a slight increase in interest income and a substantial decrease in interest expense resulting from the payment of a $550 million debt obligation last September. 
On last quarter's call, we indicated we will be active in the second quarter with share repurchases. I'm pleased to report that we aggressively resumed our buyback program with the repurchase of nearly 8 million shares or $235 million. Combined with our buyback activity in last year's fourth quarter, we've used $320 million of our $500 million authorization, repurchasing a total of 11.2 shares. We plan to continue repurchasing our stock in the third quarter. 
When we analyzed our debt portfolio at the beginning of the year, we felt some changes would be warranted if market conditions afforded us an opportunity. In the second quarter, we took advantage of a significant decline in tenure corporate rates by tendering for a portion of our debt obligations. Although we have a small amounts due in 2012 and 2013, we chose to address the spike in our maturity ladder in 2014 and '15 when an aggregate of $1.4 billion would come in due within the 14-month period. In June, we initiated a tender offer for $250 million each of the 2014 and '15. The tender was oversubscribed, and in July, we reduced the $1.4 billion spike by $600 million. We brought in $330 million of the $650 million due in 2014 and $270 million of the $750 million maturing in 2015. Given our strong cash position, we funded the tender with $100 million of cash and a new issue 10-year note for $500 million. The coupon on the new note is that 4.8%. Cost of $73 million related to the early extinguishment of the debt from the tender offer will be recognized in the third quarter. We are very pleased with these transactions, which have lowered our refinancing in intermediate-term by expanding our maturities at a very attractive interest rate. Additionally, we'll see a reduction in our annual interest expense of $9 million. Our tax rate in the second quarter was 31%, reflecting our geographic mix of earnings. We continue to expect that the tax rates for the year will be approximately 31%. Quarter end cash was $1.7 billion compared with $1.5 billion a year ago. Debt at the end of the second quarter was $3 billion. Net debt, which is total debt less cash and cash equivalents was $1.4 billion compared with $2.1 billion at the end of the second quarter of last year. 
In summary, our financial position has continued to strengthen over the last 12 months. We prudently used the current environment of low interest rates to opportunistically reconfigure our capital structure, extend maturities of our debt portfolio, delever our balance sheet, trim ongoing interest expense and reduce our intermediate-term refinancing risks. With that, I'll turn the call back to Brian."

I am Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me and presenting on the call today is Dan Glaser, Group President and Chief Operating Officer; and Vanessa Wittman, our CFO. Also, I'd like to welcome our operating companies' CEOs, Peter Zaffino of Marsh, Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter, Michele Burns of Mercer and John Drzik of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Mike Bischoff. Following my comments, Dan will discuss our operating results in more detail. Vanessa will then update you on our financial position. 
Let me begin by saying our second quarter results were outstanding and illustrate the excellent progress we have made over the past year. We reported a strong increase in revenue with growth of 12%, and growth was 5% on an underlying basis for the second quarter in a row. In fact, this is the fourth consecutive quarter that each of our operating companies produce revenue growth on both a reported and an underlying basis. And we continue to achieve this growth while maintaining control over our operating expenses. As a result, we produced strong growth in adjusted operating income. In the first 6 months of this year, underlying revenue growth of 5% and adjusted underlying expense growth of 4% produced 13% growth in adjusted operating income, an excellent first half of the year. 
The positive momentum at Marsh continued this quarter with underlying revenue growth driven by new strong new business development and increased client revenue rates. Guy Carpenter also produced excellent underlying revenue growth as it has for 10 straight quarters. Mercer generated an underlying revenue growth of mid-single digits for the fourth consecutive quarter, and Oliver Wyman string of solid revenue growth continued, driven by Financial Services, its largest industry sector. So as we look across the breadth of the company, we're very pleased with the performance of everyone of our operating companies. 
As you've heard me say a number of times since our Investor Day last September, our plan is to establish Marsh & McLennan Companies as an elite business enterprise, valued by our clients, our colleagues and our shareholders. And we have articulated our growth strategy that will guide us in realizing this aspiration. Our strategy focuses on the characteristics that create exceptional value and superior returns for investors, sustained long-term growth in revenue and earnings per share, low capital requirements, high cash generation and reducing the risk profile of the company. Some of these pillars are interrelated. For example, our positive cash flow has allowed us within the past several quarters to increase our dividend, make attractive acquisitions and institute a share repurchase program. Our excess cash also allowed us to strengthen our balance sheet, which lowers the risk profile of the company. 
Another example of how we're developing into an elite organization is the articulation to our colleagues throughout the world of our corporate philosophy, which we refer to as the greater good. This philosophy is designed to assist our colleagues with respect to the legal, ethical and risk issues that may arise in the course of doing business. This enhanced approach reinforces our business standards as we operate globally. As part of this effort, we produced a documentary to creatively represent the essence of our corporate philosophy. We encourage you to visit our website to learn more about the greater good and to view the 4-minute trailer for the award-winning film entitled, Faces of Marsh & McLennan. 
So you see we take very seriously the 4 pillars we presented to the investment community 10 months ago. Not only are we producing strong results, we are implementing a variety of initiatives to better position the company for growth. 
In summary, our excellent performance in the first half of the year demonstrates the type of performance the senior leadership is striving for. Sustaining this performance over the long term should translate into outstanding results for our shareholders. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Dan to review our second quarter results in more detail."
473342,137363024,151429,"Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2011",2011-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm delighted to talk to you about the outstanding financial performance of our operating companies in the second quarter.

I'm delighted to talk to you about the outstanding financial performance of our operating companies in the second quarter. First, let's go into a little more detail on our consolidated operating results. We achieved solid revenue growth, an increase in adjusted operating income at each of our operating companies for the fourth consecutive quarter. This quarter, revenue increased 12% to $2.9 billion, and underlying revenue growth was 5%. We also produced a robust increase in adjusted operating income of 17%. 
Risk and Insurance Services revenue increased 11% to $1.6 billion with underlying revenue growth of 5%. Continued expense discipline held adjusted underlying expense growth to 3%. Adjusted operating income increased 16% to $352 million with Marsh and Guy Carpenter both contributing double-digit growth. And the adjusted operating margin increased 100 basis points to 21.7% reflecting higher margins at both operating companies. For the first half of the year, the adjusted operating margin for the segment increased slightly despite the effects of higher pension expense and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. 
Marsh had another strong quarter any way you look at it. Revenue increased 12% to $1.4 billion, and underlying revenue rose 5% marking the fifth consecutive quarter of growth. Every one of Marsh's major geographic operations experienced underlying revenue growth in the quarter with particularly strong growth of 18% in Latin America. In fact, throughout Marsh's global operations, 27 countries produced underlying revenue growth that exceeded 10%. Additionally, U.S. Canada generated revenue growth of 3% for the fourth consecutive quarter. On a year-to-date basis, Marsh's growth rate swung by 500 basis points compared with the first 6 months of last year, an impressive performance considering market conditions. Global new business development continues to be strong. In the second quarter, Marsh's new business was up 8% on an underlying basis with similar growth in both U.S., Canada and international operations. For the first 6 months, Marsh generated over $500 million in new business. And with disciplined expense control, the result is double-digit growth and adjusted operating income, not just for the quarter but the year-to-date as well. 
Now turning to reinsurance broking. Guy Carpenter continues to build our last year's very strong performance. Revenue was $257 million reflecting the underlying growth of 5% led by global specialties, Latin America, Continental Europe and U.S. facultative reinsurance broking. Guy Carpenter had a particularly solid revenue growth from sales of its new CWILP or county weighted index loss product. Over the last 2.5 years Carpenter has produced 10 consecutive quarters of underlying revenue growth. It was able to accomplish this through a continuing strong new business development and very high client retention. So in summary, Marsh and Guy Carpenter both produced strong financial results not only in the second quarter but throughout the first half of this year. 
Turning to our Consulting segment. I am pleased that our Consulting operations continued to generate strong revenue growth as well. In the second quarter, revenue rose 13% to $1.3 billion with underlying growth of 5%. Growth in adjusted underlying expenses was 4%. Adjusted operating income increased 21%, and year-to-date growth was 17%. And the Consulting adjusted margin rose 80 basis points in the current quarter. The impact of higher pension expense in the quarter was offset by a benefit from foreign currency translation. 
Mercer had a strong second quarter. Mercer's revenue increased 13% this quarter to $945 million, and underlying revenue growth was 4%. Mercer continued the solid performance we have seen over the past year. Within Retirement, growth in the U. K. and Latin America was offset by declines in the U.S. and Ireland. Health and Benefits continued its good performance with growth in all regions of the world and particular strength in the U.S., Latin America, Canada and Asia-Pacific. Rewards, Talent and Communications produced double-digit revenue growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. Outsourcing's underlying growth of 2% primarily reflecting growth in Australia, partially offset by a decline in the U.S. The 13% underlying revenue growth in investment consulting and management continue to trend that is extended for more than a year. Mercer has assets under management of $44 billion as of June 30. And Mercer produced margin improvement and double-digit growth in adjusted operating income. 
Oliver Wyman also had an excellent quarter, continuing to produce strong revenue growth with an increase of 14%. On an underlying basis, it's growth was 8%, which represents Oliver Wyman's sixth consecutive quarter of high single-digit revenue growth, an impressive performance. In the latest quarter, Oliver Wyman's growth was diversified with strong growth from its largest industry sector, Financial Services. It also had solid growth from the healthcare, manufacturing and transportation industry sectors. Oliver Wyman's close management of operating expenses also contributed to double-digit growth in adjusted operating income with a healthy increase in its margin. 
So in summary, we are very pleased with the performance of each of our operating companies, not only this quarter but also over the first 6 months of the year. In aggregate, our operating companies produced adjusted income growth of 17% for the quarter and 13% for the first half of the year, an excellent performance. 
Now let me turn it over to Vanessa."

As Brian and Dan have indicated, the financial performance at Marsh & McLennan Companies in the second quarter was very strong. We produced earnings per share of $0.50 in the second quarter on both the GAAP and adjusted basis. And despite the year-over-year decline in investment income of $24 million or $0.03 per share, the increase in adjusted EPS was 9%. We anticipate investment income in the third quarter to be a slight loss, similar to the third quarter of 2010. In the second quarter, net interest expense decreased to $44 million from $57 million a year ago. This was due to a slight increase in interest income and a substantial decrease in interest expense resulting from the payment of a $550 million debt obligation last September. 
On last quarter's call, we indicated we would be active in the second quarter with share repurchases. I'm pleased to report we aggressively resumed our buyback program with the repurchase of nearly 8 million shares for $235 million. Combined with our buyback activity in last year's fourth quarter, we've used $320 million of our $500 million authorization, repurchasing a total of 11.2 shares. We plan to continue repurchasing our stock in the third quarter. 
When we analyzed our debt portfolio at the beginning of the year, we felt some changes would be warranted if market conditions afforded us an opportunity. In the second quarter, we took advantage of a significant decline in tenure corporate rates by tendering for a portion of our debt obligations. Although we have a small amounts due in 2012 and 2013, we chose to address the spike in our maturity ladder in 2014 and '15 when an aggregate of $1.4 billion was coming due within a 14-month period. In June, we initiated a tender offer for $250 million each of the 2014 and '15. The tender was oversubscribed and in July, we reduced the $1.4 billion spike by $600 million. We brought in $330 million of the $650 million due in 2014 and $270 million of the $750 million maturing in 2015. 
Given our strong cash position, we funded the tender with $100 million of cash and a new issue 10-year note for $500 million. The coupon on the new note is 4.8%. Cost of $73 million related to the early extinguishment of the debt from the tender offer will be recognized in the third quarter. We are very pleased with these transactions, which have lowered our refinancing in intermediate-term by extending our maturities at a very attractive interest rate. Additionally, we'll see a reduction in our annual interest expense of $9 million. 
Our tax rate in the second quarter was 31%, reflecting our geographic mix of earnings. We continue to expect that the tax rates for the year will be approximately 31%. Quarter end cash was $1.7 billion compared with $1.5 billion a year ago. Debt at the end of the second quarter was $3 billion. Net debt, which is total debt less cash and cash equivalents was $1.4 billion compared with $2.1 billion at the end of the second quarter of last year. 
In summary, our financial position has continued to strengthen over the last 12 months. We prudently used the current environment of low interest rates to opportunistically reconfigure our capital structure, extend maturities of our debt portfolio, delever our balance sheet, trim ongoing interest expense and reduce our intermediate-term refinancing risks. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Brian."

And we also have an acquisition strategy to complement what our current portfolio looks like either from a segmentation or geographical standpoint. So while there's activity, we will absolutely stick to our strategy and drive growth in acquisitions that fit what we've outlined in the past."

I am Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me and presenting on the call today is Dan Glaser, Group President and Chief Operating Officer; and Vanessa Wittman, our CFO. Also, I'd like to welcome our operating companies' CEOs, Peter Zaffino of Marsh, Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter, Michele Burns of Mercer and John Drzik of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Mike Bischoff. Following my comments, Dan will discuss our operating results in more detail. Vanessa will then update you on our financial position. 
Let me begin by saying our second quarter results were outstanding and illustrate the excellent progress we have made over the past year. We reported a strong increase in revenue with growth of 12%, and growth was 5% on an underlying basis for the second quarter in a row. In fact, this is the fourth consecutive quarter that each of our operating companies produced revenue growth on both a reported and an underlying basis. And we continue to achieve this growth while maintaining control over our operating expenses. As a result, we produced strong growth in adjusted operating income. In the first 6 months of this year, underlying revenue growth of 5% and adjusted underlying expense growth of 4% produced 13% growth in adjusted operating income, an excellent first half of the year. 
The positive momentum at Marsh continued this quarter with underlying revenue growth driven by strong new business development and increased client revenue rates. Guy Carpenter also produced excellent underlying revenue growth as it has for 10 straight quarters. Mercer generated an underlying revenue growth of mid-single digits for the fourth consecutive quarter, and Oliver Wyman’s string of solid revenue growth continued, driven by Financial Services, its largest industry sector. So as we look across the breadth of the company, we're very pleased with the performance of every one of our operating companies. 
As you've heard me say a number of times since our Investor Day last September, our plan is to establish Marsh & McLennan Companies as an elite business enterprise, valued by our clients, our colleagues and our shareholders. And we have articulated our growth strategy that will guide us in realizing this aspiration. Our strategy focuses on the characteristics that create exceptional value and superior returns for investors: sustained long-term growth in revenue and earnings per share, low capital requirements, high cash generation and reducing the risk profile of the company. Some of these pillars are interrelated. For example, our positive cash flow has allowed us within the past several quarters to increase our dividend, make attractive acquisitions and institute a share repurchase program. Our excess cash also allowed us to strengthen our balance sheet, which lowers the risk profile of the company. 
Another example of how we're evolving into an elite organization is the articulation to our colleagues throughout the world of our corporate philosophy, which we refer to as The Greater Good. This philosophy is designed to assist our colleagues with respect to the legal, ethical and risk issues that may arise in the course of doing business. This enhanced approach reinforces our business standards as we operate globally. As part of this effort, we produced a documentary to creatively represent the essence of our corporate philosophy. We encourage you to visit our website to learn more about The Greater Good and to view the 4-minute trailer for the award-winning film entitled, Faces of Marsh & McLennan. 
So you see we take very seriously the 4 pillars we presented to the investment community 10 months ago. Not only are we producing strong results, we are implementing a variety of initiatives to better position the company for growth. 
In summary, our excellent performance in the first half of the year demonstrates the type of performance the senior leadership is striving for. Sustaining this performance over the long term should translate into outstanding results for our shareholders.  
And with that, let me turn it over to Dan to review our second quarter results in more detail."
473342,137363024,151459,"Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2011",2011-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm delighted to talk to you about the outstanding financial performance of our operating companies in the second quarter. First, let's go into a little more detail on our consolidated operating results. We ac",867,"Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm delighted to talk to you about the outstanding financial performance of our operating companies in the second quarter. First, let's go into a little more detail on our consolidated operating results. We achieved solid revenue growth and increased adjusted operating income at each of our operating companies for the fourth consecutive quarter. This quarter, revenue increased 12% to $2.9 billion, and underlying revenue growth was 5%. We also produced a robust increase in adjusted operating income of 17%. 
Risk and Insurance Services revenue increased 11% to $1.6 billion with underlying revenue growth of 5%. Continued expense discipline held adjusted underlying expense growth to 3%. Adjusted operating income increased 16% to $352 million with Marsh and Guy Carpenter both contributing double-digit growth. And the adjusted operating margin increased 100 basis points to 21.7%, reflecting higher margins at both operating companies. For the first half of the year, the adjusted operating margin for the segment increased slightly despite the effects of higher pension expense and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. 
Marsh had another strong quarter any way you look at it. Revenue increased 12% to $1.4 billion, and underlying revenue rose 5% marking the fifth consecutive quarter of growth. Every one of Marsh's major geographic operations experienced underlying revenue growth in the quarter with particularly strong growth of 18% in Latin America. In fact, throughout Marsh's global operations, 27 countries produced underlying revenue growth that exceeded 10%. Additionally, U.S. Canada generated revenue growth of 3% for the fourth consecutive quarter. On a year-to-date basis, Marsh's growth rate swung by 500 basis points compared with the first 6 months of last year, an impressive performance considering market conditions. Global new business development continues to be strong. In the second quarter, Marsh's new business was up 8% on an underlying basis with similar growth in both its U.S./Canada and international operations. For the first 6 months, Marsh generated over $500 million in new business. And with disciplined expense control, the result is double-digit growth in adjusted operating income, not just for the quarter but the year-to-date as well. 
Now turning to reinsurance broking. Guy Carpenter continues to build on last year's very strong performance. Revenue was $257 million, reflecting the underlying growth of 5% led by global specialties, Latin America, Continental Europe and U.S. facultative reinsurance broking. Guy Carpenter had particularly solid revenue growth from sales of its new CWILP or county weighted index loss product. Over the last 2.5 years, Carpenter has produced 10 consecutive quarters of underlying revenue growth. It was able to accomplish this through continuing strong new business development and very high client retention. So in summary, Marsh and Guy Carpenter both produced strong financial results not only in the second quarter but throughout the first half of this year. 
Turning to our Consulting segment. I am pleased that our Consulting operations continued to generate strong revenue growth as well. In the second quarter, revenue rose 13% to $1.3 billion with underlying growth of 5%. Growth in adjusted underlying expenses was 4%. Adjusted operating income increased 21%, and year-to-date growth was 17%. And the Consulting adjusted margin rose 80 basis points in the current quarter. The impact of higher pension expense in the quarter was offset by a benefit from foreign currency translation. 
Mercer had a strong second quarter. Mercer's revenue increased 13% this quarter to $945 million, and underlying revenue growth was 4%. Mercer continued the solid performance we have seen over the past year. Within Retirement, growth in the U. K. and Latin America was offset by declines in the U.S. and Ireland. Health and Benefits continued its good performance with growth in all regions of the world and particular strength in the U.S., Latin America, Canada and Asia-Pacific. Rewards, Talent and Communications produced double-digit revenue growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. Outsourcing's underlying growth of 2% primarily reflected growth in Australia, partially offset by a decline in the U.S. The 13% underlying revenue growth in investment consulting and management continued a trend that is extended for more than a year. Mercer has assets under management of $44 billion as of June 30. And Mercer produced margin improvement and double-digit growth in adjusted operating income. 
Oliver Wyman also had an excellent quarter, continuing to produce strong revenue growth with an increase of 14%. On an underlying basis, its growth was 8%, which represents Oliver Wyman's sixth consecutive quarter of high single-digit revenue growth, an impressive performance. In the latest quarter, Oliver Wyman's growth was diversified with strong growth from its largest industry sector, Financial Services. It also had solid growth from the healthcare, manufacturing and transportation industry sectors. Oliver Wyman's close management of operating expenses also contributed to double-digit growth in adjusted operating income with a healthy increase in its margin. 
So in summary, we are very pleased with the performance of each of our operating companies, not only this quarter but also over the first 6 months of the year. In aggregate, our operating companies produced adjusted income growth of 17% for the quarter and 13% for the first half of the year, an excellent performance. 
Now let me turn it over to Vanessa."

As Brian and Dan have indicated, the financial performance at Marsh & McLennan Companies in the second quarter was very strong.

As Brian and Dan have indicated, the financial performance at Marsh & McLennan Companies in the second quarter was very strong. We produced earnings per share of $0.50 in the second quarter on both a GAAP and adjusted basis. And despite the year-over-year decline in investment income of $24 million or $0.03 per share, the increase in adjusted EPS was 9%. We anticipate investment income in the third quarter to be a slight loss, similar to the third quarter of 2010. In the second quarter, net interest expense decreased to $44 million from $57 million a year ago. This was due to a slight increase in interest income and a substantial decrease in interest expense resulting from the payment of a $550 million debt obligation last September. 
On last quarter's call, we indicated we would be active in the second quarter with share repurchases. I'm pleased to report we aggressively resumed our buyback program with the repurchase of nearly 8 million shares for $235 million. Combined with our buyback activity in last year's fourth quarter, we've used $320 million of our $500 million authorization, repurchasing a total of 11.2 million shares. We plan to continue repurchasing our stock in the third quarter. 
When we analyzed our debt portfolio at the beginning of the year, we felt some changes would be warranted if market conditions afforded us an opportunity. In the second quarter, we took advantage of a significant decline in 10-year corporate rates by tendering for a portion of our debt obligations. Although we have small amounts due in 2012 and 2013, we chose to address the spike in our maturity ladder in 2014 and '15 when an aggregate of $1.4 billion was coming due within a 14-month period. In June, we initiated a tender offer for $250 million each of the 2014s and '15s. The tender was oversubscribed, and in July, we reduced the $1.4 billion spike by $600 million. We brought in $330 million of the $650 million due in 2014 and $270 million of the $750 million maturing in 2015. 
Given our strong cash position, we funded the tender with $100 million of cash and a new issue 10-year note for $500 million. The coupon on the new note is 4.8%. Costs of $73 million related to the early extinguishment of the debt from the tender offer will be recognized in the third quarter. We are very pleased with these transactions, which have lowered our refinancing in intermediate-term by extending our maturities at a very attractive interest rate. Additionally, we'll see a reduction in our annual interest expense of $9 million. 
Our tax rate in the second quarter was 31%, reflecting our geographic mix of earnings. We continue to expect that the tax rate for the year will be approximately 31%. Quarter end cash was $1.7 billion compared with $1.5 billion a year ago. Debt at the end of the second quarter was $3 billion. Net debt, which is total debt less cash and cash equivalents, was $1.4 billion compared with $2.1 billion at the end of the second quarter of last year. 
In summary, our financial position has continued to strengthen over the last 12 months. We prudently used the current environment of low interest rates to opportunistically reconfigure our capital structure, extend maturities of our debt portfolio, delever our balance sheet, trim ongoing interest expense and reduce our intermediate-term refinancing risk. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Brian."

I am Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me and presenting on the call today is Dan Glaser, Group President and Chief Operating Officer; and Vanessa Wittman, our CFO. Also, I'd like to welcome our operating companies' CEOs, Peter Zaffino of Marsh, Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter, Michele Burns of Mercer and John Drzik of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Mike Bischoff. Following my comments, Dan will discuss our operating results in more detail. Vanessa will then update you on our financial position. 
Let me begin by saying our second quarter results were outstanding and illustrate the excellent progress we have made over the past year. We reported a strong increase in revenue with growth of 12%, and growth was 5% on an underlying basis for the second quarter in a row. In fact, this is the fourth consecutive quarter that each of our operating companies produced revenue growth on both a reported and an underlying basis. And we continue to achieve this growth while maintaining control over our operating expenses. As a result, we produced strong growth in adjusted operating income. In the first 6 months of this year, underlying revenue growth of 5% and adjusted underlying expense growth of 4% produced 13% growth in adjusted operating income, an excellent first half of the year. 
The positive momentum at Marsh continued this quarter with underlying revenue growth driven by strong new business development and increased client revenue rates. Guy Carpenter also produced excellent underlying revenue growth as it has for 10 straight quarters. Mercer generated an underlying revenue growth of mid-single digits for the fourth consecutive quarter, and Oliver Wyman’s string of solid revenue growth continued, driven by Financial Services, its largest industry sector. So as we look across the breadth of the company, we're very pleased with the performance of every one of our operating companies. 
As you've heard me say a number of times since our Investor Day last September, our plan is to establish Marsh & McLennan Companies as an elite business enterprise, valued by our clients, our colleagues and our shareholders. And we have articulated our growth strategy that will guide us in realizing this aspiration. Our strategy focuses on the characteristics that create exceptional value and superior returns for investors: sustained long-term growth in revenue and earnings per share, low capital requirements, high cash generation and reducing the risk profile of the company. Some of these pillars are interrelated. For example, our positive cash flow has allowed us within the past several quarters to increase our dividend, make attractive acquisitions and institute a share repurchase program. Our excess cash also allowed us to strengthen our balance sheet, which lowers the risk profile of the company. 
Another example of how we're evolving into an elite organization is the articulation to our colleagues throughout the world of our corporate philosophy, which we refer to as The Greater Good. This philosophy is designed to assist our colleagues with respect to the legal, ethical and risk issues that may arise in the course of doing business. This enhanced approach reinforces our business standards as we operate globally. As part of this effort, we produced a documentary to creatively represent the essence of our corporate philosophy. We encourage you to visit our website to learn more about The Greater Good and to view the 4-minute trailer for the award-winning film entitled, Faces of Marsh & McLennan. 
So you see we take very seriously the 4 pillars we presented to the investment community 10 months ago. Not only are we producing strong results, we are implementing a variety of initiatives to better position the company for growth. 
In summary, our excellent performance in the first half of the year demonstrates the type of performance the senior leadership is striving for. Sustaining this performance over the long term should translate into outstanding results for our shareholders.  
And with that, let me turn it over to Dan to review our second quarter results in more detail."

I'm delighted to talk to you about the outstanding financial performance of our operating companies in the second quarter. First, let's go into a little more detail on our consolidated operating results. We achieved solid revenue growth and increased adjusted operating income at each of our operating companies for the fourth consecutive quarter. This quarter, revenue increased 12% to $2.9 billion, and underlying revenue growth was 5%. We also produced a robust increase in adjusted operating income of 17%. 
Risk and Insurance Services revenue increased 11% to $1.6 billion with underlying revenue growth of 5%. Continued expense discipline held adjusted underlying expense growth to 3%. Adjusted operating income increased 16% to $352 million with Marsh and Guy Carpenter both contributing double-digit growth. And the adjusted operating margin increased 100 basis points to 21.7%, reflecting higher margins at both operating companies. For the first half of the year, the adjusted operating margin for the segment increased slightly despite the effects of higher pension expense and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. 
Marsh had another strong quarter any way you look at it. Revenue increased 12% to $1.4 billion, and underlying revenue rose 5% marking the fifth consecutive quarter of growth. Every one of Marsh's major geographic operations experienced underlying revenue growth in the quarter with particularly strong growth of 18% in Latin America. In fact, throughout Marsh's global operations, 27 countries produced underlying revenue growth that exceeded 10%. Additionally, U.S. Canada generated revenue growth of 3% for the fourth consecutive quarter. On a year-to-date basis, Marsh's growth rate swung by 500 basis points compared with the first 6 months of last year, an impressive performance considering market conditions. Global new business development continues to be strong. In the second quarter, Marsh's new business was up 8% on an underlying basis with similar growth in both its U.S./Canada and international operations. For the first 6 months, Marsh generated over $500 million in new business. And with disciplined expense control, the result is double-digit growth in adjusted operating income, not just for the quarter but the year-to-date as well. 
Now turning to reinsurance broking. Guy Carpenter continues to build on last year's very strong performance. Revenue was $257 million, reflecting the underlying growth of 5% led by global specialties, Latin America, Continental Europe and U.S. facultative reinsurance broking. Guy Carpenter had particularly solid revenue growth from sales of its new CWILP or county weighted index loss product. Over the last 2.5 years, Carpenter has produced 10 consecutive quarters of underlying revenue growth. It was able to accomplish this through continuing strong new business development and very high client retention. So in summary, Marsh and Guy Carpenter both produced strong financial results not only in the second quarter but throughout the first half of this year. 
Turning to our Consulting segment. I am pleased that our Consulting operations continued to generate strong revenue growth as well. In the second quarter, revenue rose 13% to $1.3 billion with underlying growth of 5%. Growth in adjusted underlying expenses was 4%. Adjusted operating income increased 21%, and year-to-date growth was 17%. And the Consulting adjusted margin rose 80 basis points in the current quarter. The impact of higher pension expense in the quarter was offset by a benefit from foreign currency translation. 
Mercer had a strong second quarter. Mercer's revenue increased 13% this quarter to $945 million, and underlying revenue growth was 4%. Mercer continued the solid performance we have seen over the past year. Within Retirement, growth in the U. K. and Latin America was offset by declines in the U.S. and Ireland. Health and Benefits continued its good performance with growth in all regions of the world and particular strength in the U.S., Latin America, Canada and Asia-Pacific. Rewards, Talent and Communications produced double-digit revenue growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. Outsourcing's underlying growth of 2% primarily reflected growth in Australia, partially offset by a decline in the U.S. The 13% underlying revenue growth in investment consulting and management continued a trend that is extended for more than a year. Mercer has assets under management of $44 billion as of June 30. And Mercer produced margin improvement and double-digit growth in adjusted operating income. 
Oliver Wyman also had an excellent quarter, continuing to produce strong revenue growth with an increase of 14%. On an underlying basis, its growth was 8%, which represents Oliver Wyman's sixth consecutive quarter of high single-digit revenue growth, an impressive performance. In the latest quarter, Oliver Wyman's growth was diversified with strong growth from its largest industry sector, Financial Services. It also had solid growth from the healthcare, manufacturing and transportation industry sectors. Oliver Wyman's close management of operating expenses also contributed to double-digit growth in adjusted operating income with a healthy increase in its margin. 
So in summary, we are very pleased with the performance of each of our operating companies, not only this quarter but also over the first 6 months of the year. In aggregate, our operating companies produced adjusted income growth of 17% for the quarter and 13% for the first half of the year, an excellent performance. 
Now let me turn it over to Vanessa."

As Brian and Dan have indicated, the financial performance at Marsh & McLennan Companies in the second quarter was very strong.

As Brian and Dan have indicated, the financial performance at Marsh & McLennan Companies in the second quarter was very strong. We produced earnings per share of $0.50 in the second quarter on both a GAAP and adjusted basis. And despite the year-over-year decline in investment income of $24 million or $0.03 per share, the increase in adjusted EPS was 9%. We anticipate investment income in the third quarter to be a slight loss, similar to the third quarter of 2010. In the second quarter, net interest expense decreased to $44 million from $57 million a year ago. This was due to a slight increase in interest income and a substantial decrease in interest expense resulting from the payment of a $550 million debt obligation last September. 
On last quarter's call, we indicated we would be active in the second quarter with share repurchases. I'm pleased to report we aggressively resumed our buyback program with the repurchase of nearly 8 million shares for $235 million. Combined with our buyback activity in last year's fourth quarter, we've used $320 million of our $500 million authorization, repurchasing a total of 11.2 million shares. We plan to continue repurchasing our stock in the third quarter. 
When we analyzed our debt portfolio at the beginning of the year, we felt some changes would be warranted if market conditions afforded us an opportunity. In the second quarter, we took advantage of a significant decline in 10-year corporate rates by tendering for a portion of our debt obligations. Although we have small amounts due in 2012 and 2013, we chose to address the spike in our maturity ladder in 2014 and '15 when an aggregate of $1.4 billion was coming due within a 14-month period. In June, we initiated a tender offer for $250 million each of the 2014s and '15s. The tender was oversubscribed, and in July, we reduced the $1.4 billion spike by $600 million. We brought in $330 million of the $650 million due in 2014 and $270 million of the $750 million maturing in 2015. 
Given our strong cash position, we funded the tender with $100 million of cash and a new issue 10-year note for $500 million. The coupon on the new note is 4.8%. Costs of $73 million related to the early extinguishment of the debt from the tender offer will be recognized in the third quarter. We are very pleased with these transactions, which have lowered our refinancing in intermediate-term by extending our maturities at a very attractive interest rate. Additionally, we'll see a reduction in our annual interest expense of $9 million. 
Our tax rate in the second quarter was 31%, reflecting our geographic mix of earnings. We continue to expect that the tax rate for the year will be approximately 31%. Quarter end cash was $1.7 billion compared with $1.5 billion a year ago. Debt at the end of the second quarter was $3 billion. Net debt, which is total debt less cash and cash equivalents, was $1.4 billion compared with $2.1 billion at the end of the second quarter of last year. 
In summary, our financial position has continued to strengthen over the last 12 months. We prudently used the current environment of low interest rates to opportunistically reconfigure our capital structure, extend maturities of our debt portfolio, delever our balance sheet, trim ongoing interest expense and reduce our intermediate-term refinancing risk. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Brian."

As a matter of fact, for the overall organization of Marsh, this is the second best quarter we've had in the last 5 years in new business. So it's a combination of very strong retentions, although I think they've remained fairly stable. We have had strong new business and really are executing much better than we have in the past. This is something that's been an evolution process. But Dan's leadership from 18 to 24 months ago of implementing winning at Marsh has derived a much stronger pipeline for us.

So there's been some increase in numbers of people, as well as a little -- a smaller increase in compensation.

I'm Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is Dan Glaser, Group President and COO; and Vanessa Wittman, our CFO. Also, I'd like to welcome our operating companies CEO, Peter Zaffino of Marsh; Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter; and John Drzik of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Mike Bischoff. Following my comments, Dan will discuss our operating results in more detail, Vanessa will then update you on our financial position. 
Before we begin our discussions of the third quarter, I'd like to take a moment to recognize and thank Michele Burns for her many contributions to our company over the last 5 years. Michele became Mercer’s CEO in 2006 and led Mercer to a period of growth despite severe turbulence in the global economy. Last month, we announced that Michele has accepted a new role to build and lead a retirement policy center. I believe this center has potential of making a major contribution for finding solutions that address the retirement issues facing the United States. I'm excited that Michele has agreed to take on the challenge of leading this effort. We announced searching for a new CEO of Mercer and until the successor is named, Dan will be overseeing Mercer’s operations. 
Now let's move to our third quarter law results, which reflect our ongoing strong performance. We generated revenue growth of 11%. On an underlying basis, revenue growth was 5%, and we continue to achieve this growth while maintaining effective control over our operating expenses. This led to an increase in operating income of 30% and growth in adjusted operating income of 18%. 
Let's turn to our operating companies. The positive momentum at Marsh continued this quarter, with underlying revenue growth across all geographies driven by higher client revenue retention rates and new business development. Guy Carpenter also generated impressive results, continuing its trend of producing quarterly underlying revenue growth, which has expanded over the past 3 years. Mercer produced underlying revenue growth of mid-single digits as it has over the past years. Oliver Wyman's strong revenue growth continued reflecting broad-based growth across its major industry sectors. So throughout Marsh & McLennan Companies  we've seen revenue increases and higher levels of profitability. This record of performance is very much in keeping with the goals we articulated at Investor Day in September of 2010. It's not been more than a year since then, so I think it's appropriate to step back and look at the progress the company has made. We're implementing our plan to establish Marsh & McLennan Companies as an elite, global growth company, valued by clients, our colleagues and shareholders. We articulated the strategy of focusing on 4 pillars: growth and revenue and earnings per share, low capital requirements, high cash generation and reducing the risk profile of the company. 
As you look at our performance since Investor Day, the achievements are evident. Over the last 4 quarters, the company has produced underlying revenue growth of 5%, and I'm pleased that each of the operating companies contributed to that achievement. Marsh grew by 5%; Carpenter, 5%; Mercer, 4%; and Oliver Wyman grew 9%. Our goal is to produce underlying revenue growth, while maintaining expense discipline, thereby generating at least 10% organic growth and adjusted operating income over the long term. I'm pleased to report that we are achieving our goals. We have produced revenue growth across the entire enterprise. We have continued to make investments for future growth. And we've done this by limiting -- while limiting our adjusted underlying expense growth to 4%. As a result, I'm very pleased that over the last 4 quarters, Marsh & McLennan Companies generated organic growth and adjusted operating income of 13%, an outstanding performance. This earnings growth combined with our dividend yield of 3% is a very attractive result for our investors and in keeping with the goals we articulated at Investor Day more than a year ago. 
Additionally, we've continued to maintain low capital requirements and generated high levels of cash. Operational changes throughout the organization, we believe, have lowered the companies risk profile. Our financial position has strengthened during this period as well, which we'll discuss in a few minutes. As we move forward, we remain committed to focusing on profitable growth and prudent redeployment of our excess cash flow in order to produce outstanding long-term returns for our shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Dan to review our third quarter results in more detail."

Marsh & McLennan Companies continued its strong performance in the third quarter. We generated underlying revenue growth that was consistent prior periods with impressive growth in both operating income and adjusted operating income. 
Let me go into a little more detail on our operating results. In the third quarter, we achieved revenue growth and increased adjusted operating income at each of our operating companies as we have for each quarter over the past year. In the quarter, revenue rose 11% to $2.8 billion, while underlying revenue growth was 5%. Adjusted operating income increased 18%. Risk and Insurance Services revenue was up 11% to $1.5 billion with underlying revenue growth of 5%. And with ongoing effective expense management, adjusted operating income increased 13% to $186 million. The adjusted operating margin increased 20 basis points, reflecting slightly higher margins at both of Marsh and Guy Carpenter. This is also indicative of the segment's performance year-to-date where the margin has increased to 19.5% despite the effects of higher pension expense. 
Marsh had another strong quarter. Revenue increased 12% to $1.2 billion. Underlying revenue rose 6%. Marsh's high client revenue retention rate and new business development produced underlying revenue growth across all geographies, led by strong growth in Asia-Pacific and Latin America of 13%. In the U.S. Canada division, underlying revenue growth was 3% for the fifth consecutive quarter. Marsh has maintained its disciplined expense control, while still being able to invest in the future, refine its operating model and absorb higher severance and pension expense. As a result, Marsh produced double-digit growth in adjusted operating income, not just for the quarter, but for the year-to-date as well. 
In August, we announced a significant expansion of our South African operations with the signing of an agreement to acquire the insurance broking business of Alexander Forbes. The transaction is scheduled to close by year end. 
Now turning to reinsurance broking. Guy Carpenter continued to produce strong results. Revenue increased 8% to $251 million with underlying growth of 3%. This growth was led by its international operations, reflecting the successful execution of its long-term business strategy. Over the last 3 years, Carpenter has consistently produced quarterly underlying revenue growth. It has been able to accomplish this through strong new business development and high client retention. So in summary, both March and Guy Carpenter produced strong financial results, not only in the third quarter but for the 9 months as well. 
Turning to our Consulting segment. Our operations continued to generate strong revenue growth. In the third quarter, revenue rose 11% to $1.3 billion with underlying growth of 6%. Growth in adjusted underlying expenses was 5%, which resulted in a 50 basis point increase in the adjusted operating margin for the quarter. Growth in adjusted operating income was 17%, not only for the third quarter but for the year as well with both Mercer and Oliver Wyman contributing to this strong growth. Mercer continued the solid performance we've seen over the past year. Revenue in the third quarter increased 11% to $975 million, and underlying revenue growth was 4% with all geographic regions contributing to this growth. Consistent with the revenue trends we've seen in Mercer’s line of business over the past year, retirements saw underlying revenue decline modestly. Health and Benefits had a fine performance with an underlying increase of 7%, driven by strong growth in the U.S. and Asia-Pacific. Rewards, Talent and Communications produced double-digit underlying revenue growth for the fifth consecutive quarter. Outsourcing generated underlying growth of 1%, reflecting growth in Asia-Pacific partially offset by a decline in the United States. And investment consulting management produced underlying growth of 10% with strong growth in the U.S. and EMEA. Oliver Wyman also had a good quarter with an increase in revenue of 13%. Underlying revenue growth was 9%. This growth was diversified with the strongest growth coming from the healthcare and consumer industry sectors. Oliver Wyman expense management also contributed to the solid increase in adjusted operating income. 
In summary, we are very pleased with the excellent performance of each of our operating companies, not only this quarter but throughout the entire year, both from a revenue and earnings growth standpoint. Now let me make several comments regarding how the increased economic uncertainty that developed in the summer, particularly in Europe may impact our near-term results. Oliver Wyman is our most economically sensitive operating company. We've seen some clients in the financial services sector defer decisions on new engagements, thus making it difficult for Oliver Wyman to generate growth in the fourth quarter resulting in a modest impact of the segments profitability. Currently, overall client interest remains high, and the pipeline going into 2012 looks encouraging. However, there is a high degree of uncertainty, so that's 0W. At Mercer, all signs indicate that the positive trends experienced in the first 9 months of the year are continuing, and we feel that any near-term economic uncertainty is not impacting our Risk and Insurance Services segment. So notwithstanding near-term economic issues, we believe we are on target to have a very successful year and remain optimistic as we develop our strategy and business plans for 2012. With that, let me turn it over to Vanessa."

On a GAAP basis, net income was $130 million or $0.24 per share. Adjusted earnings per share was also $0.24. Costs of $72 million related to the early extinguishment of debt from the tender offer are highlighted on a separate line in this quarter's income statement. This expense is reflected in both our GAAP EPS and our adjusted EPS. I should also note that our a GAAP and adjusted earnings are almost identical for the 9-month period as well. Operating income totaled $1.247 billion, and adjusted operating income was $1.252 billion. As a result, GAAP earnings per share continuing operations year-to-date was $1.30, and adjusted earnings per share also totaled $1.30. 
Now let me add some color regarding other items, including our recent financing activities. In the third quarter, interest expense decreased to $49 million from $60 million a year ago. This level of quarterly interest expense is a reasonable indicator of the run rate we expect going forward. Several actions taken over the past 12 months substantially reduced our interest expense. First was the payment of a $550 million debt obligation in September 2010. Next, in July of this year, we took advantage of interest rate environment for a tender refinancing effort to  extend our majority of the latter and reduce our aggregate interest expense. We had $1.4 billion of debt coming due in 2014 and 2015, and we successfully tendered for $600 million of these bonds. We funded the tender with $ 100 million dollars of cash and a new 10-year note for $500 million with a coupon of 4.8%. We are very pleased with these transactions, which allowed us to opportunistically refine our capital structure, lower our refinancing risks in the intermediate term, extend maturities of our debt portfolio at a very attractive interest rate and delever our balance sheet. In total, the actions taken over the past year reduced our annual interest expense by $45 million. 
Turning to investment income, in the third quarter, investment income was essentially 0 compared with a $2 million loss in last year's third quarter. Due to a decline in the equity markets in the third quarter, we anticipate reporting an investment loss of approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter. 
Moving on to share repurchase. Since beginning our share repurchase program in last year's the fourth quarter, the company has repurchased a total of 15.6 million shares at a cost of $447 million, including 4.4 million shares that were purchased in the third quarter. In August, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the share repurchase program to $1 billion from $500 million. 
Looking at taxes. Our adjusted tax rate this quarter increased to 32.7%. This compares with 30.4% in last year's third quarter. A drop in the U.K. statutory tax rate reduced the value of our U.K. net deferred tax assets, which was fully reflected this quarter. This change in the U.K. tax law put upward pressure on our adjusted tax rate in the third quarter but will slightly benefit our overall tax position going forward. The higher tax rate in the current quarter also reflects a slight shift in the geographic mix of earnings. While there may be volatility in our tax rate from quarter to quarter, we still feel that for modeling purposes, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate of approximately 31% over the next year. Due to our high cash generation, we were able to redeploy our cash in the third quarter in a number of ways, including a $126 million per share repurchase, $123 million for dividend, $100 million to reduce long-term debt, $72 million for the early debt repayment and $21 million for acquisitions. This effective redeployment of capital will also contribute to our future growth in earnings per share. And despite all of these actions, our cash position increased $55 million during the third quarter. Debt at the end of the third quarter was $2.9 billion. We have a $250 million note due March 15, 2012, which is our only debt coming due in 2012. Last month, we took advantage of favorable conditions in the credit market, and we're able to close a new $1 billion, 5-year revolving credit facility to replace our existing $1 billion, 3-year credit facility that was due to expire next year.

Maybe you could talk about that in the context of the margin. It seems Oliver Wyman probably has a lot higher margin with the revenue per head being I think double what Mercer is. And if you can kind of also talk in the broader context of just Mercer margins in general, what do you think you can take that to over the next couple of years? It seems your competitors have some much higher target out there although it seems to be going backwards at this point, but if you could talk about that."

So we're very much focused on creating the business disciplines that are necessary in order to be able to commit to that, so that's #1. I'll leave it to John in a second to talk about Oliver Wyman specifically and what he's seeing in the market. In terms of Mercer, I'd start by saying, Mercer is a really strong company. It's large. It's growing. It's globally coordinated. It's profitable. It's got some great people. It's got a great client list. So I spent a good part of my time in the last 5 months really digging into Mercer, and a lot of what I see, I'm pleased with. My goal is to work with Mercer leadership team to take all this and make it better. We can be more global, we can be more profitable with better margins and we be more innovative.

In August and September when we were in a period there of tightened economic uncertainty and more market volatility, it resulted in a slowdown in new sales for Oliver Wyman. While our third quarter results were strong with a 9% growth, that will impact our fourth quarter, and so fourth quarter will be weaker. And particularly, the financial services sector especially the banking sector is where we're experiencing the weakness. And as Dan said, it'll make Q4 challenging one for us. It'll be challenging for us to grow in Q4. Now looking at what recent events mean, in October, sales picked up to back to a normal pace as the market seems to stabilize. And client pipeline is encouraging at this point. events of this week suggest there could be an extended period of uncertainty. We could see that coming back in. So I think, looking at medium-term, I'd say we're very confident that Oliver Wyman is an attractive growth business and will generate margin growth, as Dan said, over that period. But quarter-to-quarter, we could fluctuate somewhat based on the economic outlook and uncertainty. And obviously, that's I think what we'll experience in the fourth quarter this year."

So we will operate as business as long as we can keep expense growth underneath revenue growth, we will be able to grow profit and improve our margin."

And really, the core bread-and-butter rewards business is very strong across all regions, that includes consulting and data. The compensation survey business again, demand is up across all regions.

I'm Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is Dan Glaser, Group President and COO; and Van",770,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results as reported earlier today. I'm Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is Dan Glaser, Group President and COO; and Vanessa Wittman, our CFO. Also, I'd like to welcome our operating companies CEOs: Peter Zaffino of Marsh; Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter; and John Drzik of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Mike Bischoff. 
Following my comments, Dan will discuss our operating results in more detail. Vanessa will then update you on our financial position. 
Before we begin our discussions of the third quarter, I'd like to take a moment to recognize and thank Michele Burns for her many contributions to our company over the last 5 years. Michele became Mercer’s CEO in 2006 and led Mercer through a period of growth despite severe turbulence in the global economy. Last month, we announced that Michele has accepted a new role: to build and lead a retirement policy center. I believe this center has the potential of making a major contribution for finding solutions that address the retirement issues facing the United States. I'm excited that Michele has agreed to take on the challenge of leading this effort. We are now searching for a new CEO of Mercer, and until a successor is named, Dan will be overseeing Mercer’s operations. 
Now let's move to our third quarter results, which reflect our ongoing strong performance. We generated revenue growth of 11%. On an underlying basis, revenue growth was 5%, and we continue to achieve this growth while maintaining effective control over our operating expenses. This led to an increase in operating income of 30% and growth in adjusted operating income of 18%. 
Let's turn to our operating companies. The positive momentum at Marsh continued this quarter, with underlying revenue growth across all geographies driven by higher client revenue retention rates and new business development. Guy Carpenter also generated impressive results, continuing its trend of producing quarterly underlying revenue growth, which has extended over the past 3 years. Mercer produced underlying revenue growth of mid-single digits as it has over the past year. Oliver Wyman's strong revenue growth continued reflecting broad-based growth across its major industry sectors. So throughout Marsh & McLennan Companies, we've seen revenue increases and higher levels of profitability. 
This record of performance is very much in keeping with the goals we articulated at Investor Day in September of 2010. It's now been more than a year since then, so I think it's appropriate to step back and look at the progress the company has made. We're implementing our plan to establish Marsh & McLennan Companies as an elite, global growth company, valued by clients, our colleagues and shareholders. We articulated a strategy focusing on 4 pillars: growth in revenue and earnings per share, low capital requirements, high cash generation and reducing the risk profile of the company. 
As you look at our performance since Investor Day, the achievements are evident. Over the last 4 quarters, the company has produced underlying revenue growth of 5%, and I'm pleased that each of the operating companies contributed to that achievement. Marsh grew by 5%; Carpenter, 5%; Mercer, 4%; and Oliver Wyman grew 9%. Our goal is to produce underlying revenue growth, while maintaining expense discipline, thereby generating at least 10% organic growth and adjusted operating income over the long term. 
I'm pleased to report that we are achieving our goals. We have produced revenue growth across the entire enterprise. We have continued to make investments for future growth. And we've done this by limiting -- while limiting our adjusted underlying expense growth to 4%. As a result, I'm very pleased that over the last 4 quarters, Marsh & McLennan Companies generated organic growth in adjusted operating income of 13%, an outstanding performance. This earnings growth, combined with our dividend yield of 3%, is a very attractive result for our investors and in keeping with the goals we articulated at Investor Day more than a year ago. 
Additionally, we've continued to maintain low capital requirements and generate high levels of cash. Operational changes throughout the organization, we believe, have lowered the companies risk profile. Our financial position has strengthened during this period as well, which Vanessa will discuss in a few minutes. 
As we move forward, we remain committed to focusing on profitable growth and prudent redeployment of our excess cash flow in order to produce outstanding long-term returns for our shareholders. 
With that, let me turn it over to Dan to review our third quarter results in more detail."

Marsh & McLennan Companies continued its strong performance in the third quarter. We generated underlying revenue growth that have paced consistent with prior periods with impressive growth in both operating income and adjusted operating income. 
Let me go into a little more detail on our operating results. In the third quarter, we achieved revenue growth and increased adjusted operating income at each of our operating companies as we have for each quarter over the past year. In the quarter, revenue rose 11% to $2.8 billion, while underlying revenue growth was 5%. Adjusted operating income increased 18%. 
Risk and Insurance Services revenue was up 11% to $1.5 billion, with underlying revenue growth of 5%. And with ongoing effective expense management, adjusted operating income increased 13% to $186 million. The adjusted operating margin increased 20 basis points, reflecting slightly higher margins at both of Marsh and Guy Carpenter. This is also indicative of the segment's performance year-to-date where the margin has increased to 19.5% despite the effects of higher pension expense. 
Marsh had another strong quarter. Revenue increased 12% to $1.2 billion. Underlying revenue rose 6%. Marsh's high client revenue retention rate and new business development produced underlying revenue growth across all geographies, led by strong growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America of 13%. In the U.S./Canada division, underlying revenue growth was 3% for the fifth consecutive quarter. Marsh has maintained its disciplined expense control, while still being able to invest in the future, refine its operating model and absorb higher severance and pension expense. As a result, Marsh produced double-digit growth in adjusted operating income, not just for the quarter, but the year-to-date as well. 
In August, we announced a significant expansion of our South African operations with the signing of an agreement to acquire the insurance broking business of Alexander Forbes. The transaction is scheduled to close by year end. 
Now turning to reinsurance broking. Guy Carpenter continued to produce strong results. Revenue increased 8% to $251 million with underlying growth of 3%. This growth was led by its international operations, reflecting the successful execution of its long-term business strategy. Over the last 3 years, Carpenter has consistently produced quarterly underlying revenue growth. It has been able to accomplish this through strong new business development and high client retention. 
So in summary, both March and Guy Carpenter produced strong financial results, not only in the third quarter, but for the 9 months as well. 
Turning to our Consulting segment. Our operations continued to generate strong revenue growth. In the third quarter, revenue rose 11% to $1.3 billion with underlying growth of 6%. Growth in adjusted underlying expenses was 5%, which resulted in a 50 basis point increase in the adjusted operating margin for the quarter. Growth in adjusted operating income was 17%, not only for the third quarter, but for the year as well, with both Mercer and Oliver Wyman contributing to this strong growth. 
Mercer continued the solid performance we have seen over the past year. Revenue in the third quarter increased 11% to $975 million, and underlying revenue growth was 4%, with all geographic regions contributing to this growth. Consistent with the revenue trends we have seen in Mercer’s lines of business over the past year, retirement saw underlying revenue decline modestly. Health and benefits had a fine performance with an underlying increase of 7%, driven by strong growth in the U.S. and Asia Pacific. Rewards, talent & communications produced double-digit underlying revenue growth for the fifth consecutive quarter. Outsourcing generated underlying growth of 1%, reflecting growth in Asia Pacific, partially offset by a decline in the United States. And investment consulting & management produced underlying growth of 10% with strong growth in the U.S. and EMEA. 
Oliver Wyman also had a good quarter with an increase in revenue of 13%. Underlying revenue growth was 9%. This growth was diversified with the strongest growth coming from the health care and consumer industry sectors. Oliver Wyman's expense management also contributed to a solid increase in adjusted operating income. 
In summary, we are very pleased with the excellent performance of each of our operating companies, not only this quarter but throughout the entire year, both from a revenue and earnings growth standpoint. 
Now let me make several comments regarding how the increased economic uncertainty that developed in mid-summer, particularly in Europe, may impact our near-term results. Oliver Wyman is our most economically sensitive operating company. We have seen some clients in the financial services sector defer decisions on new engagements, thus making it difficult for Oliver Wyman to generate growth in the fourth quarter, resulting in a modest impact on the segment's profitability. Currently, overall client interest remains high and the pipeline going into 2012 looks encouraging. However, there is a high degree of uncertainty. So that's 0W. 
At Mercer, all signs indicate that the positive trends experienced in the first 9 months of the year are continuing and we feel that any near-term economic uncertainty is not impacting our Risk and Insurance Services segment. So notwithstanding near-term economic issues, we believe we are on target to have a very successful year and remain optimistic as we develop our strategy and business plans for 2012. 
With that, let me turn it over to Vanessa."

On a GAAP basis, net income was $130 million or $0.24 per share. Adjusted earnings per share was also $0.24. Costs of $72 million related to the early extinguishment of debt from the tender offer are highlighted on a separate line in this quarter's income statement. This expense is reflected in both our GAAP EPS and our adjusted EPS. I should also note that our a GAAP and adjusted earnings are almost identical for the 9-month period as well. Operating income totaled $1.247 billion, and adjusted operating income was $1.252 billion. As a result, GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations year-to-date was $1.30 and adjusted earnings per share also totaled $1.30. 
Now let me add some color regarding other items, including our recent financing activities. In the third quarter, interest expense decreased to $49 million from $60 million a year ago. This level of quarterly interest expense is a reasonable indicator of the run rate we expect going forward. Several actions taken over the past 12 months substantially reduced our interest expense. First was the payment of a $550 million debt obligation in September 2010. Next, in July of this year, we took advantage of the interest rate environment through a tender refinancing effort to  extend our maturity ladder and reduce our aggregate interest expense. We had $1.4 billion of debt coming due in 2014 and 2015, and we successfully tendered for $600 million of these bonds. We funded the tender with $100 million dollars of cash and a new 10-year note for $500 million with a coupon of 4.8%. We are very pleased with these transactions, which allowed us to opportunistically refine our capital structure, lower our refinancing risks in the intermediate term, extend maturities of our debt portfolio at a very attractive interest rate and delever our balance sheet. In total, the actions taken over the past year reduced our annual interest expense by $45 million. 
Turning to investment income. In the third quarter, investment income was essentially 0 compared with a $2 million loss in last year's third quarter. Due to a decline in the equity markets in the third quarter, we anticipate reporting an investment loss of approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter. 
Moving on to share repurchase. Since beginning our share repurchase program in last year's fourth quarter, the company has repurchased a total of 15.6 million shares at a cost of $447 million, including 4.4 million shares that were purchased in the third quarter. In August, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the share repurchase program to $1 billion from $500 million. 
Looking at taxes. Our adjusted tax rate this quarter increased to 32.7%. This compares with 30.4% in last year's third quarter. A drop in the U.K. statutory tax rate reduced the value of our U.K. net deferred tax assets, which was fully reflected this quarter. This change in the U.K. tax law put upward pressure on our adjusted tax rate in the third quarter but will slightly benefit our overall tax position going forward. 
The higher tax rate in the current quarter also reflects a slight shift in the geographic mix of earnings. While there may be volatility in our tax rate from quarter-to-quarter, we still feel that for modeling purposes, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate of approximately 31% over the next year. 
Due to our high cash generation, we were able to redeploy our cash in the third quarter in a number of ways, including a $126 million per share repurchase, $123 million for dividends, $100 million to reduce long-term debt, $72 million for the early debt repayment and $21 million for acquisitions. This effective redeployment of capital will also contribute to our future growth in earnings per share. And despite all of these actions, our cash position increased $55 million during the third quarter. 
Debt at the end of the third quarter was $2.9 billion. We have a $250 million note due March 15, 2012, which is our only debt coming due in 2012. 
Last month, we took advantage of favorable conditions in the credit market, and we're able to close a new $1 billion, 5-year revolving credit facility to replace our existing $1 billion, 3-year credit facility that was due to expire next year. We are very pleased with the increased financial flexibility and reduced uncertainty, resulting from the new facilities' extended duration. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Brian."

I'll leave it to John in a second to talk about Oliver Wyman, specifically, and what he's seeing in the market. In terms of Mercer, I'd start by saying, Mercer is a really strong company. It's large. It's growing. It's globally coordinated. It's profitable. It's got some great people. It's got a great client list. So I've spent a good part of my time in the last 5 months really digging into Mercer, and a lot of what I see, I'm pleased with. My goal is to work with the Mercer leadership team to take all of this and make it better. We can be more global. We can be more profitable with better margins. And we can be more innovative. And so that will be the focus of the leadership team and I over the coming months and years."

In August and September, when we were in a period there of tightened economic uncertainty and more market volatility, it resulted in a slowdown in new sales for Oliver Wyman. So while our third quarter results were strong with a 9% growth, that will impact our fourth quarter, and so fourth quarter will be weaker. And particularly, financial services sector, especially the banking sector, was where we were experiencing the weakness. And as Dan said, it'll make Q4 challenging one for us. It'll be challenging for us to grow in Q4. Now looking at what recent events mean, in October, sales picked up to back to a normal pace as the market seems stabilized. And client pipeline is encouraging at this point. But obviously, events of this week suggest there could be an extended period of uncertainty and we could see that coming back in. So I think looking at the medium term, I'd say we're very confident that Oliver Wyman is an attractive growth business and will generate margin growth, as Dan said, over that period. But quarter-to-quarter, we could fluctuate somewhat based on the economic outlook and uncertainty. And obviously, that's, I think, what we'll experience in the fourth quarter this year."

I've been through a few of these cycles, not too many because we will have too many finding markets. And the strange thing is they're all different. They all start out for different reasons, going in different directions. So it is very hard to say, yes, this is exactly like '99. Things are so much different than they were in '99 today, I mean, economically, globally, all that. But I would say that one of the issues with that period was just kind of an exhaustion that took place, that's the word I've been using, and there was just nowhere else to go with rates except to go back up. And that is the real question that we reached that point. I think you've heard from Peter and from Dan and from Alex that there isn't a real pattern necessarily forming yet here.

And so all of those areas are actually doing quite well. But I'll just take a moment on rewards, talent & communications because they've had their fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. And really, the core bread-and-butter rewards business is very strong across all regions and that includes consulting and data. The compensation survey business, again, demand is up across all regions. And there's high demand for talent management, specifically leadership development and skills assessment in emerging markets. So we're very well-positioned to capture that trend. And I think at this stage, 5 quarters in a row, you would see that as a trend."

I'm Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is Dan Glaser, Group President and COO, and Van",770,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results as reported earlier today. I'm Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is Dan Glaser, Group President and COO, and Vanessa Wittman, our CFO. Also, I'd like to welcome our operating company CEOs: Peter Zaffino of Marsh, Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter and John Drzik of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Mike Bischoff. 
Following my comments, Dan will discuss our operating results in more detail. Vanessa will then update you on our financial position. 
Before we begin our discussions of the third quarter, I'd like to take a moment to recognize and thank Michele Burns for her many contributions to our company over the last 5 years. Michele became Mercer’s CEO in 2006 and led Mercer through a period of growth despite severe turbulence in the global economy. Last month, we announced that Michele has accepted a new role: to build and lead a retirement policy center. I believe this center has the potential of making a major contribution toward finding solutions that address the retirement issues facing the United States. I'm excited that Michele has agreed to take on the challenge of leading this effort. We are now searching for a new CEO of Mercer, and until a successor is named, Dan will be overseeing Mercer’s operations. 
Now let's move to our third quarter results, which reflect our ongoing strong performance. We generated revenue growth of 11%. On an underlying basis, revenue growth was 5%, and we continued to achieve this growth while maintaining effective control over our operating expenses. This led to an increase in operating income of 30% and growth in adjusted operating income of 18%. 
Let's turn to our operating companies. The positive momentum at Marsh continued this quarter, with underlying revenue growth across all geographies driven by higher client revenue retention rates and new business development. Guy Carpenter also generated impressive results, continuing its trend of producing quarterly underlying revenue growth, which has extended over the past 3 years. Mercer produced underlying revenue growth of mid-single-digits as it has over the past year. Oliver Wyman's strong revenue growth continued reflecting broad-based growth across its major industry sectors. So throughout Marsh & McLennan Companies, we've seen revenue increases and higher levels of profitability. 
This record of performance is very much in keeping with the goals we articulated at Investor Day in September of 2010. It's now been more than a year since then, so I think it's appropriate to step back and look at the progress the company has made. We're implementing our plan to establish Marsh & McLennan Companies as an elite global growth company, valued by clients, our colleagues and shareholders. We articulated a strategy focusing on 4 pillars: growth in revenue and earnings per share, low capital requirements, high cash generation and reducing the risk profile of the company. 
As you look at our performance since Investor Day, the achievements are evident. Over the last 4 quarters, the company has produced underlying revenue growth of 5%, and I'm pleased that each of the operating companies contributed to that achievement. Marsh grew by 5%; Carpenter, 5%; Mercer, 4%; and Oliver Wyman grew 9%. Our goal is to produce underlying revenue growth while maintaining expense discipline, thereby generating at least 10% organic growth and adjusted operating income over the long term. 
I'm pleased to report that we are achieving our goals. We have produced revenue growth across the entire enterprise. We have continued to make investments for future growth. And we've done this by limiting -- while limiting our adjusted underlying expense growth to 4%. As a result, I am very pleased that over the last 4 quarters, Marsh & McLennan Companies generated organic growth in adjusted operating income of 13%, an outstanding performance. This earnings growth combined with our dividend yield of 3% is a very attractive result for our investors and in keeping with the goals we articulated at Investor Day more than a year ago. 
Additionally, we've continued to maintain low capital requirements and generate high levels of cash. Operational changes throughout the organization, we believe, have lowered the companies' risk profile. Our financial position has strengthened during this period as well, which Vanessa will discuss in a few minutes. 
As we move forward, we remain committed to focusing on profitable growth and prudent redeployment of our excess cash flow in order to produce outstanding long-term returns for our shareholders. 
With that, let me turn it over to Dan to review our third quarter results in more detail."

Marsh & McLennan Companies continued its strong performance in the third quarter. We generated underlying revenue growth that have paced consistent with prior periods, with impressive growth in both operating income and adjusted operating income. 
Let me go into a little more detail on our operating results. In the third quarter, we achieved revenue growth and increased adjusted operating income at each of our operating companies, as we have for each quarter over the past year. In the quarter, revenue rose 11% to $2.8 billion, while underlying revenue growth was 5%. Adjusted operating income increased 18%. 
Risk and Insurance Services revenue was up 11% to $1.5 billion, with underlying revenue growth of 5%. And with ongoing effective expense management, adjusted operating income increased 13% to $186 million. The adjusted operating margin increased 20 basis points, reflecting slightly higher margins at both Marsh and Guy Carpenter. This is also indicative of the segment's performance year-to-date, where the margin has increased to 19.5% despite the effects of higher pension expense. 
Marsh had another strong quarter. Revenue increased 12% to $1.2 billion. Underlying revenue rose 6%. Marsh's high client revenue retention rate and new business development produced underlying revenue growth across all geographies, led by strong growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America of 13%. In the U.S./Canada division, underlying revenue growth was 3% for the fifth consecutive quarter. Marsh has maintained its disciplined expense control, while still being able to invest in the future, refine its operating model and absorb higher severance and pension expense. As a result, Marsh produced double-digit growth in adjusted operating income not just for the quarter, but the year-to-date as well. 
In August, we announced a significant expansion of our South African operations with the signing of an agreement to acquire the insurance broking business of Alexander Forbes. The transaction is scheduled to close by year end. 
Now turning to reinsurance broking. Guy Carpenter continued to produce strong results. Revenue increased 8% to $251 million with underlying growth of 3%. This growth was led by its international operations, reflecting the successful execution of its long-term business strategy. Over the last 3 years, Carpenter has consistently produced quarterly underlying revenue growth. It has been able to accomplish this through strong new business development and high client retention. 
So in summary, both March and Guy Carpenter produced strong financial results not only in the third quarter, but for the 9 months as well. 
Turning to our Consulting segment. Our operations continued to generate strong revenue growth. In the third quarter, revenue rose 11% to $1.3 billion with underlying growth of 6%. Growth in adjusted underlying expenses was 5%, which resulted in a 50-basis-point increase in the adjusted operating margin for the quarter. Growth in adjusted operating income was 17% not only for the third quarter, but for the year as well, with both Mercer and Oliver Wyman contributing to this strong growth. 
Mercer continued the solid performance we have seen over the past year. Revenue in the third quarter increased 11% to $975 million, and underlying revenue growth was 4%, with all geographic regions contributing to this growth. Consistent with the revenue trends we have seen in Mercer’s lines of business over the past year, retirement saw underlying revenue decline modestly. Health and benefits had a fine performance, with an underlying increase of 7%, driven by strong growth in the U.S. and Asia Pacific. Rewards, talent & communications produced double-digit underlying revenue growth for the fifth consecutive quarter. Outsourcing generated underlying growth of 1%, reflecting growth in Asia Pacific, partially offset by a decline in the United States. And investment consulting & management produced underlying growth of 10%, with strong growth in the U.S. and EMEA. 
Oliver Wyman also had a good quarter, with an increase in revenue of 13%. Underlying revenue growth was 9%. This growth was diversified with the strongest growth coming from the health care and consumer industry sectors. Oliver Wyman's expense management also contributed to a solid increase in adjusted operating income. 
In summary, we are very pleased with the excellent performance of each of our operating companies, not only this quarter, but throughout the entire year, both from a revenue and earnings growth standpoint. 
Now let me make several comments regarding how the increased economic uncertainty that developed in mid-summer, particularly in Europe, may impact our near-term results. Oliver Wyman is our most economically sensitive operating company. We have seen some clients in the financial services sector defer decisions on new engagements, thus making it difficult for Oliver Wyman to generate growth in the fourth quarter, resulting in a modest impact on the segment's profitability. Currently, overall client interest remains high, and the pipeline going into 2012 looks encouraging. However, there is a higher degree of uncertainty. So that's OW. 
At Mercer, all signs indicate that the positive trends experienced in the first 9 months of the year are continuing, and we feel that any near-term economic uncertainty is not impacting our Risk and Insurance Services segment. So notwithstanding near-term economic issues, we believe we are on target to have a very successful year and remain optimistic as we develop our strategy and business plans for 2012. 
With that, let me turn it over to Vanessa."

On a GAAP basis, net income was $130 million, or $0.24 per share. Adjusted earnings per share was also $0.24. Costs of $72 million related to the early extinguishment of debt from the tender offer are highlighted on a separate line in this quarter's income statement. This expense is reflected in both our GAAP EPS and our adjusted EPS. I should also note that our a GAAP and adjusted earnings are almost identical for the 9-month period as well. Operating income totaled $1.247 billion, and adjusted operating income was $1.252 billion. As a result, GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations year-to-date was $1.30 and adjusted earnings per share also totaled $1.30. 
Now let me add some color regarding other items, including our recent financing activities. In the third quarter, interest expense decreased to $49 million from $60 million a year ago. This level of quarterly interest expense is a reasonable indicator of the run rate we expect going forward. Several actions taken over the past 12 months substantially reduced our interest expense. First was the payment of a $550 million debt obligation in September 2010. Next, in July of this year, we took advantage of the interest rate environment through a tender refinancing effort to  extend our maturity ladder and reduce our aggregate interest expense. We had $1.4 billion of debt coming due in 2014 and 2015, and we successfully tendered for $600 million of these bonds. We funded the tender with $100 million dollars of cash and a new 10-year note for $500 million with a coupon of 4.8%. We are very pleased with these transactions, which allowed us to opportunistically refine our capital structure, lower our refinancing risk in the intermediate term, extend maturities of our debt portfolio at a very attractive interest rate and delever our balance sheet. In total, the actions taken over the past year reduce our annual interest expense by $45 million. 
Turning to investment income. In the third quarter, investment income was essentially 0 compared with a $2 million loss in last year's third quarter. Due to a decline in the equity markets in the third quarter, we anticipate reporting an investment loss of approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter. 
Moving on to share repurchase. Since beginning our share repurchase program in last year's fourth quarter, the company has repurchased a total of 15.6 million shares at a cost of $447 million, including 4.4 million shares that were purchased in the third quarter. In August, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the share repurchase program to $1 billion from $500 million. 
Looking at taxes. Our adjusted tax rate this quarter increased to 32.7%. This compares with 30.4% in last year's third quarter. A drop in the U.K. statutory tax rate reduced the value of our U.K. net deferred tax assets, which was fully reflected this quarter. This change in the U.K. tax law put upward pressure on our adjusted tax rate in the third quarter but will slightly benefit our overall tax position going forward. 
The higher tax rate in the current quarter also reflects a slight shift in the geographic mix of earnings. While there may be volatility in our tax rate from quarter-to-quarter, we still feel that for modeling purposes, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate of approximately 31% over the next year. 
Due to our high cash generation, we were able to redeploy our cash in the third quarter in a number of ways, including a $126 million per share repurchase, $123 million for dividends, $100 million to reduce long-term debt, $72 million for the early debt repayment and $21 million for acquisitions. This effective redeployment of capital will also contribute to our future growth in earnings per share. And despite all of these actions, our cash position increased $55 million during the third quarter. 
Debt at the end of the third quarter was $2.9 billion. We have a $250 million note due March 15, 2012, which is our only debt coming due in 2012. 
Last month, we took advantage of favorable conditions in the credit market and were able to close a new $1 billion, 5-year revolving credit facility to replace our existing $1 billion, 3-year credit facility that was due to expire next year. We are very pleased with the increased financial flexibility and reduced uncertainty resulting from the new facilities' extended duration. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Brian."

And so we're very much focused on creating the business disciplines that are necessary in order to be able to commit to that, so that's #1. I'll leave it to John in a second to talk about Oliver Wyman specifically and what he's seeing in the market. In terms of Mercer, I'd start by saying, Mercer is a really strong company. It's large. It's growing. It's globally coordinated. It's profitable. It's got some great people. It's got a great client list. So I've spent a good part of my time in the last 5 months really digging into Mercer, and a lot of what I see, I'm pleased with. My goal is to work with the Mercer leadership team to take all of this and make it better. We can be more global. We can be more profitable with better margins. And we can be more innovative. And so that will be the focus of the leadership team and I over the coming months and years."

In August and September, when we were in a period there of tightened economic uncertainty and more market volatility, it resulted in a slowdown in new sales for Oliver Wyman. So while our third quarter results were strong with a 9% growth, that will impact our fourth quarter, and so fourth quarter will be weaker. In particular, the Financial Services sector, especially the banking sector, was where we were experiencing the weakness. And as Dan said, it'll make Q4 challenging one for us. It'll be challenging for us to grow in Q4. Now looking at what recent events mean, in October, sales picked up to back to a normal pace as the market seemed to stabilize.  And our client pipeline is encouraging at this point. But obviously, events of this week suggest there could be an extended period of uncertainty, and we could see that coming back in. So I think looking at the medium term, I'd say we're very confident that Oliver Wyman is an attractive growth business and will generate margin growth, as Dan said, over that period. But quarter-to-quarter, we could fluctuate somewhat based on the economic outlook and uncertainty. And obviously, that's, I think, what we'll experience in the fourth quarter this year."

Things are so much different than they were in '99 today, I mean, economically, globally, all that. But I would say that one of the issues with that period was just kind of an exhaustion that took place, that's the word I've been using, and there was just nowhere else to go with rates except to go back up. And that is the real question that we reached that point. I think you've heard from Peter and from Dan and from Alex that there isn't a real pattern, necessarily, forming yet here.

And so all of those areas are actually doing quite well. But I'll just take a moment on rewards, talent & communications because they've had their fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. And really, the core bread-and-butter rewards business is very strong across all regions, and that includes consulting and data. The compensation survey business, again, demand is up across all regions. And there's high demand for talent management, specifically leadership development and skills assessment in emerging markets. So we're very well-positioned to capture that trend. And I think at this stage, 5 quarters in a row, you would see that as a trend."

I'm Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is Dan Glaser, Group President and COO, and Van",770,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results as reported earlier today. I'm Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is Dan Glaser, Group President and COO, and Vanessa Wittman, our CFO. Also, I'd like to welcome our operating company CEOs: Peter Zaffino of Marsh, Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter and John Drzik of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Mike Bischoff. 
Following my comments, Dan will discuss our operating results in more detail. Vanessa will then update you on our financial position. 
Before we begin our discussions of the third quarter, I'd like to take a moment to recognize and thank Michele Burns for her many contributions to our company over the last 5 years. Michele became Mercer’s CEO in 2006 and led Mercer through a period of growth despite severe turbulence in the global economy. Last month, we announced that Michele has accepted a new role: to build and lead a retirement policy center. I believe this center has the potential of making a major contribution toward finding solutions that address the retirement issues facing the United States. I'm excited that Michele has agreed to take on the challenge of leading this effort. We are now searching for a new CEO of Mercer, and until a successor is named, Dan will be overseeing Mercer’s operations. 
Now let's move to our third quarter results, which reflect our ongoing strong performance. We generated revenue growth of 11%. On an underlying basis, revenue growth was 5%, and we continued to achieve this growth while maintaining effective control over our operating expenses. This led to an increase in operating income of 30% and growth in adjusted operating income of 18%. 
Let's turn to our operating companies. The positive momentum at Marsh continued this quarter, with underlying revenue growth across all geographies driven by higher client revenue retention rates and new business development. Guy Carpenter also generated impressive results, continuing its trend of producing quarterly underlying revenue growth, which has extended over the past 3 years. Mercer produced underlying revenue growth of mid-single-digits as it has over the past year. Oliver Wyman's strong revenue growth continued reflecting broad-based growth across its major industry sectors. So throughout Marsh & McLennan Companies, we've seen revenue increases and higher levels of profitability. 
This record of performance is very much in keeping with the goals we articulated at Investor Day in September of 2010. It's now been more than a year since then, so I think it's appropriate to step back and look at the progress the company has made. We're implementing our plan to establish Marsh & McLennan Companies as an elite global growth company, valued by clients, our colleagues and shareholders. We articulated a strategy focusing on 4 pillars: growth in revenue and earnings per share, low capital requirements, high cash generation and reducing the risk profile of the company. 
As you look at our performance since Investor Day, the achievements are evident. Over the last 4 quarters, the company has produced underlying revenue growth of 5%, and I'm pleased that each of the operating companies contributed to that achievement. Marsh grew by 5%; Carpenter, 5%; Mercer, 4%; and Oliver Wyman grew 9%. Our goal is to produce underlying revenue growth while maintaining expense discipline, thereby generating at least 10% organic growth and adjusted operating income over the long term. 
I'm pleased to report that we are achieving our goals. We have produced revenue growth across the entire enterprise. We have continued to make investments for future growth. And we've done this by limiting -- while limiting our adjusted underlying expense growth to 4%. As a result, I am very pleased that over the last 4 quarters, Marsh & McLennan Companies generated organic growth in adjusted operating income of 13%, an outstanding performance. This earnings growth combined with our dividend yield of 3% is a very attractive result for our investors and in keeping with the goals we articulated at Investor Day more than a year ago. 
Additionally, we've continued to maintain low capital requirements and generate high levels of cash. Operational changes throughout the organization, we believe, have lowered the companies' risk profile. Our financial position has strengthened during this period as well, which Vanessa will discuss in a few minutes. 
As we move forward, we remain committed to focusing on profitable growth and prudent redeployment of our excess cash flow in order to produce outstanding long-term returns for our shareholders. 
With that, let me turn it over to Dan to review our third quarter results in more detail."

Marsh & McLennan Companies continued its strong performance in the third quarter. We generated underlying revenue growth that have paced consistent with prior periods, with impressive growth in both operating income and adjusted operating income. 
Let me go into a little more detail on our operating results. In the third quarter, we achieved revenue growth and increased adjusted operating income at each of our operating companies, as we have for each quarter over the past year. In the quarter, revenue rose 11% to $2.8 billion, while underlying revenue growth was 5%. Adjusted operating income increased 18%. 
Risk and Insurance Services revenue was up 11% to $1.5 billion, with underlying revenue growth of 5%. And with ongoing effective expense management, adjusted operating income increased 13% to $186 million. The adjusted operating margin increased 20 basis points, reflecting slightly higher margins at both Marsh and Guy Carpenter. This is also indicative of the segment's performance year-to-date, where the margin has increased to 19.5% despite the effects of higher pension expense. 
Marsh had another strong quarter. Revenue increased 12% to $1.2 billion. Underlying revenue rose 6%. Marsh's high client revenue retention rate and new business development produced underlying revenue growth across all geographies, led by strong growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America of 13%. In the U.S./Canada division, underlying revenue growth was 3% for the fifth consecutive quarter. Marsh has maintained its disciplined expense control, while still being able to invest in the future, refine its operating model and absorb higher severance and pension expense. As a result, Marsh produced double-digit growth in adjusted operating income not just for the quarter, but the year-to-date as well. 
In August, we announced a significant expansion of our South African operations with the signing of an agreement to acquire the insurance broking business of Alexander Forbes. The transaction is scheduled to close by year end. 
Now turning to reinsurance broking. Guy Carpenter continued to produce strong results. Revenue increased 8% to $251 million with underlying growth of 3%. This growth was led by its international operations, reflecting the successful execution of its long-term business strategy. Over the last 3 years, Carpenter has consistently produced quarterly underlying revenue growth. It has been able to accomplish this through strong new business development and high client retention. 
So in summary, both March and Guy Carpenter produced strong financial results not only in the third quarter, but for the 9 months as well. 
Turning to our Consulting segment. Our operations continued to generate strong revenue growth. In the third quarter, revenue rose 11% to $1.3 billion with underlying growth of 6%. Growth in adjusted underlying expenses was 5%, which resulted in a 50-basis-point increase in the adjusted operating margin for the quarter. Growth in adjusted operating income was 17% not only for the third quarter, but for the year as well, with both Mercer and Oliver Wyman contributing to this strong growth. 
Mercer continued the solid performance we have seen over the past year. Revenue in the third quarter increased 11% to $975 million, and underlying revenue growth was 4%, with all geographic regions contributing to this growth. Consistent with the revenue trends we have seen in Mercer’s lines of business over the past year, retirement saw underlying revenue decline modestly. Health and benefits had a fine performance, with an underlying increase of 7%, driven by strong growth in the U.S. and Asia Pacific. Rewards, talent & communications produced double-digit underlying revenue growth for the fifth consecutive quarter. Outsourcing generated underlying growth of 1%, reflecting growth in Asia Pacific, partially offset by a decline in the United States. And investment consulting & management produced underlying growth of 10%, with strong growth in the U.S. and EMEA. 
Oliver Wyman also had a good quarter, with an increase in revenue of 13%. Underlying revenue growth was 9%. This growth was diversified with the strongest growth coming from the health care and consumer industry sectors. Oliver Wyman's expense management also contributed to a solid increase in adjusted operating income. 
In summary, we are very pleased with the excellent performance of each of our operating companies, not only this quarter, but throughout the entire year, both from a revenue and earnings growth standpoint. 
Now let me make several comments regarding how the increased economic uncertainty that developed in mid-summer, particularly in Europe, may impact our near-term results. Oliver Wyman is our most economically sensitive operating company. We have seen some clients in the financial services sector defer decisions on new engagements, thus making it difficult for Oliver Wyman to generate growth in the fourth quarter, resulting in a modest impact on the segment's profitability. Currently, overall client interest remains high, and the pipeline going into 2012 looks encouraging. However, there is a higher degree of uncertainty. So that's OW. 
At Mercer, all signs indicate that the positive trends experienced in the first 9 months of the year are continuing, and we feel that any near-term economic uncertainty is not impacting our Risk and Insurance Services segment. So notwithstanding near-term economic issues, we believe we are on target to have a very successful year and remain optimistic as we develop our strategy and business plans for 2012. 
With that, let me turn it over to Vanessa."

On a GAAP basis, net income was $130 million, or $0.24 per share. Adjusted earnings per share was also $0.24. Costs of $72 million related to the early extinguishment of debt from the tender offer are highlighted on a separate line in this quarter's income statement. This expense is reflected in both our GAAP EPS and our adjusted EPS. I should also note that our a GAAP and adjusted earnings are almost identical for the 9-month period as well. Operating income totaled $1.247 billion, and adjusted operating income was $1.252 billion. As a result, GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations year-to-date was $1.30 and adjusted earnings per share also totaled $1.30. 
Now let me add some color regarding other items, including our recent financing activities. In the third quarter, interest expense decreased to $49 million from $60 million a year ago. This level of quarterly interest expense is a reasonable indicator of the run rate we expect going forward. Several actions taken over the past 12 months substantially reduced our interest expense. First was the payment of a $550 million debt obligation in September 2010. Next, in July of this year, we took advantage of the interest rate environment through a tender refinancing effort to  extend our maturity ladder and reduce our aggregate interest expense. We had $1.4 billion of debt coming due in 2014 and 2015, and we successfully tendered for $600 million of these bonds. We funded the tender with $100 million dollars of cash and a new 10-year note for $500 million with a coupon of 4.8%. We are very pleased with these transactions, which allowed us to opportunistically refine our capital structure, lower our refinancing risk in the intermediate term, extend maturities of our debt portfolio at a very attractive interest rate and delever our balance sheet. In total, the actions taken over the past year reduce our annual interest expense by $45 million. 
Turning to investment income. In the third quarter, investment income was essentially 0 compared with a $2 million loss in last year's third quarter. Due to a decline in the equity markets in the third quarter, we anticipate reporting an investment loss of approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter. 
Moving on to share repurchase. Since beginning our share repurchase program in last year's fourth quarter, the company has repurchased a total of 15.6 million shares at a cost of $447 million, including 4.4 million shares that were purchased in the third quarter. In August, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the share repurchase program to $1 billion from $500 million. 
Looking at taxes. Our adjusted tax rate this quarter increased to 32.7%. This compares with 30.4% in last year's third quarter. A drop in the U.K. statutory tax rate reduced the value of our U.K. net deferred tax assets, which was fully reflected this quarter. This change in the U.K. tax law put upward pressure on our adjusted tax rate in the third quarter but will slightly benefit our overall tax position going forward. 
The higher tax rate in the current quarter also reflects a slight shift in the geographic mix of earnings. While there may be volatility in our tax rate from quarter-to-quarter, we still feel that for modeling purposes, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate of approximately 31% over the next year. 
Due to our high cash generation, we were able to redeploy our cash in the third quarter in a number of ways, including a $126 million per share repurchase, $123 million for dividends, $100 million to reduce long-term debt, $72 million for the early debt repayment and $21 million for acquisitions. This effective redeployment of capital will also contribute to our future growth in earnings per share. And despite all of these actions, our cash position increased $55 million during the third quarter. 
Debt at the end of the third quarter was $2.9 billion. We have a $250 million note due March 15, 2012, which is our only debt coming due in 2012. 
Last month, we took advantage of favorable conditions in the credit market and were able to close a new $1 billion, 5-year revolving credit facility to replace our existing $1 billion, 3-year credit facility that was due to expire next year. We are very pleased with the increased financial flexibility and reduced uncertainty resulting from the new facilities' extended duration. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Brian."

I'll leave it to John in a second to talk about Oliver Wyman specifically and what he's seeing in the market. In terms of Mercer, I'd start by saying, Mercer is a really strong company. It's large. It's growing. It's globally coordinated. It's profitable. It's got some great people. It's got a great client list. So I've spent a good part of my time in the last 5 months really digging into Mercer, and a lot of what I see, I'm pleased with. My goal is to work with the Mercer leadership team to take all of this and make it better. We can be more global. We can be more profitable with better margins. And we can be more innovative. And so that will be the focus of the leadership team and I over the coming months and years."

In August and September, when we were in a period there of tightened economic uncertainty and more market volatility, it resulted in a slowdown in new sales for Oliver Wyman. So while our third quarter results were strong with a 9% growth, that will impact our fourth quarter, and so fourth quarter will be weaker. In particular, the Financial Services sector, especially the banking sector, was where we were experiencing the weakness. And as Dan said, it'll make Q4 challenging one for us. It'll be challenging for us to grow in Q4. Now looking at what recent events mean, in October, sales picked up to back to a normal pace as the market seemed to stabilize.  And our client pipeline is encouraging at this point. But obviously, events of this week suggest there could be an extended period of uncertainty, and we could see that coming back in. So I think looking at the medium term, I'd say we're very confident that Oliver Wyman is an attractive growth business and will generate margin growth, as Dan said, over that period. But quarter-to-quarter, we could fluctuate somewhat based on the economic outlook and uncertainty. And obviously, that's, I think, what we'll experience in the fourth quarter this year."

I've been through a few of these cycles, not too many, because we don't have too many hardening markets. And the strange thing is they're all different. They all start out for different reasons, going in different directions. So it is very hard to say, yes, this is exactly like '99. Things are so much different than they were in '99 today, I mean, economically, globally, all that. But I would say that one of the issues with that period was just kind of an exhaustion that took place, that's the word I've been using, and there was just nowhere else to go with rates except to go back up. And that is the real question that we reached that point. I think you've heard from Peter and from Dan and from Alex that there isn't a real pattern, necessarily, forming yet here. Some ups, some downs, some sideways. Nothing dramatic either way. And so I think this is going to have its own characteristics, and your call is as good as mine on when this all changes. And one day, we'll have answer to this. That's what's great about it."

Mercer has actually very strong new business development over the past couple of years. And so that's certainly a big part of their growth, particularly in areas where we have invested around the world such as health and benefits. If you look at Mercer piece-by-piece, the most significant areas of growth have been in rewards, talent & communications, health and benefits and the investment space. And so all of those areas are actually doing quite well. But I'll just take a moment on rewards, talent & communications because they've had their fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. And really, the core bread-and-butter rewards business is very strong across all regions, and that includes consulting and data. The compensation survey business, again, demand is up across all regions. And there's high demand for talent management, specifically leadership development and skills assessment in emerging markets. So we're very well-positioned to capture that trend. And I think at this stage, 5 quarters in a row, you would see that as a trend."

So we're talking to companies. Our dialogue with life insurance companies is around we all believe that annuities provide part of the answer, and perhaps even annuities linked with long-term care are interesting products, and we all are surprised at the lack of take-up. And so there's, I think, a lot of interest around greater product in an annuity kind of format. And for companies to look at how they can support that for their colleague base, particularly if they've moved from DB to DC. But the life insurance companies themselves would say it has not been a tremendously active market.
