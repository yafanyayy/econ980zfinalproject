Happy new year. 2010 was another year of fine operating and financial performance for Exelon. I'll start with some of the key factors. As you know, from our earnings release, our operating earnings were $4.06 p",1934,"Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Stacie. Happy new year. 
2010 was another year of fine operating and financial performance for Exelon. I'll start with some of the key factors. As you know, from our earnings release, our operating earnings were $4.06 per share, handily beating our original expectations for the year and at the top end of the range we provided you last quarter.
We accomplished this through attention to cost control across the business. We met our target for operating O&M for 2010, despite starting the year with pension and OPEB expense that was $35 million higher than 2009 and a challenge in our budget of $100 million to offset rising costs. This was our second straight year of delivering O&M below the 2008 level of $4.5 billion. Revenues in Exelon Generation were helped by better-than-expected market conditions across the portfolio. Higher capacity prices from the scheduled reset of PJM capacity raised were expected but nonetheless helped in delivering on our commitments. 
At both ComEd and PECO, weather effects particularly in the summer months increased earnings over last year by about $0.16 per share. I would point out that we saw very little growth in either company, although we're always a little uncertain about our weather adjustments. They may be a little more than we're seeing, but it was basically very close to flat.
We generated cash from operations of $5.3 billion, $1 million more than our original expectations. Our higher net income, our tax planning work and cash benefits from bonus depreciation were the primary drivers. Our cash generation in 2010 allowed us to contribute $765 million to the pension plans, including a $500 million voluntary contribution last August. Separately, we contributed $200 million to our OPEB plans. And of course, the best thing of all, is that we returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders through the dividend with we held stable at $2.10 per share.
In operations, both OPEB and PECO maintained strong performance while managing costs despite intense. In each case, we were a little bit disappointed in the duration indices, although I believe we're either in first quartile or close to it. We very pleased by our frequency of interruption. ComEd achieved its highest customer satisfaction scores in more than five years, and PECO had its best ever customer satisfaction scores. Exelon nuclear its eighth consecutive year of capacity factors over 93%. While that starts to sound routine, it's simply isn't. The management focus that goes into consistent operations at these levels, with a fleet our size, is a clear competitive advantage for Exelon. 
We added 59 megawatts of new nuclear generation to the fleet through our uprate plan. We have another 98 megawatts projected to be added in 2011 across a number of sites including Limerick, LaSalle and Quad Cities. For Exelon Power, 2010 marked our first acquisition of wind assets with the acquisition of John Deere Renewables, now called Exelon Wind. This portfolio positions us as an important player in renewables policy-making. And as we told you before, we have long-term contracts to lock in our earnings expectation and cash flow. As was suggested in the President's speech last night, we have continued growth in requirements to purchase renewables. This puts Exelon in the place of selling as well as buying.
We also lived by our own advocacy in retiring some of our oldest plants. We received FERC approval for short-term RMR agreements on at any zone through the retirement dates that we've announced in 2011 and '12. We also resolved a long-standing dispute with the state of New Jersey regarding the early retirement of our nuclear plant at Oyster Creek. This provides certainty that we will not be required to install cooling towers, which the plant could simply not afford, while still allowing us to capture the majority of the estimated remaining value in the sites. 
We are preparing the transmission system for a cleaner future. We move forward with $178 million of transmission upgrades in downtown Chicago. We expect to complete by the end of 2011. Our transmission team is pursuing transmission development across the Midwest to move renewable energy verities needed most. And Exelon Generation is taking steps to reduce congestion around our units through projects like the transformer replacement station that is planned for the fourth quarter.
So let me say that I am very pleased with what our management achieved in 2010. This was a tough year and across the board, PECO, ComEd, nuclear, Power Team, Exelon Power, our Business Service group. Our business met their. Power Team found ways to get some extra revenue in a very challenging power market.
Now turning to 2011. As you've seen in the morning's release, we are expecting another good year with operating earnings somewhere in the range of $3.90 to $4.20 per share. Our estimate reflects a number of items, which go in both directions. PECO has now transitioned to fully deregulated markets. And new electric and gas distribution rates went into effect on January 1. The below-market Power Purchase Agreement between PECO and Exelon Generation ended, which will allow Generation to realize about $20 more per megawatt-hour in 2011 on power sold to PECO customers. 
Exelon Energy, our retail sales arm, is growing its presence in the East as a result of PECO going to market. The pricing on financial swap between generation and ComEd had a scheduled increase at the beginning of the year, adding about $150 million of revenue net fuel over 2010 levels. Our financial results will continue to be helped by the hedges put on by Power Team for 2011, which were in the money by over $1.7 billion at year end. That includes the swap in Illinois as well as in the other contracts in other regions.
We expect demand at both ComEd and PECO to again be flat on a weather normal basis. Now on the other hand, we of course must continue to limit cost increases and to work ever harder on financial discipline for us to. PECO had a favorable rate case settlement during the year. ComEd is working hard with other utilities in Illinois to pursue a legislative proposal, to invest in modernizing the grid in return for a formula rate structure. While it is too soon to tell the outcome, the proposal would be an economic development and would give ComEd more timely and predictable regulatory mechanism for recovering its costs. 
As we have reported before, tax legislation passed in December accelerates $1 billion of cash flows. We are using that along with other funds and the tax benefit thereof to make a $2.1 billion contribution to the pension plan. Using the funds for this purpose meets our obligations to our employees. It reduces the long-term corporate liability and takes advantage of the tax deductibility of the contributions. It means that our future operating cash flows are more available for things like our nuclear uprates and other long-term opportunities. Needless to say, it also makes those more available to protect your dividend. We of course radically improved of the funded status of the pension plan. And this allows us to accelerate our plans to rebalance the asset mix of the trust. And what we're doing is moving from our equity contribution to a higher level of debt, so that we reduce the volatility and max the assets more closely to reliable.[ph] 
Now, 2011 is expected to bring a lot of things that are on our future. These include environmental regulations, changes in energy and capacity markets and the prospects for the economy. We believe, and every check we make confirms, that EPA will issue its proposed rules for hazardous air pollutants in March, and the final rules are scheduled for later this year. Because EPA is committed to this end and because there are legal requirements under court order, we expect EPA to move rigorously in this regard. We also expect there will be a great deal of political debate about whether these regulations are, in some way, too much too soon. Since we haven't seen them, we can't opine whether they're too much for the clean air act for a long time compliance requirements.
EPA has shown that we believe to be commendable reasonableness on the 316(b) Clean Water rules. The agency has indicated that it expects to issue those rules in March as well. Final rules on 316(b) are expected in mid-2012 with compliance staged over seven period after that. Lisa Jackson, the EPA Administrator, has stated the ""one size fits all"" approach does not work and a closed-cycle cooling may not be the right technology at all plants. We believe that to be good news for Exelon and the entire industry. So there will be a great deal of news on the EPA front.
With respect to energy and capacity markets, the situation remains murky. As you all know, gas prices remain low. We are, of course, very interested in the results of the big capacity auction in PJM. We believe they will be higher than last year's results. The question is, how much higher? The reduced demand forecast from PJM will exert some downward pressure on the markets. It is possible that the recent New Jersey legislation to pay for new gas plants will also be a downward force. However, we believe that as per FERC precedent, FERC will move to require a reasonable minimum bid price for these units and do so in time for May's RPM auction. We are also evaluating other options on how we would respond in the event the governor signs this legislation. 
There are very large number of factors affecting the result of May's capacity prices. These include the amount of demand response to participation, the number of plant retirements that are definite, and bidding behavior reflecting what people really can commit themselves to do with coal plants in the face of both gas prices and becoming EPA. They also reflect timing of transmission upgrades. We keep trying to evaluate all of these moving parts, as do you, and we will do our best to put them all together again once PJM releases its planning parameters and FERC issues its ruling on the demand response market situation. However, the reality is that we, like you, will not know the May prices until the auction takes place. The long-term trend to us is clear, however. Capacity prices must rise moving from . 
Now as I said earlier, we're all aware that gas prices remain low. In the fourth quarter, we did see tangible increases in energy prices. We have forwards up about $3 per megawatt-hour. Some of that has sagged off in January, but prices still remain above the September 30 level. NiHub prices remain challenged, but our hedged prices in the Midwest are helping us here. We will continue our ratable hedging policy, which we've talked to you about many times. It has served us well in this period of low prices. And of course, Ken Cornew and his team, are constantly looking to lock in longer-term power contracts that give us both some value for our capacity and reflect the value of environmental costs in long-run price of energy. And while we don't get many with we look out in the longer term, we do see some that give us this sort of value.
So that is 2010 and 2011 as we see it. As I said earlier, we are simply very pleased with 2010 performance. And we see no reason why we can't do it again for you in 2011. Matt?"

This morning, I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year results and provide additional details for our 2011 earnings and cash forecast. My key message for today are on Slide 6.Starting with the fourth qua",1335,"Thank you, John. Happy new year, everyone. This morning, I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year results and provide additional details for our 2011 earnings and cash forecast. My key message for today are on Slide 6.
Starting with the fourth quarter, we achieved operating earnings of $0.96 per share for the quarter compared to $0.92 in earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2009. Our fourth quarter results remain reattributable to higher capacity revenues and higher nuclear volumes, partially offset by unfavorable market conditions and increased nuclear fuel costs.
For the year, Exelon 2010 operating earnings were $4.06 per share. We are very pleased with our financial performance for 2010, because we were able to deliver earnings well above our original guidance range despite the slow economic recovery anticipated a year ago. Now a few thoughts in our latest hedging activity and current market conditions. As we mentioned last quarter, and as you can see on Slide 8, we increased the pace of our hedging activity for 2012 during the first half of the year when prices were higher. And we had since slowed down as prices moved lower. Also as you can see on the chart on the left, we increased the percentage of put options during the year, which comprised most of our sales the purely ratable sales plan. The use of put options provides downside price production that allows us to capture higher prices as they rise.
The chart on the right highlights the PJM West hub energy prices continued to improve with some contribution from increasing Eastern coal prices. Midwest energy and natural gas prices have remained relatively unchanged over the past quarter. Our hedging disclosures, which are in the appendix of today's presentation, now incorporate all of Exelon wind's sales. Wind assets located in Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota are included in the Midwest region. All other wind assets are located in the South and West regions.
Moving to Slide 9, ComEd had a great year despite lower-than-expected load. ComEd was able to absorb increased storm costs and the impacts of an unfavorable Court of Appeals ruling, principally due to their proactive focus on cost management. ComEd's load results are on Slide 10. A weak economy continues to weigh on ComEd load. ComEd's weather normalized load in the fourth quarter of 2010 declined by 1.2% driven by lower residential usage, which was largely the result of the continued impact of high unemployment and higher foreclosures in the Chicagoland region. Chicagoland's regional unemployment rate of 9.3% is in line with the U.S. rate, while the GDP of 1.6% rides right behind the U.S. statistics.
Looking ahead to 2011, we are expecting flat usage next year compared to 0.2% for 2010. We believe that the Chicago economy is gradually turning a corner. However, we expect the improvement in the residential class will be offset by the efficiency efforts. And large C&I growth will be slower, reflecting the stability of the gains experienced in 2010.
Turning to PECO on Slide 11. PECO also had a very good year and delivered solid earnings despite historic summer storms. As expected, PECO's fourth quarter results were lower than last year due to the scheduled reduction in the collection of CTC revenue. As a reminder, this was the last year of PECO's CTC revenue collections, as PECO has made its full transition to competitive markets.
On Slide 12, PECO's weather normal load was flat for the fourth quarter and essentially flat for the year. In the fourth quarter, PECO experienced positive growth in the large C&I class, which was offset by decreases in residential and small C&I classes.
Looking ahead to 2011, we expect PECO's electric deliveries to be flat consistent with 2010, as a result of larger energy efficiency impacts in 2011 that will offset economic improvement particularly in the residential class and large C&I classes. Small C&I sales are expected to contract this year at a lesser rate than in 2010.
Turning to 2011 earnings outlook, we're expecting another good year for Exelon, with operating earnings in the range of $3.90 to $4.20 of earnings per share for the full year and first quarter results in the range of $1 to $1.10 per share. Exelon's 2011 operating earnings will be led by ExGen, primarily due to the expiration of the PECO Power Purchase Agreement with ExGen. Under our normal hedging policy, ExGen has been locking in forward sales of its 2011 expected generation at market rates since 2008.
2011 effective realized energy prices for the Mid-Atlantic are expected to be approximately $20 per megawatt-hour higher than they were in 2010. A portion of this increased revenue will be offset by lower capacity prices once the 2011 and '12 planning year rates are effected in June. We expect ComEd and PECO's 2011 operating income will be supported by increased distribution rates. PECO's new distribution rates are effective at the beginning of 2011. For ComEd, new distribution rates subject to approval will be effective in June. Our full year operating earnings estimates also reflect higher state taxes of $0.03 attributable to recently enacted Illinois income tax rate increase.
On Slide 13, our 2011 earnings guidance assumes O&M on a consolidated basis of $4.68 billion, a $290 million increase over 2010 primarily driven by three items: first, $90 million for wage and inflationary increases; second, $55 million for increased nuclear costs driven by two more outages in 2011 than in 2010; and third, $50 million for the inclusion of a complete year of O&M projections for Exelon Wind. Going forward, we expect future O&M increases for Exelon to be more in line with a 2% growth rate particularly in 2012 and 2013.
Our pension estimates on Slide 14 reflect our year-end valuation in the $2.1 billion pension contribution announced earlier this month. The incremental contribution will be funded by $500 million of cash from operations, $850 million bonus depreciation benefits and $750 million in tax benefits from the contribution itself.
Slide 15 has more information as to why we decided to make the $2.1 billion contribution to Exelon's pension plans. Under the Pension Protection Act effective in 2008, we are effectively required to fund our pension obligations over a seven-year period. With this contribution, our funded status is expected to be about 90% by the end of the year. Accelerating our funding enables us to reduce the risk on the balance sheet and reduce the sensitivity of our funded status and contribution requirements to future changes in the discount rate.
The pension contribution improves cash flow due to lower future funding requirements particularly in 2012 and 2013. It also pension expense, provides additional cushion in our already strong credit metrics and creates additional debt capacity.
Moving to Slide 16, we expect operating cash flows of $4.3 billion in 2011. And combined with our strong credit metrics, we are well positioned to meet our operating commitments, make investments in growth opportunities and fund the dividend. As you can see, we expect to spend approximately $700 million at ExGen for investments to operate the wind projects. As planned, we will continue work in our operating projects across the fleet including any more uprate projects at Wood, Byron, Limerick and, all of which are expected to be fully operational over the next few years and EPU projects at. We will also continue the completion of the three Michigan wind projects that were in advanced stages of development at the time of the acquisition. At the utilities, we anticipate spending over $400 million on new business Smart Grid investments and transmission upgrades.
As shown on Slide 17, John has discussed many of the key events that we are focused on 2011. As we actively work our way through 2011, we will continue to focus on managing our costs, anticipating events that can have a significant impact in our business and adapting accordingly to maximize opportunities and minimize challenges.

We expected a decline in MACT part of the year but not as dramatically as we saw. And I think our view of that, you have to break it down by class. The large C&I performed very well throughout the year. I think it overall increased of about 2.6%. We have some sectors that were in manufacturing sectors, where we saw double digit increases. So overall, that sector's strong. Residential underperformed, then small C&I continues to underperform for us. I think we're seeing generally the Chicago economy lagging what we see nationally. Our foreclosure rates are higher. Repossessions are up 20% over 2009. Personal bankruptcies is up pretty significantly over 2009. Disposable income is not up. So we're just seeing general tough economic trends in our region. And the other dynamic that we think impacted residential here is we had the hottest July in 15 years. So we had very high bills during the summer. We thought our center rate increased by about 23%, and was driven predominantly by customers concerned about high bills. And we may have seen a reaction coming off that hot summer. So that's the way we're interpreting it. We're looking over 2011 flat, which is we revised. Originally, we thought we were going to see a little pickup in 2011. But based on this trend with the economy in the Chicago region, we're looking to a flat 2011."

Happy new year. 2010 was another year of fine operating and financial performance for Exelon. I'll start with some of the key factors. As you know, from our earnings release, our operating earnings were $4.06 p",1993,"Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Stacie. Happy new year. 
2010 was another year of fine operating and financial performance for Exelon. I'll start with some of the key factors. As you know, from our earnings release, our operating earnings were $4.06 per share, handily beating our original expectations for the year and at the top end of the range we provided you last quarter.
We accomplished this through a strict attention to cost control across the business. We met our target for operating O&M for 2010, despite starting the year with pension and OPEB expense that was $35 million higher than 2009 and a challenge in our budget of $100 million to offset rising costs. This was our second straight year of delivering O&M below the 2008 level of $4.5 billion. Revenues in Exelon Generation were helped by better-than-expected market conditions across the portfolio. Higher capacity prices from the scheduled reset of PJM capacity rate were expected but nonetheless helped in delivering on our commitments. 
At both ComEd and PECO, weather effects, particularly in the summer months increased earnings over last year by about $0.16 per share. I would point out that we saw very little load growth in either company, although, we're always a little uncertain about our weather I just mentioned. There may be a little more than we're seeing, but it was basically very close to flat.
We generated cash from operations of $5.3 billion, $1 million more than our original expectations. Our higher net income, our tax planning work and cash benefits from bonus depreciation were the primary drivers. Our cash generation in 2010 allowed us to contribute $765 million to the pension plans, including a $500 million voluntary contribution last August. Separately, we contributed $200 million to our OPEB plans. And of course, the best thing of all, is that we returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders through the dividend, which we held stable at $2.10 per share.
In operations, both ComEd and PECO maintained strong performance, while managing costs despite intense storms. In each case, we were a little disappointed in the duration indices, although I believe we're either in first quartile or close to it. But we were very pleased by our frequency of interruption. ComEd achieved its highest customer satisfaction scores in more than five years, and PECO had its best ever customer satisfaction scores. Exelon Nuclear turned in its eighth consecutive year of capacity factors over 93%. While that starts to sound routine, it's simply isn't. The management focus that goes into consistent operations at these levels, with a fleet our size, is a clear competitive advantage for Exelon. 
We added 59 megawatts of new nuclear generation to the fleet through our uprate plan. We have another 98 megawatts projected to be added in 2011 across a number of sites including Limerick, LaSalle and Quad Cities. For Exelon Power, 2010 marked our first acquisition of wind assets with the acquisition of John Deere Renewables, now, of course, called Exelon Wind. This portfolio positions us as an important player in renewables policy-making. And as we told you before, we have long-term contracts to lock in our earnings expectation and cash flow. As was suggested in the President's speech last night, we have continued growth in requirements to purchase renewables. This puts Exelon in the place of selling as well as buying.
We also lived by our own creed and advocacy in retiring some of our oldest plants. We received FERC approval for short-term RMR agreements on Cromby and Eddystone through the retirement dates that we've announced in 2011 and '12. We also resolved a long-standing dispute with the state of New Jersey regarding the early retirement of our nuclear plant at Oyster Creek. This provides certainty that we will not be required to install cooling towers, which the plant simply could not afford, while still allowing us to capture the majority of the estimated remaining value in the sites. 
We are preparing the transmission system for a cleaner future. We move forward with $178 million of transmission upgrades in downtown Chicago. We expect to complete these by the end of 2011. Our transmission team is pursuing high-voltage transmission development across the Midwest to move renewable energy to where it is needed most. And Exelon Generation is taking steps to reduce congestion around our units through projects like the transformer replacement in our Clinton Station that is planned for the fourth quarter.
So let me say that I am very pleased with what our management achieved in 2010. This was a tough year, and across the board, PECO, ComEd, Nuclear, Power Team, Exelon Power, our Business Service group, on a business [ph] met their cost goals. And in the case, Power Team found ways to get some extra revenue in a very challenging power market.
Now turning to 2011. As you've seen in the morning's release, we are expecting another good year, with operating earnings somewhere in the range of $3.90 to $4.20 per share. Our estimate reflects a number of items, which go in both directions. PECO has now transitioned to fully deregulated markets, and new electric and gas distribution rate went into effect on January 1. The below-market power purchase agreement between PECO and Exelon Generation ended, which will allow Generation to realize about $20 more per megawatt-hour in 2011 on power sold to PECO customers. 
Exelon Energy, our retail sales arm, is growing its presence in the East as a result of PECO going to market. The pricing on financial swap between Generation and ComEd had a scheduled increase at the beginning of the year, adding about $150 million of revenue, net fuel over 2010 levels. Our financial results will continue to be helped by the hedges put on by Power Team for 2011, which were in the money by over $1.7 billion at year end. That includes the swap in Illinois as well as the other contracts in other regions.
We expect demand at both ComEd and PECO to again be flat on a weather-normal basis. Now on the other hand, we of course must continue to limit cost increases and to work ever harder on financial discipline across the enterprise. PECO had a favorable rate case settlement during the year. ComEd is working hard with other utilities in Illinois to pursue a legislative proposal, to invest in modernizing the grid in return for a formula rate structure. While it is too soon to tell the outcome, the proposal would be an economic development engine for the state and would give ComEd more timely and predictable regulatory mechanism for recovering its costs. 
As we have reported before, tax legislation passed in December accelerate $1 billion of cash flows. We are using that along with other funds and the tax benefits thereof to make a $2.1 billion contribution to the pension plan. Using the funds for this purpose meets our obligation to our employees. It reduces the long-term corporate liability and takes advantage of the tax deductibility of the contributions. It means that our future operating cash flows are more available for things like our nuclear uprate and other long-term growth opportunities. Needless to say, it also makes those more available to protect your dividend. We of course, radically improved the funded status of the pension plan, and this allows us to accelerate our plans to rebalance the asset mix of the trust. And what we're doing is moving from our credited equity contribution to a higher level of debt, so that we reduce the volatility and match the assets more closely to the lighter terms.
Now, 2011 is one that could bring a lot of things that bear on our future value. These include environmental regulations, changes in energy and capacity markets and the prospects for the broader economy. We believe, and every check we make confirms, that EPA will issue its proposed rules for hazardous air pollutants in March, and the final rules are scheduled for later this year. Both because EPA is committed to this end and because there are legal requirements under court order, we expect EPA to move vigorously in this regard. We all know there will be a great deal of political debate about whether these regulations are, in some way, too much too soon. Since we haven't seen them, we can't opine on whether they're too much, but the Clean Air Act's been around for a long time and compliance requirements are hardly a surprise.
EPA has shown what we believe to be commendable reasonableness on the 316 b Clean Water rules. The agency has indicated that it expects to issue those rules in March as well. Final rules on 316 b are expected in mid-2012 with compliance phased over some period after that. Lisa Jackson, the EPA Administrator, has stated that a one-size-fits-all approach does not work and that closed-cycle cooling may not be the right technology at all plants. We believe that to be good news for Exelon and the entire industry. So there will be a great deal of news on the EPA front.
With respect to energy and capacity markets, the situation remains murky. As you all know, gas prices remain low. We are, of course, very interested in the results of the late capacity auction in PJM. We believe they will be higher than last year's results. The question is, how much higher? The reduced demand forecast from PJM will exert some downward pressure on the markets. It is possible that the recent New Jersey legislation to pay for new gas plants will also be a downward force. However, we believe that under FERC precedent, FERC will move to require a reasonable minimum bid price for these units and do so in time for May's RPM auction. We are also evaluating other options on how we would respond in the event the governor signs this legislation into law.
There are very large number of factors affecting the result of May's capacity prices. These include the amount of demand response to participation, the number of plant retirements that are definite, and bidding behavior reflecting what people really can commit themselves to do with coal plants in the face of both gas prices and the coming EPA legislations. They also reflect the timing of transmission upgrade. We keep trying to evaluate all of these moving parts, as do you, and we will do our best to put them all together again once PJM releases its planning parameters and FERC issues its ruling on the demand-response market saturation. However, the reality is that we, like you, will not know the May prices until the auction takes place in May. The long-term trend to us is clear, however, capacity prices must rise if new interests are to be recorded [ph]. 
Now as I said earlier, we're all aware that gas prices remain low. In the fourth quarter, we did see tangible increases in energy prices. We had West Hub forwards up about $3 per megawatt-hour. Some of that has sagged off in January, but prices still remain above the September 30 level. NiHub prices remain challenged, but our hedged prices in the Midwest are helping us here. We will continue our ratable hedging policy, which we've talked to you about many times. It has served us well through this period of low prices. And of course, Ken Cornew and his team, are constantly looking to lock in longer-term power contracts that give us both some value for our capacity and reflect the value of environmental costs in the long-run price of energy. And while we don't get many, what we look out is the longer term. We do see some that give us this sort of value.
So that is 2010 and 2011 as we see it. As I said earlier, we are simply very pleased with 2010 performance. And we see no reason why we can't do it again for you in 2011. Matt?"
296181,118302377,95561,"Exelon Corp., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2011",2011-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Exelon Corporation","Executives","Thank you, John. Happy New Year, everyone. This morning, I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year results and provide additional details for our 2011 earnings and cash forecast. My key message for today are on Slide 6.Starting with the fourth qua",1345,"Thank you, John. Happy New Year, everyone. This morning, I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year results and provide additional details for our 2011 earnings and cash forecast. My key message for today are on Slide 6.
Starting with the fourth quarter, we achieved operating earnings of $0.96 per share for the quarter, compared to $0.92 in earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2009. Our fourth quarter results were mainly attributable to higher capacity revenues and higher nuclear volumes, partially offset by unfavorable market conditions and increased nuclear fuel costs.
For the year, Exelon's 2010 operating earnings were $4.06 per share. We are very pleased with our financial performance for 2010, because we were able to deliver earnings well above our original guidance range despite the slower economic recovery anticipated a year ago. Now a few thoughts on our latest hedging activity and current market conditions. As we mentioned last quarter, and as you can see on Slide 8, we increased the pace of our hedging activity for 2012 during the first half of the year when prices were higher. And we have since slowed down as prices moved lower. Also, as you can see on the chart on the left, we increased the percentage of put options during the year, which comprised most of our sales above the purely ratable sales plan. The use of put options provides downside price protection that allows us to capture higher prices as they rise.
The chart on the right highlights that PJM West hub energy prices continued to improve with some contribution from increasing Eastern coal prices. Midwest energy and natural gas prices have remained relatively unchanged over the past quarter. Our hedging disclosures, which are in the appendix of today's presentation, now incorporate all of Exelon Wind's sales. Wind assets located in Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota are included in the Midwest region. All other Wind assets are located in the South and West region.
Moving to Slide 9, ComEd had a great year despite lower-than-expected load. ComEd was able to absorb increased storm costs and the impacts of an unfavorable Court of Appeals ruling, principally due to their proactive focus on cost management. ComEd's load results are on Slide 10. A weak economy continues to weigh on ComEd's load growth. ComEd's weather-normal load growth for the fourth quarter of 2010 declined by 1.2%, driven by lower residential usage, which was largely a result of the continued impact of high unemployment and higher foreclosures in the Chicagoland region. Chicagoland's regional unemployment rate of 9.3% is in line with the U.S. rate, while the GDP of 1.6% for the region lags behind the U.S. statistics.
Looking ahead to 2011, we are expecting flat usage next year compared to 0.2% for 2010. We believe that the Chicago economy is gradually turning a corner. However, we expect the improvement in the residential class will be offset by the efficiency efforts. And large C&I growth will be slower, reflecting the stability of the gains experienced in 2010.
Turning to PECO on Slide 11. PECO also had a very good year and delivered solid earnings despite historic summer storms. As expected, PECO's fourth quarter results were lower than last year due to the scheduled reduction in the collection of CTC revenue. As a reminder, this was the last year of PECO's CTC revenue collections, as PECO has made its full transition to competitive markets.
On Slide 12, PECO's weather-normal load was flat for the fourth quarter and essentially flat for the year. In the fourth quarter, PECO experienced positive growth in the large C&I class, which was offset by decreases in residential and small C&I classes.
Looking ahead to 2011, we expect PECO's electric deliveries to be flat consistent with 2010, as a result of larger energy efficiency impacts in 2011 that will offset economic improvements, particularly in the residential class and large C&I classes. Small C&I sales are expected to contract this year, but at a lesser rate than in 2010.
Turning to 2011 earnings outlook, we're expecting another good year for Exelon, with operating earnings in the range of $3.90 to $4.20 of earnings per share for the full year and first quarter results in the range of $1 to $1.10 per share. Exelon's 2011 operating earnings will be led by ExGen, primarily due to the expiration of the PECO power purchase agreement with ExGen. Under our normal hedging policy, ExGen has been locking in forward sales of its 2011 expected generation at market rates since 2008.
2011 effective realized energy prices for the Mid-Atlantic are expected to be approximately $20 per megawatt-hour higher than they were in 2010. A portion of this increased revenue will be offset by lower capacity prices once the 2011 and '12 planning year rates are effective in June. We expect ComEd and PECO's 2011 operating income will be supported by increased distribution rates. PECO's new distribution rates were effective at the beginning of 2011. For ComEd, new distribution rates subject to approval will be effective in June. Our full year operating earnings estimates also reflect higher state taxes of $0.03 attributable to the recently enacted Illinois income tax rate increase.
On Slide 13, our 2011 earnings guidance assumes O&M on a consolidated basis of $4.68 billion, a $290 million increase over 2010 primarily driven by three items: First, $90 million for wage and inflationary increases; second, $55 million for increased nuclear costs driven by two more outages in 2011 than in 2010; and third, $50 million for the inclusion of a complete year of O&M projections for Exelon Wind. Going forward, we expect future O&M increases for Exelon to be more in line with a 2% growth rate particularly in 2012 and 2013.
Our pension estimates on Slide 14 reflect our year-end valuation and the $2.1 billion pension contribution announced earlier this month. The incremental contribution will be funded by $500 million of cash from operations, $850 million bonus depreciation benefits and $750 million in tax benefits from the contribution itself.
Slide 15 has more information as to why we decided to make the $2.1 billion contribution to Exelon's pension plans. Under the Pension Protection Act effective in 2008, we are effectively required to fund our pension obligation over a seven-year period. With this contribution, our funded status is expected to be about 90% by the end of the year. Accelerating our funding enables us to reduce the risk on the balance sheet and reduce the sensitivity of our funded status and contribution requirements to future changes in the discount rate.
The pension contribution improves cash flow due to lower future funding requirements, particularly in 2012 and 2013. It also lowers pension expense, provides additional cushion in our already strong credit metrics and creates additional debt capacity.
Moving to Slide 16, we expect operating cash flows of $4.3 billion in 2011. And combined with our strong credit metrics, we are well positioned to meet our operating commitments, make investments in growth opportunities and fund the dividend. As you can see, we expect to spend approximately $700 million at ExGen for investments in operating wind projects. As planned, we will continue work on our uprate projects across the fleet, including MUR uprate projects at Braidwood, Byron, Limerick and LaSalle, all of which are expected to be fully operational over the next few years and EPU projects at Peach Bottom and LaSalle. We will also continue the completion of the three Michigan wind projects that were in advanced stages of development at the time of the acquisition. At the utilities, we anticipate spending over $400 million on new business Smart Grid investments and transmission upgrades.
As shown on Slide 17, John has discussed many of the key events that we are focused on 2011. As we actively work our way through 2011, we will continue to focus on managing our costs, anticipating events that can have a significant impact on our business and adapting accordingly to maximize opportunities and minimize challenges.

Forward prices and heat rates have moved up more aggressively in the Mid-Atlantic than in the Midwest in the past quarter. And obviously in January, they've come back a bit as John mentioned. I still think there is upside, particularly in heat rates at NiHub. We've talked about how could impact our prices. We think there might be a little bit of that in the forward market, but not much of it. We talked about how MACT standards in '14 and '15 could improve prices more significantly.

We expected a decline in that part of the year but not as dramatically as we saw. And I think our view of that, you have to break it down by class. The large C&I performed very well throughout the year. I think it overall increased at about 2.6%. And we have some sectors that were in solar manufacturing sectors, where we saw double digit increases. So overall, that sector's strong. Residential underperformed, and small C&I continues to underperform for us. I think we're seeing generally, the Chicago economy lagging what we see nationally. Our foreclosure rates are higher. Repossessions were up 20% over 2009. Personal bankruptcies is up pretty significantly over 2009. Disposable income is not up. So we're just seeing general tough economic trends in our region. And the other dynamic that we think, impacted residential here is we had the hottest July in 15 years. So we had very high bills during the summer. We saw our center rate increased by about 23%, and that was driven predominantly by customers concerned about high bills. And we may have seen a reaction coming off that hot summer. So that's the way we're interpreting it. We're looking out to 2011 flat, which is we revised. Originally, we thought we were going to see a little pickup in 2011.

There were a couple of plants there that could support it. Arguably, you would say the same about Oyster Creek. I mean we thought it should run for another 20 years without the towers.

But EPA technically does not mix its air and water decisions together. Their different statutes administered by different arms of the agency. But there is an overriding economic issue here, which is EPA and the administration are not going to enforce their regulations in a way that makes 2/3 or 3/4 of the power plants in the country uneconomic. And the real issue I think on water is to get at those that are in the most environmentally sensitive area, and on air, to shut down the oldest, dirtiest and least economic. A very strong case can be made and we have hired consultants to do it, then you can replace 20% to 30% of the coal fleet. And mostly, it could be picked up easily by existing or new gas fired capacity. But I don't think -- once those numbers get up in the 30%, 35% range, the economic costs become much more challenging. And you put too many things together, you start to few away the tea-party objections there to what the EPA is doing. And so I think you see some rough practical balance emerge. And I still think that balance will be good for us."

Happy New Year. 2010 was another year of fine operating and financial performance for Exelon. I'll start with some of the key factors. As you know, from our earnings release, our operating earnings were $4.06 p",1985,"Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Stacie. Happy New Year. 
2010 was another year of fine operating and financial performance for Exelon. I'll start with some of the key factors. As you know, from our earnings release, our operating earnings were $4.06 per share, handily beating our original expectations for the year and at the top end of the range we provided you last quarter.
We accomplished this through a strict attention to cost control across the business. We met our target for operating O&M for 2010, despite starting the year with pension and OPEB expense that was $35 million higher than 2009 and a challenge in our budget of $100 million to offset rising costs. This was our second straight year of delivering O&M below the 2008 level of $4.5 billion. Revenues in Exelon Generation were helped by better-than-expected market conditions across the portfolio. Higher capacity prices from the scheduled reset of PJM capacity rates were expected but nonetheless helped in delivering on our commitments. 
At both ComEd and PECO, weather effects, particularly in the summer months increased earnings over last year by about $0.16 per share. I would point out that we saw very little load growth in either company, although, we're always a little uncertain about our weather assessments. There may be a little more than we're seeing, but it was basically very close to flat.
We generated cash from operations of $5.3 billion, $1 million more than our original expectations. Our higher net income, our tax planning work and cash benefits from bonus depreciation were the primary drivers. Our cash generation in 2010 allowed us to contribute $765 million to the pension plans, including a $500 million voluntary contribution last August. Separately, we contributed $200 million to our OPEB plans. And of course, the best thing of all is that we returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders through the dividend, which we held stable at $2.10 per share.
In operations, both ComEd and PECO maintained strong performance, while managing costs despite intense storms. In each case, we were a little disappointed in the duration indices, although I believe we're either in first quartile or close to it. But we were very pleased by our frequency of interruption. ComEd achieved its highest customer satisfaction scores in more than five years, and PECO had its best ever customer satisfaction scores. Exelon Nuclear turned in its eighth consecutive year of capacity factors over 93%. While that starts to sound routine, it's simply isn't. The management focus that goes into consistent operations at these levels, with a fleet our size, is a clear competitive advantage for Exelon. 
We added 59 megawatts of new nuclear generation to the fleet through our uprate plan. We have another 98 megawatts projected to be added in 2011 across a number of sites including Limerick, LaSalle and Quad Cities. For Exelon Power, 2010 marked our first acquisition of wind assets with the acquisition of John Deere Renewables, now, of course, called Exelon Wind. This portfolio positions us as an important player in renewables policy-making. And as we told you before, we have long-term contracts to lock in our earnings expectation and cash flow. If it’s suggested in the President's speech last night, we have continued growth in requirements to purchase renewables. This puts Exelon in the place of selling as well as buying.
We also lived by our own creed and advocacy in retiring some of our oldest plants. We received FERC approval for short-term RMR agreements on Cromby and Eddystone through the retirement dates that we've announced in 2011 and '12. We also solved the long-standing dispute with the state of New Jersey regarding the early retirement of our nuclear plant at Oyster Creek. This provides certainty that we will not be required to install cooling towers, which the plant simply could not afford, while still allowing us to capture the majority of the estimated remaining value in the site. 
We are preparing the transmission system for a cleaner future. We move forward with $178 million of transmission upgrades in downtown Chicago. We expect to complete these by the end of 2011. Our transmission team is pursuing high-voltage transmission development across the Midwest to move renewable energy to where it is needed most. And Exelon Generation is taking steps to reduce congestion around our units through projects like the transformer replacement near Clinton Station that is planned for the fourth quarter.
So let me say that I am very pleased with what our management achieved in 2010. This was a tough year, and across the board, PECO, ComEd, Nuclear, Power Team, Exelon Power, our Business Service group, on a business entities met their cost goals. And in the case, Power Team found ways to get some extra revenue in a very challenging power market.
Now turning to 2011. As you've seen in the morning's release, we are expecting another good year, with operating earnings somewhere in the range of $3.90 to $4.20 per share. Our estimate reflects a number of items, which go in both directions. PECO has now transitioned to fully deregulated markets, and new electric and gas distribution rates went into effect on January 1. The below-market power purchase agreement between PECO and Exelon Generation ended, which will allow Generation to realize about $20 more per megawatt-hour in 2011 on power sold to PECO customers. 
Exelon Energy, our retail sales arm, is growing its presence in the East as a result of PECO going to market. The pricing on financial swap between Generation and ComEd had a scheduled increase at the beginning of the year, adding about $150 million of revenue, net fuel over 2010 levels. Our financial results will continue to be helped by the hedges put on by Power Team for 2011, which were in the money by over $1.7 billion at year end. That includes the swap in Illinois as well as the other contracts in other regions.
We expect demand at both ComEd and PECO to again be flat on a weather-normal basis. Now on the other hand, we of course must continue to limit cost increases and to work ever harder on financial discipline across the enterprise. PECO had a favorable rate case settlement during the year. ComEd is working hard with other utilities in Illinois to pursue a legislative proposal, to invest in modernizing the grid in return for a formula rate structure. While it is too soon to tell the outcome, the proposal would be an economic development engine for the state and would give ComEd more timely and predictable regulatory mechanism for recovering its costs. 
As we have reported before, tax legislation passed in December accelerates $1 billion of cash flows. We are using that along with other funds and the tax benefits thereof to make a $2.1 billion contribution to the pension plan. Using the funds for this purpose meets our obligation to our employees. It reduces a long-term corporate liability and takes advantage of the tax deductibility of the contributions. It means that our future operating cash flows are more available for things like our nuclear uprate and other long-term growth opportunities. Needless to say, it also makes those more available to protect your dividend. We of course, radically improved the funded status of the pension plan, and this allows us to accelerate our plans to rebalance the asset mix of the trust. And what we're doing is moving from our present equity contribution to a higher level of debt, so that we reduce the volatility and match the assets more closely to the liabilities.
Now, 2011 is going to bring a lot of things that bear on our future value. These include environmental regulations, changes in energy and capacity markets and the prospects for the broader economy. We believe, and every check we make confirms, that EPA will issue its proposed rules for hazardous air pollutants in March, and the final rules are scheduled for later this year. Both because EPA is committed to this end and because there are legal requirements under court order, we expect EPA to move vigorously in this regard. We all know there will be a great deal of political debate about whether these regulations are, in some way, too much too soon. Since we haven't seen them, we can't opine on whether they're too much, but the Clean Air Act's been around for a long time and compliance requirements are hardly a surprise.
EPA has shown what we believe to be commendable reasonableness on the 316 b Clean Water rules. The agency has indicated that it expects to issue those rules in March as well. Final rules on 316 b are expected in mid-2012 with compliance staged over some period after that. Lisa Jackson, the EPA Administrator, has stated that a one-size-fits-all approach does not work and that closed-cycle cooling may not be the right technology at all plants. We believe that to be good news for Exelon and the entire industry. So there will be a great deal of news on the EPA front.
With respect to energy and capacity markets, situation remains murky. As you all know, gas prices remain low. We are, of course, very interested in the results of the May capacity auction in PJM. We believe they will be higher than last year's results. The question is, how much higher? The reduced demand forecast from PJM will exert some downward pressure on the markets. It is possible that the recent New Jersey legislation to pay for new gas plants will also be a downward force. However, we believe that under FERC precedent, FERC will move to require a reasonable minimum bid price for these units and do so in time for May's RPM option auction. We are also evaluating other options on how we would respond in the event the governor signs this legislation into law.
There are very large number of factors affecting the result of May's capacity prices. These include the amount of demand responsive participation, the number of plant retirements that are definite, and bidding behavior reflecting what people really can commit themselves to do with coal plants in the face of both gas prices and the coming EPA regulation. They also reflect timing of transmission upgrade. We keep trying to evaluate all of these moving parts, as do you, and we will do our best to put them all together again once PJM releases its planning parameters and FERC issues its ruling on the demand-response market saturation. However, the reality is that we, like you, will not know the May prices until the auction takes place in May. The long-term trend to us is clear, however, capacity prices must rise if new entrants and to be afforded. 
Now as I said earlier, we're all aware that gas prices remain low. In the fourth quarter, we did see tangible increases in energy prices. We had West Hub forwards up about $3 per megawatt-hour. Some of that has sagged off in January, but prices still remain above the September 30 level. NiHub prices remain challenge, but our hedge prices in the Midwest are helping us here. We will continue our ratable hedging policy, which we've talked to you about many times. It has served us well through this period of low prices. And of course, Ken Cornew and his team are constantly looking to lock in longer-term power contracts that give us both some value for our capacity and reflect the value of environmental costs in the long-run price of energy. And while we don't get many, when we look out in the longer term we do see some that give us this sort of value.
So that is 2010 and 2011 as we see it. As I said earlier, we are simply very pleased with 2010 performance. And we see no reason why we can't do it again for you in 2011. Matt?"

This morning, I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year results and provide additional details for our 2011 earnings and cash forecast. My key messages for today are on Slide 6.Starting with the fourth qu",1343,"Thank you, John. Happy New Year, everyone. This morning, I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year results and provide additional details for our 2011 earnings and cash forecast. My key messages for today are on Slide 6.
Starting with the fourth quarter, we achieved operating earnings of $0.96 per share for the quarter, compared to $0.92 in earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2009. Our fourth quarter results were mainly attributable to higher capacity revenues and higher nuclear volumes partially offset by unfavorable market conditions and increased nuclear fuel costs.
For the year, Exelon's 2010 operating earnings were $4.06 per share. We are very pleased with our financial performance for 2010, because we were able to deliver earnings well above our original guidance range despite the slower economic recovery anticipated a year ago. Now a few thoughts on our latest hedging activity and current market conditions. As we mentioned last quarter and as you can see on Slide 8, we increased the pace of our hedging activity for 2012 during the first half of the year when prices were higher. And we have since slowed down as prices moved lower. Also, as you can see on the chart on the left, we increased the percentage of put options during the year, which comprised most of our sales above purely ratable sales plan. The use of put options provides downside price protection but allows us to capture higher prices as they rise.
Chart on the right highlights that PJM West hub energy prices continued to improve with some contribution from increasing Eastern coal prices. Midwest energy and natural gas prices have remained relatively unchanged over the past quarter. Our hedging disclosures, which are in the appendix of today's presentation, now incorporate all of Exelon Wind's sales. Wind assets located in Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota are included in the Midwest region. All other Wind assets are located in the South and West region.
Moving to Slide 9, ComEd had a great year despite lower-than-expected load. ComEd was able to absorb increased storm costs and the impacts of an unfavorable Court of Appeals ruling, principally due to their proactive focus on cost management. ComEd's load results are on Slide 10. A weak economy continues to weigh on ComEd's load growth. ComEd's weather-normal load growth for the fourth quarter of 2010 declined by 1.2%, driven by lower residential usage which was largely a result of the continued impact of high unemployment and higher foreclosures in the Chicagoland region. Chicagoland's regional unemployment rate of 9.3% is in line with the U.S. rate, while the GEP of 1.6% for the region lags behind the U.S. statistics.
Looking ahead to 2011, we are expecting flat usage next year compared to 0.2% for 2010. We believe that the Chicago economy is gradually turning a corner. However, we expect the improvement in the residential class will be offset by the efficiency efforts and large C&I growth will be slower, reflecting the stability of the gains experienced in 2010.
Turning to PECO on Slide 11. PECO also had a very good year and delivered solid earnings despite historic summer storms. As expected, PECO's fourth quarter results were lower than last year due to the scheduled reduction in the collection of CTC revenue. As a reminder, this was the last year of PECO's CTC revenue collections, as PECO has made its full transition to competitive markets.
On Slide 12, PECO's weather-normal load was flat for the fourth quarter and essentially flat for the year. In the fourth quarter, PECO experienced positive growth in the large C&I class, which was offset by decreases in residential and small C&I classes.
Looking ahead to 2011, we expect PECO's electric deliveries to be flat consistent with 2010, as a result of larger energy efficiency impacts in 2011 that will offset economic improvements, particularly in the residential class and large C&I classes. Small C&I sales are expected to contract this year, but at a lesser rate than in 2010.
Turning to 2011 earnings outlook, we're expecting another good year for Exelon, with operating earnings in the range of $3.90 to $4.20 earnings per share for the full year and first quarter results in the range of $1 to $1.10 per share. Exelon's 2011 operating earnings will be led by ExGen, primarily due to the expiration of the PECO power purchase agreement with ExGen. Under our normal hedging policy, ExGen has been locking in forward sales of its 2011 expected generation at market rates since 2008.
2011 effective realized energy prices for the Mid-Atlantic are expected to be approximately $20 per megawatt-hour higher than they were in 2010. A portion of this increased revenue will be offset by lower capacity prices once the 2011 and '12 planning year rates are effective in June. We expect ComEd and PECO's 2011 operating income will be supported by increased distribution rates. PECO's new distribution rates were effective at the beginning of 2011. For ComEd, new distribution rates subject to approval will be effective in June. Our full year operating earnings estimates also reflect higher state taxes of $0.03 attributable to the recently enacted Illinois income tax rate increase.
On Slide 13, our 2011 earnings guidance assumes O&M on a consolidated basis of $4.68 billion, a $290 million increase over 2010 primarily driven by three items: First, $90 million for wage and inflationary increases; second, $55 million for increased nuclear costs driven by two more outages in 2011 than in 2010; and third, $50 million for the inclusion of a complete year of O&M projections for Exelon Wind. Going forward, we expect future O&M increases for Exelon to be more in line with a 2% growth rate particularly in 2012 and 2013.
Our pension estimates on Slide 14 reflect our year-end valuation and the $2.1 billion pension contribution announced earlier this month. The incremental contribution will be funded by $500 million of cash from operations, $850 million bonus depreciation benefits and $750 million in tax benefits from the contribution itself.
Slide 15 has more information as to why we decided to make the $2.1 billion contribution to Exelon's pension plans. Under the Pension Protection Act effective in 2008, we are effectively required to fund our pension obligation over a seven-year period. With this contribution, our funded status is expected to be about 90% by the end of the year. Accelerating our funding enables us to reduce the risk on the balance sheet and reduce the sensitivity of our funded status and contribution requirements to future changes in the discount rate.
The pension contribution improves cash flow due to lower future funding requirements, particularly in 2012 and 2013. It also lowers pension expense, provides additional cushion in our already strong credit metrics and creates additional debt capacity.
Moving to Slide 16, we expect operating cash flows of $4.3 billion in 2011. And combined with our strong credit metrics, we are well positioned to meet our operating commitments, make investments in growth opportunities and fund the dividend. As you can see, we expect to spend approximately $700 million at ExGen for investments in uprates and wind projects. As planned, we will continue work on our uprate projects across the fleet, including MUR uprate projects at Braidwood, Byron, Limerick and LaSalle, all of which are expected to be fully operational over the next few years and EPU projects at Peach Bottom and LaSalle. We will also continue the completion of the three Michigan wind projects that were in advanced stages of development at the time of the acquisition. At the utilities, we anticipate spending over $400 million on new business Smart Grid investments and transmission upgrades.
As shown on Slide 17, John has discussed many of the key events that we are focused on 2011. As we actively work our way through 2011, we will continue to focus on managing our costs, anticipating events that can have a significant impact on our business and adapting accordingly to maximize opportunities and minimize challenges.

We think there might be a little bit of that in the forward market, but not much of it. We talked about how MACT standards in '14 and '15 could improve prices more significantly.

And we have some sectors that were in, some of our manufacturing sectors, where we saw double digit increases. So I think overall, that sector's strong. Residential underperformed, and small C&I continues to underperform for us. I think we're seeing generally, the Chicago economy lagging what we see nationally. Our foreclosure rates are higher. Repossessions were up 20% over 2009. A personal bankruptcy is up pretty significantly over 2009. Disposable income is not up. So we're just seeing general tough economic trends in our region. And the other dynamic that we think, impacted residential here is we had the hottest July in 15 years. So we had very high bills during the summer. We saw our call center rate increased by about 23%, and that was driven predominantly by customers concerned about high bills. So we may have seen a reaction coming off that hot summer.

If I look at market heat rates, it looks like there's significantly more improvement in market heat rates in the Mid-Atlantic versus the Midwest from I guess, third quarter disclosures versus fourth quarter disclosures.

Dominion has quick-cooling towers in the Brayton Point Station in New England, a power plant I watch when I fly to see my mother-in-law, because -- and of course, used to run, and so I pay attention to it. And there, there were long years of studies on what was happening to the Winter Flounder population and what I think is called Mount Hope Bay. And it was sort of the accumulation of those studies over many years that I think motivated both EPA and Dominion and the ultimate settlement. It was also the value of the plant. There were a couple plants there that could support it. Arguably, you would say the same about Oyster Creek. I mean we thought it should run for another 20 years without the towers. But there were a lot of people who had studies of different weight in New Jersey saying there was localized impact in Barnegat Ba0079. And so you had a lot of political pressure surrounding it.

But there is an overriding economic issue here, which is EPA and the administration are not going to enforce their regulations in a way that makes 2/3 or 3/4 of the power plants in the country uneconomic. And the real issue I think on water is to get at those that are in the most environmentally sensitive area, and on air, to shut down the oldest, dirtiest and least economic. A very strong case can be made and we have helped hire consultants to do it, then you can replace 20% to 30% of the coal fleet and mostly, it can be picked up easily by existing or new gas fired capacity. But I don't think -- once those numbers get up in the 30%, 35% range, the economic costs become much more challenging. And you put too many things together you start fueling the Tea Party objections to everything EPA is doing. And so I think you see some rough practical balance emerge.

In the first quarter, we again turned in very strong operating and financial performance. Our operating earnings were $1.17 per share, which meet both our expectations and those we have read on the street. It won't always happen, but it sure is nice when it does. 
Our earnings at Generation were helped by the performance of our units in Texas during a February cold there. They were helped, as you would expect it, by the roll off of the PPA between Exelon Generation and PECO. They were also helped by the positive effects of bonus depreciation, which lowered Pennsylvania income tax. 
On the operating side, our nuclear fleet turned in a 94.8% capacity factor during the quarter. Congratulations to Chip Pardee and Mike. Our first quarter performance gives us confidence that we will be well within our guidance range for the full year of $3.90 to $4.20 per share. Matt will discuss the financial results in more detail shortly. 
I want to talk about a couple of other issues that concern you and concern us. The EPA proposed these rules last month on air toxics and on the 316(b). Both were proposed on time and in ways that were generally consistent with what we expected. We remain confident that EPA will issue the final toxics rule and expect that rule to go into effect and as planned with compliance in late 2014 or early 2015. There has been a lot of noise about these rules, and there will continue to be noise as people fight them. I don't think the noise will go away, but I don't expect Congress to do anything to change the rules. The EPA is simply enforcing the requirements of the existing Clean Air Act, as that act has been interpreted by the courts including the Supreme Court of the United States. The last major amendments to that act are now over 20 years old. Neither the rules nor their implementation should be a surprise to anyone. 
My confidence is bolstered by the fact that the Senate failed to pass legislation that would stop EPA from regulating greenhouse gases. That legislation only got 50 votes, so it seems highly unlikely that the Senate could find the required 60 votes it would need to block EPA's rules on mercury, arsenic or other toxins. If the Senate didn't choose to block carbon regulation, it is not going to pass legislation that most people believe will negatively impact the health of babies, children and pregnant women.
According to the EPA's estimates, the health benefits from controlling mercury could be as high as $140 billion, while the cost of compliance would only be around $11 billion. While one should take these with a little skepticism on both sides, it's hard to argue that the cost benefit differential is not huge. On 
the reliability front, the impact is manageable. Each FERC region has excess generation capacity. 2/3 of the coal fleet has already installed or is in the process of installing the controls necessary for compliance and much of the capacity from coal plants that do retire can be replaced by underutilized existing gas plants. 
For Exelon's fossil units, the proposed rules have minimal impact. We have already made the decision to retire our Eddystone 1 Units 1 and 2 and Cromby station, with the first 2 of these units set to retire at the end of next month. We are evaluating compliance options at Eddystone 3 and 4 and oil. Our share of the expected compliance costs at Station, where we own 21%, is expected to be small. Coupled with the rules, which will be finalized in June, we believe that our plant owners will evaluate compliance with the toxic rule on a holistic basis.
Turning to 316(b). We are pleased with EPA's decision to avoid a ""one size fits all"" rulemaking. They have allowed flexibility in compliance methods and time lines. Their rules enable cost-benefit analysis and give discretions to state permitting authorities. Cooling towers are not mandated as the best technology available for all plants. It appears to us that screen technology can be employed to comply with the impingement requirements at a small fraction of the cost of cooling towers. We expect the final rule on the 316(b) sometime in July next year.
Turning to the RPM capacity markets. You all know that May will be an important date for us. As we have discussed in the past, the environmental regulations will have an impact much earlier than their compliance dates particularly in PJM, where the capacity markets looks forward 3 years. EPA's proposed regulations, along with our market fundamentals, will be key import into the capacity auction, the results of which will be known on the 13th of May. Coal prices continue to face upwards, which help natural gas prices remain low, which does not. Median behavior for coal generators and also for demand response will be key. These are the big open questions that will impact affect auction results. Demand response may also be impacted by PJM's filing at FERC this month to clarify the rules for how demand response is measured and eliminate double column issues.
It now appears that the legislation passed earlier in this year to incent new gas generation will not have an impact on this year's PJM auction. We are also pleased that FERC, in its recent discussion involving PJM's minimum offer price, will recall the MOPR, acted decisively in defending competitive markets and the value they bring to customers. FERC rejected exemptions from them, MOPR for state action like that of New Jersey, which were designed to incent new capacity with out of market mechanisms. When we take all of these together, our view remains that the results of the auction for Exelon's fleet will be similar or slightly better than last year, but we simply don't know until we see them.
On the nuclear front, we are of course following the events in Japan everyday as are you. They will be a focus for us and for our regulators, as they should for the next several years. It is clear that the situation in Japan will have implications for the industry here, but it is still too early to define those implications. The NRC has taken an active role to continue its strong record of ensuring the safety of the U.S. nuclear fleet. We know that certain areas will get more attention, probably the maintenance for spent fuel pools, the adequacy of containment structures to withstand extreme events and emergency planning procedures to deal with the sustained loss of power. 
At this point, we don't see significant near-term implications for the license renewal process. We are fully engaged and will work with regulators, industry groups and elected officials to satisfy everyone with the operation of our fleet. We have completed the four recommended actions from, performed 1,000 on each of our plants and verified the capabilities to mitigate extreme events that we have designed into the process. Nothing in that review raised new doubts about the safety of our plants. 
Chip Pardee has testified before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and in the Senate forum in Illinois hosted by Senators Durbin and Kirk. He has briefed Congress and their staff on Exelon's response procedures specifically. We expect some increased fees from the state of Illinois. 
Currently, we are working with the Illinois Emergency Management Association in that regard. Exactly what the U.S. nuclear industry will be required to do is still an open question, and putting an estimate on any cost is premature. But we do expect there could be incremental oversight or process changes and we will deal with those issues. Until we have a better picture of how things may change, we have not modified our operating plans. So far in 2011, we have spent $65 million of the $450 million capital expenditure program planned for this year. A large part of that is associated with turbo replacements like. We received NRC approval earlier this month for 32 megawatts of uprates at Limerick, which we will bring online this year. We will continue to evaluate our uprate program as we go, but at this point, it is too early to make any changes. It continues to appear to be a net benefit for shareholders.
On other fronts, we continue to pursue ways to increase our value. Exelon Generation is trying successfully to reduce congestion around our units in the Midwest. We have discussed in the past the transformer replacement at the substation near Clinton, which is on schedule to be completed later this year. In addition, Generation will invest approximately $5 million and reconduct that 45 KV line to reduce congestion around our what. 
In our wind business, we are moving forward with 230 megawatts of wind in advanced development in Michigan. We will look for opportunities to develop our wind portfolio further but are insistent that they be based on long-term contracts.
So the last quarter was filled with a number of significant events. Life is never boring for Exelon or its analysts or for its shareholders. But we have turned in a very good quarter, and I am very proud of what the Exelon team delivered for you this quarter."

I'll begin by discussing our first quarter results, and then I'll give an update on our latest market views and load results. In the first quarter of 2011, Exelon's operating ea",1490,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. messages today are on Slide 5. I'll begin by discussing our first quarter results, and then I'll give an update on our latest market views and load results. 
In the first quarter of 2011, Exelon's operating earnings were $1.17 per share compared to $$1 per share in the first quarter of 2010. Our earnings improved over last year as a result of higher realized energy prices mainly in the mid-Atlantic region due to the end of the PECO power purchase agreement, higher capacity revenue and higher nuclear volumes that have fewer refueling outages this year compared to the prior year. Exelon's first quarter results were better than our guidance range because of three principal reasons: first, favorable revenue of fuel and taxes due to an extreme weather event in February; second, our position change in Pennsylvania's state bonus depreciation policy; and third, favorable O&M that is primarily timing in nature. The weather event in Texas occurred in early February, when cold weather and unit outages caused ERCOT to implement emergency procedures.  Our ERCOT generation assets performed well, which contributed approximately $0.02 per share to our bottom line. 
Exelon's first quarter results also reflect a $0.03 benefit related to bonus depreciation in Pennsylvania. Historically Pennsylvania disallowed the recognition of bonus depreciation and are saying here, it's allowed for federal purposes. However in February, the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue issued a bulletin permitting the recognition of 100% bonus depreciation in the same year as recognized for federal purposes. As a result, PECO and ExGen will recognize a lower-than-expected state tax expense for 2011. In addition to the $0.03 recognized in the first quarter, we expect to recognize an additional $0.03 of favorability for this item during the course of the year.
The key drivers for ExGen's quarter-over-quarter earnings are on Slide 6. You may recall at our fourth quarter 2010 call in January, we highlighted our expected increase in revenue at ExGen due to the exploration of its power purchase agreement with PECO. This contributed $0.19 per share to Generation's earnings in the first quarter. 
On Slide 7, you can see a snapshot of our hedge position as of March 31. You will notice, from the chart on the left and from our updated hedge disclosures, that our hedge percent is for 2012 is closer to a ratable level. Based on our commodity views, we completed the majority of our sales during the higher-priced periods during the quarter. In addition, the amount of put options has remained relatively unchanged since the end of last year.
You can see from the chart on the right in 2012 and 2013, PJM West Hub prices started and ended the quarter around the same level while NiHub prices have not fully returned to the levels of year end despite the recovery of gas to year-end levels. We continue to lead a reasonable open position in the Midwest in 2013 in order to allow more time for price recovery.
Looking at the back end of the 2014 and '15 forward curves in the chart on the bottom right, you can see that the rebound in price recovery was more pronounced in the last half of March compared to earlier in the quarter. In addition to increases in gas and coal prices and the events in Japan, we believe a portion of this reflects the impact of the recently proposed Air Toxic Rule. We recently updated our analysis of the Air Toxic Rule and the revised estimate for the projected impact on energy prices as in the range of $4 to $6 per megawatt-hour. We believe that the 2014 and 2015 PJM West Hub forward prices shown in the flat reflect most of this uplift. However based on our analysis, it appears that only a limited amount of the potential uplift is reflected in NiHub's 2014 and 2015 prices. As a reminder, our portfolio is essentially open in 2014 and '15, which allows us to capture that upside when it's priced in the forward markets.
ComEd's year-over-year earnings are on Slide 8 and additional details are available in the earnings release attachments issued earlier today. Approximately $0.06 of the quarter-over-quarter reduction in EPS was due to last year's catch-up benefit from the uncollectible rider that we booked in the first quarter of last year.
Turning to Slide 9 for ComEd's load results, ComEd's quarter-over-quarter weather-normal total load decreased by 0.1% compared to last year as a result of lower usage in the residential class. The quarter results are in line with our expectations, and we anticipate the Chicago area housing market conditions will continue to challenge year-over-year growth in the residential class. We expect to see positive growth in the residential sector in the third quarter of this year, assuming Chicago area home prices have bottomed out by then. 
As predicted, large C&I continued to deliver year-over-year growth and small C&I had a modest increase over the prior year. We continue to anticipate flat load growth for the year compared to the prior year. and such, our prior forecast remains unchanged.
Earlier this month, we received the ALG proposed order in the ComEd's distribution rate case filed last June. The ALG proposed $166 million revenue increased, which have a $14 million calculation error, bringing the actual amount of $152 million. This compares to the amount of $113 million. We expect the commission's final order by the end of May, which will become effective in June 2011.
At the end of May, the commission will also issue their final order for ComEd's alternative regulation proposal, which is designed to establish a recovery mechanism for proposals such as Smart Grid. 
In legislative news, the Public Utilities Committee of the Illinois House held several hearings over the last few weeks for Illinois House Bill 14. As a reminder, this is legislation that would enable ComEd to make major investments in the electrical grid to modernize the system and would also provide a formula rate mechanism for more timely recovery of ComEd's costs. We are working to broad stakeholder support for the bill, and we expect to know more before the spring session of the Illinois General Assembly ends in late May.
PECO's quarter-over-quarter key drivers are on Slide 10. PECO's earnings now reflect the new distribution rates from the gas industry and distribution rate cases approved last year. 
Turning to Slide 11, PECO's weather-normal total load growth for the quarter decreased by 1.1% compared to the prior year but was slightly better than our projections. The quarter-over-quarter 1.1% decrease was principally driven by large and small C&I, partially offset by modest growth in residential. The growth in the residential class was due to better-than-expected improvements in key economic factors, mainly the increases in real disposable income. Large C&I load growth was negative this quarter compared to the first quarter of 2010, primarily due to inventory restocking that took place in the first quarter 2010 and lower usage in the pharmaceutical sector. Our outlook for load growth for the full year has not changed, as we continue to expect total load to be flat for the year.
Turning to our cash sources and uses on Slide 12. We are expecting to generate cash from operations of $4.3 billion this year. Our end-of-year cash forecast remains the same at approximately $400 million, which factors in the dividend and investment and our growth projects such as uprates and wind development projects that are currently under way.  
We are generating strong cash flows and have also taken concrete steps to further strengthen our short-term and long-term liquidity position. In January, we reduced our 2012 through 2014 cash requirements by contributing $2.1 billion to our pension funds and increased the funded status from approximately 70% to nearly 90%.  In February, we refinanced $6.4 billion of credit facilities at Exelon, GenCo and PECO at favorable rates and turns, and the agreements are in place for 5 years with an option to extend them for two 1-year periods. This gives us flexibility to manage future refinancings.
These steps, along with a continued focus on financial discipline and cost management, positions us well to meet our funding requirements including dividends and growth capital and maintain strong credit metrics. As an additional note, we have provided, in the appendix to today's slide on Page 40, more details on the specific calculation Exelon's consolidated credit metrics.
Before I close, I just want to reiterate John's earlier statement about 2011 guidance. I continue to believe that we will deliver full year operating guidance comfortably within the range of $3.90 to $4.20 especially considering our better-than-expected earnings in the first quarter and the additional $0.03 we expect to recognize through Pennsylvania bonus depreciation during the rest of the year. For the next quarter, we expect operating results in the range of $0.90 to $1 per share. That concludes my remarks, and we can now take questions."

Where DSI applies, there is obviously going to be a variable-costs impact, and we're going to look very carefully at what happens with SO2 images. and there's a potential there that you could see on a megawatt-hour basis, an increase in variable costs of somewhere between $4 to $8 depending on how much SO2 has to come out if you use a dry scrubber. In that instance, the impact isn't necessarily felt in the capacity market, but on the energy side of the equation where the units remain.

And our hedging position in the Midwest has a significant amount of energy sold in the Jan to May period because of the 3,000-megawatt ComEd swap.

In the first quarter, we again turned in very strong operating and financial performance. Our operating earnings were $1.17 per share, which meet both our expectations and those we have read on The Street. It won't always happen but it sure is nice when it does. 
Our earnings at Generation were helped by the performance of our units in Texas during a February cold snap there. They were helped, as you expected, by the roll off of the PPA between Exelon Generation and PECO. They were also helped by the positive effects of bonus depreciation, which lowered Pennsylvania income taxes. 
On the operating side, our nuclear fleet turned in a 94.8% capacity factor during the quarter. Congratulations to Chip Pardee and Mike Pacilio. Our first quarter performance gives us confidence that we will be well within our guidance range for the full year of $3.90 to $4.20 per share. Matt will discuss the financial results in more detail shortly. 
I want to talk about a couple of other issues that concern you and concern us. The EPA proposed these rules last month on air toxics and on the 316(b). Both were proposed on time and in ways that were generally consistent with what we expected. We remain confident that EPA will issue the final toxics rule and expect that rule to go into effect as planned with compliance in late 2014 or early 2015. There has been a lot of noise about these rules, and there will continue to be noise as people fight them. I don't think the noise will go away, but I don't expect Congress to do anything to change the rules. The EPA is simply enforcing the requirements of the existing Clean Air Act, as that act has been interpreted by the courts including the Supreme Court of the United States. The last major amendments to that act are now over 20 years old. Neither the rules nor their implementation should be a surprise to anyone. 
My confidence is bolstered by the fact that the Senate failed to pass legislation that would stop EPA from regulating greenhouse gases. That legislation only got 50 votes, so it seems highly unlikely that the Senate could find the required 60 votes it would need to block EPA's rules on mercury, arsenic or other toxins. If the Senate didn't choose to block carbon regulation, it is not going to pass legislation that most people believe will negatively impact the health of babies, children and pregnant women.
According to the EPA's estimates, the health benefits from controlling mercury could be as high $140 billion, while the cost of compliance would only be around $11 billion. While one should take these numbers with a little skepticism on both sides, it's hard to argue that the cost benefit differential is not huge. 
On the reliability front, the impact is manageable. Each NERC region has excess generating capacity. 2/3 of the coal fleet has already installed or is in the process of installing the controls necessary for compliance, and much of the capacity from coal plants that do retire can be replaced by underutilized existing gas plants. 
For Exelon's fossil units, the proposed rules have minimal impact. We have already made the decision to retire our Eddystone 1 Units 1 and 2, and Cromby Station, with the first 2 of these units set to retire at the end of next month. We are evaluating compliance options at Eddystone 3 and 4 and Schuco oil peak. Our share of the expected compliance costs at Kanuma Station, where we own 21% is expected to be small. Coupled with the Transport Rule, which will be finalized in June, we believe that our plant owners will evaluate compliance with the Toxic Rule on a holistic basis.
Turning to 316(b). We are pleased with EPA's decision to avoid the ""one size fits all"" rulemaking. They have allowed flexibility in compliance methods and time lines. Their rules enable cost-benefit analysis and give discretions to state permitting authorities. Cooling towers are not mandated as the best technology available for all plants. It appears to us that screen technology can be employed to comply with the impingement requirements at a small fraction of the cost of cooling towers. We expect the final rule on the 316(b) sometime in July next year.
Turning to the RPM capacity markets. You all know that May will be an important date for us. As we have discussed in the past, the environmental regulations will have an impact much earlier than their compliance dates particularly in PJM, where the capacity market looks forward, 3 years. 
EPA's proposed regulations, along with our market fundamentals, will be key import into the capacity auction, the results of which will be known on the 13th of May. Coal prices continue to face upwards, which help; natural gas prices remain low, which does not. Milling behavior for coal generators and also for demand response will be key. These are the big open questions that will impact -- affect  capacity auction results. Demand response may also be impacted by PJM's filing at FERC this month to clarify the rules for how demand response is measured and eliminate double counting issues.
It now appears that the legislation passed earlier in this year to incent new gas generation will not have an impact on this year's PJM auction. We are also pleased that FERC, in its recent discussion involving PJM's minimum offer price, rule called the MOPR [Minimum Offer Price Rule], acted decisively in defending competitive markets and the value they bring to customers. FERC rejected exemptions from them, MOPR for state action, like that at New Jersey, which were designed to incent new capacity without the market mechanisms. 
When we take all of these together, our view remains that the results of the auction for Exelon's feet -- fleet will be similar or slightly better than last year, but we simply won't know until we see them.
On the nuclear front, we are of course following the events in Japan everyday, as are you. They will be a focus for us and for our regulators, as they should for the next several years. It is clear that the situation in Japan will have implications for the industry here, but it is still too early to define or quantify those implications. 
The NRC is taking an active role to continue its strong record of ensuring the safety of the U.S. nuclear fleet. We know that certain areas will get more attention, probably the maintenance with spent fuel pools, the adequacy of containment structures to withstand extreme events and emergency planning procedures to deal with the sustained loss of power. 
At this point, we don't see significant near-term implications for the license renewal process. We are fully engaged and will work with regulators, industry groups and elected officials to satisfy everyone with the operation of our fleet. We have completed the four recommended actions from [indiscernible], performed walk-down to each of our plants and verified their capabilities to mitigate extreme events that we have designed into the process. Nothing in that review raised new doubts about the safety of our plants. 
Chip Pardee has testified before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and in the Senate forum in Illinois hosted by Senators Durbin and Kirk. He has briefed members of Congress and their staff on Exelon's response procedures specifically. We expect some increased fees from the state of Illinois. Currently, we are working with the Illinois Emergency Management Association in that regard. 
Exactly what the U.S. nuclear industry will be required to do is still an open question, and putting an estimate on any cost is premature. But we do expect there could be incremental oversight or process changes, and we will deal with those issues squarely. Until we have a better picture of how things may change, we have not modified our operating plans. 
So far in 2011, we have spent $65 million of the $450 million capital expenditure program planned for this year. A large part of that is associated with turbine replacements at Dresden, Quad Cities, and Peach Bottom. We received NRC approval earlier this month for 32 megawatts of uprates at Limerick, which we will bring online this year. We will continue to evaluate the power uprate program as we go, but at this point, it is too early to make any changes. It continues to appear to be a net benefit for shareholders.
On other front, we continue to pursue ways to increase our value. Exelon Generation is trying successfully to reduce congestion around our units in the Midwest. We have discussed in the past the transformer replacement at the rising substation near Clinton, which is on schedule to be completed later this year. In addition, Generation will invest approximately $5 million and reconduct treatment at 345 kV line to reduce congestion around our Quad Cities plant. 
In our wind business, we are moving forward with 230 megawatts of wind in advanced development in Michigan. We will look for opportunities to develop our Wind portfolio further but are insistent that they be based on long-term contracts.
So the last quarter was filled with a number of significant events. Life is never boring for Exelon or its analysts or for its shareholders, but we have turned in a very good quarter, and I am very proud of what the Exelon team delivered for you this quarter."

My key messages for today are on Slide 5. I'll begin by discussing our first quarter results, and then I'll give an update on our latest market views and load results. In the first quarter of 2011, Exelon's o",1496,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. My key messages for today are on Slide 5. I'll begin by discussing our first quarter results, and then I'll give an update on our latest market views and load results. 
In the first quarter of 2011, Exelon's operating earnings were $1.17 per share compared to $1 per share in the first quarter of 2010. Our earnings improved over last year as a result of higher realized energy prices mainly in the mid-Atlantic region due to the end of the PECO power purchase agreement, higher capacity revenue and higher nuclear volumes that have fewer refueling outages this year compared to the prior year. 
Exelon's first quarter results were better than our guidance range because of three principal reasons: first, favorable revenue net of fuel and taxes due to an extreme weather event in February; second, a position change in Pennsylvania's state bonus depreciation policy; and third, favorable O&M that is primarily timing in nature. The weather event in Texas occurred in early February, when cold weather and unit outages caused ERCOT to implement emergency procedures.  Our ERCOT generation assets performed well, which contributed approximately $0.02 per share to our bottom line. 
Exelon's first quarter results also reflect a $0.03 benefit related to bonus depreciation in Pennsylvania. Historically, Pennsylvania disallowed the recognition of bonus depreciation in the same year it's allowed for federal purposes. However in February, the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue issued a bulletin permitting the recognition of 100% bonus depreciation in the same year as recognized for federal purposes. As a result, PECO and ExGen will recognize a lower-than-expected state tax expense for 2011. In addition the $0.03 recognized in the first quarter, we expect to recognize an additional $0.03 of favorability for this item during the course of the year.
The key drivers for ExGen's quarter-over-quarter earnings are on Slide 6. You may recall on our fourth quarter 2010 call in January, we highlighted our expected increase in revenue at ExGen due to the exploration of its power purchase agreement with PECO. This contributed $0.19 per share to Generation's earnings in the first quarter. 
On Slide 7, you can see a snapshot of our hedge position as of March 31. You will notice from the chart on the left and from our updated hedge disclosures, that our hedge percentage for 2012 is closer for a ratable level. Based on our commodity views, we completed the majority of our sales during the higher-priced periods during the quarter. In addition, the amount of put options has remained relatively unchanged since the end of last year.
You can see from the chart on the right in 2012 and 2013, PJM West Hub prices started and ended the quarter around the same level, while NiHub prices have not fully returned to the levels of year-end despite the recovery of gas to year-end levels. We continue to lead a reasonable open position in the Midwest in 2013 in order to allow more time for price recovery.
Looking at the back end of 2014 and '15 forward curves in the chart in the bottom right, you can see that the rebound in price recovery was more pronounced in the last half of March compared to earlier in the quarter. In addition to increases in gas and coal prices and the events in Japan, we believe a portion of this reflects the impact of the recently proposed Air Toxic Rule. We recently updated our analysis of the Air Toxic Rule and the revised estimate for the projected impact on energy prices as in the range of $4 to $6 per megawatt-hour. We believe that the 2014 and 2015 PJM West Hub forward prices shown in the chart reflect most of this uplift. However, based on our analysis, it appears that only a limited amount of the potential uplift is reflected in NiHub's 2014 and 2015 prices. As a reminder, our portfolio is essentially open in 2014 and '15, which allows us to capture that upside when it's priced into the forward markets.
ComEd's year-over-year earnings are on Slide 8 and additional details are available in the earnings release attachments issued earlier today. Approximately $0.06 of the quarter-over-quarter reduction in EPS was due to last year's catch-up benefit from the uncollectible rider that we booked in the first quarter of last year.
Turning to Slide 9 for ComEd's load results, ComEd's quarter-over-quarter weather-normal total load decreased by 0.1% compared to last year as a result of lower usage in the residential class. The quarter results are in line with our expectations, and we anticipate the Chicago area housing market conditions will continue to challenge year-over-year growth in the residential class. We expect to see positive growth in the residential sector in the third quarter of this year, assuming Chicago area home prices have bottomed out by then. 
As predicted, large C&I continue to deliver year-over-year growth and small C&I have modest increase over the prior year. We continue to anticipate flat load growth for the year compared to the prior year, and as such, our prior forecast remains unchanged.
Earlier this month, we received the ALJ's [Administrative Law Judges] proposed order in the ComEd's distribution rate case filed last June. The ALJ proposed $166 million revenue increase, which have $14 million calculation error, bringing the actual amount of $152 million. This compares to the ICC staff replied amount of $113 million. We expect the commission's final order by the end of May, which will become effective in June 2011. At the end of May, the commission will also issue their final order for ComEd's alternative regulation proposal, which is designed to establish a recovery mechanism for proposals such as Smart Grid. 
In legislative news, the Public Utilities Committee of the Illinois House held several hearings over the last few weeks for Illinois House Bill 14. As a reminder, this is legislation that would enable ComEd to make major investments in the electrical grid to modernize the system and would also provide a formula rate mechanism for more timely recovery of ComEd's costs. We are working to build broad stakeholder support for the bill, and we expect to know more before the spring session of the Illinois General Assembly ends in late May.
PECO's quarter-over-quarter key drivers are on Slide 10. PECO's earnings now reflect the new distribution rates from the gas distribution rate cases approved last year. 
Turning to Slide 11, PECO's weather-normal total load growth for the quarter decreased by 1.1% compared to the prior year but was slightly better than our projections. The quarter-over-quarter 1.1% decrease was principally driven by large and small C&I, partially offset by modest growth in residential. The growth in the residential class was due to better-than-expected improvements in key economic factors, mainly, increases in real disposable income. Large C&I load growth was negative this quarter compared to the first quarter of 2010, primarily due to inventory restocking that took place in the first quarter 2010 and lower usage in the pharmaceutical sector. Our outlook for load growth for the full year has not changed, as we continue to expect total load to be flat for the year.
Turning to our cash sources and uses on Slide 12. We are expecting to generate cash from operations of $4.3 billion this year. Our end-of-the-year cash forecast remains the same at approximately $400 million, which factors in the dividend and investment in our growth projects such as uprates and wind development projects that are currently under way.  
We are generating strong cash flows and have also taken concrete steps to further strengthen our short-term and long-term liquidity positions. In January, we reduced our 2012 through 2014 cash requirements by contributing $2.1 billion to our pension funds and increased the funded status from approximately 70% to nearly 90%.  In February, we refinanced $6.4 billion of credit facilities at Exelon, GenCo and PECO with favorable rates and turns, and the agreements are in place for 5 years with an option to extend them for two 1-year periods. This gives us flexibility to manage future refinancings.
These steps, along with a continued focus on financial discipline and cost management, positions us well to meet our funding requirements, including dividends and growth capital and maintain strong credit metrics. As an additional note, we have provided, in the appendix to today's slide on Page 40, more details on the specific calculation of Exelon's consolidated credit metrics.
Before I close, I just want to reiterate John's earlier statement about 2011 guidance. I continue to believe that we will deliver full year operating guidance comfortably within the range of $3.90 to $4.20 per share especially considering our better-than-expected earnings in the first quarter and the additional $0.03 we expect to recognize from Pennsylvania bonus depreciation during the rest of the year. For the next quarter, we expect operating results in the range of $0.90 to $1 per share. That concludes my remarks, and we can now take questions."

Our biggest issue in that area has been in -- is reflected in our decision at Oyster Creek based off of the state's decision there for the Barnegat Bay. On Fukushima, we think that the analysis that is under way will continue to support the design, structural design of our various reactor types, and it will reaffirm our operating strategies to ensure that we do not challenge the structural integrity as a potential event happens. We see the expense and the focus coming more in the operating strategies and preparations for beyond-design basis, accidents, things you just can't anticipate, and we'll work with the regulator and the industry on those. We have differentiated ourselves significantly in operating strategy. And everybody's read the articles over the last couple of weeks that have been in most of the papers and they've heard from the U.S. regulators and the administration, many politicians about those differences. So we're not anticipating large capital expenditures, maintenance CapEx or installation of any major upgrades and we'll just continue to work.

Where DSI applies, there is obviously going to be a variable-cost impact, and we're going to look very carefully at what happens with SO2 emissions. And it's -- there's a potential there that you could see on a megawatt-hour basis, an increase in variable costs of somewhere between $4 to $8, depending on how much SO2 has to come out if you use a dry scrubber.

As we all know, the world that we were in love with came to an end back in 2008. Since that time, we have delivered operating earnings of $4.20, $4.12 and $4.06. As you can tell from our results in the first quarter and our reconfirmed estimate range, we are in a very good position to give you numbers like that again this year. 
When next year and 2013 comes, we cannot fully overcome the downward pressure that has existed on electricity prices. You know that, and have been pricing that into our shares for at least a year, probably 2 years now. But I urge you to look at how well this machine is operating. We continue to produce results that are better than the models indicate. I think we can keep doing that as we go forward, and you can't be sure until you see it, which is why we don't always put it in a forecast. But there are a lot of good things going on within this company, and there are good opportunities that Kevin and his team keep finding in the power markets that you can't put just in a linear extrapolation.

They are joined by several other members of Exelon's senior management team, who will be available to answer your questions. We've scheduled 60 minutes for this call, and I'd now like to turn the call over to John Rowe, Exelon's CEO."

Our operating earnings were $1.17 per",1598,"Thank you, Stacie. It's a shame to waste such a talented woman on the Safe Harbor notice. That seems to be your loss at life. 
In the first quarter, we again turned in very strong operating and financial performance. Our operating earnings were $1.17 per share, which meet both our expectations and those we have read on The Street. It won't always happen but it sure is nice when it does. 
Our earnings at Generation were helped by the performance of our units in Texas during a February cold snap there. They were helped, as you expected, by the roll off of the PPA between Exelon Generation and PECO. They were also helped by the positive effects of bonus depreciation, which lowered Pennsylvania income taxes. 
On the operating side, our nuclear fleet turned in a 94.8% capacity factor during the quarter. Congratulations to Chip Pardee and Mike Pacilio. Our first quarter performance gives us confidence that we will be well within our guidance range for the full year of $3.90 to $4.20 per share. Matt will discuss the financial results in more detail shortly. 
I want to talk about a couple of other issues that concern you and concern us. The EPA proposed these rules last month on air toxics and on the 316(b). Both were proposed on time and in ways that were generally consistent with what we expected. We remain confident that EPA will issue the final toxics rule and expect that rule to go into effect as planned with compliance in late 2014 or early 2015. There has been a lot of noise about these rules, and there will continue to be noise as people fight them. I don't think the noise will go away, but I don't expect Congress to do anything to change the rules. The EPA is simply enforcing the requirements of the existing Clean Air Act, as that act has been interpreted by the courts including the Supreme Court of the United States. The last major amendments to that act are now over 20 years old. Neither the rules nor their implementation should be a surprise to anyone. 
My confidence is bolstered by the fact that the Senate failed to pass legislation that would stop EPA from regulating greenhouse gases. That legislation only got 50 votes, so it seems highly unlikely that the Senate could find the required 60 votes it would need to block EPA's health rules on mercury, arsenic or other toxins. If the Senate didn't choose to block carbon regulation, it is not going to pass legislation that most people believe will negatively impact the health of babies, children and pregnant women.
According to the EPA's estimates, the health benefits from controlling mercury could be as high $140 billion, while the cost of compliance would only be around $11 billion. While one should take these numbers with a little skepticism on both sides, it's hard to argue that the cost benefit differential is not huge. 
On the reliability front, the impact is manageable. Each NERC region has excess generating capacity. 2/3 of the coal fleet has already installed or is in the process of installing the controls necessary for compliance, and much of the capacity from coal plants that do retire can be replaced by underutilized existing gas plants. 
For Exelon's fossil units, the proposed rules have minimal impact. We have already made the decision to retire our Eddystone Units 1 and 2, and Cromby Station, with the first 2 of these units set to retire at the end of next month. We are evaluating compliance options at Eddystone 3 and 4 and Schuco oil peak. Our share of the expected compliance costs at Kanuma Station, where we own 21% is expected to be small. Coupled with the Transport Rule, which will be finalized in June, we believe that our plant owners will evaluate compliance with the Toxic Rule on a holistic basis.
Turning to 316(b). We are pleased with EPA's decision to avoid the ""one size fits all"" rulemaking. They have allowed flexibility in compliance methods and time lines. Their rules enable cost-benefit analysis and give discretions to state permitting authorities. Cooling towers are not mandated as the best technology available for all plants. It appears to us that screen technology can be employed to comply with the impingement requirements at a small fraction of the cost of cooling towers. We expect the final rule on the 316(b) sometime in July next year.
Turning to the RPM capacity markets. You all know that May will be an important date for us. As we have discussed in the past, the environmental regulations will have an impact much earlier than their compliance dates particularly in PJM, where the capacity market looks forward, 3 years. 
EPA's proposed regulations, along with our market fundamentals, will be key input into the capacity auction, the results of which will be known on the 13th of May. Coal prices continue to face upwards, which help; natural gas prices remain low, which does not. Milling behavior for coal generators and also for demand response will be key. These are the big open questions that will impact -- affect  capacity auction results. Demand response may also be impacted by PJM's filing at FERC this month to clarify the rules for how demand response is measured and eliminate double counting issues.
It now appears that the legislation passed earlier in this year to incent new gas generation will not have an impact on this year's PJM auction. We are also pleased that FERC, in its recent discussion involving PJM's minimum offer price, rule called the MOPR [Minimum Offer Price Rule], acted decisively in defending competitive markets and the value they bring to customers. FERC rejected exemptions from them, MOPR for state action, like that at New Jersey, which were designed to incent new capacity with out-of-market mechanisms. 
When we take all of this together, our view remains that the results of the auction for Exelon's feet -- fleet will be similar or slightly better than last year, but we simply won't know until we see them.
On the nuclear front, we are of course following the events in Japan everyday, as are you. They will be a focus for us and for our regulators, as they should for the next several years. It is clear that the situation in Japan will have implications for the industry here, but it is still too early to define or quantify those implications. 
The NRC is taking an active role to continue its strong record of ensuring the safety of the U.S. nuclear fleet. We know that certain areas will get more attention, probably the maintenance with spent fuel pools, the adequacy of containment structures to withstand extreme events and emergency planning procedures to deal with the sustained loss of power. 
At this point, we don't see significant near-term implications for the license renewal process. We are fully engaged and will work with regulators, industry groups and elected officials to satisfy everyone with the operation of our fleet. We have completed the four recommended actions from [indiscernible], performed walk-downs at each of our plants and verified their capabilities to mitigate extreme events that we have designed into the process. Nothing in that review raised new doubts about the safety of our plants. 
Chip Pardee has testified before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and in the Senate forum in Illinois hosted by Senators Durbin and Kirk. He has briefed members of Congress and their staff on Exelon's response procedures specifically. We expect some increased fees from the state of Illinois. Currently, we are working with the Illinois Emergency Management Association in that regard. 
Exactly what the U.S. nuclear industry will be required to do is still an open question, and putting an estimate on any cost is premature. But we do expect there could be incremental oversight or process changes, and we will deal with those issues squarely. Until we have a better picture of how things may change, we have not modified our [indiscernible] plans. 
So far in 2011, we have spent $65 million of the $450 million capital expenditure program planned for this year. A large part of that is associated with turbine replacements at Dresden, Quad Cities, and Peach Bottom. We received NRC approval earlier this month for 32 megawatts of uprates at Limerick, which we will bring online this year. We will continue to evaluate the power uprate program as we go, but at this point, it is too early to make any changes. It continues to appear to be a net benefit for shareholders.
On other fronts, we continue to pursue ways to increase our value. Exelon Generation is trying successfully to reduce congestion around our units in the Midwest. We have discussed in the past the transformer replacement at the rising substation near Clinton, which is on schedule to be completed later this year. In addition, Generation will invest approximately $5 million in reconductering the 345 kV line to reduce congestion around our Quad Cities plant. 
In our wind business, we are moving forward with 230 megawatts of wind in advanced development in Michigan. We will look for opportunities to develop our Wind portfolio further but are insistent that they be based on long-term contracts.
So the last quarter was filled with a number of significant events. Life is never boring for Exelon or its analysts or for its shareholders, but we have turned in a very good quarter, and I am very proud of what the Exelon team delivered for you this quarter."
296181,129925546,118438,"Exelon Corp., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2011",2011-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Exelon Corporation","Executives","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. My key messages for today are on Slide 5. I'll begin by discussing our first quarter results, and then I'll give an update on our latest market views and load results. In the first quarter of 2011, Exelon's o",1498,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. My key messages for today are on Slide 5. I'll begin by discussing our first quarter results, and then I'll give an update on our latest market views and load results. 
In the first quarter of 2011, Exelon's operating earnings were $1.17 per share compared to $1 per share in the first quarter of 2010. Our earnings improved over last year as a result of higher realized energy prices mainly in the mid-Atlantic region due to the end of the PECO power purchase agreement, higher capacity revenue and higher nuclear volumes due to fewer refueling outages this year compared to the prior year. 
Exelon's first quarter results were better than our guidance range because of three principle reasons: first, favorable revenue net of fuel and taxes due to an extreme weather event in February; second, a position change in Pennsylvania's state bonus depreciation policy; and third, favorable O&M that is primarily timing in nature. The weather event in Texas occurred in early February, when cold weather and unit outages caused ERCOT to implement emergency procedures.  Our ERCOT generation assets performed well, which contributed approximately $0.02 per share to our bottom line. 
Exelon's first quarter results also reflect a $0.03 benefit related to bonus depreciation in Pennsylvania. Historically, Pennsylvania disallowed the recognition of bonus depreciation in the same year it's allowed for federal purposes. However, in February the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue issued a bulletin permitting the recognition of 100% bonus depreciation in the same year as recognized for federal purposes. As a result, PECO and ExGen will recognize a lower-than-expected state tax expense for 2011. In addition the $0.03 recognized in the first quarter, we expect to recognize an additional $0.03 of favorability for this item during the course of the year.
The key drivers for ExGen's quarter-over-quarter earnings are on Slide 6. You may recall on our fourth quarter 2010 call in January, we highlighted our expected increase in revenue at ExGen due to the expiration of its power purchase agreement with PECO. This contributed $0.19 per share to Generation's earnings in the first quarter. 
On Slide 7, you can see a snapshot of our hedge position as of March 31. You will notice from the chart on the left and from our updated hedge disclosures, that our hedge percentage for 2012 is closer to a ratable level. Based on our commodity views, we completed the majority of our sales during the higher-priced periods during the quarter. In addition, the amount of put options has remained relatively unchanged since the end of last year.
You can see from the chart on the right the 2012 and 2013 PJM West Hub prices started and ended the quarter around the same level, while NiHub prices have not fully returned to the levels of year-end despite the recovery of gas to year-end levels. We continue to leave a reasonable open position in the Midwest in 2013 in order to allow more time for price recovery.
Looking at the back end of 2014 and '15 forward curves in the chart in the bottom right, you can see that the rebound in price recovery was more pronounced in the last half of March compared to earlier in the quarter. In addition to increases in gas and coal prices and the events in Japan, we believe a portion of this reflects the impact of the recently proposed Air Toxic Rule. We recently updated our analysis of the Air Toxic Rule and our revised estimate for the projected impact on energy prices is in the range of $4 to $6 per megawatt-hour. We believe that the 2014 and 2015 PJM West Hub forward prices shown in the chart reflect most of this uplift. However, based on our analysis, it appears that only a limited amount of the potential uplift is reflected in NiHub's 2014 and 2015 prices. As a reminder, our portfolio is essentially open in 2014 and '15, which allows us to capture that upside when it's priced into the forward markets.
ComEd's year-over-year earnings are on Slide 8 and additional details are available in the earnings release attachments issued earlier today. Approximately $0.06 of the quarter-over-quarter reduction in EPS was due to last year's catch-up benefit for the uncollectible rider that we booked in the first quarter of last year.
Turning to Slide 9 for ComEd's load results, ComEd's quarter-over-quarter weather-normal total load decreased by 0.1% compared to last year as a result of lower usage in the residential class. The quarter results are in line with our expectations, and we anticipate the Chicago area housing market conditions will continue to challenge year-over-year growth in the residential class. We expect to see positive growth in the residential sector in the third quarter of this year, assuming Chicago area home prices have bottomed out by then. 
As predicted, large C&I continue to deliver year-over-year growth and small C&I had a modest increase over the prior year. We continue to anticipate flat load growth for the year compared to the prior year, and as such, our prior forecast remains unchanged.
Earlier this month, we received the ALJ's [Administrative Law Judges] proposed order in the ComEd's distribution rate case filed last June. The ALJ proposed $166 million revenue increase, which had a $14 million calculation error, bringing the actual amount of $152 million. This compares to the ICC staff reply brief amount of $113 million. We expect the commission's final order by the end of May, which will become effective in June 2011. At the end of May, the commission will also issue their final order for ComEd's alternative regulation proposal, which is designed to establish a recovery mechanism for proposals such as Smart Grid. 
In legislative news, the Public Utilities Committee of the Illinois House held several hearings over the last few weeks for Illinois House Bill 14. As a reminder, this is legislation that would enable ComEd to make major investments in the electrical grid to modernize the system and would also provide a formula rate mechanism for more timely recovery of ComEd's costs. We are working to build broad stakeholder support for the bill, and we expect to know more before the spring session of the Illinois General Assembly ends in late May.
PECO's quarter-over-quarter key drivers are on Slide 10. PECO's earnings now reflect the new distribution rates from the gas distribution rate cases approved last year. 
Turning to Slide 11, PECO's weather-normal total load growth for the quarter decreased by 1.1% compared to the prior year but was slightly better than our projections. The quarter-over-quarter 1.1% decrease was principally driven by large and small C&I, partially offset by modest growth in residential. The growth in the residential class was due to better-than-expected improvements in key economic factors, mainly, increases in real disposable income. Large C&I load growth was negative this quarter compared to the first quarter of 2010, primarily due to inventory restocking that took place in the first quarter 2010 and lower usage in the pharmaceutical sector. Our outlook for load growth for the full year has not changed, as we continue to expect total load to be flat for the year.
Turning to our cash sources and uses on Slide 12. We are expecting to generate cash from operations of $4.3 billion this year. Our end-of-the-year cash forecast remains the same at approximately $400 million, which factors in the dividend and investment in our growth projects such as uprates and wind development projects that are currently underway.  
We are generating strong cash flows and have also taken concrete steps to further strengthen our short-term and long-term liquidity positions. In January, we reduced our 2012 through 2014 cash requirements by contributing $2.1 billion to our pension funds and increased the funded status from approximately 70% to nearly 90%.  In February, we refinanced $6.4 billion of credit facilities at Exelon, GenCo and PECO with favorable rates and turns, and the agreements are in place for 5 years with an option to extend them for two 1-year periods. This gives us flexibility to manage future refinancings.
These steps, along with a continued focus on financial discipline and cost management, positions us well to meet our funding requirements, including dividends and growth capital and maintain strong credit metrics. As an additional note, we have provided in the appendix to today's slide on Page 40, more details on the specific calculation of Exelon's consolidated credit metrics.
Before I close, I just want to reiterate John's earlier statement about 2011 guidance. I continue to believe that we will deliver full year operating guidance comfortably within the range of $3.90 to $4.20 per share especially considering our better-than-expected earnings in the first quarter and the additional $0.03 we expect to recognize from Pennsylvania bonus depreciation during the rest of the year. For the next quarter, we expect operating results in the range of $0.90 to $1 per share. That concludes my remarks, and we can now take questions."

So we have -- and we'll continue to evaluate our fleet. But we do not see a material increase in capital expenditure required for the cooling towers. Now that said, it's a state-by-state interpretation and we'll continue to monitor over the next couple of years as permits come up, how we work within the states. Our biggest issue in that area has been in -- is reflected in our decision at Oyster Creek based off of the state's decision there for the Barnegat Bay. On Fukushima, we think that the analysis that is under way will continue to support the design -- the structural design of our various reactor types, and it will reaffirm our operating strategies to ensure that we do not challenge the structural integrity as a potential event happens. We see the expense and the focus coming more in operating strategies in preparations for beyond-design basis accidents, things you just can't anticipate, and we'll work with the regulator and the industry on those. We have differentiated ourselves significantly in operating strategy. And everybody's read the articles over the last couple of weeks that have been in most of the papers and they've heard from the U.S. regulators and the administration, many politicians about those differences. So we're not anticipating large capital expenditures, maintenance CapEx or installation of any major upgrades and we'll just continue to work. Trying to quantify the expense where we think more of it will come in, it's too early now. Again, I don't see it as significantly material at this point. But Chip Pardee is leading the industry group, working with NEI and INPO to make sure that we're closely in communication with the regulators and the administration -- the politicians so we can resolve the concerns and continue with the high safety records in preparation standards that we have."

I think you're probably going to see more scrubbing, more wet scrubbing and dry scrubbing on Appalachian units, and perhaps a little bit more than EPA has predicted in its models. Where DSI applies, there is obviously going to be a variable-cost impact, and we're going to look very carefully at what happens with SO2 emissions. And it's -- there's a potential there that you could see on a megawatt-hour basis, an increase in variable costs of somewhere between $4 to $8, depending on how much SO2 has to come out if you use a dry scrubber. In that instance, the impact isn't necessarily felt in the capacity market, but on the energy side of the equation where units remain, they don't retire, but they have higher variable costs and higher dispatch costs."

Our operating earnings were $1.5 per share, which I think significantly exceeded your consensus. 
Expectations. We have had a very busy summer at both ComEd and PECO. We have extreme heat and violent thunderstorms. More than July on ComEd not up over 850,000 customers and it took us nearly a weak to get them all back, but the ComEd is performing better than ever before and handled without major trouble a new all-time peak of 23,753 megawatts on the 20th of July. ComEd got a reasonable result in class rate case considering the court decision that you've all heard about 6 or 9 months ago. And it's continuing its work to get Illinois Senate Bill 1652 inactive. This legislation will support a broad infrastructure improvement program and finally bring some real regulatory stability to Illinois.
We simply don't know what the odds are of the governor signing it. He hasn't been sounding promising to date, and we don't know whether the legislation would overturn the, it is certainly possible that they would because very badly. 
In Philadelphia, PECO continues to produce genuinely exceptional financial results. And it has handled its extreme heat superbly. PECO also hit an all-time peak last Thursday and again knocked it on Friday.
During the second quarter, Exelon Generation's capacity factor and its nuclear fleet was 89.6%, largely as a result of 103 refueling outage base and 4 units. For the first 6 months of the year, the capacity factor was 92.2%. And in spite of a year with an extraordinary number of refueling outages, our nuclear group continues to strive to achieve its usual 93% this year.
Our performance this quarter was distinguished by some positive tax items, which are not simply accidents, but the result of very hard work by and his tax guidance. We are on or slightly ahead of plan just with basic operating use, but the tax benefits allow us to increase our earnings guidance for 2011, up to $4.5 to $4.25 per share. This range already includes about $0.04 per share of incremental storm costs from the major July 11 storm, which we will book in the third quarter. Now we've had continued storms in ComEd. I don't have a good number yet on the expense of the whole, but that was the big one and we've already got that pretty well boxed. 
Needless to say, I am personally very pleased to being able to increase the earnings guidance. Our merger work in Maryland is marching along right on schedule, and one these days, I'll wake up retired, hopefully as early as January. So I would really like 2011 to be a good year, and right now it looks like it's going to be a very good year, indeed.
Turning to the merger. We made all of our regulatory filings within a month of announcing the transaction. We filed our S-4 proxy statement with the SEC at the end of June. Deferred DOJ processes are proceeding on course. The taxes in New York processes are on track, we hope to get a decision in Texas next month and New York before the end of the year. The NRC is likely to complete its review by January.
In Maryland, the schedule has been set to have a Public Service Commission decision on January 5, 2012. If you look at those dates, you see the basis for my hope that we actually can get these all done in January, well, perhaps for February. We continue to work with the stakeholders in Maryland, including the governor staff. We have several Exelon officers based in Baltimore to ensure that dialogue remains constructive throughout the process. This is one of the lessons we've learned from all of our work in New Jersey 5 years ago, it is get your own people on the ground, get direct information and have people get to know you first hand.
So far, everything is on pace and on schedule. I believe we do remain on track to close the merger early next year. Chris Crane and Mayo are in the process of defining the new leadership structure. They will make the announcements of the first layer of Executive Management announcements late this summer.
Over the last 3 months, we have visited with many of you, I'm sure with all of our larger shareholders. And I'm pleased to say the reaction from you has been generally very positive, indeed. Nearly everyone I have talked to in my reports from and Stacie and Chris are similar, recognize that this deal works. It makes a financial sense from earnings position, from a cash flow perspective and from a credit perspective. The combination of our Generation fleet with the Constellations customer facing business provides strong platform for growth. And the transaction allows us to diversify our fleet across various forms of Clean Energy, and enables us to execute our Exelon 2020 vision for a clean energy future.
Being clean, it's a competitive hallmark for Exelon. It will become even more advantageous as we move into this new era of EPA regulations. More and more, through a combination of economics, gas prices and pending environmental regulations, we expect to see the market bias towards cleaner forms of energy. Earlier this month, EPA issued its final cross state air solution rule, that we used to call the transport rule. The final rule contains many of the provisions that the Clean Energy Group to which Exelon belongs suggested and provides more regulatory certainty for lowering knocks and sulphur dioxide emissions beginning as early as next year. We applaud EPA's use of all market-based solution with interstate trading where they are put.
Overall, we think the rule will have a positive impact on wholesale prices, albeit with some regional differences. We're still evaluating the rule and we'll learn more as we see trading in advance of the January 2012 start date. 
On the Air Toxics Rule, EPA extended its comment period until early August, but has maintained a strong commitment to finalizing that rule in November. This is of at most importance to EPA and I expect them to hold to that time line. The administration has made it increasingly clear, the EPA has its most important.
As we expected the  capacity markets were the first to reflect the environmental regulations, current prices in the most recent PJM auction suggests that generators are taking a long-run economic approach meetings, and companies continue to announce coal retirements and new plans for complying with the regulations. In PJM alone, plant operators have announced plans to retire more than 8,000 megawatts of operating coal capacity. We continue to believe that there will not be repeal all or multiyear delay of the EPA regulations, despite some Congressional attempts to do so. As you can all can tell from that current budget stalemate, doing nothing is a congressional strength and we are glad to be in a position where that's good enough for our purposes.
Now our opportunities to get one-year extensions when needed for compliance will be evaluated by EPA, maybe justifiable in number of cases and indeed Exelon would not opposed that, what we care about is when they are going to shut down the plant, they do it promptly and on time. We do not support and do not expect delays in the closing of plants that are not close to be. 
I want now to turn to the nuclear industry's response to the events at Fukushima and its implications for the U.S. nuclear industry.
We are very pleased that from the very first days, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has taken a fact-based, balanced and objective approach to assessing U.S. Nuclear Plants and administration has backed the NRC in regard. Our ownership RD has worked daily in court in coordinating with regulators, policymakers, the Nuclear Energy Institute and our peer companies. He is sharing the industry's Fukushima responds theory committee.
On July 12, NRC Task Force issued its 90-day report which states clearly that U.S. nuclear plants are safe and also describes air use for regulatory improvement. We expect the NRC staff and the commission to work very diligently in both effectively learning how to improve the regulatory structure, but also making certain that it stays in that phase. The industry will work through both and to make certain all this happens. The issues identified at the Task Force report are largely those we expected. Very importantly to us, the Task Force report appears to find that current standards for the storage of spent fuel and the license renewal process are sound and appropriate. Since these were areas that defined the high-end of the potential cost to us, we are pleased to see that they've have achieved this level of stability. How the NRC implements the remaining Task Force recommendation will take time to know. The cost to Exelon is still impossible to determine in any degree of detail, but we expect when we know that it will be spread over a number of years.
Nonetheless, with the challenges ahead for the countries oldest and dirtiest coal plants, I would rather have the challenges of Exelon nuclear fleet any day. The fundamental competitive strengths that we have remained intact. The value of our fleet will improve as our markets improve and EPA regulations are applied. Our operates program continues to provide us with a low risk, low-cost growth deal. We have added 194 megawatts since we began the program in 2009. We have the ability to reassess market conditions as we know, thus, we have decided to remove the Three Mile Island and Quinton EPUs from d the plan due to economics. But we are moving forward with our other operates and plan to bring another 185 megawatts online between now and the end of 2013.
So let me end with the following. This quarter's results represents the 11th straight quarter in which we have met and generally beaten your expectations. We've beaten our own internal forecast. The reason for this is not always the same. detention to operations is part of it every quarter, including this last one. 
In this quarter, some tax benefits were a big part of the change, but the key message I would like to leave you with is that we keep finding things to improve the system. We are absolutely, totally, rigorously and pathologically dedicated to doing that. We can't guarantee that we'll be successful in doing that every quarter as we go forward, but I believe that this company is placed, positioned and hung out to dry on the proposition that we can keep things better than the models. 
With that, I'll turn the call to Matt Hilfiger."
296181,138235805,146848,"Exelon Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2011",2011-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Exelon Corporation","Executives","Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. I'll start my remarks this morning on Slide 10, and follow with some additional commentary on our second quarter results and update our hedging and recent regulatory activity. Earnings release issued this morning",1433,"Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. I'll start my remarks this morning on Slide 10, and follow with some additional commentary on our second quarter results and update our hedging and recent regulatory activity. 
Earnings release issued this morning provide significant detail about our second quarter results.
We are pleased to deliver another quarter of financial results that met or exceeded your expectations. Exelon second quarter operating earnings were $1.5 per share, compared to $0.99 per share in the second quarter 2010. The earnings drivers for all 3 operating companies are highlighted on Slide 11, 12 and 13. 
Our second quarter results include the recognition of a onetime tax benefit of $0.07 per share at Exelon, resulting from a provision under the Energy Policy Act of 2005  that allows transfers of cash or investments from our nonqualified Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds to our qualified Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds generating a tax deduction and a time of transfer. Exelon originally exercised this provision in March of 2008 and recognized a significant cash benefit based on the proposed regulations back in 2008. However, since that time, the IRS issued final regulations with provisions that allow us to carry back the deduction for 2 additional years from 2008 to 2006, resulting in earnings of $0.07 per share from the accumulation of interest and lower tax expense. We also expect to recognize of that $0.01 per share benefit in the second half of the year for this item as well.
Moving onto Slide 14 for an update on power markets and hedging status, our prices in both the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest have recovered steadily since hitting their lows in late February. As you can see from the chart on the lower left, Midwest heat rates improved quite significantly as power prices increased despite the decrease in gas price, indicating in part of the recognition of environmental compliance requirements by market participants. 
With this improvement in Midwest power prices, we increased our hedging activity, including participation in the Illinois Power Authority Solicitations conducted on behalf of ComEd and. Highlighted in our hedged disclosure section of this presentation, we are slightly above or purely rentable hedge for 2012 and 2013. With further improvement in forward prices in July, we continue to leverage our market use for executing sales within the quarter by selecting the product mix and using various channels to market at value to our portfolio.
Turning to Slide 15, you can see the diversity in our Generation and sales mix while our nuclear assets are the core of our Generation portfolio, a sizable ownership for control of other assets complements our nuclear base and allows power teams to more structured products, including retail. Following the roll off of the Power Purchase Agreement with PECO, we continue to utilize several channels to market to minimize liquidity and congestions. Exelon Energy, our competitive retail business, has experienced significant growth primarily in Pennsylvania. Their delivered electric sales volume for the period January to June 2011, increased by over 50% to $9.6 million-megawatt per hours, compared to the same period in 2010.
Turning to ComEd, the Illinois Commerce Commission issued its final order in ComEd's 2010 distribution rate case at the end of May. ComEd received a revenue increase of $143 million versus its revised request of $343 million, with the new rates starting in June. The ICC order align with many of the recommendations in ALJ's proposed order approving a 10.5% ROE and a capital structure with equity slightly above 47%. We view this as a reasonable outcome considering the Commission's order reflected the impacts of Illinois and courts decision and the depreciation reserve, which represents $85 million of the reduced revenue request.
ComEd's target and earned return on equity of 10% or better, however, due to the final outcome of the ComEd rate case and the recent impact of the 2 very severe storms that hit the Chicago area in June and July, ComEd will struggle to earn its target ROE we this year. As a result, we have adjusted our full year earnings range down for ComEd. 
Going forward, absent the effectiveness of the Illinois Senate Bill 1652, ComEd is looking at alternatives such as formula rate legislation or more regular rate case filings using a future test year in order to achieve more consistent 10% or better earned ROEs.
Turning to load, our expectations for both ComEd and PECO for the balance of the year are very similar to what we indicated last quarter. In the Chicago area, we aren't seeing any major changes in load or the economy that suggest we need to be more or less optimistic. 
In Philadelphia, despite a lower gross metro product growth estimates since the last quarter, we anticipate no material changes to our 2011 Road forecast. You can refer to the appendix for the slides on load trends in key economic indicators.
Moving onto Slide 16. Last year, we announced our intention to pursue the right line, a high-voltage 765 kV transmission project in the Midwest to a partnership with the Electronic Transmission America referred referred to as EPA, a joint venture of AEP and Mid-American holdings. The updated project time line reflects a execution of the partnership agreement between Exelon and the EPA that was formalized on July 13. The agreements establish operational, financial and management terms to the construction of the line that will extend from Illinois to Indiana to the Ohio border. We expect this line to improve the liability and reduce congestion to this territory once it is fully operational later in the decade, subject to a number of variables including approvals, PJM and FERC.
The execution of a partnership agreement cleared the path to the FERC rate and incentives filing, which was submitted on July 18. The filing reflects a total 12.7 return on equity, which includes a base return and incentives. The filing also request other incentives such as our ability to recover, abandonment cost and construction work in progress. We have asked the FERC to issue an order on this binding by October and are beginning to work to include the line in the PJM Regional Transmission Expansion Planning process.
Our latest cash flow update is on Slide 17. Our business continues to generate strong cash flows from operations of $4.3 billion and we expect to end the year with $350 million in cash. Cash associated with the nuclear decommissioning trust funds special transfer tax that I described earlier will be realized in 2012. Capitalizing on the financial health of the business, we're able to deploy capital for value enhancing investments when such opportunities present themselves. This was the case with our $305 million acquisition of Wolf Hollow, a 720-megawatt combined central plan. 
This acquisition aligns well with our existing footprint at ERCOT. It works from a financial equity standpoint given our existing PPA for 50% of the output of the plant and it will further complement our combined portfolio once we merge with Constellation. We purchased Wolf Hollow with a very attractive price compared to other recent transactions and it will be funded upon closing with cash and available liquidity resources. The acquisition is pending approval from the Texas PUC, which we expect to receive in the third quarter.
Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to provide you with our business outlook for the rest of the year. As John said, we are raising and tightening our full year guidance range because of our strong year-to-date performance, tax related items in the first 6 months of the year and our view for the balance of the year.
For those of you who track storms, we have included in our guidance about $0.04 per share of incremental storm cost related to a severe storm that hit the Chicago area in July 11. The storm ranks as one of the worst to hit the ComEd region, impacting in excess of 850,000 customers. This storm cost have included in our consolidated third quarter guidance range where we expect to earn between $1 and $1.10 per share. Our confidence and our higher full year guidance ranges based on the impact of weather so far this year, including the storms. New distribution rates at ComEd beginning in June, consistent operational performance and continued effective management of our own. We delivered strong financial results in the first half of the year even before the tax items that came through and we are on track to maintain our earnings commitments to you over the remainder of the year. 
I will now open the call for questions."

But I don't know if you are able to listen to the call that NDIS on largely the same subject. And one significant differentiator that we do see thus far with the 90-day report versus actions that were required post-911 is that unlike the events of a decade ago when our principal corrective actions involved adding significant security staff and significant additions to security staff, which as you know are ongoing O&M expenses versus a highly concentrated on once and done capital improvements. From what we can see this time around, the Task Force largely concentrates on the physical attributes of the power plants, which tend to lend themselves to capital versus O&M improvements. I do know that we have completed our first round of seismic and flooding walk down at our power plants. We did that several months ago as an immediate action post-Fukushima. And we have not bound significant deficiencies with our current design basis features, so I am not anticipating at all any large expenditures around the minor deficiencies that we did find. But until such time, NRC is more specific about whether or not further strengthening of our seismic or flooding defenses will be required, I can't really speculate the costs. I do know that again that would lend themselves to onetime capital costs instead of ongoing O&M commitments that we have to make year-over-year."

As you know from our earnings release we had another fine quarter. Our operating earnings were $1.05 per share, which I think significantly exceeded your consensus expectations. We have had a very busy summer",1819,"Thank you, Stacie, and good morning, everyone. As you know from our earnings release we had another fine quarter. Our operating earnings were $1.05 per share, which I think significantly exceeded your consensus expectations. We have had a very busy summer at both ComEd and PECO with extreme heat and violent thunderstorms. One in July, on ComEd, knocked out over 850,000 customers, and it took us nearly a week to get them all back. But the ComEd system is performing better than ever before, and handled without major trouble, a new all-time peak of 23,753 megawatts on the 20th of July. ComEd got a reasonable result in class rate case considering the appellate court decision that you had all heard about 6 or 9 months ago. And it's continuing its work to get Illinois Senate Bill 1652 enacted. This legislation would support a broad infrastructure improvement program and finally bring some real regulatory stability to Illinois.
We simply don't know what the odds are of the governor signing it. He hasn't been sounding promising to date, and we don't know whether the legislation would overturn the [indiscernible]. It is certainly possible that they would because they want big chops very badly. 
In Philadelphia, PECO continues to produce genuinely exceptional financial results. And it has handled its extreme heat superbly. PECO also hit an all-time peak last Thursday and again topped it on Friday.
During the second quarter, Exelon Generation's capacity factor in its nuclear fleet was 89.6%, largely as a result of 103 refueling outage days at 4 units. For the first 6 months of the year, the capacity factor was 92.2%. And in spite of a year of -- with an extraordinary number of refueling outages, our nuclear group continues to strive to achieve its usual 93% this year.
Our performance this quarter was distinguished by some positive tax items, which are not simply accidents, but the result of very hard work by Tom Terry and his tax guidance. We are on or slightly ahead of plan just with basic operating use, but the tax benefits allow us to increase our earnings guidance for 2011, up from $4.05 to $4.25 per share. This range already includes about $0.04 per share of incremental storm costs from the major July 11 storm, which we will book in the third quarter. Now we've had continued storms in ComEd. I don't have a good number yet on the expense of the whole, but that was the big one, and we've already got that pretty well boxed. 
Needless to say, I am personally very pleased at being able to increase the earnings guidance. Our merger work in Maryland is marching along right on schedule, and one of these days, I'll wake up retired, hopefully as early as January, so I would really like 2011 to be a good year. And right now, it looks like it's going to be a very good year, indeed.
Turning to the merger. We made all of our regulatory filings within a month of announcing the transaction. We filed our S-4 proxy statement with the SEC at the end of June. The FERC and DOJ processes are proceeding on course. The Texas and New York processes are on track. We hope to get a decision in Texas next month and New York before the end of the year. The NRC is likely to complete its review by January.
In Maryland, the schedule has been set to have a Public Service Commission decision on January 5, 2012. If you look at those dates, you see the basis for my hope that we actually can get these all done in January, or perhaps in February. We continue to work with the stakeholders in Maryland, including the governor's staff. We have several Exelon officers based in Baltimore to ensure that dialogue remains constructive throughout the process. This is one of the lessons we've learned from all of our work in New Jersey 5 years ago. It is: get your own people on the ground, get direct information and have people get to know you firsthand.
So far, everything is on pace and on schedule. I believe we do remain on track to close the merger early next year. Chris Crane and Mayo Shattuck are in the process of defining the new leadership structure. They will make the announcements of the first layer of executive management announcements late this summer.
Over the last 3 months, we have visited with many of you, I'm sure with all of our larger shareholders. And I'm pleased to say the reaction from you has been generally very positive, indeed. Nearly everyone I have talked to and my reports from Bill Von Hoene and Stacie and Chris are similar, recognize that this deal works. It makes financial sense from earnings position, from a cash flow perspective and from a credit perspective. The combination of our Generation fleet with Constellations' customer-facing business provides strong platform for growth. And the transaction allows us to diversify our fleet across various forms of clean energy, and enables us to execute our Exelon 2020 vision for a clean energy future.
Being clean is a competitive hallmark for Exelon. It will become even more advantageous as we move into this new era of EPA regulations. More and more, through a combination of economics, gas prices and pending environmental regulations, we expect to see the market biased towards cleaner forms of energy. Earlier this month, EPA issued its final Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, what we used to call the transport rule. The final rule contains many of the provisions that the Clean Energy Group, to which Exelon belongs, suggested and provides more regulatory certainty for lowering NOx and sulphur dioxide emissions beginning as early as next year. We applaud EPA's use of a market-based solution with interstate trading where it could.
Overall, we think the rule will have a positive impact on wholesale prices, albeit with some regional differences. We're still evaluating the rule, and we'll learn more as we see allowance trading in advance of the January 2012 start date. 
On the Air Toxics Rule, EPA extended its comment period until early August, but has maintained a strong commitment to finalizing that rule in November. This is of the utmost importance to EPA, and I expect them to hold to that timeline. The administration has made it increasingly clear the EPA has its full support.
As we expected, the capacity markets were the first to reflect the environmental regulations. Current prices in the most recent PJM auction suggests that generators are taking a long-run economic approach to bidding, and companies continue to announce coal retirements and new plans for complying with the regulations. In PJM alone, plant operators have announced plans to retire more than 8,000 megawatts of operating coal capacity. We continue to believe that there will not be repeal or multiyear delay of the EPA regulations, despite some congressional attempts to do so. As you can all can tell from that current budget stalemate, doing nothing is a congressional strength, and we are glad to be at the position where that's good enough for our purposes.
Opportunities to get one-year extensions when needed for compliance will be evaluated by EPA, maybe justifiable in a number of cases and indeed, Exelon would not oppose that. What we care about is when they are going to shut down the plant, they do it promptly and on time. We do not support and do not expect delays in the closing of plants that are not going to be upgraded. 
I want now to turn to the nuclear industry's response to the events at Fukushima and its implications for the U.S. nuclear industry.
We are very pleased that from the very first days, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has taken a fact-based, balanced and objective approach to assessing U.S. nuclear plants and that the administration has backed the NRC in this regard. Our own Chip Pardee has worked daily in coordinating with regulators, policymakers, the Nuclear Energy Institute, INPO and our peer companies. He is sharing the industry's Fukushima Response Steering Committee.
On July 12, an NRC task force issued its 90-day report, which states clearly that U.S. nuclear plants are safe and also describes areas for regulatory improvement. We expect the NRC staff and the commission to work very diligently in both effectively learning how to improve the regulatory structure but also making certain that it stays fact-based. The industry will work through both INPO and NEI to make certain that all this happens.
The issues identified in the task force report are largely those we expected. Very importantly to us, the task force report appears to find that current standards for the storage of spent fuel and the license renewal process are sound and appropriate. Since these were areas that defined the high-end of the potential cost to us, we are pleased to see that they have achieved this level of stability. How the NRC implements the remaining task force recommendations will take time to know. The cost to Exelon is still impossible to determine in any degree of detail, but we expect when we know that it will be spread over a number of years.
Nonetheless, with the challenges ahead for the country's oldest and dirtiest coal plants, I would rather have the challenges of Exelon's nuclear fleet any day. The fundamental competitive strengths that we have remain intact. The value of our fleet will improve as power markets improve and EPA regulations are applied. Our uprates program continues to provide us with a low risk, low-cost growth vehicle. We have added 194 megawatts since we began the program in 2009. We have the ability to reassess market conditions as we go. Thus, we have decided to remove the Three Mile Island and Clinton EPUs from the plan due to economics. But we are moving forward with our other uprates and plan to bring another 185 megawatts online between now and the end of 2013.
So let me end with the following. This quarter's results represents the 11th straight quarter in which we have met and generally beaten your expectations. We've beaten our own internal forecast. The reason for this is not always the same. Constant to operations is part of it every quarter, including this last one. In this quarter, some tax benefits were a big part of the change. But the key message I would like to leave you with is that we keep finding things to improve the system. We are absolutely, totally, rigorously and pathologically dedicated to doing that. 
We can't guarantee that we'll be successful in doing that every quarter as we go forward, but I believe this company is placed, positioned and hung out to dry on the proposition that we can keep things better than the models. With that, I'll turn the call to Matt Hilzinger."
296181,138235805,147155,"Exelon Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2011",2011-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Exelon Corporation","Executives","Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. I'll start my remarks this morning on Slide 10, and follow with some additional commentary on our second quarter results and update on hedging and recent regulatory activity. Earnings release issued this morning",1442,"Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. I'll start my remarks this morning on Slide 10, and follow with some additional commentary on our second quarter results and update on hedging and recent regulatory activity. 
Earnings release issued this morning provide significant detail about our second quarter results.
We are pleased to deliver another quarter of financial results that met or exceeded your expectations. Exelon's second quarter operating earnings were $1.05 per share, compared to $0.99 per share in the second quarter of 2010. The earnings drivers for all 3 operating companies are highlighted on Slides 11, 12 and 13. 
Our second quarter results include the recognition of a onetime tax benefit of $0.07 per share at Exelon, resulting from a provision under the Energy Policy Act of 2005  that allows transfers of cash or investments from our nonqualified nuclear decommissioning trust funds to our qualified nuclear decommissioning trust funds, generating a tax deduction at the time of transfer. Exelon originally exercised this provision in March of 2008 and recognized a significant cash benefit based on the proposed regulations back in 2008. However, since that time, the IRS issued final regulations with provisions that allow us to carry back the deduction for 2 additional years from 2008 to 2006, resulting in earnings of $0.07 per share from the accumulation of interest and lower tax expense. We also expect to recognize about $0.01 per share benefit in the second half of the year for this item as well.
Moving on to Slide 14 for an update on power markets and hedging status. Our prices in both the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest have recovered steadily since hitting their lows in late February. As you can see from the chart on the lower left, Midwest heat rates improved quite significantly as power prices increased despite the decrease in gas price, indicating in part the recognition of environmental compliance requirements by market participants. 
With this improvement in Midwest power prices, we increased our hedging activity, including participation in the Illinois Power Authority solicitations conducted on behalf of ComEd and Ameren. As highlighted in our hedged disclosure section of this presentation, we are slightly above our purely rentable hedge for 2012 and 2013. With further improvement in forward prices in July, we continue to leverage our market views for executing sales within the quarter by selecting the product mix and using various channels to market to add value to the portfolio.
Turning to Slide 15. You can see the diversity in our Generation and sales mix. While our nuclear assets are the core of our Generation portfolio, a sizable ownership of control of other assets complements our nuclear base and allows Power Team to serve more structured products, including retail. Following the roll off of the power purchase agreement with PECO, we continue to utilize several channels to market to minimize liquidity and congestions. Exelon Energy, our competitive retail business, has experienced significant growth, primarily in Pennsylvania. Their delivered electric sales volume for the period January to June 2011 increased by over 50% to $9.6 million megawatt per hours compared to the same period in 2010.
Turning to ComEd. The Illinois Commerce Commission issued its final order in ComEd's 2010 distribution rate case at the end of May. ComEd received a revenue increase of $143 million versus its revised request of $343 million, with the new rates starting in June. The ICC order aligned with many of the recommendations in the ALJ's proposed order, approving a 10.5% ROE and a capital structure with equity slightly above 47%. We view this as a reasonable outcome considering the commission's order reflected the impacts of the Illinois appellate courts decision and the depreciation reserve, which represents $85 million of the reduced revenue request.
ComEd targets an earned return on equity of 10% or better. However, due to the final outcome of the ComEd rate case and the recent impact of the 2 very severe storms that hit the Chicago area in June and July, ComEd will struggle to earn its target ROE this year. As a result, we have adjusted our full year earnings range down for ComEd. 
Going forward, absent the effectiveness of the Illinois Senate Bill 1652, ComEd is looking at alternatives such as formula rate legislation or more regular rate case filings using a future test year in order to achieve more consistent 10% or better earned ROEs.
Turning to load. Our expectations for both ComEd and PECO for the balance of the year are very similar to what we indicated last quarter. In the Chicago area, we aren't seeing any major changes in load or the economy that suggest we need to be more or less optimistic. 
In Philadelphia, despite a lower gross metro product growth estimates since the last quarter, we anticipate no material changes to our 2011 growth forecast. You can refer to the appendix for the slides on load trends and key economic indicators.
Moving on to Slide 16. Last year, we announced our intention to pursue the RITE line, a high-voltage 765-kV transmission project in the Midwest through a partnership with the Electronic Transmission America, referred to as ETA, a joint venture of AEP and Mid-American holdings. The updated project timeline reflects the execution of the partnership agreement between Exelon and the ETA that was formalized on July 13. The agreements establish operational, financial and management terms to the construction of a line that will extend from Illinois to Indiana to the Ohio border. We expect this line to improve reliability and reduce congestion to this territory once it is fully operational later in the decade, subject to a number of variables including approvals at PJM and FERC.
The execution of the partnership agreement cleared the path for the FERC rate and incentives filing, which was submitted on July 18. The filing reflects a total of 12.7 return on equity, which includes a base return and incentives. The filing also request other incentives such as our ability to recover abandonment costs and construction work in progress. We have asked the FERC to issue an order on this binding by October and are beginning to work to include the line in the PJM regional transmission expansion planning process. Our latest cash flow update is on Slide 17. Our business continues to generate strong cash flows from operations of $4.3 billion, and we expect to end the year with $350 million in cash. Cash benefits associated with the nuclear decommissioning trust funds special transfer tax that I described earlier will be realized in 2012. Capitalizing on the financial health of the business, we're able to deploy capital for value enhancing investments when such opportunities present themselves. This was the case with our $305 million acquisition of Wolf Hollow, a 720-megawatt combined central plan. 
This acquisition aligns well with our existing footprint at ERCOT. It works from a financial and credit standpoint given our existing PPA for 50% of the output of the plant, and it will further complement our combined portfolio once we merge with Constellation. We purchased Wolf Hollow at a very attractive price compared to other recent transactions, and it will be funded upon closing with cash and available liquidity resources. The acquisition is pending approval from the Texas PUC, which we expect to receive in the third quarter.
Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to provide you with our business outlook for the rest of the year. As John said, we are raising and tightening our full year guidance range because of our strong year-to-date performance, tax related items in the first 6 months of the year and our view for the balance of the year.
For those of you who track storms, we have included in our guidance about $0.04 per share of incremental storm costs related to a severe storm that hit the Chicago area in July 11. This storm ranks as one of the worst to hit the ComEd region, impacting in excess of 850,000 customers. These storm costs have been included in our consolidated third quarter guidance range where we expect to earn between $1 and $1.10 per share. Our confidence and our higher full year guidance range is based on the impact of weather so far this year, including the storms, new distribution rates at ComEd beginning in June, consistent operational performance and continued effective management of our own. We delivered strong financial results in the first half of the year even before the tax items that came through, and we are on track to maintain our earnings commitments to you over the remainder of the year. 
I will now open the call for questions."

So we'll be seeing some heat rate move up and corresponding price move up in the markets because of that. And that wasn't just the heatwave.

As you know from our earnings release we had another fine quarter. Our operating earnings were $1.05 per share, which I think significantly exceeded your consensus expectations.

Our operating earnings were $1.05 per share, which I think significantly exceeded your consensus expectations. We have had a very busy summer at both ComEd and PECO with extreme heat and violent thunderstorms. One in July, on ComEd, knocked out over 850,000 customers, and it took us nearly a week to get them all back. But the ComEd system is performing better than ever before, and handled without major trouble, a new all-time peak of 23,753 megawatts on the 20th of July. ComEd got a reasonable result in class rate case considering the appellate court decision that you had all heard about 6 or 9 months ago. And it's continuing its work to get Illinois Senate Bill 1652 enacted. This legislation would support a broad infrastructure improvement program and finally bring some real regulatory stability to Illinois.
We simply don't know what the odds are of the governor signing it. He hasn't been sounding promising to date, and we don't know whether the legislature would overturn the veto. It is certainly possible that they would because they want these jobs very badly. 
In Philadelphia, PECO continues to produce genuinely exceptional financial results. And it has handled its extreme heat superbly. PECO also hit an all-time peak last Thursday and again topped it on Friday.
During the second quarter, Exelon Generation's capacity factor in its nuclear fleet was 89.6%, largely as a result of 103 refueling outage days at 4 units. For the first 6 months of the year, the capacity factor was 92.2%. And in spite of a year of -- with an extraordinary number of refueling outages, our nuclear group continues to strive to achieve its usual 93% this year.
Our performance this quarter was distinguished by some positive tax items, which are not simply accidents, but the result of very hard work by Tom Terry and his tax guidance. We are on or slightly ahead of plan just with basic operating use, but the tax benefits allow us to increase our earnings guidance for 2011, up from $4.05 to $4.25 per share. This range already includes about $0.04 per share of incremental storm costs from the major July 11 storm, which we will book in the third quarter. Now we've had continued storms in ComEd. I don't have a good number yet on the expense of the whole, but that was the big one, and we've already got that pretty well boxed. 
Needless to say, I am personally very pleased at being able to increase the earnings guidance. Our merger work in Maryland is marching along right on schedule, and one of these days, I'll wake up retired, hopefully as early as January, so I would really like 2011 to be a good year. And right now, it looks like it's going to be a very good year, indeed.
Turning to the merger. We made all of our regulatory filings within a month of announcing the transaction. We filed our S-4 proxy statement with the SEC at the end of June. The FERC and DOJ processes are proceeding on course. The Texas and New York processes are on track. We hope to get a decision in Texas next month and New York before the end of the year. The NRC is likely to complete its review by January.
In Maryland, the schedule has been set to have a Public Service Commission decision on January 5, 2012. If you look at those dates, you see the basis for my hope that we actually can get these all done in January, or perhaps in February. We continue to work with the stakeholders in Maryland, including the governor's staff. We have several Exelon officers based in Baltimore to ensure that dialogue remains constructive throughout the process. This is one of the lessons we've learned from all of our work in New Jersey 5 years ago. It is: get your own people on the ground, get direct information and have people get to know you firsthand.
So far, everything is on pace and on schedule. I believe we do remain on track to close the merger early next year. Chris Crane and Mayo Shattuck are in the process of defining the new leadership structure. They will make the announcements of the first layer of executive management announcements late this summer.
Over the last 3 months, we have visited with many of you, I'm sure with all of our larger shareholders. And I'm pleased to say the reaction from you has been generally very positive, indeed. Nearly everyone I have talked to and my reports from Bill Von Hoene and Stacie and Chris are similar, recognize that this deal works. It makes financial sense from earnings position, from a cash flow perspective and from a credit perspective. The combination of our Generation fleet with Constellations' customer-facing business provides a  strong platform for growth. And the transaction allows us to diversify our fleet across various forms of clean energy, and enables us to execute our Exelon 2020 vision for a clean energy future.
Being clean is a competitive hallmark for Exelon. It will become even more advantageous as we move into this new era of EPA regulations. More and more, through a combination of economics, gas prices and pending environmental regulations, we expect to see the market bias towards cleaner forms of energy. Earlier this month, EPA issued its final Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, what we used to call the transport rule. The final rule contains many of the provisions that the Clean Energy Group, to which Exelon belongs, suggested and provides more regulatory certainty for lowering NOx and sulphur dioxide emissions beginning as early as next year. We applaud EPA's use of a market-based solution with interstate trading where it could.
Overall, we think the rule will have a positive impact on wholesale prices, albeit with some regional differences. We're still evaluating the rule, and we'll learn more as we see allowance trading in advance of the January 2012 start date. 
On the Air Toxics Rule, EPA extended its comment period until early August, but has maintained a strong commitment to finalizing that rule in November. This is of the utmost importance to EPA, and I expect them to hold to that timeline. The administration has made it increasingly clear the EPA has its full support.
As we expected, the capacity markets were the first to reflect the environmental regulations. Current prices in the most recent PJM auction suggests that generators are taking a long-run economic approach to bidding, and companies continue to announce coal retirements and new plans for complying with the regulations. In PJM alone, plant operators have announced plans to retire more than 8,000 megawatts of operating coal capacity. We continue to believe that there will not be repeal or multiyear delay of the EPA regulations, despite some congressional attempts to do so. As you can all can tell from that current budget stalemate, doing nothing is a congressional strength, and we are glad to be at the position where that's good enough for our purposes.
Opportunities to get one-year extensions when needed for compliance will be evaluated by EPA, maybe justifiable in a number of cases and indeed, Exelon would not oppose that. What we care about is when they are going to shut down a plant, they do it promptly and on time. We do not support and do not expect delays in the closing of plants that are not going to be upgraded. 
I want now to turn to the nuclear industry's response to the events at Fukushima and its implications for the U.S. nuclear industry.
We are very pleased that from the very first days, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has taken a fact-based, balanced and objective approach to assessing U.S. nuclear plants and that the administration has backed the NRC in this regard. Our own Chip Pardee has worked daily in coordinating with regulators, policymakers, the Nuclear Energy Institute, INPO and our peer companies. He is chairing the industry's Fukushima Response Steering Committee.
On July 12, an NRC task force issued its 90-day report, which states clearly that U.S. nuclear plants are safe and also describes areas for regulatory improvement. We expect the NRC staff and the commission to work very diligently in both effectively learning how to improve the regulatory structure but also making certain that it stays fact-based. The industry will work through both INPO and NEI to make certain that all this happens.
The issues identified in the task force report are largely those we expected. Very importantly to us, the task force report appears to find that current standards for the storage of spent fuel and the license renewal process are sound and appropriate. Since these were areas that defined the high-end of the potential cost to us, we are pleased to see that they have achieved this level of stability. How the NRC implements the remaining task force recommendations will take time to know. The cost to Exelon is still impossible to determine in any degree of detail, but we expect when we know that it will be spread over a number of years.
Nonetheless, with the challenges ahead for the country's oldest and dirtiest coal plants, I would rather have the challenges of Exelon's nuclear fleet any day. The fundamental competitive strengths that we have remain intact. The value of our fleet will improve as power markets improve and EPA regulations are applied. Our uprates program continues to provide us with a low risk, low-cost growth vehicle. We have added 194 megawatts since we began the program in 2009. We have the ability to reassess market conditions as we go. Thus, we have decided to remove the Three Mile Island and Clinton EPUs from the plan due to economics. But we are moving forward with our other uprates and plan to bring another 185 megawatts online between now and the end of 2013.
So let me end with the following. This quarter's results represents the 11th straight quarter in which we have met and generally beaten your expectations. We've beaten our own internal forecast. The reason for this is not always the same. Constant attention to operations is part of it every quarter, including this last one. In this quarter, some tax benefits were a big part of the change. But the key message I would like to leave you with is that we keep finding things to improve the system. We are absolutely, totally, rigorously and pathologically dedicated to doing that. 
We can't guarantee that we'll be successful in doing that every quarter as we go forward, but I believe this company is placed, positioned and hung out to dry on the proposition that we can keep things better than the models. With that, I'll turn the call to Matt Hilzinger."

I'll start my remarks this morning on Slide 10, and follow with some additional commentary on our second quarter results and update on hedging and recent regulatory activity. 
Earnings release issued this morning provide significant detail about our second quarter results.
We are pleased to deliver another quarter of financial results that met or exceeded your expectations. Exelon's second quarter operating earnings were $1.05 per share, compared to $0.99 per share in the second quarter of 2010. The earnings drivers for all 3 operating companies are highlighted on Slides 11, 12 and 13. 
Our second quarter results include the recognition of a onetime tax benefit of $0.07 per share at Exelon, resulting from a provision under the Energy Policy Act of 2005  that allows transfers of cash or investments from our nonqualified nuclear decommissioning trust funds to our qualified nuclear decommissioning trust funds, generating a tax deduction at the time of transfer. Exelon originally exercised this provision in March of 2008 and recognized a significant cash benefit based on the proposed regulations back in 2008. However, since that time, the IRS issued final regulations with provisions that allow us to carry back the deduction for 2 additional years from 2008 to 2006, resulting in earnings of $0.07 per share from the accumulation of interest and lower tax expense. We also expect to recognize about $0.01 per share benefit in the second half of the year for this item as well.
Moving on to Slide 14 for an update on power markets and hedging status. Power prices in both the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest have recovered steadily since hitting their lows in late February. As you can see from the chart on the lower left, Midwest heat rates improved quite significantly as power prices increased despite the decrease in gas price, indicating in part the recognition of environmental compliance requirements by market participants. 
With this improvement in Midwest power prices, we increased our hedging activity, including participation in the Illinois Power Authority solicitations conducted on behalf of ComEd and Ameren. As highlighted in our hedge disclosure section of this presentation, we are slightly above a purely ratable hedge for 2012 and 2013. With further improvement in forward prices in July, we continue to leverage our market views for executing sales within the quarter by selecting the product mix and using various channels to market to add value to the portfolio.
Turning to Slide 15. You can see the diversity in our Generation and sales mix. While our nuclear assets are the core of our Generation portfolio, a sizable ownership or control of other assets complements our nuclear base and allows Power Team to serve more structured products, including retail. Following the roll off of the power purchase agreement with PECO, we continue to utilize several channels to market to minimize liquidity and congestions. Exelon Energy, our competitive retail business, has experienced significant growth, primarily in Pennsylvania. Their delivered electric sales volume for the period January to June 2011 increased by over 50% to 9.6 million megawatt per hours compared to the same period in 2010.
Turning to ComEd. The Illinois Commerce Commission issued its final order in ComEd's 2010 distribution rate case at the end of May. ComEd received a revenue increase of $143 million versus its revised request of $343 million, with the new rates starting in June. The ICC order aligned with many of the recommendations in the ALJ's proposed order, approving a 10.5% ROE and a capital structure with equity slightly above 47%. We view this as a reasonable outcome considering the commission's order reflected the impacts of the Illinois appellate courts decision and the depreciation reserve, which represents $85 million of the reduced revenue request.
ComEd targets an earned return on equity of 10% or better. However, due to the final outcome of the ComEd rate case and the recent impact of the 2 very severe storms that hit the Chicago area in June and July, ComEd will struggle to earn its target ROE this year. As a result, we have adjusted our full year earnings range down for ComEd. 
Going forward, absent the effectiveness of the Illinois Senate Bill 1652, ComEd is looking at alternatives such as formula rate legislation or more regular rate case filings using a future test year in order to achieve more consistent 10% or better earned ROEs.
Turning to load. Our expectations for both ComEd and PECO for the balance of the year are very similar to what we indicated last quarter. In the Chicago area, we aren't seeing any major changes in load or the economy that suggest we need to be more or less optimistic. 
In Philadelphia, despite a lower gross metro product growth estimates since the last quarter, we anticipate no material changes to our 2011 load  forecast. You can refer to the appendix for the slides on load trends and key economic indicators.
Moving on to Slide 16. Last year, we announced our intention to pursue the RITE line, a high-voltage 765-kV transmission project in the Midwest through a partnership with the Electronic Transmission America, referred to as ETA, a joint venture of AEP and Mid-American holdings. The updated project timeline reflects the execution of the partnership agreement between Exelon and ETA that was formalized on July 13. The agreements establish operational, financial and management terms to the construction of a line that will extend from Illinois through Indiana to the Ohio border. We expect this line to improve reliability and reduce congestion to this territory once it is fully operational later in the decade, subject to a number of variables including approvals at PJM and FERC.
The execution of the partnership agreement cleared the path for the FERC rate and incentives filing, which was submitted on July 18. The filing reflects a total of 12.7 return on equity, which includes a base return and incentives. The filing also requests other incentives such as our ability to recover abandonment costs and construction work in progress. We have asked the FERC to issue an order on this binding by October and are beginning to work to include the line in the PJM regional transmission expansion planning process. Our latest cash flow update is on Slide 17. Our business continues to generate strong cash flows from operations of $4.3 billion, and we expect to end the year with $350 million in cash. Cash benefits associated with the nuclear decommissioning trust funds special transfer tax that I described earlier will be realized in 2012. Capitalizing on the financial health of the business, we're able to deploy capital for value enhancing investments when such opportunities present themselves. This was the case with our $305 million acquisition of Wolf Hollow, a 720-megawatt combined central plant. 
This acquisition aligns well with our existing footprint at ERCOT. It works from a financial and credit standpoint given our existing PPA for 50% of the output of the plant, and it will further complement our combined portfolio once we merge with Constellation. We purchased Wolf Hollow at a very attractive price compared to other recent transactions, and it will be funded upon closing with cash and available liquidity resources. The acquisition is pending approval from the Texas PUC, which we expect to receive in the third quarter.
Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to provide you with our business outlook for the rest of the year. As John said, we are raising and tightening our full year guidance range because of our strong year-to-date performance, tax related items in the first 6 months of the year and our view for the balance of the year.
For those of you who track storms, we have included in our guidance about $0.04 per share of incremental storm costs related to a severe storm that hit the Chicago area on July 11. This storm ranks as one of the worst to hit the ComEd region, impacting in excess of 850,000 customers. These storm costs have been included in our consolidated third quarter guidance range where we expect to earn between $1 and $1.10 per share. Our confidence and our higher full year guidance range is based on the impact of weather so far this year, including storms, new distribution rates at ComEd beginning in June, consistent operational performance and continued effective management of our own up costs[ph]. We delivered strong financial results in the first half of the year even before the tax items that came through, and we are on track to maintain our earnings commitments to you over the remainder of the year. 
I will now open the call for questions."

So we'll be seeing some heat rate move up and corresponding price move up in the markets because of that. And that wasn't just the heatwave.

And just if I reference back, say, to what occurred after 9-11, is there some way that you could give us parameters to think about the O&M or capital costs associated with those?"

Our operating earnings of $1.12 beat our own expectations in the upper end of the range by a couple of cents and beaten your consensus by $0.03. We are very proud of having achieved that because in the third quarter, we were haunted by intense storms. As you all know, we had a hurricane in the East and we had 1 month with the most severe repetitive storms that I have ever seen at ComEd. Matt will discuss the storm caused and restoration performance in most in more detail. And just let me say that at, ComEd, front end and stability to get the troops out again and again to get extra troops in to deal with repetitive storms was really remarkable and the preparation that Denis O'Brien and Greg did for the hurricane was really exceptional. PECO was 1 of the first utilities to have all of its this customers back and did it then absolutely seamless public relations. So it's a tremendous performance. 
Our nuclear organization continues to expand at world class levels. We have a capacity factor 95.8% in the third quarter. Now the standout driver, the thing that made our ability to recover all of those storm costs in the same quarter was our strong performance in Texas. Due to the extreme heat, tired men we had on peak crisis in the ERCOT North Zone of $107 per megawatt hour. We had some hours as high as $3,000 per megawatt hour. Our units generated 2.4 million-megawatt hours of electricity, which was an increase of 20% over last year. 
Higher prices in the spot and the day had markets in the open generation link in our portfolio enabled us to gain about $0.10 per share in the third quarter from our Texas operations. Congratulations for this are due to Ken Cornew our team, for how they managed their open position and Chip Pardee and Sony are for making the units perform when we needed them. This was just a good story for Exelon and it shows how different pieces of our system came to contribute when they really need it. 
Based on our performance to date, we are reaffirming our 2011 full-year earnings range of $4.05 to $4.25. By then Frank has allowed me to say we expect to be comfortably in that range, I would say damn comfortably within that range. Matt will cover our financial performance in more detail in a few minutes but let me first give an update on the Constellation merger, our Solar acquisition and what's going on at EPA. 
So far, all the formal benchmarks are on track for an early first quarter close of the merger. We have mailed our proxies and scheduled our shareholder meeting for November 17. We appreciate the support of the transaction that we have received from so many of you and the earlier you cast your votes in support of it, the more momentum we will have. Our regulatory approvals are progressing nicely. We made progress at both for and DOJ and PJM market monitor. The key proceeding remains the management utility commission approval and our negotiations with the governor's office in Maryland. 
In order to address the concerns raised by the PJM market monitor, we filed a settlement agreement committing not to sell the plans we agreed to the best to other significant market participants in PJF. We don't think those people's own lawyers would have let them bid anyway though we don't believe this concession comes with this significant cost. We are very pleased that we have everything worked out with the market monitor. This is one of those benchmarks we've been looking at to make certain that we don't have the problems we had in New Jersey 5 years ago. We have received word from Massachusetts that no further approval is required. We expect in order from the New York commission next month and in Maryland, hearings before the PSC begins next week. We have made a number of additional commitments in our rebuttal testimony and we have refused to make some of the commitments which we have been asked to do. We are very happy to have a live negotiation with Maryland officials. We're not going to give away the real value in this transaction. We believe we can make this work for you, our shareholders and for the customers in Maryland and hard at work convincing folks in Maryland that is South. 
Turning to the Solar acquisition, we announced that we had acquired Antelope Valley sold the ranch one from first solar. This is a 230-megawatt utility scale installation in Southern California. It will be fully operational by 2013 and then we have a 25 year PPA with PG&E for 100% of the output. DOE has provided the loan guarantee for a $646 million of the total $1.36 billion investment. We are taking investment tax credits on the project and we'll also get a little bonus appreciation for assets placed in service by the end of '12. Putting all these cash flow benefits together, we expect to recover our initial investment by 2015. Once complete, Antelope Valley will be one of the largest probable take projects in the road. This is another example of working within our Exelon 2020 plan to bring the low mission low market[indiscernible] to the economy. With our tax capacity, we were able to do that without sacrificing our financial requirements. 
Let me turn briefly to the EPA's regulatory calendar. As you all know, the administration has directed EPA to put ozone regulations on a slower crack and we expect new ozone standard to be proposed in 2013. At the same time, the administration has backed EPA's work on the cross state and on air toxic rules for power plants. EPA has indicated it will take another month to release the final air toxic rules. We see their care and attention to detail as good things. Made it clear that he doesn't intend to abandon the effort to regulate hazardous air pollutants like mercury. Despite the passage of the train act in-house, we do not believe a congressional effort to suspend EPA's work will ultimately pass both houses and we do not see how it could sustain at retail. As you know, EPA recently proposed modifications to the cross state rule. We think that's a good thing, not a bad thing, they're obviously trying to eliminate cases where the other rose had unintended consequences we're offered at. So we continue to believe that Exelon will see the market benefits on additional EPA regulation that we have been discussing for some. Now, what's more important is we're all ready seeing the action that we really care about. The last PJM auction resulted in over 1,800 megawatts less coal than before. About 7,000 megawatts less coal capacity cleared the auction. To date, about 10,000 megawatts of coal-fired capacity in PJM has been announced for retirement. We have revised our estimates upward from 10 or 11,000 to be retired to about 15,000 megawatts retiring over the next few years in PJM. This is partly due to the pending environmental regulation and partly due to the fact that many of these units simply aren't economic at today's natural gas prices, and with today's low growth. So we continue to think the market will improve and our views on this are supported by increasing start feds and the general power market behavior that we have seen at and Kenneth Cornew is with me today and he'll be happy to discuss that in more detail later. 
Now, let me just comment on a couple of other things. First, the NRC continues to take a careful and thoughtful and decisive response to the events in Japan at the Fukushima plants. The staff has evaluated the findings of the task force and presented a prioritized action plan. The mission recently approved the best near-term actions. Tier 1 priorities include reassessing policies, procedures and guidelines. We expect additional requirements, requiring hard and vents and spent fuel full instrumentation, as well as more back up equipment for station blackout response. While these Tier 1 requirements will be handled decisively on a short timeline, it will be an opportunity for industry input. We believe the NRC is handling the Fukushima effect in a fairly responsible manner.
Now, we are turning gears, we are actively evolved in the AEP Energy Ohio rate at and marketing cases. And in this case, neither of these companies was enthused about how much capacity was supposed to go to market. We have intervened strongly, making it very clear that we didn't wish impair either companies ability to recover its current investments. But at the same time, making it clear that we wanted future investments judged by market standards. We have achieved settlements. We had both AEP Ohio and tell us to do one done now? Been out we have a settlement with wholesale. Not only does this create an opportunity in the market for some 70 million-megawatt hours of electricity, I view this as one of the most important step forward for competitive markets in the past decade. As you all know in the late 90s, it seemed everything would be competitive and then after Enron, things roll back. So here we have cases of utilities that have been strong advocates of competitive or regulated monopolies agreeing to a larger percentage of market participation. I think that's a very good thing indeed and Joe Dominguez and Scott Brown and Delia start of our team is just tremendous job working on these things innovative is impossible for the other utilities but was definitively pro-market. 
Closer to home in Illinois, we watched Senate Bill 1652 and be company trailer built on an hourly basis to trailer bill passed the Senate yesterday I that required majority to overturn the governor's veto. The Trailer Bill passed out of House committee this morning by about I think of 17:1 or 16:1. We believe both bills will be presented to both houses in the next day or 2 but you'll know when they pass as soon as we do. Frank Clark is on the phone and so is Joe Turkic and they can talk to you with more detail about these. I think this is a remarkable effort by the legislator to both privately improve electric service in Illinois and to do so in a way that's fair to combat and Enron and a Tuesday about his were. 
So just to finish up and turn it over to Matt, again, and again we find a way to deliver earnings. And I think we are on track for a very good year at Exelon and there is no part of the company that has made a contribution. As you all know, Tom Terry starts work has been especially certainly this year and above the basic units are pulling together and we're giving it results. So with that, Matt?"
296181,141310277,178159,"Exelon Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2011",2011-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Exelon Corporation","Executives","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. This morning I will review the operating results for the quarter in more detail and share a few thoughts on the market performance and cash flow. As John mentioned, Exelon delivered operating earnings of $1.12",1341,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. This morning I will review the operating results for the quarter in more detail and share a few thoughts on the market performance and cash flow. As John mentioned, Exelon delivered operating earnings of $1.12 per share this quarter, a penny per share better than the same period in the prior year. 
Moving to Slide 9, Generations operating earnings were up $0.04 per share this quarter, compared to last year, largely due to improved portfolio and market conditions. It reflects PECO's transition to market at the beginning of the year and our third quarter of Texas performance. 
As you can see on Slide 10, we are near our ratable hedge targets the future of and regulating although we slowed down the pace of our hedging this quarter, we continued to make sales and able to benefit from the higher pricing we saw periodically through the quarter at the West Hub and Hub. We higher pricing primarily to two factors. First, the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule's and second, additional heatwave expansion at the West Hub and my have consistent historical levels at some of the natural gas prices. On the right side of the Slide, you can see that prices increased following the release on the cross state air pollution rule in early July and increased begin with some of commission announces begin trading in early September. Those future it's good to prices more than doubled the EPA price of approximately $1,100 per ton. Since then the EPA has modified the State Emissions budgets and we are currently seeing 2012 SO2 emission market's voted at 700 to 1,100 per ton, which is at or below the EPA's expectations. With respect to heat rates, NiHub heat rates continue to build on the improvement we saw earlier in the year in both NiHub and West Hub expanded by approximately 1 point during the quarter for 2012 and 2013, which were supportive of higher prices as natural gas prices remain low. You may have also noticed that our expected generation in the South and West region is up since our second quarter across all years. As a note, we are not including the expected generation from was not an absolute value solar range 2 acquisitions that we completed during the third quarter. 
Turning to comment on Slide 11, operating earnings for the third quarter of 2011 or $0.17 per share compared to $0.18 per share last year. Incremental storm costs were up $0.06 per share this quarter compared to last year, due to a very busy summer of storms.  ComEd's proves managed and unprecedented of total 10 major storms in close succession in the summer including the July 11 storm that we mention during our second quarter earnings call, which affected nearly 1 million customers. In each instance, ComEd's restoration performance was commendable under very challenging conditions. 
Moving now to PECO on Slide 12. Operating earnings were $0.16 per share, which reflect a $0.02 increase in incremental storm cost versus last year due to Hurricane Irene. As many of you experienced directly, Hurricane Irene cost extensive flooding and wind damage and interrupted service to nearly 7 million customers in 14 U.S. states. About 500,000 of the affected customers were in the PECO service territory. Those at PECO partner in the aftermath of Irene was the extraordinary job of restoring service to 99%, their affected customers within 72 hours. PECO management proactively mobilized thousands of employees, contractors and workers from other regions, including combat before the storm hit the service territory which enabled the immediate and effective restoration response. With respect to loads for comment on PECO, totaled weather-normalized electric deliveries are down for the quarter, compared to the prior-year at ComEd and are essentially flat to PECO. The slowdown in growth in the economy is weighin on the electric demand in both regions. Almost every economist we watched has reduced the U.S. gross domestic product growth expectations for this year and shows that they are not expecting the economy to gain a lot of momentum in the near-term. 
Based on our year-to-date performance, and a decline in our expectations for the fourth quarter, we are modifying our full-year load expectations. 2011 we are now projecting a decline in load from last year of 0.6% at ComEd, and a decline of 0.5% at PECO. Details regarding our load results and outlook, they can be found on Slides 28 and 29 in the appendix of today's presentation. 
On Slide 13, you'll find our updated cash flow projections for this year, during the third quarter based on new IRS guidance issued on August 19, ComEd and PECO can immediately deduct expenses associated with certain repairs. It will reduce their tax and generate an additional $300 million cash flow operations. We expect to receive about approximately $250 million this year and $50 million in 2012. 
As John mentioned, we will fund Antelope Valley solar project with a combination of a federal financing bank loan that is guaranteed by the Department of Energy, cash on hand and other short-term debt. Interest rates on the loan will be fixed at an attractive spread of 37.5 basis points of the U.S. Treasuries of comparable maturity adding to the financial of project. Maintaining a strong balance sheet and identifying executing value-added strategies has positioned us and the year was strong cash and with strong credit metrics. The year-end, we are projecting FFO to debt of 47% of ExGen endoscope which is well above our 30% to 35% target and gives us flexibility heading into the next few years to manage the changes in our Generation markets. 
Before I close, I'd like to touch on a couple of additional items starting with pension on Page 14. At the end of the third quarter, our pension was funded at 83%. 2 significant factors that impacted our funded status are discount rate and asset returns. The discount rate is used to determine our pension obligation at pension cost for the following year and is determined that December 31st of each year and is based on the yields of long-term high-quality corporate bonds, which we can't control. However, we can and have influenced the asset returns generated by our portfolio based on our investment decisions. 
In 2010, Exelon implemented a liability hedge strategy and rebalanced the portfolio to a less equity concentrated asset allocation. Our investment strategy has resulted in significant outperformance of our plants relative to the S&P 500. The $2.1 billion pension contribution in January, in conjunction with our liability hedge strategy has in large part reduced the impact of lower discount rates on the pension unfunded status costs and contributions. As a result, we do not currently anticipate substantial changes to our plan in 2012 pension contribution. Consistent with the prior year, we will provide our latest 2012 pension contribution projections and sensitivities at API and a couple of weeks. On October 14, we received an order from the FERC on our incentive and formulary rate filing the right orange transmission project. FERC approved an 11.43% return on equity without hearing. The rate includes other for our RTO membership and for projects, risks and challenges. In addition, the order grants 100% seabed and abandoned and recovery and regulatory asset treatment for preconstruction costs. Our incentives are subject to PJM including the red line as regional transmission expansion plan known as RTEP. The plan were full with PJM's RTEP process by participating in a stakeholder process currently underway to assess modifications needed to the existing RTEP requirements to address FERC Order Number 1000 and policy-based transmission expansion. 
Finally, when we presented PEI in a couple of weeks we have introduced the status of our 2014 hedge disclosure due to our pending merger with Constellation, we will not be introducing 2012 earnings guidance. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong financial results and remain on track to deliver earnings solidly within our earnings guidance range for the year. And with that, we are ready to take your questions."

So the heat rates picked up to a point where they represent value, option value for peeking assets. I think this is something that can continue obviously driven many of the fundamental long-term drivers which we discussed, as well as weather, but this is an indication that, as you get closer to equilibrium, you will see more power volatility and see higher value for the times kinds of assets that we have in Texas. From a retail business perspective, we like the retail business. The retail business is the most effective way for us to find hedges for our portfolio that's designed to serve retail load. We have that in large part in the mid-Atlantic, we have it in Texas with our mid-American peeking assets, so this in no way changes our perspective on what the value of a retail business and load following in a portfolio can do for you.

We believe one of the great virtues of the merger is it puts their retail marketing capability with our Generation. And we like that in Texas as the other places. Ken Cornew who will be heading the whole trading shop for the combined company, will be working with both Chris and to try to come up with a conservative adequately hedged approach to handling places where we have more load than generation. I think the real difference is that learning as we all have from the last 9 months, we've probably hedged a little sooner than Constellation has historically. We're a little more completely, in other words, we take the tail out a little further. It was possible to do that, indeed, Ken was able to sell some power at very high prices from our fleet in the wake of the heat and then buy it back a few weeks later at cheaper prices that he can produce it for. So to us, it's a matter of learning from the whole thing. We believe Constellation will turn out to have some losses in Texas and as yes is they're smaller than our chains but we don't know yet and you'll find that in the Constellations earnings call. What's really important here is the 2 things are stronger together than separately and we're going to impose a conservative hedging discipline on the whole. Ken, would you like to add to that?"

And the real issue is trying to guess what could commision wants because you can't talk directly to the Commissioner and to work with the Governor and the governor's office as to what they want and as an earlier question explored, the governor's office appears most interested in more renewables. The commissioners may have some interest in accelerating the timing when additional gas capacity comes online. I think those are the issues.

And you know, and we know, that there's nobody else with the same upside that we have down the road.

Our operating earnings of $1.12 beat our own expectations in the upper end of the range by a couple of cents and beat your consensus by $0.03. We are very proud of having achieved that because in the third quarter, we were haunted by intense storms. As you all know, we had a hurricane in the East and we had one month with the most severe repetitive storms that I have ever seen at ComEd. Matt will discuss the storm costs and restoration performance in most -- in more detail. But just let me say that at ComEd, Frank and Anne's ability to get the troops out again and again, to get extra troops in to deal with repetitive storms was really remarkable. And the preparation that Denis O'Brien and Craig did for the hurricane was really exceptional. PECO was one of the first utilities to have all of its customers back and did it with absolutely seamless public relations. So it was a tremendous performance. 
Our nuclear organization continues to expand [ph] at world class levels. We have a capacity factor 95.8% in the third quarter. Now the standout driver, the thing that made our ability to recover all of those storm costs in the same quarter was our strong performance in Texas. Due to the extreme heat, tired men [ph] , we had on peak crisis in the ERCOT north zone of $107 per megawatt hour. We had some hours as high as $3,000 per megawatt hour. Our units generated 2.4 million-megawatt hours of electricity, which was an increase of 20% over last year. 
Higher prices in the spot and the day-ahead markets, and the open generation link in our portfolio enabled us to gain about $0.10 per share in the third quarter from our Texas operations. Congratulations for this are due to Ken Cornew and his power team, for how they managed the open position, and to Chip Pardee and Sonny Garg for making the units perform when we needed them. This was just a good do-story for Exelon and it shows how different pieces of our system can contribute when they're really needed. 
Based on our performance to date, we are reaffirming our 2011 full year earnings range of $4.05 to $4.25. But then[ph]  Frank has allowed me to say we expect to be comfortably in that range, I would say, ""Damned comfortably within that range."" Matt will cover our financial performance in more detail in a few minutes but let me first give an update on the Constellation merger, our Solar acquisition and what's going on at EPA. 
So far, all of the formal benchmarks are on track for an early first quarter close of the merger. We have mailed our proxies and scheduled our shareholder meeting for November 17. We appreciate the support of the transaction that we have received from so many of you and the earlier you cast your votes in support of it, the more momentum we will have. Our regulatory approvals are progressing nicely. We've made progress at both FERC and DOJ, and with the PJM market monitor. The key proceeding remains the Maryland utility commission approval and our negotiations with the governor's office in Maryland. 
In order to address the concerns raised by the PJM market monitor, we filed a settlement agreement committing not to sell the plants we agreed to the best to other significant market participants in PJM. We don't think those people's own lawyers would have let them bid anyway but we don't believe this concession comes with a significant cost. We are very pleased that we have everything worked out with the market monitor. This is one of those benchmarks we've been looking at to make certain that we don't have the problems we had in New Jersey 5 years ago. We have received word from Massachusetts that no further approval is required. We expect an order from the New York commission next month and in Maryland, hearings before the PSC begin next week. We have made a number of additional commitments in our rebuttal testimony and we have refused to make some of the commitments which we have been asked to do. We are very happy to have a live negotiation with Maryland officials. We're not going to give away the real value in this transaction. We believe we can make this work for you, our shareholders, and for the customers in Maryland and we're hard at work convincing folks in Maryland that that is so. 
Turning to the Solar acquisition, we announced that we had acquired Antelope Valley Solar Ranch One from First Solar. This is a 230-megawatt utility scale installation in Southern California. It will be fully operational by 2013 and then we have a 25-year PPA with PG&E for 100% of the output. DOE has provided the loan guarantee for $646 million of the total $1.36 billion investment. We are taking investment tax credits on the project and we'll also get a little bonus appreciation for assets placed in service by the end of '12. Putting all these cash flow benefits together, we expect to recover our initial investment by 2015. Once complete, Antelope Valley will be one of the largest photovoltaic projects in the world. This is another example of working within our Exelon 2020 plan to bring low emission, [indiscernible] power generation to the economy. With our tax capacity, we were able to do that without sacrificing our financial requirements. 
Let me turn briefly to the EPA's regulatory calendar. As you all know, the administration has directed EPA to put ozone regulations on a slower track and we expect the new ozone standard to be proposed in 2013. At the same time, the administration has backed EPA's work on the cross-state and air toxic rules for power plants. While EPA has indicated it will take another month to release the final air toxic rules, we see their care and attention to detail as good things. The President has made it clear that he doesn't intend to abandon the effort to regulate hazardous air pollutants like mercury. Despite the passage of the TRAIN Act in the House, we do not believe a congressional effort to suspend the EPA's work will ultimately pass both houses and we do not see how it could sustain a veto, if it did. As you know, EPA recently proposed modifications to the cross-state rule. We think that's a good thing, not a bad thing, they're obviously trying to eliminate cases where the other rules had unintended consequences, we're all for that. So we continue to believe that Exelon will see the market benefits on additional EPA regulation that we have been discussing over sometime. Now, what's more important is we're already seeing the actions that we really care about. The last PJM auction resulted in over 1,800 megawatts less coal bidding than before. About 7,000 megawatts less coal capacity cleared the auction. To date, about 10,000 megawatts of coal-fired capacity in PJM has been announced for retirement. We have revised our estimate upward from 10,000 or 11,000 to be retired to about 15,000 megawatts retiring over the next few years in PJM. This is partly due to the pending environmental regulation and partly due to the fact that many of these units simply aren't economic at today's natural gas prices, and with today's low loan growth. So we continue to think the market will improve and our views on this are supported by increasing sharp freds [ph] and the general power market behavior that we have seen, and Ken Cornew is with me today and will be happy to discuss that in more detail later. 
Now, let me just comment on a couple of other things. First, the NRC continues to take a careful and thoughtful and decisive response to the events in Japan at the Fukushima plants. The staff has evaluated the findings of the task force and presented a prioritized action plan. The commission recently approved the best near-term actions. The Tier 1 priorities include reassessing policies, procedures and in fact, guidelines. We expect additional requirements, requiring hardened vents and spent fuel pool instrumentation, as well as more backup equipment for station blackout response. While these Tier 1 requirements will be handled decisively on a short timeline, there will be an opportunity for industry input. We believe the NRC is handling the Fukushima event in a very responsible manner.
Now, we are turning gears. We are actively involved in the AEP Ohio and Duke Energy Ohio rate and marketing cases. And in this case, neither of these companies was enthused about how much capacity was supposed to go to market. We have intervened strongly, making it very clear that we didn't wish to impair either company's ability to recover its current investments. But at the same time, making it clear that we wanted future investments judged by market standards. We have achieved settlements. We had both AEP Ohio and so is the Duke, one done now?"

Not only does this create an opportunity market for some 70 million-megawatt hours of electricity, I view this as one of the most important step forward for competitive markets in the past decade. As you all know in the late 90s, it seemed like everything would be competitive and then after Enron, things rolled back. So here we have cases of utilities that have been strong advocates of competitive -- of regulated monopolies agreeing to a larger percentage of market participation. I think that's a very good thing indeed and Joe Dominguez and Scott Brown and Delia Stroud of our team just did a tremendous job working on these things in a way that won't possible [ph]  for the other utilities but was definitively pro-market. 
Closer to home in Illinois, we watched Senate Bill 1652 and the accompanying trailer bill on an hourly basis. The trailer bill passed the Senate yesterday by the required majority to overturn the governor's veto. The trailer bill passed out of House committee this morning by about -- I think it was 17:1 or 16:1. We believe both bills will be presented to both houses in the next day or 2 but you'll know when they pass as soon as we do. Frank Clark is on the phone and so is Joe Trpik and they can talk to you with more detail about these. But I think this is a remarkable effort to fund the legislature who both try to improve the electric service in Illinois and to do so in a way that's fair to ComEd and Enron. I'm very pleased about this work.
So just to finish off and turn it over to Matt, again, and again we find a way to deliver earnings. And I think we are on track for a very good year at Exelon and there is no part of the company that hasn't made a contribution. As you all know, Tom Terry's tax work has been exceptional this year, but all of the basic units are pulling together and we're giving you results. So with that, Matt?"
296181,141310277,178597,"Exelon Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2011",2011-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Exelon Corporation","Executives","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. This morning I will review the operating results for the quarter in more detail and share a few thoughts on power market performance and cash flow. As John mentioned, Exelon delivered operating earnings of $1.1",1362,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. This morning I will review the operating results for the quarter in more detail and share a few thoughts on power market performance and cash flow. As John mentioned, Exelon delivered operating earnings of $1.12 per share this quarter, $0.01 per share better than the same period from the prior year. 
Moving to Slide 9, Generations operating earnings are up $0.04 per share this quarter, compared to last year, largely due to improved portfolio and market conditions. It reflects PECO's transition to market at the beginning of the year and our third quarter of Texas performance. 
As you can see on Slide 10, we are near our ratable hedge targets for 2012 and '13, although we slowed down the pace of our hedging this quarter, we continue to make sales and able to benefit from the higher pricing we saw periodically through the quarter at the West Hub and NiHub. We attribute the higher pricing primarily to 2 factors: first, the markets' reaction to the Cross-State Air Pollution Rules; and second, additional heat rate expansion at the West Hub and NiHub consistent with historical levels of similar natural gas prices. 
On the right side of the slide, you can see that prices increased following the release of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule in early July, the increase began when some limited amount of emission allowances began trading in early September. Those future rates cleared at prices more than double the EPA price of approximately $1,100 per ton. Since then, the EPA has modified the state emissions budgets and we are currently seeing 2012 SO2 emission markets quoted at $700 to $1,100 per ton, which is at or below the EPA's expectations. 
With respect to heat rates, NiHub heat rates continue to build on the improvement we saw earlier in the year and both NiHub and West Hub heat rates expanded by approximately 1 point during the quarter for 2012 and 2013, which were supportive of higher prices as natural gas prices remained low. You may have also noticed that our expected generation in the South and West region is up since our second quarter across all years. As a note, we are now including the expected generation from Wolf Hollow and Antelope Valley Solar Ranch, 2 acquisitions that we completed during the third quarter. 
Turning to comment on Slide 11, operating earnings for the third quarter of 2011 were $0.17 per share compared to $0.18 per share last year. Incremental storm costs were up $0.06 per share this quarter compared to last year, due to a very busy summer of storms. ComEd's crews managed an unprecedented total of 10 major storms in close succession this summer, including the July 11 storm that we mentioned during our second quarter earnings call, which affected nearly 1 million customers. In each instance, ComEd's restoration performance was commendable under very challenging conditions. 
Moving now to PECO on Slide 12. Operating earnings were $0.16 per share, which reflect a $0.02 increase in incremental storm costs versus last year due to Hurricane Irene. As many of you experienced directly, Hurricane Irene caused extensive flooding and wind damage and interrupted service to nearly 7 million customers in 14 U.S. states. About 500,000 of the affected customers were in the PECO service territory. Those at PECO were partner in the aftermath of Irene was the extraordinary job of restoring service to 99% of their affected customers within 72 hours. PECO management proactively mobilized thousands of employees, contractors and workers from other regions, including ComEd before the storm hit the service territory which enabled the immediate and effective restoration response. With respect to load for ComEd and PECO, total weather-normalized electric deliveries are down for the quarter, compared to the prior year at ComEd and are essentially flat at PECO. The slowdown in growth in the economy is weighing on the electric demand in both regions. Almost every economist we watch has reduced the U.S. gross domestic product growth expectations for this year and shows that they are not expecting the economy to gain a lot of momentum in the near term. 
Based on our year-to-date performance and the decline in our expectations for the fourth quarter, we are modifying our full year load expectations. For 2011 we are now projecting a decline in load from last year of 0.6% at ComEd, and a decline of 0.5% at PECO. The details regarding our load results and outlook, they can be found on Slides 28 and 29 in the appendix of today's presentation. 
On Slide 13, you will find our updated cash flow projections for this year. During the third quarter based on new IRS guidance issued on August 19, ComEd and PECO can immediately deduct expenses associated with certain repairs, which will reduce their tax liabilities and generate an additional $300 million cash flow operations. We expect to receive about approximately $250 million this year and a $50 million in 2012. 
As John mentioned, we will fund Antelope Valley Solar project with a combination of a federal financing bank loan which is guaranteed by the Department of Energy, cash on hand and other short-term debt. Interest rates on the loan will be fixed at an attractive spread of 37.5 basis points above U.S. Treasuries of comparable maturity, adding to the financial attractiveness of the project. Maintaining a strong balance sheet and identifying -- executing value-added strategies has positioned us and the year with strong cash and with strong credit metrics. At the year-end, we are projecting FFO to debt of 47% at ExGen in HoCo, which is well above our 30% to 35% target and gives us flexibility heading into the next few years to manage the changes in our Generation markets. 
Before I close, I'd like to touch on a couple of additional items starting with pension on Page 14. At the end of the third quarter, our pension was funded at 83%. Two significant factors that impacted our funded status are discount rate and asset returns. The discount rate is used to determine our pension obligation at pension costs for the following year and is determined at December 31st of each year and is based on the yields of long-term, high-quality corporate bonds, which we can't control. However, we can and have influenced the asset returns generated by our portfolio based on our investment decisions. 
In 2010, Exelon implemented a liability hedge strategy and rebalanced the portfolio to a less equity-concentrated asset allocation. Our investment strategy has resulted in significant outperformance of our plans relative to the S&P 500. The $2.1 billion pension contribution in January, in conjunction with our liability hedge strategy has, in large part, reduced the impact of lower discount rates on the pension unfunded status costs and contributions. As a result, we do not currently anticipate substantial changes to our plan in 2012 pension contribution. Consistent with the prior year, we will provide our latest 2012 pension contribution projections and sensitivities at EEI in a couple of weeks. On October 14, we received an order from the FERC on our incentive and formula rate filing, the RITE Line transmission project. FERC approved an 11.43% return on equity without hearing. The rate includes others [ph]  for our RTO membership and for projects, risks and challenges. In addition, the order grants 100% CWIP and abandoned and recovery, and regulatory asset treatment for preconstruction costs. All incentives are subject to PJM including the RITE Line as Regional Transmission Expansion Plan, known as RTEP. The plan will pull[ph]  with PJM's RTEP process by participating in a stakeholder process currently under way to assess modifications needed to the existing RTEP requirements to address FERC Order No. 1000 and policy-based transmission expansion. 
Finally, when we present at EEI in a couple of weeks we will introduce the status of our 2014 hedge disclosure. Due to our pending merger with Constellation, we will not be introducing 2012 earnings guidance. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong financial results and remain on track to deliver earnings solidly within our earnings guidance range for the year. And with that, we are ready to take your questions."

In addition and that obviously we picked up the Wolf Hollow, the second half of the Wolf Hollow plant, which we had at first to have PPA, and we have a solar facility there picking up some generations. So about half of its increase -- half of the increased generation in our hedge disclosure represents increased dispatch on our plans and half are the new acquisitions in Texas. In the time the market that is set up for this kind of volatility if you have supply demand equilibrium driven by either longer-term supply demand fundamentals or in some part, in this case extreme weather, extreme drought that caused the conditions that we saw in August and somewhat through September. So the heat rates picked up to a point where they represent more value, option value, for peeking assets. I think this is something that can continue obviously driven many of the fundamental long-term drivers which we discussed, as well as weather, but this is an indication that, as you get closer to equilibrium, you will see more power volatility and see higher value for the kinds of assets that we have in Texas. From a retail business perspective, we like the retail business. The retail business is the most effective way for us to find hedges for our portfolio that's designed to serve retail load. We have that, in large part, in the Mid-Atlantic, we have it in Texas with our Mid-American peaking assets, so this in no way changes our perspective on what the value of a retail business and load following in a portfolio can do for you. We just don't like to sell it when it's not valued fairly in the market, and we'll sell it appropriately when it is valued fairly in the market."

We believe one of the great virtues of the merger is it puts their retail marketing capability with our Generations. And we like that in Texas as in other places. Ken Cornew who will be heading the whole trading shop for the combined company, will be working with both Chris and Mayo to try to come up with a conservative, adequately hedged approach to handling places where we have more load than generation. I think the real difference is that learning as we all have from the last 9 months, we probably hedged a little sooner than Constellation has historically or a little more completely, in other words, we take the tail out a little further. It was possible to do that, indeed, Ken was able to sell some power at very high prices from our fleet in the wake of the heat and then buy it back a few weeks later at cheaper prices than he can produce it for. So to us, it's a matter of learning from the whole thing. We believe Constellation will turn out to have had some losses in Texas. Ken's last guess is that they're as smaller than our gains, but we don't know yet and you'll find that out in the Constellations' earnings call.

Second, if Chris Crane and Bill Von Hoene and Darryl Bradford, Calvin Butler are really successful, by the time we get to our next earnings call, we might have closed Constellation and that if that's the case, it would be a very good thing indeed, but if that's the case, this will be the last time you'll hear from me on one of these and so I just want to make some points very crisply about what's going on here. Again and again, over the last several years, we have beaten estimates, we have proven that the machine works across the board at different parts of the company, find the extra at different times. And yes, it's coincidental just which one performs when with the extra value. But what's not coincidental is we've got a whole lot of hounds hunting and they do it really well and they're not here because they're pruning their ear because they produce results. And that's true in our nuclear operation, it's true in the 2 delivery copies, it's true with our the rate-making people, it's true with Tom Terry's work on taxes, it's true with Joe Dominguez's remarkable work in Ohio with Duke and AEP. I mean, things are working here and Chris Crane will be as absolutely dedicated to value as I am, and this management team will be as dedicated to value without me as it has been with me. And you know and we know because your forecast for the next couple of years aren't much different than ours that the next couple of years are going to be tougher on an earnings basis. And you know and we know, that there's nobody else with the same upside that we have down the road. And it really is fortunate in my view that we're starting to see rumors about upside in power markets already. Energy just isn't going to be free in those markets indefinitely. So I really just want to end this by saying, you have one hell of a team working for you here and they will continue to deliver. Thank you very much."

Our operating earnings of $1.12 beat our own expectations in the upper end of the range by a couple of cents and beat your consensus by $0.03. We are very proud of having achieved that because in the third quarter, we were haunted by intense storms. As you all know, we had a hurricane in the East and we had one month with the most severe repetitive storms that I have ever seen at ComEd. Matt will discuss the storm costs and restoration performance in most -- in more detail. But just let me say that at ComEd, Frank and Anne's ability to get the troops out again and again, to get extra troops in to deal with repetitive storms was really remarkable. And the preparation that Denis O'Brien and Craig did for the hurricane was really exceptional. PECO was one of the first utilities to have all of its customers back and did it with absolutely seamless public relations. So it was a tremendous performance. 
Our nuclear organization continues to expand [ph] at world class levels. We have a capacity factor 95.8% in the third quarter. Now the standout driver, the thing that made our ability to recover all of those storm costs in the same quarter was our strong performance in Texas. Due to the extreme heat, tired men [ph] , we had on peak crisis in the ERCOT north zone of $107 per megawatt hour. We had some hours as high as $3,000 per megawatt hour. Our units generated 2.4 million-megawatt hours of electricity, which was an increase of 20% over last year. 
Higher prices in the spot and the day-ahead markets, and the open generation link in our portfolio enabled us to gain about $0.10 per share in the third quarter from our Texas operations. Congratulations for this are due to Ken Cornew and his power team, for how they managed the open position, and to Chip Pardee and Sonny Garg for making the units perform when we needed them. This was just a good do-story for Exelon and it shows how different pieces of our system can contribute when they're really needed. 
Based on our performance to date, we are reaffirming our 2011 full year earnings range of $4.05 to $4.25. But then[ph]  Frank has allowed me to say we expect to be comfortably in that range, I would say, ""Damned comfortably within that range."" Matt will cover our financial performance in more detail in a few minutes but let me first give an update on the Constellation merger, our Solar acquisition and what's going on at EPA. 
So far, all of the formal benchmarks are on track for an early first quarter close of the merger. We have mailed our proxies and scheduled our shareholder meeting for November 17. We appreciate the support of the transaction that we have received from so many of you and the earlier you cast your votes in support of it, the more momentum we will have. Our regulatory approvals are progressing nicely. We've made progress at both FERC and DOJ, and with the PJM market monitor. The key proceeding remains the Maryland utility commission approval and our negotiations with the governor's office in Maryland. 
In order to address the concerns raised by the PJM market monitor, we filed a settlement agreement committing not to sell the plants we agreed to the best to other significant market participants in PJM. We don't think those people's own lawyers would have let them bid anyway but we don't believe this concession comes with a significant cost. We are very pleased that we have everything worked out with the market monitor. This is one of those benchmarks we've been looking at to make certain that we don't have the problems we had in New Jersey 5 years ago. We have received word from Massachusetts that no further approval is required. We expect an order from the New York commission next month and in Maryland, hearings before the PSC begin next week. We have made a number of additional commitments in our rebuttal testimony and we have refused to make some of the commitments which we have been asked to do. We are very happy to have a live negotiation with Maryland officials. We're not going to give away the real value in this transaction. We believe we can make this work for you, our shareholders, and for the customers in Maryland and we're hard at work convincing folks in Maryland that that is so. 
Turning to the Solar acquisition, we announced that we had acquired Antelope Valley Solar Ranch One from First Solar. This is a 230-megawatt utility scale installation in Southern California. It will be fully operational by 2013 and then we have a 25-year PPA with PG&E for 100% of the output. DOE has provided the loan guarantee for $646 million of the total $1.36 billion investment. We are taking investment tax credits on the project and we'll also get a little bonus appreciation for assets placed in service by the end of '12. Putting all these cash flow benefits together, we expect to recover our initial investment by 2015. Once complete, Antelope Valley will be one of the largest photovoltaic projects in the world. This is another example of working within our Exelon 2020 plan to bring low emission, [indiscernible] power generation to the economy. With our tax capacity, we were able to do that without sacrificing our financial requirements. 
Let me turn briefly to the EPA's regulatory calendar. As you all know, the administration has directed EPA to put ozone regulations on a slower track and we expect the new ozone standard to be proposed in 2013. At the same time, the administration has backed EPA's work on the cross-state and air toxic rules for power plants. While EPA has indicated it will take another month to release the final air toxic rules, we see their care and attention to detail as good things. The President has made it clear that he doesn't intend to abandon the effort to regulate hazardous air pollutants like mercury. Despite the passage of the TRAIN Act in the House, we do not believe a congressional effort to suspend the EPA's work will ultimately pass both houses and we do not see how it could sustain a veto, if it did. As you know, EPA recently proposed modifications to the cross-state rule. We think that's a good thing, not a bad thing, they're obviously trying to eliminate cases where the other rules had unintended consequences, we're all for that. So we continue to believe that Exelon will see the market benefits on additional EPA regulation that we have been discussing over sometime. Now, what's more important is we're already seeing the actions that we really care about. The last PJM auction resulted in over 1,800 megawatts less coal bidding than before. About 7,000 megawatts less coal capacity cleared the auction. To date, about 10,000 megawatts of coal-fired capacity in PJM has been announced for retirement. We have revised our estimate upward from 10,000 or 11,000 to be retired to about 15,000 megawatts retiring over the next few years in PJM. This is partly due to the pending environmental regulation and partly due to the fact that many of these units simply aren't economic at today's natural gas prices, and with today's low loan growth. So we continue to think the market will improve and our views on this are supported by increasing sharp freds [ph] and the general power market behavior that we have seen, and Ken Cornew is with me today and will be happy to discuss that in more detail later. 
Now, let me just comment on a couple of other things. First, the NRC continues to take a careful and thoughtful and decisive response to the events in Japan at the Fukushima plants. The staff has evaluated the findings of the task force and presented a prioritized action plan. The commission recently approved the best near-term actions. The Tier 1 priorities include reassessing policies, procedures and in fact, guidelines. We expect additional requirements, requiring hardened vents and spent fuel pool instrumentation, as well as more backup equipment for station blackout response. While these Tier 1 requirements will be handled decisively on a short timeline, there will be an opportunity for industry input. We believe the NRC is handling the Fukushima event in a very responsible manner.
Now, we are turning gears. We are actively involved in the AEP Ohio and Duke Energy Ohio rate and marketing cases. And in this case, neither of these companies was enthused about how much capacity was supposed to go to market. We have intervened strongly, making it very clear that we didn't wish to impair either company's ability to recover its current investments. But at the same time, making it clear that we wanted future investments judged by market standards. We have achieved settlements. We had both AEP Ohio and so is the Duke, one done now?"

Not only does this create an opportunity market for some 70 million-megawatt hours of electricity, I view this as one of the most important step forward for competitive markets in the past decade. As you all know in the late 90s, it seemed like everything would be competitive and then after Enron, things rolled back. So here we have cases of utilities that have been strong advocates of competitive -- of regulated monopolies agreeing to a larger percentage of market participation. I think that's a very good thing indeed and Joe Dominguez and Scott Brown and Delia Stroud of our team just did a tremendous job working on these things in a way that won't possible [ph]  for the other utilities but was definitively pro-market. 
Closer to home in Illinois, we watched Senate Bill 1652 and the accompanying trailer bill on an hourly basis. The trailer bill passed the Senate yesterday by the required majority to overturn the governor's veto. The trailer bill passed out of House committee this morning by about -- I think it was 17:1 or 16:1. We believe both bills will be presented to both houses in the next day or 2 but you'll know when they pass as soon as we do. Frank Clark is on the phone and so is Joe Trpik and they can talk to you with more detail about these. But I think this is a remarkable effort to fund the legislature who both try to improve the electric service in Illinois and to do so in a way that's fair to ComEd and Enron. I'm very pleased about this work.
So just to finish off and turn it over to Matt, again, and again we find a way to deliver earnings. And I think we are on track for a very good year at Exelon and there is no part of the company that hasn't made a contribution. As you all know, Tom Terry's tax work has been exceptional this year, but all of the basic units are pulling together and we're giving you results. So with that, Matt?"
296181,141310277,178643,"Exelon Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2011",2011-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Exelon Corporation","Executives","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. This morning I will review the operating results for the quarter in more detail and share a few thoughts on power market performance and cash flow. As John mentioned, Exelon delivered operating earnings of $1.1",1362,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. This morning I will review the operating results for the quarter in more detail and share a few thoughts on power market performance and cash flow. As John mentioned, Exelon delivered operating earnings of $1.12 per share this quarter, $0.01 per share better than the same period from the prior year. 
Moving to Slide 9, Generations operating earnings are up $0.04 per share this quarter, compared to last year, largely due to improved portfolio and market conditions. It reflects PECO's transition to market at the beginning of the year and our third quarter of Texas performance. 
As you can see on Slide 10, we are near our ratable hedge targets for 2012 and '13, although we slowed down the pace of our hedging this quarter, we continue to make sales and able to benefit from the higher pricing we saw periodically through the quarter at the West Hub and NiHub. We attribute the higher pricing primarily to 2 factors: first, the markets' reaction to the Cross-State Air Pollution Rules; and second, additional heat rate expansion at the West Hub and NiHub consistent with historical levels of similar natural gas prices. 
On the right side of the slide, you can see that prices increased following the release of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule in early July, the increase began when some limited amount of emission allowances began trading in early September. Those future rates cleared at prices more than double the EPA price of approximately $1,100 per ton. Since then, the EPA has modified the state emissions budgets and we are currently seeing 2012 SO2 emission markets quoted at $700 to $1,100 per ton, which is at or below the EPA's expectations. 
With respect to heat rates, NiHub heat rates continue to build on the improvement we saw earlier in the year and both NiHub and West Hub heat rates expanded by approximately 1 point during the quarter for 2012 and 2013, which were supportive of higher prices as natural gas prices remained low. You may have also noticed that our expected generation in the South and West region is up since our second quarter across all years. As a note, we are now including the expected generation from Wolf Hollow and Antelope Valley Solar Ranch, 2 acquisitions that we completed during the third quarter. 
Turning to comment on Slide 11, operating earnings for the third quarter of 2011 were $0.17 per share compared to $0.18 per share last year. Incremental storm costs were up $0.06 per share this quarter compared to last year, due to a very busy summer of storms. ComEd's crews managed an unprecedented total of 10 major storms in close succession this summer, including the July 11 storm that we mentioned during our second quarter earnings call, which affected nearly 1 million customers. In each instance, ComEd's restoration performance was commendable under very challenging conditions. 
Moving now to PECO on Slide 12. Operating earnings were $0.16 per share, which reflect a $0.02 increase in incremental storm costs versus last year due to Hurricane Irene. As many of you experienced directly, Hurricane Irene caused extensive flooding and wind damage and interrupted service to nearly 7 million customers in 14 U.S. states. About 500,000 of the affected customers were in the PECO service territory. Those at PECO were partner in the aftermath of Irene was the extraordinary job of restoring service to 99% of their affected customers within 72 hours. PECO management proactively mobilized thousands of employees, contractors and workers from other regions, including ComEd before the storm hit the service territory which enabled the immediate and effective restoration response. With respect to load for ComEd and PECO, total weather-normalized electric deliveries are down for the quarter, compared to the prior year at ComEd and are essentially flat at PECO. The slowdown in growth in the economy is weighing on the electric demand in both regions. Almost every economist we watch has reduced the U.S. gross domestic product growth expectations for this year and shows that they are not expecting the economy to gain a lot of momentum in the near term. 
Based on our year-to-date performance and the decline in our expectations for the fourth quarter, we are modifying our full year load expectations. For 2011 we are now projecting a decline in load from last year of 0.6% at ComEd, and a decline of 0.5% at PECO. The details regarding our load results and outlook, they can be found on Slides 28 and 29 in the appendix of today's presentation. 
On Slide 13, you will find our updated cash flow projections for this year. During the third quarter based on new IRS guidance issued on August 19, ComEd and PECO can immediately deduct expenses associated with certain repairs, which will reduce their tax liabilities and generate an additional $300 million cash flow operations. We expect to receive about approximately $250 million this year and a $50 million in 2012. 
As John mentioned, we will fund Antelope Valley Solar project with a combination of a federal financing bank loan which is guaranteed by the Department of Energy, cash on hand and other short-term debt. Interest rates on the loan will be fixed at an attractive spread of 37.5 basis points above U.S. Treasuries of comparable maturity, adding to the financial attractiveness of the project. Maintaining a strong balance sheet and identifying -- executing value-added strategies has positioned us and the year with strong cash and with strong credit metrics. At the year-end, we are projecting FFO to debt of 47% at ExGen in HoCo, which is well above our 30% to 35% target and gives us flexibility heading into the next few years to manage the changes in our Generation markets. 
Before I close, I'd like to touch on a couple of additional items starting with pension on Page 14. At the end of the third quarter, our pension was funded at 83%. Two significant factors that impacted our funded status are discount rate and asset returns. The discount rate is used to determine our pension obligation at pension costs for the following year and is determined at December 31st of each year and is based on the yields of long-term, high-quality corporate bonds, which we can't control. However, we can and have influenced the asset returns generated by our portfolio based on our investment decisions. 
In 2010, Exelon implemented a liability hedge strategy and rebalanced the portfolio to a less equity-concentrated asset allocation. Our investment strategy has resulted in significant outperformance of our plans relative to the S&P 500. The $2.1 billion pension contribution in January, in conjunction with our liability hedge strategy has, in large part, reduced the impact of lower discount rates on the pension unfunded status costs and contributions. As a result, we do not currently anticipate substantial changes to our plan in 2012 pension contribution. Consistent with the prior year, we will provide our latest 2012 pension contribution projections and sensitivities at EEI in a couple of weeks. On October 14, we received an order from the FERC on our incentive and formula rate filing, the RITE Line transmission project. FERC approved an 11.43% return on equity without hearing. The rate includes others [ph]  for our RTO membership and for projects, risks and challenges. In addition, the order grants 100% CWIP and abandoned and recovery, and regulatory asset treatment for preconstruction costs. All incentives are subject to PJM including the RITE Line as Regional Transmission Expansion Plan, known as RTEP. The plan will pull[ph]  with PJM's RTEP process by participating in a stakeholder process currently under way to assess modifications needed to the existing RTEP requirements to address FERC Order No. 1000 and policy-based transmission expansion. 
Finally, when we present at EEI in a couple of weeks we will introduce the status of our 2014 hedge disclosure. Due to our pending merger with Constellation, we will not be introducing 2012 earnings guidance. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong financial results and remain on track to deliver earnings solidly within our earnings guidance range for the year. And with that, we are ready to take your questions.\"

In addition and that obviously we picked up the Wolf Hollow, the second half of the Wolf Hollow plant, which we had the first half PPA, and we have a solar facility there picking up some generations. So about half of its increase -- half of the increased generation in our hedge disclosure represents increased dispatch on our plans and half are the new acquisitions in Texas. In the kind of market that is set up for this kind of volatility if you have supply/demand equilibrium driven by either longer-term supply/demand fundamentals or in some part, in this case extreme weather, extreme drought that caused the conditions that we saw in August and somewhat through September. So the heat rates picked up to a point where they represent more value, option value, for peaking assets. I think this is something that can continue obviously driven many of the fundamental long-term drivers which we discussed, as well as weather, but this is an indication that, as you get closer to equilibrium, you will see more power volatility and see higher value for the kinds of assets that we have in Texas. From a retail business perspective, we like the retail business. The retail business is the most effective way for us to find hedges for our portfolio that's designed to serve retail load. We have that, in large part, in the Mid-Atlantic, we have it in Texas with our Mid-American peaking assets, so this in no way changes our perspective on what the value of a retail business and load following in a portfolio can do for you. We just don't like to sell it when it's not valued fairly in the market, and we'll sell it appropriately when it is valued fairly in the market."

We believe one of the great virtues of the merger is it puts their retail marketing capability with our Generations. And we like that in Texas as in other places. Ken Cornew, who will be heading the whole trading shop for the combined company, will be working with both Chris and Mayo to try to come up with a conservative, adequately hedged approach to handling places where we have more load than generation. I think the real difference is that learning, as we all have from the last 9 months, we probably hedged a little sooner than Constellation has historically or a little more completely, in other words, we take the tail out a little further. It was possible to do that, indeed, Ken was able to sell some power at very high prices from our fleet in the wake of the heat and then buy it back a few weeks later at cheaper prices than he can produce it for. So to us, it's a matter of learning from the whole thing. We believe Constellation will turn out to have had some losses in Texas. Ken's last guess is that they're smaller than our gains, but we don't know yet and you'll find that out in the Constellations' earnings call. What's really important here is the 2 things are stronger together than separately and we're going to impose a conservative hedging discipline on the whole. Ken, would you like to add to that?"

Most large customers have switched where they can, that's true in both Illinois and Pennsylvania and in other competitive markets, but we're seeing more switching by small commercial customers, the beginnings of serious switching by residential customers, with more in Pennsylvania than in Illinois but the trend is the same and more efforts by municipalities to aggregate and this is one of the reasons why we value the Constellation purchase, because they're further along in developing both the marketing groups and people and the backup IT platform than we are. With that, I'll turn it over to Ken."

We focused our attention on industrial and commercial customers in Pennsylvania and have spent most of our time developing those systems and people and capability to market to that segment.

We have no activity in that market right now."

Second, if Chris Crane and Bill Von Hoene and Darryl Bradford, Calvin Butler are really successful, by the time we get to our next earnings call, we might have closed Constellation and that if that's the case, it would be a very good thing indeed, but if that's the case, this will be the last time you'll hear from me on one of these and so I just want to make some points very crisply about what's going on here. Again and again, over the last several years, we have beaten estimates, we have proven that the machine works across the board as different parts of the company, find the extra at different times. And yes, it's coincidental just which one performs when, with the extra value. But what's not coincidental is we've got a whole lot of hounds hunting and they do it really well and they're not here because they're pretty, they're here because they produce results. And that's true in our nuclear operation, it's true in the 2 delivery companies, it's true with our rate-making people, it's true with Tom Terry's work on taxes, it's true with Joe Dominguez's remarkable work in Ohio with Duke and AEP. I mean, things are working here and Chris Crane will be as absolutely dedicated to value as I am, and this management team will be as dedicated to value without me as it has been with me. And you know and we know because your forecast for the next couple of years aren't much different than ours, that the next couple of years are going to be tougher on an earnings basis. And you know and we know, that there's nobody else with the same upside that we have down the road. And it really is fortunate in my view that we're starting to see glimmers of that upside in power markets already. Energy just isn't going to be free in those markets indefinitely. So I really just want to end this by saying, you have one hell of a team working for you here and they will continue to deliver. Thank you very much."
