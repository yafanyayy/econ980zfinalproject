Four weeks ago, we have a 2011 guidance call, and I hope you came away from that call with a sense of the confidence we have going to this year and our ability to have another breakout year similar to 2010 operationally, financially and in terms of share price performance. We entered the year with a lot of momentum and a higher level of energy and excitement that at any time in my tenure with El Paso. In E&P, we're ramping up our activity and some of the most exciting oil plays out there, and our early results are very encouraging as Brent will share more detail. 
In the pipes, them now got 85% of the Ruby pipe welded up. And while we're increasing our estimated cost to viewpoint $3.55 billion, we also had a much greater certainty on the remaining risks. Hence, the elimination of the range for completed costs. And while Ruby execution isn't what we forecast, we still expect to put the entirety of our $8 million backlog in service this year. 
We don't have a Midstream update today except to say that market the same continue to push forward on two key projects in the Marcellus and the Eagleford in addition to successfully expanding existing Midstream assets and the Eagleford and Altamont.

In Slide 5 you'll see a snapshot of our fourth quarter financial results. We reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.20 for the quarter.

We reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.20 for the quarter. Now when compared to 2009, the difference is primarily driven by lower realized commodity prices. During the quarter, we only had about 60% of our domestic natural gas production hedged around $5.80 compared to nearly 90% at north of $6 in the first three quarters of this year. Compared that to the fourth quarter of 2009 when we had almost 75% of our gas production hedged at roughly $9. Bottom line, that lower realized commodity prices reduced our earnings by about $0.10 per share quarter over quarter. 
In addition to the impact from lower prices, fourth quarter results reflected higher performance-related employee benefit costs of about $0.02 a share. As a result of our strong share price performance relative to our peer group in 2010, we doubled the amount of the company matching contribution for our employees who participate in the 401(k) plan with El Paso stock. This discretionary matching contribution is only available when our total shareholder returns performance versus our peers exceeds the medium level. Now we think this is a great way to assure our employees are aligned with our shareholders interest. And this additional matching contribution is, however, not available for senior management. 
Slide 6, is a bit of our report card and our key 2010 goals. Now I'm not going to go through to each and every one of these since we touched on many during our recent guidance call. But by all accounts, we certainly have a very successful year. 
Adjusted earnings per share and cash flow from operations were better than we guided to in late 2009 and that's despite Natural Gas pricing well below the $5.50 assumption that we had used in our original plan. And overall, both business units had a great year. And despite the challenges on Ruby, the Pipeline Group had an excellent year executing on the projects placed in service in 2010, putting five projects in service collectively $100 million under budget. And on the E&P side, our E&P team not get out apart for second year in a row. Brent will walk you through some of these key measures in just a couple of minute. 
On Slide 7, I'll round out our brief look back to a 2010 with some of the other key year-end metrics. We ended the year with $13.7 billion of total net debt. This includes $3.4 billion of consolidated debt of our MLP, El Paso Pipeline Partners. It also includes $1.1 billion of Ruby debt that will be deconsolidated from our balance sheet shortly after the pipelines placed in service. And at that point, it will be recourse only to the Ruby pipeline. We came into 2011 with very strong liquidity, $2.4 billion, even after retiring about $700 million of El Paso debt late in 2010. And finally, 2010 CapEx finished the year $4.2 billion, pretty close to our original CapEx target for the year. Now remember, E&P CapEx included the incremental $265 million of lease acquisition capital for Eagleford and Wolfcamp oil acreage. And on the pipeline side, last year's $2.8 billion of capital will likely be the high watermark for many years to come. 
On Slide 8, we reiterate our primary financial objectives for 2011. And although I've covered these on our recent call, I think it's important to keep this front and center. First and foremost, we intend on improving the balance sheet so that we achieve an investment group profile by 2012. There's no question that reaching this goal has very positive implications for shareholder value. The best tool we have four accelerate our deleveraging is continuing our MLP drop-down strategy using EPB. And make no mistake, we're focused on maximizing the impact of the strategy to the benefit of El Paso and El Paso pipeline stakeholders. In the last month's call, I noted that our guidance assumes we complete two to three drops in 2011. 
And finally, we'll maintain adequate liquidity throughout the year and support our businesses. As we progress through the year, the need to maintain our historic liquidity levels will diminish as we complete the pipeline backlog and continue to improve and further de-risk our balance sheet.
I will wrap up this morning with an update on our hedge positions on Slide 9. Since our last call, we added 2.7 million barrels of oil hedges for 2012. So based on our forecasted 2011 production, we've got about 70% of our 2012 oil production hedged with downside protection at $90. So despite the constructive macro outlook for oil, the $90 flora fields pretty good. Nothings change in our GAAP hedges other than the fact that they are further into money and continue to look great. And by the way, our hedges boosted our cash flow by roughly $300 million in 2010, which when added about $1 billion generated in 2009, equates to almost $2 per share of incremental cash flow. So I'm quite proud of the value our disciplined hedging programs created over the last couple of years in what has been a very challenging commodity market. That's it for me. I'll turn the call over to Jim for pipeline update. Jim?"

Two in the Rockies and one in the Southeast to supply gas to a newly converted coal plants. All three are now generating revenue. That came in approximately $100 million under budget, as JR said, completing an excellent year of executing our projects that went into service last year. As you know, this year will essentially complete our regional $8 billion backlog by placing five more expansions in service. We've made good progress on Ruby, and it's getting close to completion but our cost estimate is higher. The other four projects are all on-time and on budget with the first of these FGT Phase VIII scheduled to begin service in April. 
As we start said the guidance call, we also have three major rig case this year. Our aim is to try is to settle all three by year end and get back to the business of serving our customers, meeting their needs safely and reliably and growing with them. 
On Slide 12, Slide 12 summarizes throughput trends for the year. Throughput was down approximately 2% overall for 2009 with increases in the East and decreases on our Western pipes. In the East, both SNG and TGP benefited from a very hot summer and cold weather. Also, TGP throughput increased due to the receipts from Marcellus and Pennsylvania and REX in Ohio. Marcellus production into TGP is now running at approximately 1.2 BCF a day, up from only 250 at the beginning of 2010. In the West, throughput was bound on both our Rockies pipes and on EPNG, not due to market demand, which was pretty flat along with both the front range and on the Southwest, but rather mostly due to competition. And the Rockies has increased competition on both intra-Rockies flows and exports out of the Rockies. On EPNG, it was supplier turn of this into California. Much of this additional supply was for LNG imports at Costa Azul, which more recently have declined. 
Importantly, we also see tangible signs now of improving market demands long-term by EPNG. While we're on throughput, let me take a minute to talk about our service to customers during the record-breaking cold-weather of a couple of weeks ago. In short, our pipes are able to demonstrate clearly their value to customers. We meant the peak thing needs of all our customers in the Northeast, Southeast and Rockies. This resulted from the first gas applies behind our pipes, extraordinary performance by our field operations people and a lot of communication between our customers and us. Our only service impact across the country was on part of EPNG South mainline and extreme West Texas, New Mexico and Arizona. This was due primarily to these us to Permian production and processing plant offsets, which entirely resulted in lower delivery pressures on EPNG. But even here, and with cold temperatures not seen in 45 years, we delivered to our customers substantially more gas than they received from their suppliers. And I want to share my appreciation to our workforce across the country, both field and office, for going the extra mile to serve our customers during this period.
On Ruby, we've made substantial progress on Ruby. As Doug said, we're now about 85% welded out, up from 70% reported just a month ago. At the same time, however, we've seem some cost and schedule slippage and now expect Ruby to cost approximately $3.55 billion and be in service in July. This results from the combined impacts of extremely wet weather in December across Northern Nevada and Southern Oregon, delays in permitting and restrictions due to fishing game habitat. Also, until recently, we expected to complete a 40-mile section of spread five in Nevada before the stage grounds mating season begins on March 1. We haven't been able to do this primarily because of delays in obtaining final culture resource clearances. Now we won't start construction on short stretches of that section until the mating season ends in mid-May. And we've temporarily shut down that spread's pipeline. So we're unlikely to complete spread five until July. 
Some of the increase in project costs is additional cash costs and some is non-cash AFUDC costs associated with the later in-service. The good news is that we believe we have more certainty now on our cost estimate. We feel better about each of the three critical issues that we've highlighted for you since the first of the year. First, the worst of the winter weather is behind us. Second, permitting and culture resource clearances are for the most part complete. And third, we have better clarity around efficient gain construction windows, although we're still dealing with a few issues on some stream process. Not only have we made good progress as evidenced by the percent welded, but also the Eastern spreads are all very nearly complete, so our run rate must spend is dropping off. So we have better line of sight now on the finish line, and we'll update you again on our May first quarter earnings call. And now I'll turn it over to Brent."

We posted good numbers again",1508,"Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to begin this morning on Slide 15. I've met with a number of investors over the past few weeks, and it was great to hear feedback and recognition that our E&P strategy is working. We posted good numbers again last year, and I'll review some of those with you in a moment. But we also know that we had continued to deliver, and we're off to a good start. 
We began the year with our production at roughly $800 million a day within our guidance range for this year, so we're on plan. But remember that our relatively wide guidance range has taken into account the potential to further shift capital from gas oil, which may impact volume guidance providing growth for that greater value. Now we continue to ramp up our local activities with two more rigs in our essential Eagle Ford area. The results of the program continue to be at or better than our pre-drill models and we're delivering some of the same efficiency gains in the Eagleford that we delivered in our Haynesville program. We've drilled for Wolfcamp wells, one is online and we are currently completing two of the wells. We're on track with our delineation plan there with two wells drilled today in the eastern portion of our acreage, one in the center and one in the Western side. 
We've also taken a whole course on two wells and the quarrying, drilling, logging data that we have gathered so far has been very consistent with our expectations and is also been some horizontal wells drilled offset our acreage that look very good and adds enthusiasm about this program. 
Considering the date of the timing of data flow in the play, we're currently planning to update on our will come program in our May 5 earnings call but perhaps one of the conferences. Some of the key metrics through 2010 performance are shown on Slide 16. Our production was $782 million equivalent per day, which is above the high end of our guidance and above 2009 results. Our fourth quarter production was $795 a day, which is up 7% year-over-year and was the highest quarterly production that we have reported since the first quarter of 2009. Cash costs were also lower than they were in 2009, coming in and $1.78 versus $1.82. 
I'm also very pleased with our reserve growth and efficiency metrics and our inventory growth for the year. When you look at 2010 E&P performance, I think the key takeaway is that we've reached a point where we can consistently deliver results that are competitive with the best of our industry peers. 
We've updated Slide 17 from our guidance call to show you our current drilling activity. We've added two oil rigs, both in the Eagleford. So in total, we now have over twice as many oil rigs and gas rigs working, and we plan for that ratio to increase during the course of the year. In the near term, we still plan to run four rigs in the Haynesville program, which is a very optimized and economic activity level. But as I said in our guidance call, depending on gas prices and service costs, we may choose to further reduce our activity and shift capital to one of our oil programs. 
Another factor that can change our activity level is whether or not we take a partner of the Eagleford. We're very much in the throes of those discussion will likely decide by the end of Q1. If we can accelerate our Eagleford program while improving the value of the opportunity by taking a partner, then we'll do it. If not, then we go alone and ship capital as we need to in the second half of the year. 
And let's stay with the Eagleford with an update on Slide 18. We are pleased with our results today that we have essentially doubled our activity level since the first of the year. We're achieving production tests and expected the EURs that as good as and are better-than-expected and we're pushing again additional cost efficiencies. Most of our activity is in the Central LaSalle County area where we have our largest acreage position. We now believe that area contains volatile oil, meaning that we have oil in the reservoir with associated gas at the surface versus having gas wells that condensate dropping out of the surface. Three of the 14 wells that we've drilled here had initial rates in excess of 1,000 barrel a day equivalent. And we recently drilled our longest lateral roughly 6400 feet, completed the well with 21 frac stages and have seen daily producing rates of over 900 barrel equivalents. So as we move into development phase, the Eagleford will have become more impactful in 2011. Since the beginning of this year, we completed nine new wells and when we get the newer completions online, we expect to double production from the field. 
On Slide 19, we showed that production mix over the expected life of the wells in the central and the northern area of Eagleford, which is consistent with a models that we published last October at a time of our Eagleford field trip. Now I want to briefly revisit this topic because in recent conversations with investors, I've heard some confusion about the product mix from our northern and central areas of Eagleford, and that makes up about as a reminder of our 2/3 of our total acreage position. And we believe that essential area of our about 75% of our recoverable reserves are expected to be oil. NGLs are only about 10% of the volume, with which means that while ethane and other liquid prices improved economics, they're not a big value driver in our program. In the northern area, where we have currently one rig working, the oil contribution increases even further to 85%. At all the wells in that northern area with the artificial lift almost from day one so we're quickly working to determine the best method of pumping the wells, both while we're producing back the water initially and in the long-term production mode. 
Noted in Frio County wells has been completed, and we're currently installing artificial lift in that well. And also in our northern area, we've drilled the well in Ariscosa county, so it's our first well there. And we drilled and logged the vertical pile hole and then we drilled the horizontal section in early of our long responses are both very encouraging. So we're anxious to see how that well produces. 
Our last chart is on Slide 20 this morning. And we're always focused on continuous improvement in all of our programs, all of our asset areas and in all parts of our business. And as a result, we believe that the Haynesville execution and cost structure to stop quartile and open industry-leading. We've taken our Haynesville practices and moving down to the Eagleford so we're moving up the learning curve rapidly, which means we're finding ways to cut time and capital costs  per well. And we've only been drilling the Eagleford for a little over a year, and the results shown on the slide are based on about 20 well set. We made significant progress during the drilled phase, improving from 500 feet per day to about 1,200 feet per day. We also had similar success in the time required from spud to total debt, cutting the number of days by over 60% from about 31 days to 11 days on our best well to date. 
And just we have done elsewhere, our drilling team has delivered these efficiencies by optimizing the drill bit, the downhole motor and the drilling designs and combinations. And then, we believe later as we move into multi-well paths, we expect to see continued reduction in cycle time. Remember though that half of our well costs is for completion and simulation, so finding efficiencies in frac-ing these wells has a major cost benefit. Averaging 3.6 fracs per day at far best well today is great progress for our Eagleford team. We've benefited from having a dedicated completion crews with Foster's better safety performance and better teamwork and coordination, and we expect to additional gains as we continue to find ways to further eliminate the non-productive time or downtime. About 40% of our stimulation costs comes from fixed equipment charges, so we'll see lower approved well costed as we improve the efficiency of Eagleford completions or as we further improve the average number of fracs per day. And then we'll spread that fixed costs to over more completions. At 3.6 fracs a day is our best Eagleford phase, but we're not stopping there because we're now consistently averaging closer to four fracs per day in the Haynesville. 
Overall, I'm really pleased with how this development is progresses and I continue to believe the Eagleford will be long term anchor program for us. I'll now turn the call back to Doug for closing comments."

It's exciting at $100 crude well to have a meaningful oil component in our E&P story and when we intend to make the most of that opportunity. By year end, we'll have at least 3x as many oil directive rigs as gas directed rigs and maybe more. And that's going to yield 30% to 40% growth in oil production this year and another 50% in 2012. 
Restoring our balance sheet strength is also a top priority for 2011. One of the primary tools to accomplish this is EPV, and there's every reason to believe we'll have another successful year growing EPV to the benefit of both the MLP unitholders and EP shareholders. We know that this continued improvement is key to getting the premium multiple for our stock day we believe we deserve. 
Another valuation key is the completion of our extensive backlog in the pipes, as well as successfully concluding rate cases on EPNG, CIG and TGP. We expect to get all this done much of it in the first half of this year. And in Midstream, you'll more from Mark on our Analyst Day in May. But in the meantime, his team is very busy completing for the mass project in the Marcellus and the Camino Real project in the Eagleford. And while each is very competitive, we're completing hard to get this across the finish line. We're making great progress already on these and other milestones we laid out for you in our earlier guidance call, and that means we have every expectation that 2011 will be another rewarding year for our shareholders. 
Finally, while we're on the topic of rewarding our shareholders, I'll wait that someone on the call is planning to ask about corporate structure given recent events in the capital markets. The key message I want you to take from this call is that we'll do what is right for our shareholders to create long-term sustainable value. And that's what we are talking about the management team or our board. So while our immediate focus is on all those milestones we laid out for 2011, we're not deaf to the markets. In fact, recent events we think are very exciting for a one as an EP shareholder or considering an EP shareholder. Case in point. So new high watermarks have been achieved recently in terms of valuations for high-quality GPs. We think that's not only appropriate; it's outstanding. And we just happen to own 100% of the highest quality GP. And the great news is, it has a tremendous growth profile. We only reached the 50% incentive distribution region rights in the fourth quarter of 2010. So the $50 million to $60 million in distributions to the GP in 2011 is still toward the front end of our very high growth trajectory that will create lots and lots of value for EP shareholders. And because it has the lowest risks, highest growth characteristics out there due to its sponsor and due to the fact that it's the only pure play GP, it sets the high watermark for what GPs are worth. In addition, recent transactions point out that company's strong balance sheet and high cash payouts are highly valued in the market. That's why we're running as fast as we can to make sure we maximize the strength of our balance sheet. And we have every expectation that we'll do just that. 
And E&P companies and assets that have low risks, repeatable drilling inventories at the lower end of the cost curve and with oil exposure gone our high valuations, that's exactly what we think we have. So if you believe that management is properly incented and the company is properly governed, then there's really nothing but upside calling our shares in this regard. So where do we stack up on those dimensions? Management has higher than average levels in compensation to changes in equity values. And given that as a group, we haven't been sellers and we are all very large owners relative to our personal work. You should assume we think and act like owners. We also have a very independent, very shareholder-minded board that I think stacks up well against any competitor we have. 
So I think I'll note two key dimensions. We have a vision of a company that will stay laser focused on taking the actions that will maximize the long-term share price of El Paso. In addition, we have a track record of doing just that, having made many, many shareholder-friendly decisions as we brought this company back from the brink. While we like the integrated model and see key benefits to it, we're not married to it. We have looked and will continue to look at structure. And the great news is, we're doing it in a vacuum. We've got interesting real world data points that analyze and monitor, some from well season transactions and some from more recent announcements. I believe that significantly increases the likelihood that a dispassionate analysis will yield the right result. This has been and will continue to be a key topic of discussion in both the management and the board level and will continue to keep you apprised of our decisions in this regard. And with that, we're happy to open it up to your questions."

But on spread five, our plan, and I think it's a well developed while we know all the parameters because of the stage cost meeting issue, within that frame mile stretch, there's only about 12 to 14 miles that's impacted by this stage grasp meeting issues. So we're clearing through what we can clear through now. As soon as we can, we'll start stringing and then welding up. Realistically,  from an assembly line operation standpoint, we won't be able to get up to that. We won't be able to do appreciable welding on that stretch until mid-May. But when you go through that exercise on spread five, we should be welded up on the whole thing in June 2 to tie ends into early July and have plenty of time for purging and packing, et cetera. Anyway, that sort of a critical path matter. On spread six and seven, in Oregon, we effective -- we're very close to having all of our permits there. And so there is more continuing to granted out as we have been doing. And we fully expect that is well us all of the rest of the pipeline with the exception of spread five to be fully welded out by the end of April. So that there are the tight ends and testing on that will commence. So as soon as we finish spread five with very limited time after that, we'll be able to put it in service. So I guess my point is that on costs, we have a much better pretty and then we have ongoing weather issues but we're through the worst of that. We essentially have all of our permits in place. The worst of the construction is really behind us. The work on spreads five, six and seven, on spread five, once we get in there, it's not difficult pipeline. So we just feel a lot better about our costs and schedule."

Obviously, we're in kind of a crazy world market right now. But we've had better results kind of come in the Eagleford. And one I'm wondering is, are we seeing sort of a creep up in the ask price?

Four weeks ago, we had a 2011 guidance call, and I hope you came away from that call with a sense of a confidence we have going into this year and our ability to have another breakout year similar to 2010 operationally, financially and in terms of share price performance. We entered the year with a lot of momentum and a higher level of energy and excitement than at any time in my tenure with El Paso. In E&P, we're ramping up our activity in some of the most exciting oil plays out there, and our early results are very encouraging as Brent will share in more detail. 
In the pipes, we now got 85% of the Ruby pipe welded up. And while we're increasing our estimated cost to $3.55 billion, we also had a much greater certainty on the remaining risks. Hence, the elimination of a range for completed costs. And while Ruby execution isn't what we forecast, we still expect to put the entirety of our $8 million backlog in service this year.

On Slide 5, you'll see a snapshot of our fourth quarter financial results. We reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.20 for the quarter.

We reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.20 for the quarter. Now when compared to 2009, the difference is primarily driven by a lower realized commodity prices. 
During the quarter, we only had about 60% of our domestic natural gas production hedged around $5.80 compared to nearly 90% at north of $6 in the first three quarters of this year. Compare that to the fourth quarter of 2009 when we had almost 75% of our gas production hedged at roughly $9. Bottom line, that lower realized commodity price has reduced our earnings by about $0.10 per share quarter over quarter. 
In addition to the impact from lower prices, fourth quarter results reflected higher performance-related employee benefit costs of about $0.02 a share. As a result of our strong share price performance relative to our peer group in 2010, we doubled the amount of the company matching contribution for our employees who participated in the 401(k) plan with El Paso stock. This discretionary matching contribution is only available when our total shareholder return performance versus our peers exceeds the medium level. 
Now we think this is a great way to assure our employees are aligned with our shareholders interest. And this additional matching contribution is, however, not available to senior management.
Slide 6, is a bit of a report card in our key 2010 goals. Now I'm not going to go through to each and every one of these since we touched on many during our recent guidance call. But by all accounts, we certainly had a very successful year. 
Adjusted earnings per share and cash flow from operations were better than we guided to in late 2009 and that's despite natural gas pricing well below the $5.50 assumption that we had used in our original plan. And overall, both business units had a great year. 
And despite the challenges on Ruby, the Pipeline Group had an excellent year executing on the projects placed in service in 2010, putting five projects in service collectively $100 million under budget. 
And on the E&P side, our E&P team knocked it out of the park for the second year in a row. Brent will walk you through some of his key measures in just a couple of minute. 
On Slide 7, I round out a brief look back to 2010 with some of the other key year-end metrics. We ended the year with $13.7 billion of total net debt. This includes $3.4 billion of consolidated debt of our MLP, El Paso Pipeline Partners. It also includes $1.1 billion of Ruby debt that will be deconsolidated from our balance sheet shortly after the pipeline is placed in service. And at that point, it will be recoursed only to the Ruby pipeline. 
We came into 2011 with very strong liquidity, $2.4 billion, even after retiring about $700 million of El Paso debt late in 2010. 
And finally, 2010 CapEx finished the year $4.2 billion, pretty close to our original CapEx target for the year. Now remember, E&P CapEx included the incremental $265 million of lease acquisition capital for Eagle Ford and Wolfcamp oil acreage. And on the pipeline side, last year's $2.8 billion of capital will likely be the high watermark for many years to come. 
On Slide 8, we reiterate our primary financial objectives for 2011. And although I've covered these on our recent call, I think it's important to keep this front and center. 
First and foremost, we intend on improving the balance sheet so that we achieve an investment-grade profile by 2012. There's no question that reaching this goal has very positive implications for shareholder value. The best tool we have to accelerate our deleveraging is continuing our MLP drop-down strategy using EPB. And make no mistake, we're focused on maximizing the impact of this strategy to the benefit of El Paso and El Paso Pipeline Partners stakeholders. 
In the last month's call, I noted that our guidance assumes we complete two to three drops in 2011.
And finally, we'll maintain adequate liquidity throughout the year to support our businesses. As we progress through the year, the need to maintain our historic liquidity levels will diminish as we complete the pipeline backlog and continue to improve and further de-risk our balance sheet.
I'll wrap up this morning with an update on our hedge positions on Slide 9. Since our last call, we added 2.7 million barrels of oil hedges for 2012. So based on our forecasted 2011 production, we've got about 70% of our 2012 oil production hedge with downside protection at $90. So despite the constructive macro outlook for oil, the $90 floor fill is pretty good. 
Nothing's change at our GAAP hedges other than the fact that they're further into money and continue to look great. And by the way, our hedges boosted our cash flow by roughly $300 million in 2010, which when added to about $1 billion generated in 2009, equates to almost $2 per share of incremental cash flow. So I'm quite proud of the value our disciplined hedging programs created over the last couple of years in what has been a very challenging commodity market. 
That's it for me. I'll turn the call over to Jim for pipeline update. Jim?"
1038355,118084823,106159,"El Paso Corp., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2011",2011-02-24,"Earnings Calls","El Paso LLC","Executives","Thanks, J.R. With the pipelines, the fourth quarter was a busy one as we placed and serviced three more growth projects; two in the Rockies and one in the Southeast to supply gas to a newly converted coal plant. All three are now generating revenue. That",872,"Thanks, J.R. With the pipelines, the fourth quarter was a busy one as we placed and serviced three more growth projects; two in the Rockies and one in the Southeast to supply gas to a newly converted coal plant. All three are now generating revenue. That came in approximately $100 million under budget, as J.R. said, completing an excellent year of executing on projects that went in service last year. 
As you know, this year will essentially complete our regional $8 billion backlog by placing five more expansions in service. We've made good progress on Ruby, and it's getting close to completion but our cost estimate is higher. The other four projects are all on-time and on-budget, with the first of these, FGT Phase VIII, scheduled to begin service in April. 
As we start said on the guidance call, we also have three major rig case this year. Our aim is to try is to settle all three by year end and get back to the business of serving our customers, meeting their needs safely and reliably and growing with them. 
On Slide 12, Slide 12 summarizes throughput trends for the year. Throughput was down approximately 2% overall from 2009 with increases in the East and decreases on our Western pipes. 
In the East, both SNG and TGP benefited from a very hot summer and cold weather. Also, TGP throughput increased due to the receipts from Marcellus in Pennsylvania and REX in Ohio. Marcellus production into TGP is now running at approximately 1.2 Bs [BCF] a day, up from only 250 a day at the beginning of 2010. 
In the West, throughput was down on both our Rockies pipes and on EPNG, not due to market demand which was pretty flat along both the front range and on the Southwest but rather mostly due to competition. And the Rockies has increased competition on both intra-Rockies flows and exports out of the Rockies. 
On EPNG, it was supply alternatives into California. Much of this additional supply was for LNG imports at Costa Azul, which more recently have declined.  Importantly, we also see tangible signs now of improving market demands long-term on EPNG. 
While we're on throughput, let me take a minute to talk about our service to customers during the record-breaking cold weather of a couple of weeks ago. In short, our pipes were to demonstrate clearly their value to customers. We met the peak they needs [ph] of all our customers in the Northeast, Southeast and Rockies. This resulted from the diverse gas supplies behind our pipes, extraordinary performance by our field operations people and a lot of communication between our customers and us. Our only service impact across the country was on part of EPNG South mainline in extreme West Texas, New Mexico and Arizona. This was due primarily to frees us to Permian production and processing plant offsets, which entirely resulted in lower delivery pressures on EPNG. 
But even here, and with cold temperatures not seen in 45 years, we delivered to our customers substantially more gas than they received from their suppliers. And I want to share my appreciation to our workforce across the country, both field and office, for going the extra mile to serve our customers during this period.
On Ruby, we've made substantial progress on Ruby. As Doug said, we're now about 85% welded out, up from 70% reported just a month ago. At the same time, however, we've seem some cost and schedule slippage and now expect Ruby to cost approximately $3.55 billion and be in service in July. This results from the combined impacts of extremely wet weather in December across Northern Nevada and Southern Oregon, delays in permitting and restrictions due to fish and game habitat. 
Also, until recently, we expected to complete a 40 mile section of Spread 5 in Nevada before the sage grouse mating season begins on March 1. We haven't been able to do this, primarily because of delays in obtaining final cultural resource clearances. Now we won't start construction on short stretches of that section until the mating season ends in mid-May. And we've temporarily shut down that spread's pipeline. So we're unlikely to complete Spread 5 until July. 
Some of the increase in project costs is additional cash costs and some is non-cash AFUDC costs associated with the later in-service. 
The good news is that we believe we have more certainty now on our cost estimate. We feel better about each of the three critical issues that we've highlighted for you since the first of the year: First, the worst of the winter weather is behind us; second, permitting and cultural resource clearances are for the most part, complete; and third, we have greater clarity around fish and game construction windows, although we're still dealing with a few issues on some stream process. 
Not only have we made good progress as evidenced by the percent welded, but also the Eastern spreads are all very nearly complete. So our run rate mostly spend is dropping off. 
So we have better line of sight now on the finish line, and we'll update you again on our May first quarter earnings call. 
And now I'll turn it over to Brent."

I've met with a number of investors over the past few weeks, and it was great to hear feedback and recognition that our E&P strategy is working. 
We posted good numbers again last year, and I'll review some of those with you in a moment. But we also know that we had to continue to deliver, and we're off to a good start. 
We began the year with our production at roughly $800 million a day within our guidance range for this year, so we're on plan. But remember that our relatively-wide guidance range has taken into account the potential to further shift capital from gas to oil, which may impact volume guidance providing growth for that greater value. 
We continue to ramp up our oil activities with two more rigs in our essential Eagle Ford area. Now results on the program continue to be at or better than our pre-drill models, and we're delivering some of the same efficiency gains in the Eagle Ford that we delivered in our Haynesville program. We've drilled four Wolfcamp wells, one is online and we are currently completing two of the wells. We're on track with our delineation plan there with two of the wells drilled today in the eastern portion of our acreage, one in the center and one on the Western side. 
We've also taken a whole course on two wells and the quarrying, drilling, logging data that we have gathered so far has been very consistent with our expectations. There's also been some horizontal wells drilled to offset our acreage that look very good and adds to our enthusiasm about this program. 
Considering the date of the timing of data flow in the play, we're currently planning to update on our Wolfcamp program in our May 5 earnings call or perhaps in or one of the conferences. 
Some of the key metrics from 2010 performance are shown on Slide 16. Our production was 782 million equivalent per day, which is above the high end of our guidance and above 2009 results. Our fourth quarter production was $795 a day, which is up 7% year-over-year and was the highest quarterly production that we've reported since the first quarter of 2009. Cash costs were also lower than they were in 2009, coming in at $1.78 versus $1.82. 
I'm also very pleased with our reserve growth and efficiency metrics in our inventory growth for the year. When you look at 2010 E&P performance, I think the key takeaway is that we've reached a point where we can consistently deliver results that are competitive with the best of our industry peers. 
We've updated Slide 17 from our guidance call to show you our current drilling activity. We've added two oil rigs, both in the Eagle Ford. So in total, we now have over twice as many oil rigs than gas rigs working, and we plan for that ratio to increase during the course of the year. In the near term, we still plan to run four rigs in the Haynesville program, which is a very optimized and economic activity level. But as I said in our guidance call, depending on gas prices and service costs, we may choose to further reduce our activity and shift capital to one of our oil programs. 
Another factor that can change our activity level is whether or not we take a partner in the Eagle Ford. We're very much in the throes of those discussions and we'll likely decide by the end of Q1. 
If we can accelerate our Eagle Ford program while improving the value of the opportunity by taking a partner, then we'll do it. If not, then we'll go alone and shift capital as we need to in the second half of the year. 
And let's stay with the Eagle Ford with an update on Slide 18. We're pleased with our results today so we've essentially doubled our activity level since the first of the year. We're achieving production tests and expected the EURs that as good as or better-than-expected, and we're pushing to gain additional cost efficiencies. 
Most of our activity is in the Central LaSalle County area where we have our largest acreage position. And we now believe that area contains volatile oil, meaning that we have oil in the reservoir with associated gas at the surface versus having gas wells with condensate dropping out of the surface. Three of the 14 wells that we've drilled here had initial rates in excess of 1,000 barrel a day equivalent. And we recently drilled our longest lateral roughly 6,400 feet, completed the well with 21 frac stages and have seen daily producing rates of over 900 barrel equivalents. 
So as we move into development phase, the Eagle Ford will become more impactful in 2011. Since the beginning of this year, we completed nine new wells and when we get the newer completions online, we expect to double production from the field. 
On Slide 19, we showed that production mix over the expected life of the wells in the central and the northern area of Eagle Ford, which is consistent with a models that we published last October at a time of our Eagle Ford field trip. Now I want to briefly revisit this topic because in recent conversations with investors, I've heard some confusion about the product mix from our northern and central areas of the Eagle Ford, and those makes up about, as a reminder, about 2/3 of our total acreage position. And we believe that an essential area, about 75% of the recoverable reserves are expected to be oil. NGLs are only about 10% of the volume, with which means that while ethane and other liquid prices improved the economics, they're not a big value driver in our program. 
In the northern area where we have currently one rig working, the oil contribution increases even further to 85%. All the wells in that northern area with artificial lift almost from day one, so we're quickly working to determine the best method of pumping the wells both while we're producing back the frac water initially and in the long term, production mode. 
Note that Frio County wells has been completed, and we're currently installing artificial lift in that well. And also in our northern area, we've drilled the well in Atascosa county. It's our first well there. And we drilled and logged a vertical pile hole and then we drilled the horizontal section and early and long responses in both are very encouraging. So we're anxious to see how that well produces. 
Our last chart is on Slide 20 this morning. And we're always focused on continuous improvement in all of our programs, all of our asset areas and in with all parts of our business. And as a result, we believe that the Haynesville execution and cost structure is top quartile and often, industry-leading. We've taken our Haynesville practices and moving them down to the Eagle Ford so we're moving up the learning curve rapidly, which means we're finding ways to cut time and capital costs per well. And we've only been drilling the Eagle Ford for a little over a year, and the results shown on this slide are based on about 20 well data set. 
We made significant progress during the drilling phase, improving from 500 feet per day to about 1,200 feet per day. We also had similar success in the time required from spud to total debt, cutting the number of days by over 60% from about 31 days to 11 days on our best well to date. 
And just as we have done elsewhere, our drilling team's delivered these efficiencies by optimizing the drill bit, the downhole motor and the drilling fluid designs and combinations. And then, we believe later as we move into multi-well paths, we expect to see continued reduction in cycle time. 
Remember though that more than half of our well costs is for completion and simulation, so finding efficiencies in frac-ing these wells has a major cost benefit. Averaging 3.6 fracs per day at far best well today is great progress for our Eagle Ford team. We've benefited from having a dedicated completion crews with Foster's better safety performance and better teamwork and coordination, and we expect additional gains as we continue to find ways to further eliminate the non-productive time or downtime. 
About 40% of our stimulation costs comes from fixed equipment charges, so we'll see a lower per well cost as we improve the efficiency of Eagle Ford completions or as we further improve the average number of fracs per day. And then, we'll spread that fixed costs to over more completions. 
At 3.6 fracs a day is our best Eagle Ford phase, but we're not stopping there because we're now consistently averaging closer to 4 fracs per day in the Haynesville. 
Overall, I'm really pleased with how this development is progresses and I continue to believe that the Eagle Ford will be a long-;term anchor program for us. 
I'll now turn the call back to Doug for closing comments."

It's exciting at $100 crude world to have a meaningful oil component in our E&P story and when we intend to make the most of that opportunity. By year end, we'll have at least 3x as many oil directive rigs as gas directed rigs and maybe more. And that's going to yield 30% to 40% growth in oil production this year and another 50% in 2012. 
Restoring our balance sheet strength is also a top priority for 2011. One of the primary tools to accomplish this is EPV, and there's every reason to believe we'll have another successful year growing EPV to the benefit of both the MLP unitholders and the EP shareholders. We know that this continued improvement is key to getting the premium multiple for our stock that we believe we deserve. 
Another valuation key is the completion of our extensive backlog in the pipes, as well as successfully concluding rate cases on EPNG, CIG and TGP. We expect to get all this done, much of it in the first half of this year. 
And in Midstream, you'll more from Mark on our Analyst Day in May. But in the meantime, his team is very busy completing for the mass project in the Marcellus and the Camino Real project in the Eagle Ford. And while each is very competitive, we're competing hard to get this across the finish line. 
We're making great progress already on these and other milestones we laid out for you in our earlier guidance call, and that means we have every expectation that 2011 will be another rewarding year for our shareholders. 
Finally, while we're on the topic of rewarding our shareholders, I'll wager that someone on the call is planning to ask about corporate structure given recent events in the capital markets. The key message I want you to take from this call is that we'll do what is right for our shareholders to create long-term sustainable value. And that's why we are talking about the management team or our Board. 
So while our immediate focus is on all those milestones we laid out for 2011, we're not deaf to the markets. In fact, recent events we think are very exciting for anyone who is an EP shareholder or considering being an EP shareholder. 
Case in point. So a new high watermarks have been achieved recently in terms of valuations for high-quality GPs. We think that's not only appropriate, it's outstanding. And we just happen to own 100% of the highest quality GP. And the great news is, it has a tremendous growth profile. We only reached the 50% incentive distribution rights in the fourth quarter of 2010. So that $50 million to $60 million in distributions to the GP in 2011 is still toward the front end of a very high growth trajectory that will create lots and lots of value for EP shareholders. And because it has the lowest-risks highest-growth characteristics out there due to its sponsor and due to the fact that it's the only pure play GP, it sets the high watermark for what GPs are worth. In addition, recent transactions point out that company's strong with balance sheets and high cash payouts are highly valued in the market. That's why we're running as fast as we can to make sure we maximize the strength of our balance sheet. And we have every expectation that we'll do just that. 
And E&P companies and assets that have low risks, repeatable drilling inventories at the lower end of the cost curve and with oil exposure drawn our high valuations, that's exactly what we think we have. So if you believe that management is properly incented and the company is properly governed, then there's really nothing but upside all in our shares in this regard. So where do we stack up on those dimensions? Management has higher-than-average leverage and compensation to changes in equity values. And given that as a group, we haven't been sellers and we are all very large owners relative to our personal work, you should assume we think and act like owners. We also have a very independent, very shareholder-minded Board that I think stacks up well against any competitor we have. 
So I think I'll note two key dimensions. We have a vision of a company that will stay laser focused on taking the actions that will maximize the long-term share price of El Paso. In addition, we have a track record of doing just that, having made many, many shareholder-friendly decisions as we brought this company back from the brink. While we like the integrated model and see key benefits to it, we're not married to it. We have looked and will continue to look at structure. And the great news is, we're not doing it in a vacuum. We've got interesting real world data points to analyze and monitor, some from well-seasoned transactions and some from more recent announcements. 
I believe that significantly increases the likelihood that a dispassionate analysis will yield the right result. This has been and will continue to be a key topic of discussion in both the management and the Board level and we'll continue to keep you apprised of our decisions in this regard. And with that, we're happy to open it up to your questions."

So we have  -- and so, and that's in three discrete pieces. One is on Spread 5, where I'll talk about our plan in just a minute, and the other -- and so that probably comprises about 40 miles of 100. And the other two cases of 30 miles each or so are on Spreads 6 and 7 in Oregon. But on Spread 5, our plan, and I think it's a well-developed, while we know all the parameters because of the sage grouse mating issue, we -- within that 40 mile stretch, there's only about 12 to 14 miles that is impacted by this sage grouse mating issue. So we're clearing through what we can clear through now. As soon as we can, we'll start stringing and then welding up. Realistically, from an assembly-line-operation standpoint, we won't be able to get up to that. We won't be able to do appreciable welding on that stretch until mid-May. But when you go through that exercise on Spread 5, we should be welded up on the whole thing in June, do to tie ends then into early July and have plenty of time for purging and packing, et cetera. Anyway, that's sort of a critical path matter. On Spread 6 and 7, in Oregon, we effective -- we're very close to having all of our permits there. And so there is more, continuing to grind it out as we have been doing. And we fully expect that is well us all of the rest of the pipeline with the exception of Spread 5 to be fully welded out by the end of April. So that there are -- then tight ends and testing on that will commence. So that as soon as we finish Spread 5  with very limited time after that, we'll be able to put it in service. So I guess my point is that on costs, we have a much better prune down now. We have ongoing weather issues, but gee, won't through the worst of that. We essentially have all of our permits in place. The worst of the construction is really behind us. The' work on Spreads 5, 6 and 7 -- on Spread 5, once we get in there, it's not difficult pipeline. So we just feel a lot better about our costs and schedule."

Really, we're talking about longer term solutions, Camino Real and others, to be able to move gas as we ramped up over the next two or three years. So I don't think that'll be the bottleneck. There is currently a trucking tightness out there in the Eagle Ford, and so we happen to manage that very carefully as we grow oil volumes to make sure we've got enough tracking capacity and/or storage in the field to be able to have short periods of time when trucking gets tight. But I think that's all manageable. Until we get longer-term, more permanent solution. So either several of the pipeline, all pipeline solutions we're looking at right now and then the terminal that we're looking that would be half potentially, drills some of it [ph]. And so we're looking at all the options for longer term as we grow or pass where we think it's sensible, the easier we have to truck."

Four weeks ago, we had a 2011 guidance call, and I hope you came away from that call with a sense of a confidence we have going into this year and our ability to have another breakout year similar to 2010 operationally, financially and in terms of share price performance. We entered the year with a lot of momentum and a higher level of energy and excitement than at any time in my tenure with El Paso. In E&P, we're ramping up our activity in some of the most exciting oil plays out there, and our early results are very encouraging as Brent will share in more detail. 
In the pipes, we now got 85% of the Ruby pipe welded up. And while we're increasing our estimated cost to $3.55 billion, we also had a much greater certainty on the remaining risks. Hence, the elimination of a range for completed costs. And while Ruby execution isn't what we forecast, we still expect to put the entirety of our $8 million backlog in service this year.

We reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.20 for the quarter. Now when compared to 2009, the difference is primarily driven by a lower realized commodity prices. 
During the quarter, we only had about 60% of our domestic natural gas production hedged around $5.80 compared to nearly 90% at north of $6 in the first three quarters of this year. Compare that to the fourth quarter of 2009 when we had almost 75% of our gas production hedged at roughly $9. Bottom line, that lower realized commodity price has reduced our earnings by about $0.10 per share quarter over quarter. 
In addition to the impact from lower prices, fourth quarter results reflected higher performance-related employee benefit costs of about $0.02 a share. As a result of our strong share price performance relative to our peer group in 2010, we doubled the amount of the company matching contribution for our employees who participated in the 401(k) plan with El Paso stock. This discretionary matching contribution is only available when our total shareholder return performance versus our peers exceeds the medium level. 
Now we think this is a great way to assure our employees are aligned with our shareholders interest. And this additional matching contribution is, however, not available to senior management.
Slide 6, is a bit of a report card in our key 2010 goals. Now I'm not going to go through to each and every one of these since we touched on many during our recent guidance call. But by all accounts, we certainly had a very successful year. 
Adjusted earnings per share and cash flow from operations were better than we guided to in late 2009 and that's despite natural gas pricing well below the $5.50 assumption that we had used in our original plan. And overall, both business units had a great year. 
And despite the challenges on Ruby, the Pipeline Group had an excellent year executing on the projects placed in service in 2010, putting five projects in service collectively $100 million under budget. 
And on the E&P side, our E&P team knocked it out of the park for the second year in a row. Brent will walk you through some of his key measures in just a couple of minute. 
On Slide 7, I round out a brief look back to 2010 with some of the other key year-end metrics. We ended the year with $13.7 billion of total net debt. This includes $3.4 billion of consolidated debt of our MLP, El Paso Pipeline Partners. It also includes $1.1 billion of Ruby debt that will be deconsolidated from our balance sheet shortly after the pipeline is placed in service. And at that point, it will be recoursed only to the Ruby pipeline. 
We came into 2011 with very strong liquidity, $2.4 billion, even after retiring about $700 million of El Paso debt late in 2010. 
And finally, 2010 CapEx finished the year $4.2 billion, pretty close to our original CapEx target for the year. Now remember, E&P CapEx included the incremental $265 million of lease acquisition capital for Eagle Ford and Wolfcamp oil acreage. And on the pipeline side, last year's $2.8 billion of capital will likely be the high watermark for many years to come. 
On Slide 8, we reiterate our primary financial objectives for 2011. And although I've covered these on our recent call, I think it's important to keep this front and center. 
First and foremost, we intend on improving the balance sheet so that we achieve an investment-grade profile by 2012. There's no question that reaching this goal has very positive implications for shareholder value. The best tool we have to accelerate our deleveraging is continuing our MLP drop-down strategy using EPB. And make no mistake, we're focused on maximizing the impact of this strategy to the benefit of El Paso and El Paso Pipeline Partners stakeholders. 
In the last month's call, I noted that our guidance assumes we complete two to three drops in 2011.
And finally, we'll maintain adequate liquidity throughout the year to support our businesses. As we progress through the year, the need to maintain our historic liquidity levels will diminish as we complete the pipeline backlog and continue to improve and further de-risk our balance sheet.
I'll wrap up this morning with an update on our hedge positions on Slide 9. Since our last call, we added 2.7 million barrels of oil hedges for 2012. So based on our forecasted 2011 production, we've got about 70% of our 2012 oil production hedge with downside protection at $90. So despite the constructive macro outlook for oil, the $90 floor fill is pretty good. 
Nothing's change at our GAAP hedges other than the fact that they're further into money and continue to look great. And by the way, our hedges boosted our cash flow by roughly $300 million in 2010, which when added to about $1 billion generated in 2009, equates to almost $2 per share of incremental cash flow. So I'm quite proud of the value our disciplined hedging programs created over the last couple of years in what has been a very challenging commodity market. 
That's it for me. I'll turn the call over to Jim for pipeline update. Jim?"

With the pipelines, the fourth quarter was a busy one as we placed and serviced three more growth projects; two in the Rockies and one in the Southeast to supply gas to a newly converted coal plant. All three are now generating revenue. That",872,"Thanks, J.R. With the pipelines, the fourth quarter was a busy one as we placed and serviced three more growth projects; two in the Rockies and one in the Southeast to supply gas to a newly converted coal plant. All three are now generating revenue. That came in approximately $100 million under budget, as J.R. said, completing an excellent year of executing on projects that went in service last year. 
As you know, this year will essentially complete our regional $8 billion backlog by placing five more expansions in service. We've made good progress on Ruby, and it's getting close to completion but our cost estimate is higher. The other four projects are all on-time and on-budget, with the first of these, FGT Phase VIII, scheduled to begin service in April. 
As we start said on the guidance call, we also have three major rig case this year. Our aim is to try is to settle all three by year end and get back to the business of serving our customers, meeting their needs safely and reliably and growing with them. 
On Slide 12, Slide 12 summarizes throughput trends for the year. Throughput was down approximately 2% overall from 2009 with increases in the East and decreases on our Western pipes. 
In the East, both SNG and TGP benefited from a very hot summer and cold weather. Also, TGP throughput increased due to the receipts from Marcellus in Pennsylvania and REX in Ohio. Marcellus production into TGP is now running at approximately 1.2 Bs [BCF] a day, up from only 250 a day at the beginning of 2010. 
In the West, throughput was down on both our Rockies pipes and on EPNG, not due to market demand which was pretty flat along both the front range and on the Southwest but rather mostly due to competition. And the Rockies has increased competition on both intra-Rockies flows and exports out of the Rockies. 
On EPNG, it was supply alternatives into California. Much of this additional supply was for LNG imports at Costa Azul, which more recently have declined.  Importantly, we also see tangible signs now of improving market demands long-term on EPNG. 
While we're on throughput, let me take a minute to talk about our service to customers during the record-breaking cold weather of a couple of weeks ago. In short, our pipes were to demonstrate clearly their value to customers. We met the peak they needs [ph] of all our customers in the Northeast, Southeast and Rockies. This resulted from the diverse gas supplies behind our pipes, extraordinary performance by our field operations people and a lot of communication between our customers and us. Our only service impact across the country was on part of EPNG South mainline in extreme West Texas, New Mexico and Arizona. This was due primarily to frees us to Permian production and processing plant offsets, which entirely resulted in lower delivery pressures on EPNG. 
But even here, and with cold temperatures not seen in 45 years, we delivered to our customers substantially more gas than they received from their suppliers. And I want to share my appreciation to our workforce across the country, both field and office, for going the extra mile to serve our customers during this period.
On Ruby, we've made substantial progress on Ruby. As Doug said, we're now about 85% welded out, up from 70% reported just a month ago. At the same time, however, we've seem some cost and schedule slippage and now expect Ruby to cost approximately $3.55 billion and be in service in July. This results from the combined impacts of extremely wet weather in December across Northern Nevada and Southern Oregon, delays in permitting and restrictions due to fish and game habitat. 
Also, until recently, we expected to complete a 40 mile section of Spread 5 in Nevada before the sage grouse mating season begins on March 1. We haven't been able to do this, primarily because of delays in obtaining final cultural resource clearances. Now we won't start construction on short stretches of that section until the mating season ends in mid-May. And we've temporarily shut down that spread's pipeline. So we're unlikely to complete Spread 5 until July. 
Some of the increase in project costs is additional cash costs and some is non-cash AFUDC costs associated with the later in-service. 
The good news is that we believe we have more certainty now on our cost estimate. We feel better about each of the three critical issues that we've highlighted for you since the first of the year: First, the worst of the winter weather is behind us; second, permitting and cultural resource clearances are for the most part, complete; and third, we have greater clarity around fish and game construction windows, although we're still dealing with a few issues on some stream process. 
Not only have we made good progress as evidenced by the percent welded, but also the Eastern spreads are all very nearly complete. So our run rate mostly spend is dropping off. 
So we have better line of sight now on the finish line, and we'll update you again on our May first quarter earnings call. 
And now I'll turn it over to Brent."

I've met with a number of investors over the past few weeks, and it was great to hear feedback and recognition that our E&P strategy is working. 
We posted good numbers again last year, and I'll review some of those with you in a moment. But we also know that we had to continue to deliver, and we're off to a good start. 
We began the year with our production at roughly $800 million a day within our guidance range for this year, so we're on plan. But remember that our relatively-wide guidance range has taken into account the potential to further shift capital from gas to oil, which may impact volume guidance providing growth for that greater value. 
We continue to ramp up our oil activities with two more rigs in our essential Eagle Ford area. Now results on the program continue to be at or better than our pre-drill models, and we're delivering some of the same efficiency gains in the Eagle Ford that we delivered in our Haynesville program. We've drilled four Wolfcamp wells, one is online and we are currently completing two of the wells. We're on track with our delineation plan there with two of the wells drilled today in the eastern portion of our acreage, one in the center and one on the Western side. 
We've also taken a whole course on two wells and the quarrying, drilling, logging data that we have gathered so far has been very consistent with our expectations. There's also been some horizontal wells drilled to offset our acreage that look very good and adds to our enthusiasm about this program. 
Considering the date of the timing of data flow in the play, we're currently planning to update on our Wolfcamp program in our May 5 earnings call or perhaps in or one of the conferences. 
Some of the key metrics from 2010 performance are shown on Slide 16. Our production was 782 million equivalent per day, which is above the high end of our guidance and above 2009 results. Our fourth quarter production was $795 a day, which is up 7% year-over-year and was the highest quarterly production that we've reported since the first quarter of 2009. Cash costs were also lower than they were in 2009, coming in at $1.78 versus $1.82. 
I'm also very pleased with our reserve growth and efficiency metrics in our inventory growth for the year. When you look at 2010 E&P performance, I think the key takeaway is that we've reached a point where we can consistently deliver results that are competitive with the best of our industry peers. 
We've updated Slide 17 from our guidance call to show you our current drilling activity. We've added two oil rigs, both in the Eagle Ford. So in total, we now have over twice as many oil rigs than gas rigs working, and we plan for that ratio to increase during the course of the year. In the near term, we still plan to run four rigs in the Haynesville program, which is a very optimized and economic activity level. But as I said in our guidance call, depending on gas prices and service costs, we may choose to further reduce our activity and shift capital to one of our oil programs. 
Another factor that can change our activity level is whether or not we take a partner in the Eagle Ford. We're very much in the throes of those discussions and we'll likely decide by the end of Q1. 
If we can accelerate our Eagle Ford program while improving the value of the opportunity by taking a partner, then we'll do it. If not, then we'll go alone and shift capital as we need to in the second half of the year. 
And let's stay with the Eagle Ford with an update on Slide 18. We're pleased with our results today so we've essentially doubled our activity level since the first of the year. We're achieving production tests and expected the EURs that as good as or better-than-expected, and we're pushing to gain additional cost efficiencies. 
Most of our activity is in the Central LaSalle County area where we have our largest acreage position. And we now believe that area contains volatile oil, meaning that we have oil in the reservoir with associated gas at the surface versus having gas wells with condensate dropping out of the surface. Three of the 14 wells that we've drilled here had initial rates in excess of 1,000 barrel a day equivalent. And we recently drilled our longest lateral roughly 6,400 feet, completed the well with 21 frac stages and have seen daily producing rates of over 900 barrel equivalents. 
So as we move into development phase, the Eagle Ford will become more impactful in 2011. Since the beginning of this year, we completed nine new wells and when we get the newer completions online, we expect to double production from the field. 
On Slide 19, we showed that production mix over the expected life of the wells in the central and the northern area of Eagle Ford, which is consistent with a models that we published last October at a time of our Eagle Ford field trip. Now I want to briefly revisit this topic because in recent conversations with investors, I've heard some confusion about the product mix from our northern and central areas of the Eagle Ford, and those makes up about, as a reminder, about 2/3 of our total acreage position. And we believe that an essential area, about 75% of the recoverable reserves are expected to be oil. NGLs are only about 10% of the volume, with which means that while ethane and other liquid prices improved the economics, they're not a big value driver in our program. 
In the northern area where we have currently one rig working, the oil contribution increases even further to 85%. All the wells in that northern area with artificial lift almost from day one, so we're quickly working to determine the best method of pumping the wells both while we're producing back the frac water initially and in the long term, production mode. 
Note that Frio County wells has been completed, and we're currently installing artificial lift in that well. And also in our northern area, we've drilled the well in Atascosa county. It's our first well there. And we drilled and logged a vertical pile hole and then we drilled the horizontal section and early and long responses in both are very encouraging. So we're anxious to see how that well produces. 
Our last chart is on Slide 20 this morning. And we're always focused on continuous improvement in all of our programs, all of our asset areas and in with all parts of our business. And as a result, we believe that the Haynesville execution and cost structure is top quartile and often, industry-leading. We've taken our Haynesville practices and moving them down to the Eagle Ford so we're moving up the learning curve rapidly, which means we're finding ways to cut time and capital costs per well. And we've only been drilling the Eagle Ford for a little over a year, and the results shown on this slide are based on about 20 well data set. 
We made significant progress during the drilling phase, improving from 500 feet per day to about 1,200 feet per day. We also had similar success in the time required from spud to total debt, cutting the number of days by over 60% from about 31 days to 11 days on our best well to date. 
And just as we have done elsewhere, our drilling team's delivered these efficiencies by optimizing the drill bit, the downhole motor and the drilling fluid designs and combinations. And then, we believe later as we move into multi-well paths, we expect to see continued reduction in cycle time. 
Remember though that more than half of our well costs is for completion and simulation, so finding efficiencies in frac-ing these wells has a major cost benefit. Averaging 3.6 fracs per day at far best well today is great progress for our Eagle Ford team. We've benefited from having a dedicated completion crews with Foster's better safety performance and better teamwork and coordination, and we expect additional gains as we continue to find ways to further eliminate the non-productive time or downtime. 
About 40% of our stimulation costs comes from fixed equipment charges, so we'll see a lower per well cost as we improve the efficiency of Eagle Ford completions or as we further improve the average number of fracs per day. And then, we'll spread that fixed costs to over more completions. 
At 3.6 fracs a day is our best Eagle Ford phase, but we're not stopping there because we're now consistently averaging closer to 4 fracs per day in the Haynesville. 
Overall, I'm really pleased with how this development is progresses and I continue to believe that the Eagle Ford will be a long-;term anchor program for us. 
I'll now turn the call back to Doug for closing comments."

It's exciting at $100 crude world to have a meaningful oil component in our E&P story and when we intend to make the most of that opportunity. By year end, we'll have at least 3x as many oil directive rigs as gas directed rigs and maybe more. And that's going to yield 30% to 40% growth in oil production this year and another 50% in 2012. 
Restoring our balance sheet strength is also a top priority for 2011. One of the primary tools to accomplish this is EPV, and there's every reason to believe we'll have another successful year growing EPV to the benefit of both the MLP unitholders and the EP shareholders. We know that this continued improvement is key to getting the premium multiple for our stock that we believe we deserve. 
Another valuation key is the completion of our extensive backlog in the pipes, as well as successfully concluding rate cases on EPNG, CIG and TGP. We expect to get all this done, much of it in the first half of this year. 
And in Midstream, you'll more from Mark on our Analyst Day in May. But in the meantime, his team is very busy completing for the mass project in the Marcellus and the Camino Real project in the Eagle Ford. And while each is very competitive, we're competing hard to get this across the finish line. 
We're making great progress already on these and other milestones we laid out for you in our earlier guidance call, and that means we have every expectation that 2011 will be another rewarding year for our shareholders. 
Finally, while we're on the topic of rewarding our shareholders, I'll wager that someone on the call is planning to ask about corporate structure given recent events in the capital markets. The key message I want you to take from this call is that we'll do what is right for our shareholders to create long-term sustainable value. And that's why we are talking about the management team or our Board. 
So while our immediate focus is on all those milestones we laid out for 2011, we're not deaf to the markets. In fact, recent events we think are very exciting for anyone who is an EP shareholder or considering being an EP shareholder. 
Case in point. So a new high watermarks have been achieved recently in terms of valuations for high-quality GPs. We think that's not only appropriate, it's outstanding. And we just happen to own 100% of the highest quality GP. And the great news is, it has a tremendous growth profile. We only reached the 50% incentive distribution rights in the fourth quarter of 2010. So that $50 million to $60 million in distributions to the GP in 2011 is still toward the front end of a very high growth trajectory that will create lots and lots of value for EP shareholders. And because it has the lowest-risks highest-growth characteristics out there due to its sponsor and due to the fact that it's the only pure play GP, it sets the high watermark for what GPs are worth. In addition, recent transactions point out that company's strong with balance sheets and high cash payouts are highly valued in the market. That's why we're running as fast as we can to make sure we maximize the strength of our balance sheet. And we have every expectation that we'll do just that. 
And E&P companies and assets that have low risks, repeatable drilling inventories at the lower end of the cost curve and with oil exposure drawn our high valuations, that's exactly what we think we have. So if you believe that management is properly incented and the company is properly governed, then there's really nothing but upside all in our shares in this regard. So where do we stack up on those dimensions? Management has higher-than-average leverage and compensation to changes in equity values. And given that as a group, we haven't been sellers and we are all very large owners relative to our personal work, you should assume we think and act like owners. We also have a very independent, very shareholder-minded Board that I think stacks up well against any competitor we have. 
So I think I'll note two key dimensions. We have a vision of a company that will stay laser focused on taking the actions that will maximize the long-term share price of El Paso. In addition, we have a track record of doing just that, having made many, many shareholder-friendly decisions as we brought this company back from the brink. While we like the integrated model and see key benefits to it, we're not married to it. We have looked and will continue to look at structure. And the great news is, we're not doing it in a vacuum. We've got interesting real world data points to analyze and monitor, some from well-seasoned transactions and some from more recent announcements. 
I believe that significantly increases the likelihood that a dispassionate analysis will yield the right result. This has been and will continue to be a key topic of discussion in both the management and the Board level and we'll continue to keep you apprised of our decisions in this regard. And with that, we're happy to open it up to your questions."

The only reason why I asked that is unless I misheard you, the Western Nevada piece is getting finished in July, is that going to be making sort of a compressed window to get those pieces tested, et cetera, and get the actual entire project in service by July? I just wanted to get some more color on that if possible."

Carl, I think as a general statement, we're simply further down the road because we -- if you think about the 85% welded, we have a grand total of about 100 miles left to weld out. So we have  -- and so, and that's in three discrete pieces. One is on Spread 5, where I'll talk about our plan in just a minute, and the other -- and so that probably comprises about 40 miles of 100. And the other two cases of 30 miles each or so are on Spreads 6 and 7 in Oregon. But on Spread 5, our plan, and I think it's a well-developed, while we know all the parameters because of the sage grouse mating issue, we -- within that 40 mile stretch, there's only about 12 to 14 miles that is impacted by this sage grouse mating issue. So we're clearing through what we can clear through now. As soon as we can, we'll start stringing and then welding up. Realistically, from an assembly-line-operation standpoint, we won't be able to get up to that. We won't be able to do appreciable welding on that stretch until mid-May. But when you go through that exercise on Spread 5, we should be welded up on the whole thing in June, do to tie ends then into early July and have plenty of time for purging and packing, et cetera. Anyway, that's sort of a critical path matter. On Spread 6 and 7, in Oregon, we effective -- we're very close to having all of our permits there. And so there is more, continuing to grind it out as we have been doing. And we fully expect that is well us all of the rest of the pipeline with the exception of Spread 5 to be fully welded out by the end of April. So that there are -- then tight ends and testing on that will commence. So that as soon as we finish Spread 5  with very limited time after that, we'll be able to put it in service. So I guess my point is that on costs, we have a much better prune down now. We have ongoing weather issues, but gee, won't through the worst of that. We essentially have all of our permits in place. The worst of the construction is really behind us. The' work on Spreads 5, 6 and 7 -- on Spread 5, once we get in there, it's not difficult pipeline. So we just feel a lot better about our costs and schedule."

Four weeks ago, we had a 2011 guidance call, and I hope you came away from that call with a sense of a confidence we have going into this year and our ability to have another breakout year similar to 2010 operationally, financially and in terms of share price performance. We entered the year with a lot of momentum and a higher level of energy and excitement than at any time in my tenure with El Paso. In E&P, we're ramping up our activity in some of the most exciting oil plays out there, and our early results are very encouraging as Brent will share in more detail. 
In the pipes, we've now got 85% of the Ruby pipe welded up. And while we're increasing our estimated cost to $3.55 billion, we also have a much greater certainty on the remaining risks. Hence, the elimination of a range for completed costs. And while Ruby execution isn't what we forecast, we still expect to put the entirety of our $8 billion backlog in service this year. 
We don't have a Midstream update today except to say that Mark and his team continue to push forward on two key projects in the Marcellus and the Eagle Ford in addition to successfully expanding existing Midstream assets in the Eagle Ford and Altamont.

On Slide 5, you'll see a snapshot of our fourth quarter financial results. We reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.20 for the quarter. Now when compared to 2009, the difference is primarily driven",874,"Thanks, Doug, and good morning to everyone. On Slide 5, you'll see a snapshot of our fourth quarter financial results. We reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.20 for the quarter. Now when compared to 2009, the difference is primarily driven by lower realized commodity prices. 
During the quarter, we only had about 60% of our domestic natural gas production hedged around $5.80 compared to nearly 90% at north of $6 in the first three quarters of this year. Compare that to the fourth quarter of 2009 when we had almost 75% of our gas production hedged at roughly $9. Bottom line, that lower realized commodity prices reduced our earnings by about $0.10 per share quarter over quarter. 
In addition to the impact from lower prices, fourth quarter results reflected higher performance-related employee benefit costs of about $0.02 a share. As a result of our strong share price performance relative to our peer group in 2010, we doubled the amount of the company matching contribution for our employees who participate in the 401(k) plan with El Paso stock. This discretionary matching contribution is only available when our total shareholder return performance versus our peers exceeds the median level. 
Now we think this is a great way to ensure our employees are aligned with our shareholders interest. And this additional matching contribution is, however, not available to senior management.
Slide 6, is a bit of a report card in our key 2010 goals. Now I'm not going to go through to each and every one of these since we touched on many during our recent guidance call. But by all accounts, we certainly had a very successful year. 
Adjusted earnings per share and cash flow from operations were better than we guided to in late 2009 and that's despite natural gas pricing well below the $5.50 assumption that we had used in our original plan. And overall, both business units had a great year. 
And despite the challenges on Ruby, the Pipeline Group had an excellent year executing on the projects placed in service in 2010, putting five projects in service collectively $100 million under budget. 
And on the E&P side, our E&P team knocked it out of the park for the second year in a row. Brent will walk you through some of his key measures in just a couple of minute. 
On Slide 7, I round out a brief look back to 2010 with some of the other key year-end metrics. We ended the year with $13.7 billion of total net debt. This includes $3.4 billion of consolidated debt of our MLP, El Paso Pipeline Partners. It also includes $1.1 billion of Ruby debt that will be deconsolidated from our balance sheet shortly after the pipeline is placed in service. And at that point, it will be recoursed only to the Ruby pipeline. 
We came into 2011 with very strong liquidity, $2.4 billion, even after retiring about $700 million of El Paso debt late in 2010. 
And finally, 2010 CapEx finished the year $4.2 billion, pretty close to our original CapEx target for the year. Now remember, E&P CapEx included an incremental $265 million of lease acquisition capital for Eagle Ford and Wolfcamp oil acreage. And on the pipeline side, last year's $2.8 billion of capital will likely be the high watermark for many years to come. 
On Slide 8, we reiterate our primary financial objectives for 2011. And although I've covered these on our recent call, I think it's important to keep these front and center. 
First and foremost, we're intent on improving the balance sheet so that we achieve an investment-grade profile by 2012. There's no question that reaching this goal has very positive implications for shareholder value. The best tool we have to accelerate our deleveraging is continuing our MLP drop-down strategy using EPB. And make no mistake, we're focused on maximizing the impact of this strategy to the benefit of El Paso and El Paso Pipeline Partners stakeholders. 
In the last month's call, I noted that our guidance assumes we complete two to three drops in 2011.
And finally, we'll maintain adequate liquidity throughout the year to support our businesses. As we progress through the year, the need to maintain our historic liquidity levels will diminish as we complete the pipeline backlog and continue to improve and further de-risk our balance sheet.
I'll wrap up this morning with an update on our hedge positions on Slide 9. Since our last call, we added 2.7 million barrels of oil hedges for 2012. So based on our forecasted 2011 production, we've got about 70% of our 2012 oil production hedged with downside protection at $90. So despite the constructive macro outlook for oil, the $90 floor feels pretty good. 
Nothing's changed on our gas hedges, other than they're fact that they're further in the money and continue to look great. And by the way, our hedges boosted our cash flow by roughly $300 million in 2010, which when added to about $1 billion generated in 2009, equates to almost $2 per share of incremental cash flow. So I'm quite proud of the value our disciplined hedging programs created over the last couple of years in what has been a very challenging commodity market. 
That's it for me. I'll turn the call over to Jim for pipeline update. Jim?"

With the pipelines, the fourth quarter was a busy one as we placed and serviced three more growth projects; two in the Rockies and one in the Southeast to supply gas to a newly converted coal plant. All three are now generating revenue. It came in approximately $100 million under budget, as J.R. said, completing an excellent year of executing on projects that went in service last year. 
As you know, this year will essentially complete our regional $8 billion backlog by placing five more expansions in service. We've made good progress on Ruby, and it's getting closer to completion, but our cost estimate is higher. The other four projects are all on-time and on-budget, with the first of these, FGT Phase VIII, scheduled to begin service in April. 
As we said on the guidance call, we also have three major rate cases this year. Our aim is to try is to settle all three by year end and get back to the business of serving our customers, meeting their needs safely and reliably and growing with them. 
On Slide 12, Slide 12 summarizes throughput trends for the year. Throughput was down approximately 2% overall from 2009 with increases in the East and decreases on our Western pipes. 
In the East, both SNG and TGP benefited from a very hot summer and cold winter. Also, TGP throughput increased due to the receipts from Marcellus in Pennsylvania and REX in Ohio. Marcellus production into TGP is now running at approximately 1.2 Bs [BCF] a day, up from only 250 a day at the beginning of 2010. 
In the West, throughput was down on both our Rockies pipes and on EPNG, not due to market demand which was pretty flat along both the front range and on the Southwest but rather mostly due to competition. In the Rockies it was increased competition on both intra-Rockies flows and exports out of the Rockies. 
On EPNG, it was supply alternatives into California. Much of this additional supply was for LNG imports at Costa Azul, which more recently have declined.  Importantly, we also see tangible signs now of improving market demands long-term on EPNG. 
While we're on throughput, let me take a minute to talk about our service to customers during the record-breaking cold weather of a couple of weeks ago. In short, our pipes were to demonstrate clearly their value to customers. We met the peak day needs of all our customers in the Northeast, Southeast and Rockies. This resulted from the diverse gas supplies behind our pipes, extraordinary performance by our field operations people and a lot of communication between our customers and us. Our only service impact across the country was on part of EPNG's South mainline in extreme West Texas, New Mexico and Arizona. This was due primarily to freeze offs of Permian production and processing plant offsets, which in turn resulted in lower delivery pressures on EPNG. 
But even here, and with cold temperatures not seen in 45 years, we delivered to our customers substantially more gas than they received from their suppliers. And I want to share my appreciation to our workforce across the country, both field and office, for going the extra mile to serve our customers during this period. 
On Ruby, we've made substantial progress on Ruby. As Doug said, we're now about 85% welded out, up from 70% reported just a month ago. At the same time, however, we've seem some cost and schedule slippage and now expect Ruby to cost approximately $3.55 billion and be in service in July. This results from the combined impacts of extremely wet weather in December across Northern Nevada and Southern Oregon, delays in permitting and restrictions due to fish and game habitat. 
Also, until recently, we expected to complete a 40 mile section of Spread 5 in Nevada before the sage grouse mating season begins on March 1. We haven't been able to do this, primarily because of delays in obtaining final cultural resource clearances. Now we won't start construction on short stretches of that section until the mating season ends in mid-May. And we've temporarily shut down that spread's pipeline. So we're unlikely to complete Spread 5 until July. 
Some of the increase in project costs is additional cash costs and some is non-cash AFUDC costs associated with the later in-service. 
The good news is that we believe we have more certainty now on our cost estimate. We feel better about each of the three critical issues that we've highlighted for you since the first of the year: First, the worst of the winter weather is behind us; second, permitting and cultural resource clearances are for the most part, complete; and third, we have greater clarity around fish and game construction windows, although we're still dealing with a few issues on some stream crossings. 
Not only have we made good progress as evidenced by the percent welded, but also the Eastern spreads are all very nearly complete. So our run rate monthly spend is dropping off. 
So we have better line of sight now on the finish line, and we'll update you again on our May first quarter earnings call. 
And now I'll turn it over to Brent."

We posted good numbers ag",1527,"Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to begin this morning on Slide 15. I've met with a number of investors over the past few weeks, and it was great to hear feedback and recognition that our E&P strategy is working. 
We posted good numbers again last year, and I'll review some of those with you in a moment. But we also know that we had to continue to deliver, and we're off to a good start. 
We began the year with our production at roughly $800 million a day within our guidance range for this year, so we're on plan. But remember that our relatively-wide guidance range has taken into account the potential to further shift capital from gas to oil, which may impact volume guidance providing growth for that greater value. 
We continue to ramp up our oil activities with two more rigs in our essential Eagle Ford area. Our results on the program continue to be at or better than our pre-drill models, and we're delivering some of the same efficiency gains in the Eagle Ford that we delivered in our Haynesville program. We've drilled four Wolfcamp wells, one is online and we are currently completing two of the wells. We're on track with our delineation plan there with two of the wells drilled today in the eastern portion of our acreage, one in the center and one on the Western side. 
We've also taken hole cores on two wells and the coring, drilling, logging data that we have gathered so far has been very consistent with our expectations. There's also been some horizontal wells drilled to offset our acreage that look very good and adds to our enthusiasm about this program. 
Considering the date of the timing of data flow in the play, we're currently planning to update on our Wolfcamp program in our May 5 earnings call or perhaps sooner at one of the conferences. 
Some of the key metrics from 2010 performance are shown on Slide 16. Our production was 782 million equivalent per day, which is above the high end of our guidance and above 2009 results. Our fourth quarter production was 795 a day, which is up 7% year-over-year and was the highest quarterly production that we've reported since the first quarter of 2009. Cash costs were also lower than they were in 2009, coming in at $1.78 versus $1.82. 
I'm also very pleased with our reserve growth and efficiency metrics in our inventory growth for the year. When you look at 2010 E&P performance, I think the key takeaway is that we've reached a point where we can consistently deliver results that are very competitive with the best of our industry peers. 
We've updated Slide 17 from our guidance call to show you our current drilling activity. We've added two oil rigs, both in the Eagle Ford. So in total, we now have over twice as many oil rigs than gas rigs working, and we plan for that ratio to increase during the course of the year. In the near term, we still plan to run four rigs in the Haynesville program, which is a very optimized and economic activity level. But as I said in our guidance call, depending on gas prices and service costs, we may choose to further reduce our activity and shift capital to one of our oil programs. 
Another factor that can change our activity level is whether or not we take a partner in the Eagle Ford. We're very much in the throes of those discussions and we'll likely decide by the end of Q1. 
If we can accelerate our Eagle Ford program while improving the value of the opportunity by taking a partner, then we'll do it. If not, then we'll go it alone and shift capital as we need to in the second half of the year. 
And let's stay with the Eagle Ford with an update on Slide 18. We're pleased with our results to date so we've essentially doubled our activity level since the first of the year. We're achieving production tests and expected the EURs that as good as or better-than-expected, and we're pushing to gain additional cost efficiencies. 
Most of our activity is in the Central LaSalle County area where we have our largest acreage position. And we now believe that area contains volatile oil, meaning that we have oil in the reservoir with associated gas at the surface versus having gas wells with condensate dropping out of the surface. Three of the 14 wells that we've drilled here had initial rates in excess of 1,000 barrels a day equivalent. And we recently drilled our longest lateral roughly 6,400 feet, completed the well with 21 frac stages and have seen daily producing rates of over 900 barrel equivalents. 
So as we move into development phase, the Eagle Ford will become more impactful in 2011. Since the beginning of this year, we have completed nine new wells and when we get the newer completions online, we expect to double production from the field. 
On Slide 19, we showed that production mix over the expected life of the wells in the central and the northern area of Eagle Ford, which is consistent with a models that we published last October at the time of our Eagle Ford field trip. Now I want to briefly revisit this topic because in recent conversations with investors, I've heard some confusion about the product mix from our northern and central areas of the Eagle Ford, and those makes up about, as a reminder, about 2/3 of our total acreage position. And we believe that in the central area, about 75% of the recoverable reserves are expected to be oil. NGLs are only about 10% of the volume, with which means that while ethane and other liquid prices improved the economics, they're not a big value driver in our program. 
In the northern area where we have currently one rig working, the oil contribution increases even further to 85%. All the wells in that northern area will need artificial lift almost from day one, so we're quickly working to determine the best method of pumping the wells both while we're producing back the frac water initially and in the long term, production mode. 
Note that Frio County wells has been completed, and we're currently installing artificial lift in that well. And also in our northern area, we've drilled the well in Atascosa county. It's our first well there. And we drilled and logged a vertical pilot hole and then we drilled the horizontal section and early worklog responses in both are very encouraging. So we're anxious to see how that well produces. 
Our last chart is on Slide 20 this morning. And we're always focused on continuous improvement in all of our programs, all of our asset areas and with with all parts of our business. And as a result, we believe that the Haynesville execution and cost structure is top quartile and often, industry-leading. We've taken our Haynesville practices and moved them down to the Eagle Ford so we're moving up the learning curve rapidly, which means we're finding ways to cut time and capital costs per well. And we've only been drilling the Eagle Ford for a little over a year, and the results shown on this slide are based on about 20 well data set. 
We made significant progress during the drilling phase, improving from 500 feet per day to about 1,200 feet per day. We also had similar success in the time required from spud to total depth, cutting the number of days by over 60% from about 31 days to 11 days on our best well to date. 
And just as we have done elsewhere, our drilling team's delivered these efficiencies by optimizing the drill bit, the downhole motor and the drilling fluid designs and combinations. And then, we believe later as we move into multi-well paths, we expect to see continued reduction in cycle time. 
Remember though that more than half of our well costs is for completion and simulation, so finding efficiencies in frac-ing these wells also has major cost benefit. Averaging 3.6 fracs per day at far best well today is great progress for our Eagle Ford team. We've benefited from having a dedicated completion crews with Foster's better safety performance and better teamwork and coordination, and we expect additional gains as we continue to find ways to further eliminate the non-productive time or downtime. 
About 40% of our stimulation costs comes from fixed equipment charges, so we'll see a lower per well cost as we improve the efficiency of Eagle Ford completions or as we further improve the average number of fracs per day. And then, we'll spread that fixed costs to over more completions. 
At 3.6 fracs a day is our best Eagle Ford pace, but we're not stopping there because we're now consistently averaging closer to 4 fracs per day in the Haynesville.  
Overall, I'm really pleased with how this development is progressing and I continue to believe that the Eagle Ford will be a long term anchor program for us. 
I'll now turn the call back to Doug for closing comments."

It's exciting at $100 crude world to have a meaningful oil component in our E&P story and when we intend to make the most of that opportunity. By year end, we'll have at least 3x as many oil directive rigs as gas directed rigs and maybe more. And that's going to yield 30% to 40% growth in oil production this year and another 50% in 2012. 
Restoring our balance sheet strength is also a top priority for 2011. One of the primary tools to accomplish this is EPB, and there's every reason to believe we'll have another successful year growing EPB to the benefit of both the MLP unitholders and the EP shareholders. We know that this continued improvement is key to getting the premium multiple for our stock that we believe it deserves. 
Another valuation key is the completion of our extensive backlog in the pipes, as well as successfully concluding rate cases on EPNG, CIG and TGP. We expect to get all this done, much of it in the first half of this year. 
And in Midstream, you'll more from Mark on our Analyst Day in May. But in the meantime, his team is very busy completing for the mass project in the Marcellus and the Camino Real project in the Eagle Ford. And while each is very competitive, we're competing hard to get these across the finish line. 
We're making great progress already on these and other milestones we laid out for you in our earlier guidance call, and that means we have every expectation that 2011 will be another rewarding year for our shareholders. 
Finally, while we're on the topic of rewarding our shareholders, I'll wager that someone on the call is planning to ask about corporate structure given recent events in the capital markets. The key message I want you to take from this call is that we'll do what is right for our shareholders to create long-term sustainable value. And that's whether we are talking about the management team or our Board. 
So while our immediate focus is on all those milestones we laid out for 2011, we're not deaf to the markets. In fact, recent events we think are very exciting for anyone who is an EP shareholder or considering being an EP shareholder. 
Case in point. So a new high watermarks have been achieved recently in terms of valuations for high-quality GPs. We think that's not only appropriate, it's outstanding. And we just happen to own 100% of the highest quality GP. And the great news is, it has a tremendous growth profile. We only reached the 50% incentive distribution rights in the fourth quarter of 2010. So that $50 million to $60 million in distributions to the GP in 2011 is still toward the front end of a very high growth trajectory that will create lots and lots of value for EP shareholders. And because it has the lowest-risks highest-growth characteristics out there due to its sponsor and due to the fact that it's the only pure play GP, it sets the high watermark for what GPs are worth. In addition, recent transactions point out that companies with strong balance sheets and high cash payouts are highly valued in the market. That's why we're running as fast as we can to make sure we maximize the strength of our balance sheet. And we have every expectation that we'll do just that. 
And E&P companies and assets that have low risks, repeatable drilling inventories at the lower end of the cost curve and with oil exposure going to higher valuations, that's exactly what we think we have. So if you believe that management is properly incented and the company is properly governed, then there's really nothing but upside all in our shares in this regard. So where do we stack up on those dimensions? Management has higher-than-average leverage and compensation to changes in equity values. And given that as a group, we haven't been sellers and we are all very large owners relative to our personal worth, you should assume we think and act like owners. We also have a very independent, very shareholder-minded Board that I think stacks up well against any competitor we have. 
So I think on those two key dimensions. We have a vision of a company that will stay laser focused on taking the actions that will maximize the long-term share price of El Paso. In addition, we have a track record of doing just that, having made many, many shareholder-friendly decisions as we brought this company back from the brink. While we like the integrated model and see key benefits to it, we're not married to it. We have looked and will continue to look at structure. And the great news is, we're not doing it in a vacuum. We've got interesting real world data points to analyze and monitor, some from well-seasoned transactions and some from more recent announcements. 
I believe that significantly increases the likelihood that a dispassionate analysis will yield the right result. This has been and will continue to be a key topic of discussion in both the management and the Board level and we'll continue to keep you apprised of our decisions in this regard. And with that, we're happy to open it up to your questions."

One is on Spread 5, where I'll talk about our plan in just a minute, and the other -- and so that probably comprises about 40 miles of the 100.

But on Spread 5, our plan, and I think it's a well-developed one, we know all the parameters because of the sage grouse mating issue, we -- within that 40 mile stretch, there's only about 12 to 14 miles that is impacted by this sage grouse mating issue. So we're clearing through what we can clear through now. As soon as we can, we'll start stringing and then welding up. Realistically, from an assembly-line-operation standpoint, we won't be able to get up to that. We won't be able to do appreciable welding on that stretch until mid-May. But when you go through that exercise on Spread 5, we should be welded up on the whole thing in June, do tie ends then into early July and have plenty of time for purging and packing, et cetera. Anyway, that's sort of the critical path matter. On Spread 6 and 7, in Oregon, we effective -- we're very close to having all of our permits there. And so there is more, continuing to grind it out as we have been doing. And we fully expect that as well as all of the rest of the pipeline with the exception of Spread 5 to be fully welded out by the end of April. So that there are -- then tie ends and testing on that will commence. So that as soon as we finish Spread 5 with very limited time after that, we'll be able to put it in service. So I guess my point is that on costs, we have a much better prune down now. We have ongoing weather issues, but gee, we're through the worst of that. We essentially have all of our permits in place. The worst of the construction is really behind us. The' work on Spreads 5, 6 and 7 -- on Spread 5, once we get in there, it's not difficult pipelining.

So we haven't advanced the permit, the environmental permit much at all. We have on our side, we've done everything we need to do to prepare it for the next round of submittals. But we're waiting for the appropriate time to do that with Obama and the regulatory body. And I think it's going to be for planning purposes, think about most of this year before we think we're going to be able to break through that log jam.  And that's really the critical path item to do either. Either self-development or to do anything else to the partner to monetize it is getting regulatory approval to build it. And then once we do get the permit, we've got two or three years after that, if the permit is still active, before we have to be able to spend capital.

Four weeks ago, we had a 2011 guidance call, and I hope you came away from that call with a sense of a confidence we have going into this year and our ability to have another breakout year similar to 2010 operationally, financially and in terms of share price performance. We entered the year with a lot of momentum and a higher level of energy and excitement than at any time in my tenure with El Paso. In E&P, we're ramping up our activity in some of the most exciting oil plays out there, and our early results are very encouraging as Brent will share in more detail. 
In the pipes, we've now got 85% of the Ruby pipe welded up. And while we're increasing our estimated cost to $3.55 billion, we also have a much greater certainty on the remaining risks. Hence, the elimination of a range for completed costs. And while Ruby execution isn't what we forecast, we still expect to put the entirety of our $8 billion backlog in service this year. 
We don't have a Midstream update today except to say that Mark and his team continue to push forward on two key projects in the Marcellus and the Eagle Ford in addition to successfully expanding existing Midstream assets in the Eagle Ford and Altamont.

We reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.20 for the quarter. Now when compared to 2009, the difference is primarily driven by lower realized commodity prices. 
During the quarter, we only had about 60% of our domestic natural gas production hedged around $5.80 compared to nearly 90% at north of $6 in the first three quarters of this year. Compare that to the fourth quarter of 2009 when we had almost 75% of our gas production hedged at roughly $9. Bottom line, that lower realized commodity prices reduced our earnings by about $0.10 per share quarter over quarter. 
In addition to the impact from lower prices, fourth quarter results reflected higher performance-related employee benefit costs of about $0.02 a share. As a result of our strong share price performance relative to our peer group in 2010, we doubled the amount of the company matching contribution for our employees who participate in the 401(k) plan with El Paso stock. This discretionary matching contribution is only available when our total shareholder return performance versus our peers exceeds the median level. 
Now we think this is a great way to ensure our employees are aligned with our shareholders interest. And this additional matching contribution is, however, not available to senior management.
Slide 6, is a bit of a report card in our key 2010 goals. Now I'm not going to go through to each and every one of these since we touched on many during our recent guidance call. But by all accounts, we certainly had a very successful year. 
Adjusted earnings per share and cash flow from operations were better than we guided to in late 2009 and that's despite natural gas pricing well below the $5.50 assumption that we had used in our original plan. And overall, both business units had a great year. 
And despite the challenges on Ruby, the Pipeline Group had an excellent year executing on the projects placed in service in 2010, putting five projects in service collectively $100 million under budget. 
And on the E&P side, our E&P team knocked it out of the park for the second year in a row. Brent will walk you through some of his key measures in just a couple of minute. 
On Slide 7, I round out a brief look back to 2010 with some of the other key year-end metrics. We ended the year with $13.7 billion of total net debt. This includes $3.4 billion of consolidated debt of our MLP, El Paso Pipeline Partners. It also includes $1.1 billion of Ruby debt that will be deconsolidated from our balance sheet shortly after the pipeline is placed in service. And at that point, it will be recoursed only to the Ruby pipeline. 
We came into 2011 with very strong liquidity, $2.4 billion, even after retiring about $700 million of El Paso debt late in 2010. 
And finally, 2010 CapEx finished the year $4.2 billion, pretty close to our original CapEx target for the year. Now remember, E&P CapEx included an incremental $265 million of lease acquisition capital for Eagle Ford and Wolfcamp oil acreage. And on the pipeline side, last year's $2.8 billion of capital will likely be the high watermark for many years to come. 
On Slide 8, we reiterate our primary financial objectives for 2011. And although I've covered these on our recent call, I think it's important to keep these front and center. 
First and foremost, we're intent on improving the balance sheet so that we achieve an investment-grade profile by 2012. There's no question that reaching this goal has very positive implications for shareholder value. The best tool we have to accelerate our deleveraging is continuing our MLP drop-down strategy using EPB. And make no mistake, we're focused on maximizing the impact of this strategy to the benefit of El Paso and El Paso Pipeline Partners stakeholders. 
In the last month's call, I noted that our guidance assumes we complete two to three drops in 2011.
And finally, we'll maintain adequate liquidity throughout the year to support our businesses. As we progress through the year, the need to maintain our historic liquidity levels will diminish as we complete the pipeline backlog and continue to improve and further de-risk our balance sheet.
I'll wrap up this morning with an update on our hedge positions on Slide 9. Since our last call, we added 2.7 million barrels of oil hedges for 2012. So based on our forecasted 2011 production, we've got about 70% of our 2012 oil production hedged with downside protection at $90. So despite the constructive macro outlook for oil, the $90 floor feels pretty good. 
Nothing's changed on our gas hedges, other than they're fact that they're further in the money and continue to look great. And by the way, our hedges boosted our cash flow by roughly $300 million in 2010, which when added to about $1 billion generated in 2009, equates to almost $2 per share of incremental cash flow. So I'm quite proud of the value our disciplined hedging programs created over the last couple of years in what has been a very challenging commodity market. 
That's it for me. I'll turn the call over to Jim for pipeline update. Jim?"

With the pipelines, the fourth quarter was a busy one as we placed and serviced three more growth projects; two in the Rockies and one in the Southeast to supply gas to a newly converted coal plant. All three are now generating revenue. It came in approximately $100 million under budget, as J.R. said, completing an excellent year of executing on projects that went in service last year. 
As you know, this year will essentially complete our regional $8 billion backlog by placing five more expansions in service. We've made good progress on Ruby, and it's getting closer to completion, but our cost estimate is higher. The other four projects are all on-time and on-budget, with the first of these, FGT Phase VIII, scheduled to begin service in April. 
As we said on the guidance call, we also have three major rate cases this year. Our aim is to try is to settle all three by year end and get back to the business of serving our customers, meeting their needs safely and reliably and growing with them. 
On Slide 12, Slide 12 summarizes throughput trends for the year. Throughput was down approximately 2% overall from 2009 with increases in the East and decreases on our Western pipes. 
In the East, both SNG and TGP benefited from a very hot summer and cold winter. Also, TGP throughput increased due to the receipts from Marcellus in Pennsylvania and REX in Ohio. Marcellus production into TGP is now running at approximately 1.2 Bs [BCF] a day, up from only 250 a day at the beginning of 2010. 
In the West, throughput was down on both our Rockies pipes and on EPNG, not due to market demand which was pretty flat along both the front range and on the Southwest but rather mostly due to competition. In the Rockies it was increased competition on both intra-Rockies flows and exports out of the Rockies. 
On EPNG, it was supply alternatives into California. Much of this additional supply was for LNG imports at Costa Azul, which more recently have declined.  Importantly, we also see tangible signs now of improving market demands long-term on EPNG. 
While we're on throughput, let me take a minute to talk about our service to customers during the record-breaking cold weather of a couple of weeks ago. In short, our pipes were to demonstrate clearly their value to customers. We met the peak day needs of all our customers in the Northeast, Southeast and Rockies. This resulted from the diverse gas supplies behind our pipes, extraordinary performance by our field operations people and a lot of communication between our customers and us. Our only service impact across the country was on part of EPNG's South mainline in extreme West Texas, New Mexico and Arizona. This was due primarily to freeze offs of Permian production and processing plant offsets, which in turn resulted in lower delivery pressures on EPNG. 
But even here, and with cold temperatures not seen in 45 years, we delivered to our customers substantially more gas than they received from their suppliers. And I want to share my appreciation to our workforce across the country, both field and office, for going the extra mile to serve our customers during this period. 
On Ruby, we've made substantial progress on Ruby. As Doug said, we're now about 85% welded out, up from 70% reported just a month ago. At the same time, however, we've seen some cost and schedule slippage and now expect Ruby to cost approximately $3.55 billion and be in service in July. This results from the combined impacts of extremely wet weather in December across Northern Nevada and Southern Oregon, delays in permitting and restrictions due to fish and game habitat. 
Also, until recently, we expected to complete a 40 mile section of Spread 5 in Nevada before the sage grouse mating season begins on March 1. We haven't been able to do this, primarily because of delays in obtaining final cultural resource clearances. Now we won't start construction on short stretches of that section until the mating season ends in mid-May. And we've temporarily shut down that spread's pipeline. So we're unlikely to complete Spread 5 until July. 
Some of the increase in project costs is additional cash costs and some is non-cash AFUDC costs associated with the later in-service. 
The good news is that we believe we have more certainty now on our cost estimate. We feel better about each of the three critical issues that we've highlighted for you since the first of the year: First, the worst of the winter weather is behind us; second, permitting and cultural resource clearances are for the most part, complete; and third, we have greater clarity around fish and game construction windows, although we're still dealing with a few issues on some stream crossings. 
Not only have we made good progress as evidenced by the percent welded, but also the Eastern spreads are all very nearly complete. So our run rate monthly spend is dropping off. 
So we have better line of sight now on the finish line, and we'll update you again on our May first quarter earnings call. 
And now I'll turn it over to Brent."

I've met with a number of investors over the past few weeks, and it was great to hear feedback and recognition that our E&P strategy is working. 
We posted good numbers again last year, and I'll review some of those with you in a moment. But we also know that we had to continue to deliver, and we're off to a good start. 
We began the year with our production at roughly $800 million a day within our guidance range for this year, so we're on plan. But remember that our relatively wide guidance range has taken into account the potential to further shift capital from gas to oil, which may impact volume guidance providing growth for that greater value. 
We continue to ramp up our oil activities with two more rigs in our essential Eagle Ford area. Our results on the program continue to be at or better than our pre-drill models, and we're delivering some of the same efficiency gains in the Eagle Ford that we delivered in our Haynesville program. We've drilled four Wolfcamp wells, one is online and we are currently completing two of the wells. We're on track with our delineation plan there with two of the wells drilled today in the eastern portion of our acreage, one in the center and one on the Western side. 
We've also taken hole cores on two wells and the coring, drilling, logging data that we have gathered so far has been very consistent with our expectations. There's also been some horizontal wells drilled to offset our acreage that look very good and adds to our enthusiasm about this program. 
Considering the date of the timing of data flow in the play, we're currently planning to update on our Wolfcamp program in our May 5 earnings call or perhaps sooner at one of the conferences. 
Some of the key metrics from 2010 performance are shown on Slide 16. Our production was 782 million equivalent per day, which is above the high end of our guidance and above 2009 results. Our fourth quarter production was 795 a day, which is up 7% year-over-year and was the highest quarterly production that we've reported since the first quarter of 2009. Cash costs were also lower than they were in 2009, coming in at $1.78 versus $1.82. 
I'm also very pleased with our reserve growth and efficiency metrics in our inventory growth for the year. When you look at 2010 E&P performance, I think the key takeaway is that we've reached a point where we can consistently deliver results that are very competitive with the best of our industry peers. 
We've updated Slide 17 from our guidance call to show you our current drilling activity. We've added two oil rigs, both in the Eagle Ford. So in total, we now have over twice as many oil rigs than gas rigs working, and we plan for that ratio to increase during the course of the year. In the near term, we still plan to run four rigs in the Haynesville program, which is a very optimized and economic activity level. But as I said in our guidance call, depending on gas prices and service costs, we may choose to further reduce our activity and shift capital to one of our oil programs. 
Another factor that can change our activity level is whether or not we take a partner in the Eagle Ford. We're very much in the throes of those discussions and we'll likely decide by the end of Q1. 
If we can accelerate our Eagle Ford program while improving the value of the opportunity by taking a partner, then we'll do it. If not, then we'll go it alone and shift capital as we need to in the second half of the year. 
And let's stay with the Eagle Ford with an update on Slide 18. We're pleased with our results to date so we've essentially doubled our activity level since the first of the year. We're achieving production tests and expected the EURs that as good as or better than expected, and we're pushing to gain additional cost efficiencies. 
Most of our activity is in the Central LaSalle County area where we have our largest acreage position. And we now believe that area contains volatile oil, meaning that we have oil in the reservoir with associated gas at the surface versus having gas wells with condensate dropping out of the surface. Three of the 14 wells that we've drilled here had initial rates in excess of 1,000 barrels a day equivalent. And we recently drilled our longest lateral roughly 6,400 feet, completed the well with 21 frac stages and have seen daily producing rates of over 900 barrel equivalents. 
So as we move into development phase, the Eagle Ford will become more impactful in 2011. Since the beginning of this year, we have completed nine new wells and when we get the newer completions online, we expect to double production from the field. 
On Slide 19, we showed that production mix over the expected life of the wells in the central and the northern area of Eagle Ford, which is consistent with a models that we published last October at the time of our Eagle Ford field trip. Now I want to briefly revisit this topic because in recent conversations with investors, I've heard some confusion about the product mix from our northern and central areas of the Eagle Ford, and those makes up about, as a reminder, about 2/3 of our total acreage position. And we believe that in the central area, about 75% of the recoverable reserves are expected to be oil. NGLs are only about 10% of the volume, with which means that while ethane and other liquid prices improved the economics, they're not a big value driver in our program. 
In the northern area where we have currently one rig working, the oil contribution increases even further to 85%. All the wells in that northern area will need artificial lift almost from day one, so we're quickly working to determine the best method of pumping the wells both while we're producing back the frac water initially and in the long term, production mode. 
Note that Frio County wells has been completed, and we're currently installing artificial lift in that well. And also in our northern area, we've drilled the well in Atascosa county. It's our first well there. And we drilled and logged a vertical pilot hole and then we drilled the horizontal section and early worklog responses in both are very encouraging. So we're anxious to see how that well produces. 
Our last chart is on Slide 20 this morning. And we're always focused on continuous improvement in all of our programs, all of our asset areas and with with all parts of our business. And as a result, we believe that the Haynesville execution and cost structure is top quartile and often, industry leading. We've taken our Haynesville practices and moved them down to the Eagle Ford so we're moving up the learning curve rapidly, which means we're finding ways to cut time and capital costs per well. And we've only been drilling the Eagle Ford for a little over a year, and the results shown on this slide are based on about 20 well data set. 
We made significant progress during the drilling phase, improving from 500 feet per day to about 1,200 feet per day. We also had similar success in the time required from spud to total depth, cutting the number of days by over 60% from about 31 days to 11 days on our best well to date. 
And just as we have done elsewhere, our drilling team's delivered these efficiencies by optimizing the drill bit, the downhole motor and the drilling fluid designs and combinations. And then, we believe later as we move into multi-well paths, we expect to see continued reduction in cycle time. 
Remember though that more than half of our well costs is for completion and simulation, so finding efficiencies in frac-ing these wells also has major cost benefit. Averaging 3.6 fracs per day at far best well today is great progress for our Eagle Ford team. We've benefited from having a dedicated completion crews with Foster's better safety performance and better teamwork and coordination, and we expect additional gains as we continue to find ways to further eliminate the non-productive time or downtime. 
About 40% of our stimulation costs comes from fixed equipment charges, so we'll see a lower per well cost as we improve the efficiency of Eagle Ford completions or as we further improve the average number of fracs per day. And then, we'll spread that fixed costs to over more completions. 
At 3.6 fracs a day is our best Eagle Ford pace, but we're not stopping there because we're now consistently averaging closer to 4 fracs per day in the Haynesville.  
Overall, I'm really pleased with how this development is progressing and I continue to believe that the Eagle Ford will be a long term anchor program for us. 
I'll now turn the call back to Doug for closing comments."

It's exciting at $100 crude world to have a meaningful oil component in our E&P story and when we intend to make the most of that opportunity. By year end, we'll have at least 3x as many oil directive rigs as gas directed rigs and maybe more. And that's going to yield 30% to 40% growth in oil production this year and another 50% in 2012. 
Restoring our balance sheet strength is also a top priority for 2011. One of the primary tools to accomplish this is EPB, and there's every reason to believe we'll have another successful year growing EPB to the benefit of both the MLP unitholders and the EP shareholders. We know that this continued improvement is key to getting the premium multiple for our stock that we believe it deserves. 
Another valuation key is the completion of our extensive backlog in the pipes, as well as successfully concluding rate cases on EPNG, CIG and TGP. We expect to get all this done, much of it in the first half of this year. 
And in Midstream, you'll more from Mark on our Analyst Day in May. But in the meantime, his team is very busy completing for the mass project in the Marcellus and the Camino Real project in the Eagle Ford. And while each is very competitive, we're competing hard to get these across the finish line. 
We're making great progress already on these and other milestones we laid out for you in our earlier guidance call, and that means we have every expectation that 2011 will be another rewarding year for our shareholders. 
Finally, while we're on the topic of rewarding our shareholders, I'll wager that someone on the call is planning to ask about corporate structure given recent events in the capital markets. The key message I want you to take from this call is that we'll do what is right for our shareholders to create long-term sustainable value. And that's whether we are talking about the management team or our Board. 
So while our immediate focus is on all those milestones we laid out for 2011, we're not deaf to the markets. In fact, recent events we think are very exciting for anyone who is an EP shareholder or considering being an EP shareholder. 
Case in point. So a new high watermarks have been achieved recently in terms of valuations for high-quality GPs. We think that's not only appropriate, it's outstanding. And we just happen to own 100% of the highest quality GP. And the great news is, it has a tremendous growth profile. We only reached the 50% incentive distribution rights in the fourth quarter of 2010. So that $50 million to $60 million in distributions to the GP in 2011 is still toward the front end of a very high growth trajectory that will create lots and lots of value for EP shareholders. And because it has the lowest-risks, highest-growth characteristics out there due to its sponsor and due to the fact that it's the only pure play GP, it sets the high watermark for what GPs are worth. In addition, recent transactions point out that companies with strong balance sheets and high cash payouts are highly valued in the market. That's why we're running as fast as we can to make sure we maximize the strength of our balance sheet. And we have every expectation that we'll do just that. 
And E&P companies and assets that have low risks, repeatable drilling inventories at the lower end of the cost curve and with oil exposure going to higher valuations, that's exactly what we think we have. So if you believe that management is properly incented and the company is properly governed, then there's really nothing but upside all in our shares in this regard. So where do we stack up on those dimensions? Management has higher-than-average leverage and compensation to changes in equity values. And given that as a group, we haven't been sellers and we are all very large owners relative to our personal worth, you should assume we think and act like owners. We also have a very independent, very shareholder-minded Board that I think stacks up well against any competitor we have. 
So I think on those two key dimensions. We have a vision of a company that will stay laser focused on taking the actions that will maximize the long-term share price of El Paso. In addition, we have a track record of doing just that, having made many, many shareholder-friendly decisions as we brought this company back from the brink. While we like the integrated model and see key benefits to it, we're not married to it. We have looked and will continue to look at structure. And the great news is, we're not doing it in a vacuum. We've got interesting real world data points to analyze and monitor, some from well-seasoned transactions and some from more recent announcements. 
I believe that significantly increases the likelihood that a dispassionate analysis will yield the right result. This has been and will continue to be a key topic of discussion in both the management and the Board level and we'll continue to keep you apprised of our decisions in this regard. And with that, we're happy to open it up to your questions."

So we have  -- and so, and that's in three discrete pieces. One is on Spread 5, where I'll talk about our plan in just a minute, and the other -- and so that probably comprises about 40 miles of the 100. And the other two pieces of 30 miles each or so are on Spreads 6 and 7 in Oregon. But on Spread 5, our plan, and I think it's a well-developed one, we know all the parameters because of the sage grouse mating issue, we -- within that 40 mile stretch, there's only about 12 to 14 miles that is impacted by this sage grouse mating issue. So we're clearing through what we can clear through now. As soon as we can, we'll start stringing and then welding up. Realistically, from an assembly-line-operation standpoint, we won't be able to get up to that. We won't be able to do appreciable welding on that stretch until mid-May. But when you go through that exercise on Spread 5, we should be welded up on the whole thing in June, do tie ends then into early July and have plenty of time for purging and packing, et cetera. Anyway, that's sort of the critical path matter. On Spread 6 and 7, in Oregon, we effective -- we're very close to having all of our permits there. And so there is more, continuing to grind it out as we have been doing. And we fully expect that as well as all of the rest of the pipeline with the exception of Spread 5 to be fully welded out by the end of April. So that there are -- then tie ends and testing on that will commence. So that as soon as we finish Spread 5 with very limited time after that, we'll be able to put it in service. So I guess my point is that on costs, we have a much better prune down now. We have ongoing weather issues, but gee, we're through the worst of that. We essentially have all of our permits in place. The worst of the construction is really behind us. The' work on Spreads 5, 6 and 7 -- on Spread 5, once we get in there, it's not difficult pipelining. So we just feel a lot better about our costs and schedule."

But they at some point will log off to. The once we go further north and Eagle Ford, we'll have less gas associated with them. And so we will be pumping almost day one. And so that's how we're designing those rigs. You're going to have to put high grade pumps on them, jet pumps or sub pumps or something to get the frac water cleaned up and the early kind of high flow rates. And then have a program in place that rotates those to the new wells and rotates them in a more permanent solution, probably rod them up in a lot of cases, just sort of high-volume rod pumping, that's what we're thinking. But we don't have that solution yet. And it's going to be some combination of flowing wells, high rate, getting the frac to it all and then long-term pumping science."

During this conference call, we will make a number of forward-looking statements and projections. We have made every reasonable effort to ensure that the information and assumptions on which these statements and projections are based are current, reasonable and complete. However, there are variety of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the statements and projections expressed during this call. You will find those factors listed under the cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements on Slide 2 of this morning’s presentation as well as in other SEC filings. We do not assume any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Finally, I’d like to ask those of you who will be participating in Q&A to limit yourselves to two questions so that we can give more people an opportunity to ask questions. Thanks for your help on this. I'll now turn the call over to Doug."

Before we begin the call this morning, I'd like to reach out all of our employees, their families, our customers and our neighbors in Alabama. Our thoughts and prayers are with you as you begin the recovery process following the recent horrific storms. El Paso and our employees are supporting Red Cross relief efforts and will continue to do so. Now for our first quarter results. 
We are delighted to have another good quarter in the books. The momentum we felt at year end has continued through the first quarter and we hope to show evidence of that this morning and again on May 24 at our Analyst Day in New York. J.R. will go over our financial results in some detail. But let me say here that we are ahead of our own internal plan in virtually every financial area. The E&P team continues to hit on all cylinders, with volumes ahead of plan, unit cost coming down and inflation being kept in check with continuing efficiency gains. 
We announced earlier this quarter that after a lengthy process, we've decided to go it alone on our Eagle Ford acreage. We had a pull some process and receive quality bids. In the end however, our judgment was that the highest return outcome for our shareholders was to hold this acreage and develop it ourselves at our pace. 
As we've matured our activity there, we've gained confidence that this is the kind of high-quality, repeatable resource that fits our strategy to a tee. As this occurred and we de-risked the acreage, its value went up. And given current and anticipated commodity prices, we felt that the value of this high-quality liquids inventory was key to our ongoing E&P story. We'll give you a full update on the impacts of this decision to our overall plan for 2011 at our Analyst Day later this month, but the news will be good. 
Brent will talk in more detail about another exciting oil related story, the Wolfcamp. But the short story is that we're extremely pleased with what we see on our own, as well as on offset acreage. We're still early, but we know enough already to know we will be drilling in the Wolfcamp for a very long time. With prices at the most recent university land sale having more than doubled since our entry less than a year ago, others apparently share that opinion. 
In the pipes, we continue to make progress in putting it to serve is the balance of an $8 million backlog or growth projects. During the quarter, FGT Phase VIII went into service on time and on budget. The second phase of the SNG expansion will go into service and Jim will provide an update on activities at Ruby where we expect to go in service in July. 
Out West, EPNG has been our most challenging pipeline, given that it serves the Arizona and California markets which have been particularly hard hit during the recent recession. We've alluded in the past to the potential for expansion at EPNG to serve new utility load in Mexico. We've now brought the first of those expansions to fruition with a project to serve 2 new PowerGen plants in the state of Sonora. This represents 185 million cubic feet a day of incremental firm transport on EPNG, a significant addition to loads on this pipe. And given that between TGP and EPNG, we now provide 75% of the transport into Mexico. We expect to compete very favorably for any additional load going forward. This a great piece of business and a big win for our team out West. 
While we don't have a report on our Midstream efforts today, I will say that we are very encouraged by recent announcements by Dowe Chemical, Chevron Phillips Chemical and Westlake Chemical about their expansion plans, primarily on the Gulf Coast. Others have estimated that this could result in an additional demand in the Gulf Coast of over 250,000 barrels a day of ethane. This means that the Gulf Coast will continue to be the demand center for ethane. We believe our MEPS project is best positioned to move the large volumes of ethane produced from the Marcellus to the Gulf Coast, and we continue to work closely with our customers to get this one over the finish line. 
Finally, we completed our first MLP drop of the year in the first quarter, continuing a string of successful drop downs, with EPB issuing more than $450 million of new equity. As in the past, we continue to target MLP proceeds to improving our balance sheet strength, as we march toward Investment Grade. With that, I'll turn it over to J.R. to review our financial results for the quarter and I'll come back at the end of wrap up."
1038355,118084840,122907,"El Paso Corp., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 05, 2011",2011-05-05,"Earnings Calls","El Paso LLC","Executives","Thanks, Doug, and good morning everyone.

As Doug just mentioned, we are off to a good start this year. So that makes my job this morning pretty straightforward. After highlighting our latest drop down to the MLP, I'll provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter and close with an update on our hedge positions. 
We completed yet another drop down to El Paso Pipeline Partners during the quarter, our first for 2011 and 6 since our IPO, raising $667 million of cash proceeds. Consistent with our stated strategy, we are using the proceeds to reduce debt at El Paso Corp. 
Continued balance sheet improvement remains at a top priority for us. That means you should expect more of the same, as we move throughout the year. Although not mentioned in my slides this morning, we also converted our 4.99% preferred into about 58 million shares of El Paso common stock during the quarter. Now this action further demonstrates our commitment to the balance sheet and moves us closer to our goal of achieving an Investment Grade profile. Now the conversion does not have an impact on our previously announced 2011 earnings per share guidance. 
Moving to Slide 6. We reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.30 for the quarter which was slightly below last year. Operational performance in the business units was offset by higher aggregate financing costs, attributable to the pipeline expansion projects, namely Ruby. Our effective tax rate for the quarter on a GAAP basis was about 12%, driven by the resolution of several tax matters, as well as earned state tax credits related to recently completed capital projects. Now excluding these items, our effective rate would've been 22% for the quarter. Now our rate will remain well below the statutory rate of 35% and lower than 2010 due to the growth of earnings attributable to non-controlling interests, as we continue to drop more assets in the El Paso Pipeline Partners. 
Adjusted segment EBIT was essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, as increases in the Pipeline Group were offset by declines in E&P. In the pipes, higher revenues from the expansion projects placed in service, as well as an increase in allowance for funds used during construction related to Ruby were partially offset by lower revenues in our EPNG system. 
In E&P, declines from lower realized natural gas prices and a higher DD&A rate were partially offset by a 5% increase in equivalent production volumes, as well as higher crude oil prices. Now despite the lower earnings, E&P posted strong operational results, as Brett will discuss in a few minutes. 
And as we talked about back in our January guidance call, the reporting business segments result season in new measure this year that excludes non-controlling interests from EBIT and EBITDA. Now remember, this change only impacted the Pipeline Group and we've adjusted our 2010 measures to conform to the new presentation. 
So let's turn to operating cash flow and capital investment on Slide 7. We're essentially on track or even slightly ahead of where we expected to be at the end of the quarter. Cash flow from operations for the quarter exceeded the prior year due primarily to higher E&P cash flows and positive working capital changes. On the capital slide, you see the ramp up in pipeline spending from last year, as we progress through the final phases of several expansion projects, most notably our Ruby Pipeline. The first quarter capital level for the pipeline is expected to be the peak as our spending declines in subsequent quarters, as we near the completion of the original $8 billion expansion backlog. 
In our E&P business, spending was up for the quarter, reflecting higher horizontal drilling and completion activity in our core areas in 2011. On Slide 8, I'll close out my comments with an update on our hedge position. 
During the quarter, we added a bit to these positions. And as you can see, we are well protected from the risks of low natural gas prices in 2011, with 80% of our gas hedged at an average price of $5.78, well above current market prices. We also have nearly half of our 2012 natural gas production hedged at about $6.
And while the near-term gas price environment remains difficult to predict, we are pleased with our hedge positions will provide a level of stability to our cash flows, as we execute our business plans. In fact, since the end of the quarter, we've been able to add some very attractive oil positions that I'll share with you at our May 24 Analyst Day. So that's my update for you this morning. I'm very happy with our strong start to 2011 and look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim."
1038355,118084840,122907,"El Paso Corp., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 05, 2011",2011-05-05,"Earnings Calls","El Paso LLC","Executives","Thanks, J.R.. The pipelines are off to a very good start in 2011.

As J.R. showed the pipes financials for the quarter reflect our expansion mode, very nice EBIT growth and big CapEx spend. And this year, we're continuing to complete more expansions, 5 additional projects and a service this year. The first one as Doug said, the FGT Phase VIII expansion was completed on budget and on-time on April 1. It's a big one, over $2.4 billion of CapEx, 800 a day of additional capacity increasing FGT's capacity into Florida by over a third. 
On the business development front, also as Doug said, we've just signed an agreement for EPNG to supply new power plants in Mexico. I'll review this project. Generally, it demonstrates the expected increase in exports to Mexico is happening and EPNG is well situated to capitalize on this trend. 
Slide 11 summarizes throughput trends for the first quarter versus last year. Overall, flat year-to-date. On the individual pipes, throughput was heavily influenced by weather. On our Eastern pipes, significantly colder weather in the Northeast this year benefited TGP. TGP's throughput was at a record high. And in the Southeast, more normal winter temperatures after a very cold early 2010 resulted in lower throughput on SNG. Other than weather, on a recent pipes, I couple of recent trends continue. 1, is that TGP continues to benefit from Marcellus production. Marcellus receipts into TGP are now 1.3 Bs a day, up from half of B a day this time last year. About two thirds of all Marcellus production in Pennsylvania is flowing into TGP. As you know, we have $1 billion of expansion projects in process in Northeast Pennsylvania. They will significantly increase our takeaway capacity to help keep up with Marcellus production growth. 
Another trend also on SNG, note that despite the normal winter weather, PowerGen loads increased up over 10% continually trends that we've now seen for the last couple of years. 
On our Rockies pipes, throughput decreased generally WIC in China plants volumes were down due to slightly lower Rockies production and lower overall exports out of the region. CIG was also impacted by this, but much colder weather along the front range help to offset it. Finally, on EPNG, throughput was down mostly due to higher withdrawals from storage and California this winter. This backed out understate transport into California. But importantly we see signs of increased throughput in the Southwest with the beginnings of an economic recovery there.  So across the country, some ups and downs, but overall, flattish throughput. 
Also an EPNG, Slide 12 describes a meaningful new expansion project. This is to serve 2 new PowerGen plants in Mexico in the state of Sonora. EPNG will provide firm transportation, 185 a day on our mainline and lateral that extends to the Mexican border. From there, third parties will transport the gas to the plants. This service will start in 2013 and we'll spend $18 million to upgrade the lateral. It means over $30 million in annual revenue for EPNG which had EBIT of just over $200 million last year, as a point of reference. This is the first in what may be more opportunities to serve growing exports to Mexico. As Doug said, between EPNG and TGP, today we transport about 3 quarters of the 1 B a day that is exported to Mexico. We, and most consultants expect those experts to double over the next several years, as Mexico turns to gas-fired PowerGen and as Pemex emphasizes oil production over gas. 
EPNG is particularly well-positioned for this business. So all EPNG remains the most challenged of our pipes, we see some tangible signs now of improving market demand long-term. 
Slide 13 summarizes our big slate of expansion projects that will complete this year. With FGT 8 complete, the next one to go in service will be the second phase of the SNG expansion for Southern Company. It will go in service on June 1. It's on time and likely will be under budget. As you may recall, this expansion serves a newly converted coal plant of Southerns.  It's a 2,500-megawatt plant. 
Then, next comes Ruby. I'll take a minute here to add some color on current construction activities on Ruby. We are nearly 90% welded out. We have about 80 miles left to complete, all in the western end of the route. About half of this 80 miles is in western Nevada and half in Oregon. As we said on our last call, we largely shut down our Spread 5 in western Nevada in March and April for the stage as mating season. Just recently, we brought back the pipe gang there and have restarted welding activities. And when the mating season ends on May 15, we'll resume construction on those restricted areas. 
During April, we also pulled most of the cruise offer spreads in Oregon to let the right-of-way dry after a very wet weather in March. We're going back to work right now in that section. In the interim, we've completed most of the critical stream crossings in Oregon which is a significant accomplishment. 
Outside of these areas that are on the western end, Ruby is very nearly complete. We expect to purge impact the entire eastern portion of the pipe in May. Also, construction of the compressor stations is now over 90% complete and commissioning is well underway at the big head station at. 
So the finish line on Ruby is in sight. Now as we get back to work on the western end, we'll know more about our progress towards final completion by the time of our Analyst Day at the end of the month. 
After Ruby in the fourth quarter, we'll complete 2 more projects. The LNG terminal in Pascagoula and our TGP Line 300 project across Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Both of these are fully subscribed with long-term contracts. So by the end of the year, essentially all of the original $8 billion backlog will be complete. 
Our focus of the pipes remains very clear, it's to complete these projects successfully. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brent."

I'll begin today on Slide 15. I also plan to keep my comments a fairly high level and focused on the quarter and then share more detail in New York on the 24. After a strong finish to 2010, we're off to a great start s",1782,"Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin today on Slide 15. I also plan to keep my comments a fairly high level and focused on the quarter and then share more detail in New York on the 24. After a strong finish to 2010, we're off to a great start so far this year in E&P. We continue to grow production and the Haynesville core continues to perform very well on the gas side. And at the same time, oil rising fast of roughly 24% year-over-year, consistent with our increase in oil-directed CapEx. And even though we are seeing cost inflation in many aspects of our business, our team has done a great job of mitigating most of those costs, including drilling, completion and production operations by continuing to increase operating efficiencies. We're actively advancing our Eagle Ford and Wolfcamp oil programs and the news was good on both fronts. We've delineated our Eagle Ford central acreage, so we now know what we have there and the results have been at or above our models. 
Our early West Texas Wolfcamp drilling results are also encouraging. So far this year, we've drilled and completed 3 wells which has told us a lot about our acreage. What seem like a big step out just last September is shaping up to be another core program for us. We're on a steep learning curve, but we still like what we see in the Wolfcamp. And going forward, we'll continue to utilize the same approach that's proven successful in the development of Haynesville and our Eagle Ford Shale programs. 
So turning in to Slide 16. We are pleased with our Q1 production and operating cash cost results. Our production was $821 million equivalent per day for the quarter which is up 5% from last year and 3% from the fourth quarter. Again, liquids were up 18% from Q1 of last year. 
Cash costs were down $0.03 to $1.85 and that's primarily driven by higher volumes. And while there's been a lot of recent discussion regarding inflation of drilling and completion cost, it's also cost pressure on the operating expense side, so reduced in unit cash cost is a big win for us. 
We have a pretty good example of how we are overcoming service cost inflation on Slide 17. The example shown is a fully completed Haynesville well which is our most mature shale program. We began the year with completed well cost of about $9 million, well below the $10-plus million level for many of our peers. Drilling costs began to rise, as we increased the average lateral links and as rig rates have increased, but we fought off those increases with a 3-day reduction in drilling time. 
On the completion side, while we have a dedicated frac crew, there's still some costs that are being passed through such as some of the pumping cost, fuel and other non-pressure pumping completion cost. So offset those increases, we were able to reduce the time it takes to complete the wells. We're now pumping up to 5 frac stages per day. And I believe that many others in the play would consider 3 to 4 in a day to be a good day. 
In addition to the cost savings, the improvement efficiency also results in 1 additional well coming on production each month which also contributed to our Q4 and our Q1 production results. Overall, our asset and our operations team has done a great job of creating a continuous improvement culture and coming up ways with new ways to gain efficiencies across the board. 
Let's start with a Eagle Ford with an update on Slide 18. Doug shared an overview of what's taken place in the Eagle Ford. Let's expand a little. We currently have 4 rigs working in the play. They're all in the central area in the South County which is up from 2 that we started the year with. And we've now fully delineated our central position we are very much in the pilot phase in the northern areas. And as you'd expect, we don't have much activity planned in the dry gas area in the South. We're still treating the southern area as a call option on higher gas prices. And we're working hard to deliver the same kind of cost efficiencies here that we're delivering in the Haynesville. 
On Slide 19, we provided a few more details of the central area. And remember this area, we expect 75% of recoverable reserves to be oil. And we drill 30 wells here and we drilled them across the block, as you can see from the green dots, so development a very good understanding of the well performance and our acreage position. 
As we learn more, we think we'll have the opportunity to move to even denser space and perhaps 80 or 100 hundred acres versus the current 120 acre space. And we're piloting that concept this year. If we're proven right, we expect to drill more wells in this area and significantly increase our recoverable resources. 
Our productive capacity through is growing rapidly, along with Mark in the midstream company, we are actively building in-field infrastructure which will result in a step-up in production rates later this summer. 
We're pleased with our results to date and we'll definitely spend more time laying out our Eagle Ford story in a few weeks. 
So let's move on to the Wolfcamp. We've included a map on Slide 20. Last summer before we bid on the university lands, we drilled the pilot well in the eastern side of our position. That well provided us with subsurface core and log data that gave us confidence to spend $180 million on land and we get into the play early at least at this part of the play. And so far this year, we drilled and completed 3 wells which is shown as red stars on the map. And as you can see, they go across our entire acreage position that spans roughly 35 miles. And we'll show you more of the technical subsurface data in New York, but we found a very consistent high-quality Wolfcamp section across this area. We're in the early days of the program and much optimization work remains. But everything we've seen confirms the view that we showed you back in November. 
At the time we showed a single average well model across the acreage, but we'll likely start to discuss a couple of different models from east to west, as we continue our appraisal drilling. But overall, the models will be in line with our average type well. 
We've added a second rig in Q1 and will likely stay at this level for the remainder of the year. One very important development since our last call is we've now finalized unitization agreements with the university land office where we created 4 drilling units on the acreage that we picked up last September. And what this means is instead of having a bunch of 640-acre section size three-year term leases, we've now combined our leases to create groups of leases or units that we can hold by drilling for up to 7 years. For maybe so this is an example of benefits of having all of our leases with a single codevelopment land owner. 
Turning to Slide 21. I can't resist including a little science. On the right has side, the chart is a picture of a whole core section from one of our wells. We normally think of shale as dense, silt or mudstone type of rock. But remember that we said that the Wolfcamp source rock in our lease area has high quartz and high carbonate content. So it has some of the same rock characteristics as conventional reservoirs. Now granted this is a significantly magnified view, but the back dark areas that you see are nice looking spaces. Per spaces that can hold a lot of oil. And we see that kind of quality rock vertically up and down throughout the Wolfpack shale section. 
On the upper left, we summarize our originally assumed Wolfcamp geology and petrophysical parameters, and we've included the results so far from our first 4 wells on the right side of the table. All the values in the table are for the entire Wolfcamp section. 
Today, we've only targeted the upper Wolfcamp which is a little over half of the total thickness and our published type curves and our future inventory only include the upper Wolfcamp section. All told, though we are finding bigger section and more net pay. The average for us it is higher and the organic content is very good. So we have a very nice looking interval which is also while we've seen industry competing aggressively to get into this part of the play. 
We concluded that some early production stats on Slide 22. We've tested 4 wells. The 38291H was our pilot well, which we're only able to frac with 7 stages over 2,000-foot interval, but achieved, but still achieved good initial test rates. We've then experimenting with lateral length and a number of frac stages and our last 3 wells have all tested nearly 300 barrels per day plus the associated gas. And a greater amount of gas in the oil has been positive in. It's good news because it provides energy for more oil to be developed in the first spaces. But as we've discussed before these was also going artificial lift almost immediately and so more gas makes the pump selection a bit tricky. Sump pump design and a post back-to-back rates are also to the areas that we're optimizing.  And also had 2 wells nearing incompletion shown on the bottom of the slide. one of them is a 7,000-foot lateral and we plan to complete it with 24 frac stages. 
So I'll wrap up on Slide 23. While it's admittedly early days for the Wolfcamp program and we still have a lot to learn. We're encouraged by the results of our pilot wells. The highest value items that we'll be optimizing include lateral links, the density or frequency of the frac stages, the artificial lift options, optimal initial producing rates and the facility design. And we are also considering drilling a vertical well this year to test the entire Wolfcamp section, including that lower portion. 
So I've covered a lot of high points for the quarter this morning and I'll expand all of these discussions further on the 24. But again, we're pleased with our execution so far this year and the way that our programs are advancing. And then I'll turn the call back to Doug for closing comments."

Before we begin the call this morning, I'd like to reach out to all of our employees, their families, our customers and our neighbors in Alabama. Our thoughts and prayers are with you as you begin the recovery process following the recent horrific storms. El Paso and our employees are supporting Red Cross relief efforts and will continue to do so. Now for our first quarter results. 
We are delighted to have another good quarter in the books. The momentum we felt at year end has continued through the first quarter, and we hope to show evidence of that this morning and again on May 24 at our Analyst Day in New York. J.R. will go over our financial results in some detail, but let me say here that we are ahead of our own internal plan in virtually every financial area. The E&P team continues to hit on all cylinders, with volumes ahead of plan, unit cost coming down and inflation being kept in check with continuing efficiency gains. 
We announced earlier this quarter that after a lengthy process, we've decided to go it alone on our Eagle Ford acreage. We had to pull some process and received quality bids. In the end however, our judgment was that the highest return outcome for our shareholders was to hold this acreage and develop it ourselves at our pace. 
As we've matured our activity there, we've gained confidence that this is the kind of high-quality, repeatable resource that fits our strategy to a tee. As this occurred and we derisked the acreage, its value went up. And given current and anticipated commodity prices, we felt that the value of this high-quality liquids inventory was key to our ongoing E&P story. We'll give you a full update on the impacts of this decision to our overall plan for 2011 at our Analyst Day later this month, but the news will be good. 
Brent will talk in more detail about another exciting oil-related story, the Wolfcamp. But the short story is that we're extremely pleased with what we see on our own, as well as on offset acreage. We're still early, but we know enough already to know we will be drilling in the Wolfcamp for a very long time. With prices at the most recent university land sale having more than doubled since our entry less than a year ago, others apparently share that opinion. 
In the pipes, we continue to make progress in putting into service the balance of an $8 million backlog or growth projects. During the quarter, FGT Phase VIII went into service on time and on budget. The second phase of the SNG expansion will go into service June 1. And Jim will provide an update on activities at Ruby where we expect to go in service in July. 
Out West, EPNG has been our most challenging pipeline, given that it serves the Arizona and California markets, which have been particularly hard hit during the recent recession. We've alluded in the past to the potential for expansion at EPNG to serve new utility load in Mexico. We've now brought the first of those expansions to fruition with a project to serve 2 new power gen plants in the state of Sonora. This represents 185 million cubic feet a day of incremental firm transport on EPNG, a significant addition to loads on this pipe. And given that between TGP and EPNG, we now provide 75% of the transport into Mexico. We expect to compete very favorably for any additional load going forward. This is a great piece of business and a big win for our team out West. 
While we don't have a report on our Midstream efforts today, I will say that we are very encouraged by recent announcements by Dow Chemical, Chevron Phillips Chemical and Westlake Chemical about their expansion plans, primarily on the Gulf Coast. Others have estimated that this could result in an additional demand in the Gulf Coast of over 250,000 barrels a day of ethane. This means that the Gulf Coast will continue to be the demand center for ethane. We believe our MEPS project is best positioned to move the large volumes of ethane produced from the Marcellus to the Gulf Coast, and we continue to work closely with our customers to get this one over the finish line. 
Finally, we completed our first MLP drop of the year in the first quarter, continuing a string of successful drop downs, with EPB issuing more than $450 million of new equity. As in the past, we continue to target MLP proceeds to improving our balance sheet strength, as we march toward investment grade. With that, I'll turn it over to J.R. to review our financial results for the quarter, and I'll come back at the end to wrap up."

As Doug just mentioned, we are off to a good start this year. So that makes my job this morning pretty straightforward. After highlighting our latest drop down to the MLP, I'll provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter and close with an update on our hedge positions. 
We completed yet another drop down to El Paso Pipeline Partners during the quarter, our first for 2011 and sixth since our IPO, raising $667 million of cash proceeds. Consistent with our stated strategy, we are using the proceeds to reduce debt at El Paso Corp. 
Continued balance sheet improvement remains a top priority for us. That means you should expect more of the same, as we move throughout the year. Although not mentioned in my slides this morning, we also converted our 4.99% preferred into about 58 million shares of El Paso common stock during the quarter. Now this action further demonstrates our commitment to the balance sheet and moves us closer to our goal of achieving an investment grade profile. Now the conversion does not have an impact on our previously announced 2011 earnings per share guidance. 
Moving to Slide 6. We reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.30 for the quarter, which was slightly below last year. Operational performance in the business units was offset by higher aggregate financing costs attributable to the pipeline expansion projects, namely Ruby. Our effective tax rate for the quarter on a GAAP basis was about 12%, driven by the resolution of several tax matters, as well as earned state tax credits related to recently completed capital projects. Now excluding these items, our effective rate would've been 22% for the quarter. Now our rate will remain well below the statutory rate of 35% and lower than 2010 due to the growth of earnings attributable to non-controlling interests, as we continue to drop more assets in the El Paso Pipeline Partners. 
Adjusted segment EBIT was essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, as increases in the Pipeline Group were offset by declines in E&P. In the pipes, higher revenues from the expansion projects placed in service, as well as an increase in allowance for funds used during construction related to Ruby were partially offset by lower revenues in our EPNG system. 
In E&P, declines from lower realized natural gas prices and a higher DD&A rate were partially offset by a 5% increase in equivalent production volumes, as well as higher crude oil prices. Now despite the lower earnings, E&P posted strong operational results, as Brett will discuss in a few minutes. 
And as we talked about back in our January guidance call, we're reporting business segment result season a new measure this year that excludes non-controlling interests from EBIT and EBITDA. Now remember, this change only impacted the Pipeline Group, and we've adjusted our 2010 measures to conform to the new presentation. 
So let's turn to operating cash flow and capital investment on Slide 7. We're essentially on track or even slightly ahead of where we expected to be at the end of the quarter. Cash flow from operations for the quarter exceeded the prior year due primarily to higher E&P cash flows and positive working capital changes. On the capital slide, you see the ramp up in pipeline spending from last year, as we progress through the final phases of several expansion projects, most notably our Ruby Pipeline. The first quarter capital level for the pipelines is expected to be the peak as our spending declines in subsequent quarters, as we near the completion of the original $8 billion expansion backlog. 
In our E&P business, spending was up for the quarter, reflecting higher horizontal drilling and completion activity in our core areas in 2011. On Slide 8, I'll close out my comments with an update on our hedge position. 
During the quarter, we added a bit to these positions. And as you can see, we are well protected from the risks of low natural gas prices in 2011, with 80% of our gas hedged at an average price of $5.78, well above current market prices. We also have nearly half of our 2012 natural gas production hedged at about $6.
And while the near-term gas price environment remains difficult to predict, we are pleased that our hedge positions will provide a level of stability to our cash flows, as we execute our business plans. In fact, since the end of the quarter, we've been able to add some very attractive oil positions that I'll share with you at our May 24 Analyst Day. So that's my update for you this morning. I'm very happy with our strong start to 2011 and look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim."

The first one, as Doug said, the FGT Phase VIII expansion was completed on budget and on-time on April 1. It's a big one, over $2.4 billion of CapEx, 800 a day of additional capacity increasing FGT's capacity into Florida by over 1/3. 
On the business development front, also as Doug said, we've just signed an agreement for EPNG to supply new power plants in Mexico. I'll review this project. Generally, it demonstrates the expected increase in exports to Mexico is happening and EPNG is well situated to capitalize on this trend. 
Slide 11 summarizes throughput trends for the first quarter versus last year. Overall, flat year-to-date. On the individual pipes, throughput was heavily influenced by weather. On our eastern pipes, significantly colder weather in the Northeast this year benefited TGP. TGP's throughput was at a record high. And in the Southeast, more normal winter temperatures after a very cold early 2010 resulted in lower throughput on SNG. Other than weather, on our recent pipes, a couple of recent trends continue. One, is that TGP continues to benefit from Marcellus production. Marcellus receipts into TGP are now 1.3 Bs a day, up from 1/2 B a day at this time last year. About 2/3 of all Marcellus production in Pennsylvania is flowing into TGP. As you know, we have $1 billion of expansion projects in process in Northeast Pennsylvania. They will significantly increase our takeaway capacity to help keep up with Marcellus production growth. 
Another trend also on SNG, note that despite the more normal winter weather, power gen loads increased up over 10% continuing a trend that we've now seen for the last couple of years. 
On our Rockies pipes, throughput decreased, generally WIC and Cheyenne Plains volumes were down due to slightly lower Rockies production and lower overall exports out of the region. CIG was also impacted by this, but much colder weather along the front range helped to offset it. Finally, on EPNG, throughput was down mostly due to higher withdrawals from storage in California this winter. This backed out interstate transport into California. But importantly, we see signs of increased throughput in the Southwest with the beginnings of an economic recovery there.  So across the country, some ups and downs, but overall, flattish throughput. 
Also on EPNG, Slide 12 describes a meaningful new expansion project. This is to serve 2 new power gen plants in Mexico in the state of Sonora. EPNG will provide firm transportation, 185 a day on our mainline and lateral that extends to the Mexican border. From there, third parties will transport the gas to the plants. This service will start in 2013, and we'll spend $18 million to upgrade the lateral. It means over $30 million in annual revenue for EPNG, which had EBIT of just over $200 million last year as a point of reference. This is the first in what may be more opportunities to serve growing exports to Mexico. As Doug said, between EPNG and TGP, today we transport about 3/4 of the 1 B a day that is exported to Mexico. We and most consultants expect those exports to double over the next several years, as Mexico turns to gas-fired power gen and as Pemex emphasizes oil production over gas. 
EPNG is particularly well positioned for this business. So while EPNG remains the most challenged of our pipes, we see some tangible signs now of improving market demand long-term. 
Slide 13 summarizes our big slate of expansion projects that will complete this year. With FGT VII complete, the next one to go in service will be the second phase of the SNG expansion for Southern Company. It will go in service on June 1. It's on-time and likely will be under budget. As you may recall, this expansion serves a newly converted coal plant of Southern's. It's a 2,500-megawatt plant. 
Then, next comes Ruby. I'll take a minute here to add some color on current construction activities on Ruby. We are nearly 90% welded out. We have about 80 miles left to complete, all in the western end of the route. About half of this 80 miles is in western Nevada and half in Oregon. As we said on our last call, we largely shut down our Spread 5 in western Nevada in March and April for the sage grouse mating season. Just recently, we brought back the pipe gang there and have restarted welding activities. And when the mating season ends on May 15, we'll resume construction on those restricted areas. 
During April, we also pulled most of the crew's upper spreads in Oregon to let the right-of-way dry after a very wet weather in March. We're going back to work right now on that section. In the interim, we've completed most of the critical stream crossings in Oregon, which is a significant accomplishment. 
Outside of these areas that are on the western end, Ruby is very nearly complete. We expect to purge and pack the entire eastern portion of the pipe in May. Also, construction of the compressor stations is now over 90% complete, and commissioning is well underway at the big head station at Opal [ph]. 
So the finish line on Ruby is in sight. Now as we get back to work on the western end, we'll know more about our progress toward final completion by the time of our Analyst Day at the end of the month. 
After Ruby in the fourth quarter, we'll complete 2 more projects. The LNG terminal in Pascagoula and our TGP Line 300 project across Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Both of these are fully subscribed with long-term contracts. So by the end of the year, essentially all of the original $8 billion backlog will be complete. 
Our focus at the pipes remains very clear, it's to complete these projects successfully. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brent."

And I also plan to keep my comments fairly high level and focused on the quarter and then share more detail in New York on the 24th. After a strong finish to 2010, we're off to a great start so far this year in E&P. We continue to grow production, and the Haynesville core continues to perform very well on the gas side. And at the same time, oil [indiscernible] volumes are rising fast, up roughly 24% year-over-year, consistent with our increase in oil-directed CapEx. And even though we are seeing cost inflation in many aspects of our business, our teams have done a great job of mitigating most of those costs, including drilling, completion and production operations by continuing to increase operating efficiencies. We're actively advancing our Eagle Ford and Wolfcamp oil programs, and the news is good on both fronts. We've delineated our Eagle Ford central acreage, so we now know what we have there and the results have been at or above our models. 
Our early West Texas Wolfcamp drilling results are also encouraging. So far this year, we've drilled and completed 3 wells, which has told us a lot about our acreage. What seem like a big step out just last September is shaping up to be another core program for us. We're on a steep learning curve, but we still like what we see in the Wolfcamp. And going forward, we'll continue to utilize the same approach that's proven successful in the development of our Haynesville and our Eagle Ford Shale programs. 
So turning then to Slide 16. We are pleased with our Q1 production and operating cash cost results. Our production was $821 million equivalent per day for the quarter, which is up 5% from last year and 3% from the fourth quarter. Again, liquids were up 18% from Q1 of last year. 
Cash costs were down $0.03 to $1.85 and that's primarily driven by higher volumes. And while there's been a lot of recent discussion regarding inflation of drilling and completion cost, it's also a cost pressure on the operating expense side, so reduce in unit cash cost is a big win for us. 
We have a pretty good example of how we are overcoming service cost inflation on Slide 17. The example shown is a fully completed Haynesville well, which is our most mature shale program. We began the year with completed well cost of about $9 million, well below the $10-plus million level for many of our peers. Drilling cost began to rise, as we increased the average lateral links and as rig rates have increased, but we fought off those increases with a 3-day reduction in drilling time. 
On the completion side, while we have a dedicated frac crew, there's still some costs that are being passed through such as some of the pumping cost, fuel and other non-pressure pumping completion cost. To offset those increases, we were able to reduce the time it takes to complete the wells. We're now pumping up to 5 frac stages per day. And I believe that many others in the play would consider 3 to 4 in a day to be a good day. 
In addition to the cost savings, the improvement efficiency also results in one additional well coming on production each month, which also contributed to our Q4 and our Q1 production results. Overall, our asset and our operations team have done a great job of creating a continuous improvement culture and coming up with new ways to gain efficiencies across the board. 
Let's start with the Eagle Ford with an update on Slide 18. Doug shared an overview of what's taken place in the Eagle Ford. But to expand a little, we currently have 4 rigs working in the play. They're all in the central area in La Salle County, which is up from 2 that we started the year with. And we've now fully delineated our central position, so we are very much in the pilot phase in the northern areas. And as you'd expect, we don't have much activity planned in the dry gas area in the South. We're still treating the southern area as a call option on higher gas prices. And we're working hard to deliver the same kind of cost efficiencies here that we're delivering in the Haynesville. 
On Slide 19, we provide a few more details of the central area. And remember this area, we expect 75% of recoverable reserves to be oil. We drilled 30 wells here, and we drilled them across the block, as you can see from the green dots, so we're developing a very good understanding of the well performance and our acreage position. 
As we learn more, we think we'll have the opportunity to move to even denser space and perhaps 80 or 100 hundred acres versus the current 120-acre space. And we're piloting that concept this year. If we're proven right, then we'd expect to drill more wells in this area and significantly increase our recoverable resources. 
Our productive capacity is growing rapidly, and along with Mark and in the Midstream company, we are actively building in-field infrastructure, which will result in a step-up in production rates later this summer. 
We're pleased with our results today, and we'll definitely spend more time laying out our Eagle Ford story in a few weeks. 
So let's move on to the Wolfcamp. We've included a map on Slide 20. Last summer before we bid on the university lands, we drilled a pilot well in the eastern side of our position. That well provided us with subsurface core and log data that gave us confidence to spend $180 million on land and to get into the play early, at least in this part of the play. And so far this year, we drilled and completed 3 wells, which are shown as red stars on the map. And as you can see, they go across our entire acreage position that spans roughly 35 miles. And we'll show you more of the technical subsurface data in New York, but we found a very consistent high-quality Wolfcamp section across this area. We're in the early days of the program and much optimization work remains, but everything that we've seen confirms the view that we showed you back in November. 
At that time, we showed a single average well model across the acreage, but we'll likely start to discuss a couple of different models from east to west as we continue our appraisal drilling. But overall, the models will be in line with our average type well. 
We've added a second rig in Q1 and will likely stay at this level for the remainder of the year. One very important development since our last call is we've now finalized unitization agreements with the university land office, where we've created 4 drilling units on the acreage that we picked up last September. And what this means is instead of having a bunch of 640-acre section-size three-year term leases, we've now combined our leases to create groups of leases or units that we can hold by drilling for up to 7 years. Now forming these units is an example of the benefits of having all of our leases with a single co-development land owner. 
Turning to Slide 21. I can't resist including a little science. On the right-hand side of the chart is a picture of a whole core section from one of our wells. Now we normally think of shale as dense, silt or mudstone type of rock. But remember that we said that the Wolfcamp source rock in our lease area has high quartz and high carbonate content. So it has some of the same rock characteristics as conventional reservoirs. Now granted this is a significantly magnified view, but the back dark areas that you see are nice-looking pore spaces, pore spaces that can hold a lot of oil. And we see that kind of quality rock vertically up and down throughout the Wolfcamp shale section. 
On the upper left, we summarize our originally assumed Wolfcamp geologic and petrophysical parameters, and we've included the results so far from our first 4 wells on the right side of the table. All of the values in the table are for the entire Wolfcamp section. 
To date, we've only targeted the upper Wolfcamp, which is a little over half of the total thickness. And our published type curves and their future inventory only include the upper Wolfcamp section. All told, though, we are finding bigger section and more net pay. The average porosity is higher and the organic content is very good. So we have a very nice looking interval, which is also why we're seeing industry competing aggressively to get into this part of the play. 
We've included some early production stats on Slide 22. We've tested 4 wells. The 38-29-1H was our pilot well, which we're only able to frac with 7 stages over a 2,000-foot interval, but achieved -- but still achieved good initial test rates. We've been experimenting with lateral length and a number of frac stages, and our last 3 wells have all tested nearly 300 barrels per day plus the associated gas. And the great amount of gas in the oil has been positive. It's good news because it provides energy for more oil to be able to move to the pore spaces. But as we've discussed before, these wells also go on artificial lift almost immediately, and so more gas makes the pump selection a bit tricky. So pump design and a post-frac, flowback rates are also through the areas that we're optimizing.  We also have 2 wells nearing completion, shown on the bottom of the slide. One of them is a 7,000-foot lateral, and we plan to complete it with 24 frac stages. 
So I'll wrap up on Slide 23. While it's admittedly early days for the Wolfcamp program, and we still have a lot to learn, we're encouraged by the results of our pilot wells. The highest value items that we'll be optimizing include lateral links, the density or frequency of the frac stages, the artificial lift options, optimal initial producing rates and the facility design. And we are also considering drilling a vertical well this year to test the entire Wolfcamp section, including that lower portion. 
So I've covered a lot of high points for the quarter this morning, and I'll expand all of these discussions further on the 24th. But again, we're pleased with our execution so far this year in the way that our programs are advancing. And then I'll now turn the call back to Doug for closing comments."

The cost of that at a midpoint of the range that we've given you in the model before. So I think the lateral length is part of what we are optimizing with a number of fracs, and I don't think we'll necessarily see a degradation and the value will likely go up because we're going to get incremental oil per stage, we think, and we're going to get a good test to that with that 7,000-foot lateral and 24-stage frac. So I think we'll be optimizing and trying to find the best value proposition, but I think it will go up as as we increase the lateral lengths not down."

One thing, Carl, that spread again, we don't want to declare victor after the first quarter, but what we've seen so far is we're holding the line against service cost inflation.

Before we begin the call this morning, I'd like to reach out to all of our employees, their families, our customers and our neighbors in Alabama. Our thoughts and prayers are with you as you begin the recovery process following the recent horrific storms. El Paso and our employees are supporting Red Cross relief efforts and will continue to do so. Now for our first quarter results. 
We are delighted to have another good quarter in the books. The momentum we felt at year end has continued through the first quarter, and we hope to show evidence of that this morning and again on May 24 at our Analyst Day in New York. J.R. will go over our financial results in some detail, but let me say here that we are ahead of our own internal plan in virtually every financial area. The E&P team continues to hit on all cylinders, with volumes ahead of plan, unit cost coming down and inflation being kept in check with continuing efficiency gains. 
We announced earlier this quarter that after a lengthy process, we've decided to go it alone on our Eagle Ford acreage. We had a fulsome process and received quality bids. In the end, however, our judgment was that the highest return outcome for our shareholders was to hold this acreage and develop it ourselves at our pace. 
As we've matured our activity there, we've gained confidence that this is the kind of high-quality, repeatable resource that fits our strategy to a tee. As this occurred and we derisked the acreage, its value went up. And given current and anticipated commodity prices, we felt that the value of this high-quality liquids inventory was key to our ongoing E&P story. We'll give you a full update on the impacts of this decision to our overall plan for 2011 at our Analyst Day later this month, but the news will be good. 
Brent will talk in more detail about another exciting oil-related story, the Wolfcamp. But the short story is that we're extremely pleased with what we see on our own, as well as on offset acreage. We're still early, but we know enough already to know we will be drilling in the Wolfcamp for a very long time. With prices at the most recent university land sale having more than doubled since our entry less than a year ago, others apparently share that opinion. 
In the pipes, we continue to make progress in putting into service the balance of an $8 million backlog or growth projects. During the quarter, FGT Phase VIII went into service on time and on budget. The second phase of the SNG expansion will go into service June 1. And Jim will provide an update on activities at Ruby where we expect to go in service in July. 
Out West, EPNG has been our most challenging pipeline, given that it serves the Arizona and California markets, which have been particularly hard hit during the recent recession. We've alluded in the past to the potential for expansion at EPNG to serve new utility load in Mexico. We've now brought the first of those expansions to fruition with a project to serve 2 new power gen plants in the state of Sonora. This represents 185 million cubic feet a day of incremental firm transport on EPNG, a significant addition to loads on this pipe. And given that between TGP and EPNG we now provide 75% of the transport into Mexico, we expect to compete very favorably for any additional load going forward. This is a great piece of business and a big win for our team out West. 
While we don't have a report on our Midstream efforts today, I will say that we are very encouraged by recent announcements by Dow Chemical, Chevron Phillips Chemical and Westlake Chemical about their expansion plans, primarily on the Gulf Coast. Others have estimated that this could result in an additional demand in the Gulf Coast of over 250,000 barrels a day of ethane. This means that the Gulf Coast will continue to be the demand center for ethane. We believe our MEPS project is best positioned to move the large volumes of ethane produced from the Marcellus to the Gulf Coast, and we continue to work closely with our customers to get this one over the finish line. 
Finally, we completed our first MLP drop of the year in the first quarter, continuing a string of successful drop downs, with EPB issuing more than $450 million of new equity. As in the past, we continue to target MLP proceeds to improving our balance sheet strength, as we march toward investment grade. 
With that, I'll turn it over to J.R. to review our financial results for the quarter, and I'll come back at the end to wrap up."

As Doug just mentioned, we are off to a good start this year. So that makes my job this morning pretty straightforward. After highlighting our latest drop down to the MLP, I'll provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter and close with an update on our hedge positions. 
We completed yet another drop down to El Paso Pipeline Partners during the quarter, our first for 2011 and sixth since our IPO, raising $667 million of cash proceeds. Consistent with our stated strategy, we are using the proceeds to reduce debt at El Paso Corp. 
Continued balance sheet improvement remains a top priority for us. That means you should expect more of the same, as we move throughout the year. Although not mentioned in my slides this morning, we also converted our 4.99% preferred into about 58 million shares of El Paso common stock during the quarter. Now this action further demonstrates our commitment to the balance sheet and moves us closer to our goal of achieving an investment grade profile. Now the conversion does not have an impact on our previously announced 2011 earnings per share guidance. 
Moving to Slide 6. We reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.30 for the quarter, which was slightly below last year. Operational performance in the business units was offset by higher aggregate financing costs attributable to the pipeline expansion projects, namely Ruby. Our effective tax rate for the quarter on a GAAP basis was about 12%, driven by the resolution of several tax matters, as well as earned state tax credits related to recently completed capital projects. Now excluding these items, our effective rate would've been 22% for the quarter. Now our rate will remain well below the statutory rate of 35% and lower than 2010 due to the growth of earnings attributable to non-controlling interests, as we continue to drop more assets into the El Paso Pipeline Partners. 
Adjusted segment EBIT was essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, as increases in the Pipeline Group were offset by declines in E&P. In the pipes, higher revenues from the expansion projects placed in service, as well as an increase in allowance for funds used during construction related to Ruby were partially offset by lower revenues in our EPNG system. 
In E&P, declines from lower realized natural gas prices and a higher DD&A rate were partially offset by a 5% increase in equivalent production volumes, as well as higher crude oil prices. Now despite the lower earnings, E&P posted strong operational results, as Brett will discuss in a few minutes. 
And as we talked about back in our January guidance call, we're reporting business segment results using a new measure this year that excludes non-controlling interests from EBIT and EBITDA. Now remember, this change only impacted the Pipeline Group, and we've adjusted our 2010 measures to conform to the new presentation. 
So let's turn to operating cash flow and capital investment on Slide 7. We're essentially on track or even slightly ahead of where we expected to be at the end of the quarter. Cash flow from operations for the quarter exceeded the prior year due primarily to higher E&P cash flows and positive working capital changes. On the capital slide, you see the ramp up in pipeline spending from last year, as we progress through the final phases of several expansion projects, most notably our Ruby Pipeline. The first quarter capital level for the pipelines is expected to be the peak as our spending declines in subsequent quarters, as we near the completion of the original $8 billion expansion backlog. 
In our E&P business, spending was up for the quarter, reflecting higher horizontal drilling and completion activity in our core areas in 2011. On Slide 8, I'll close out my comments with an update on our hedge position. 
During the quarter, we added a bit to these positions. And as you can see, we are well protected from the risks of low natural gas prices in 2011, with 80% of our gas hedged at an average price of $5.78, well above current market prices. We also have nearly half of our 2012 natural gas production hedged at about $6.
And while the near-term gas price environment remains difficult to predict, we are pleased that our hedge positions will provide a level of stability to our cash flows, as we execute our business plans. In fact, since the end of the quarter, we've been able to add some very attractive oil positions that I'll share with you at our May 24 Analyst Day. 
So that's my update for you this morning. I'm very happy with our strong start to 2011, and look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim."

As J.R. showed, the pipes financials for the quarter reflect our expansion mode, very nice EBIT growth and big CapEx spend. And this year, we're continuing to complete more expansions, 5 additional projects enter service this year. The first one, as Doug said, the FGT Phase VIII expansion, was completed on budget and on-time on April 1. It's a big one, over $2.4 billion of CapEx, 800 a day of additional capacity increasing FGT's capacity into Florida by over 1/3. 
On the business development front, also as Doug said, we've just signed an agreement for EPNG to supply new power plants in Mexico. I'll review this project. Generally, it demonstrates the expected increase in exports to Mexico is happening and EPNG is well situated to capitalize on this trend. 
Slide 11 summarizes throughput trends for the first quarter versus last year. Overall, flat year-to-date. On the individual pipes, throughput was heavily influenced by weather. On our eastern pipes, significantly colder weather in the Northeast this year benefited TGP. TGP's throughput was at a record high. And in the Southeast, more normal winter temperatures after a very cold early 2010, resulted in lower throughput on SNG. 
Other than weather, on our recent pipes, a couple of recent trends continue. One, is that TGP continues to benefit from Marcellus production. Marcellus receipts into TGP are now 1.3 Bs a day, up from 1/2 B a day at this time last year. About 2/3 of all Marcellus production in Pennsylvania is flowing into TGP. As you know, we have $1 billion of expansion projects in process in Northeast Pennsylvania. They will significantly increase our takeaway capacity to help keep up with Marcellus production growth. 
Another trend also on SNG, note that despite the more normal winter weather, power gen loads increased up over 10% continuing a trend that we've now seen for the last couple of years. 
On our Rockies pipes, throughput decreased, generally WIC and Cheyenne Plains volumes were down due to slightly lower Rockies production and lower overall exports out of the region. CIG was also impacted by this, but much colder weather along the front range helped to offset it. 
Finally, on EPNG, throughput was down mostly due to higher withdrawals from storage in California this 
winter. This backed out interstate transport into California. But importantly, we see signs of increased throughput in the Southwest with the beginnings of an economic recovery there.  
So across the country, some ups and downs, but overall, flattish throughput. 
Also on EPNG, Slide 12 describes a meaningful new expansion project. This is to serve 2 new power gen plants in Mexico in the state of Sonora. EPNG will provide firm transportation, 185 a day, on our mainline and lateral that extends to the Mexican border. From there, third parties will transport the gas to the plants. This service will start in 2013, and we'll spend $18 million to upgrade the lateral. It means over $30 million in annual revenue for EPNG, which had EBIT of just over $200 million last year as a point of reference. 
This is the first in what may be more opportunities to serve growing exports to Mexico. As Doug said, between EPNG and TGP, today we transport about 3/4 of the 1 B a day that is exported to Mexico. We and most consultants expect those exports to double over the next several years, as Mexico turns to gas-fired power gen and as Pemex emphasizes oil production over gas. 
EPNG is particularly well positioned for this business. So while EPNG remains the most challenged of our pipes, we see some tangible signs now of improving market demand long-term. 
Slide 13 summarizes our big slate of expansion projects that will complete this year. With FGT VIII complete, the next one to go in service will be the second phase of the SNG expansion for Southern Company. It will go in service on June 1. It's on time and likely will be under budget. As you may recall, this expansion serves a newly converted coal plant of Southern's. It's a 2,500-megawatt plant. 
Then, next comes Ruby. I'll take a minute here to add some color on current construction activities on Ruby. We are nearly 90% welded out. We have about 80 miles left to complete, all in the western end of the route. About half of this 80 miles is in Western Nevada and half in Oregon. As we said on our last call, we largely shut down our Spread 5 in Western Nevada in March and April for the sage grouse mating season. Just recently, we brought back the pipe gang there and have restarted welding activities. And when the mating season ends on May 15, we'll resume construction on those restricted areas. 
During April, we also pulled most of the crews off our spreads in Oregon to let the right-of-way dry after a very wet weather in March. We're going back to work right now on that section. In the interim, we've completed most of the critical stream crossings in Oregon, which is a significant accomplishment. 
Outside of these areas that are on the western end, Ruby is very nearly complete. We expect to purge and pack the entire eastern portion of the pipe in May. Also, construction of the compressor stations is now over 90% complete, and commissioning is well underway at the Big Head Station at Opal. 
So the finish line on Ruby is in sight. Now as we get back to work on the western end, we'll know more about our progress toward final completion by the time of our Analyst Day at the end of the month. 
After Ruby, in the fourth quarter we'll complete 2 more projects. The LNG terminal in Pascagoula and our TGP Line 300 project across Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Both of these are fully subscribed with long-term contracts. So by the end of the year, essentially all of the original $8 billion backlog will be complete. 
Our focus at the pipes remains very clear, it's to complete these projects successfully. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brent."

I'll begin today on Slide 15. And I also plan to keep my comments fairly high level and focused on the quarter, and then share more detail in New York on the 24th.

And I also plan to keep my comments fairly high level and focused on the quarter, and then share more detail in New York on the 24th. 
After a strong finish to 2010, we're off to a great start so far this year in E&P. We continue to grow production, and the Haynesville core continues to perform very well on the gas side. And at the same time, oil and condensate volumes are rising fast, up roughly 24% year-over-year, consistent with our increase in oil-directed CapEx. And even though we are seeing cost inflation in many aspects of our business, our teams have done a great job of mitigating most of those costs, including drilling, completion and production operations by continuing to increase operating efficiencies. We're actively advancing our Eagle Ford and Wolfcamp oil programs, and the news is good on both fronts. We've delineated our Eagle Ford central acreage, so we now know what we have there, and the results have been at or above our models. 
Our early West Texas Wolfcamp drilling results are also encouraging. So far this year, we've drilled and completed 3 wells, which has told us a lot about our acreage. What seemed like a big step out just last September is shaping up to be another core program for us. We're on a steep learning curve, but we still like what we see in the Wolfcamp. And going forward, we'll continue to utilize the same approach that's proven successful in the development of our Haynesville and our Eagle Ford Shale programs. 
So turning then to Slide 16. We are pleased with our Q1 production and operating cash cost results. Our production was $821 million equivalent per day for the quarter, which is up 5% from last year and 3% from the fourth quarter. Again, liquids were up 18% from Q1 of last year. 
Cash costs were down $0.03 to $1.85, and that's primarily driven by higher volumes. And while there's been a lot of recent discussion regarding inflation of drilling and completion cost, it's also a cost pressure on the operating expense side, so reduce in unit cash cost is a big win for us. 
We have a pretty good example of how we are overcoming service cost inflation on Slide 17. The example shown is a fully completed Haynesville well, which is our most mature shale program. We began the year with completed well cost of about $9 million, well below the $10-plus million level for many of our peers. Drilling cost began to rise, as we increased the average lateral links and as rig rates have increased, but we fought off those increases with a 3-day reduction in drilling time. 
On the completion side, while we have a dedicated frac crew, there's still some costs that are being passed through such as some of the pumping cost, fuel and other non-pressure pumping completion cost. To offset those increases, we were able to reduce the time it takes to complete the wells. We're now pumping up to 5 frac stages per day. And I believe that many others in the play would consider 3 to 4 in a day to be a good day. 
In addition to the cost savings, the improvement efficiency also results in one additional well coming on production each month, which also contributed to our Q4 and our Q1 production results. Overall, our asset and our operations teams have done a great job of creating a continuous improvement culture and coming up with new ways to gain efficiencies across the board. 
Let's turn to the Eagle Ford on a -- with an update on Slide 18. Doug shared an overview of what's taken place in the Eagle Ford. But to expand a little, we currently have 4 rigs working in the play. They're all in the central area in La Salle County, which is up from 2 that we started the year with. And we've now fully delineated our central position, so we are very much in the pilot phase in the northern areas. And as you'd expect, we don't have much activity planned in the dry gas area in the South. We're still treating the southern area as a call option on higher gas prices. And we're working hard to deliver the same kind of cost efficiencies here that we're delivering in the Haynesville. 
On Slide 19, we provide a few more details of the central area. And remember this area, we expect 75% of recoverable reserves to be oil. We drilled 30 wells here, and we drilled them across the block, as you can see from the green dots, so we're developing a very good understanding of the well performance and our acreage position. 
As we learn more, we think we'll have the opportunity to move to even denser space and perhaps 80 or 100 hundred acres versus the current 120-acre space. And we're piloting that concept this year. If we're proven right, then we'd expect to drill more wells in this area and significantly increase our recoverable resources. 
Our productive capacity is growing rapidly, and along with Mark and in the Midstream company, we are actively building in-field infrastructure, which will result in a step-up in production rates later this summer. 
We're pleased with our results today, and we'll definitely spend more time laying out our Eagle Ford story in a few weeks. 
So let's move on to the Wolfcamp. We've included a map on Slide 20. Last summer before we bid on the university lands, we drilled a pilot well in the eastern side of our position. That well provided us with subsurface core and log data that gave us confidence to spend $180 million on land and to get into the play early, at least in this part of the play. And so far this year, we drilled and completed 3 wells, which are shown as red stars on the map. And as you can see, as you go across -- they go across our entire acreage position that spans roughly 35 miles. And we'll show you more of the technical subsurface data in New York, but we found a very consistent high-quality Wolfcamp section across this area. We're in the early days of the program and much optimization work remains, but everything that we've seen confirms the view that we showed you back in November. 
At that time, we showed a single average well model across the acreage, but we'll likely start to discuss a couple of different models from east to west as we continue our appraisal drilling. But overall, the models will be in line with our average type well. 
We've added a second rig in Q1 and will likely stay at this level for the remainder of the year. One very important development since our last call is we've now finalized unitization agreements with the university land office, where we've created 4 drilling units on the acreage that we picked up last September. And what this means is, instead of having a bunch of 640-acre section-size three-year term leases, we've now combined our leases to create groups of leases or units that we can hold by drilling for up to 7 years. Now forming these units is an example of the benefits of having all of our leases with a single co-development land owner. 
Turning to Slide 21. I can't resist including a little science. On the right-hand side of the chart is a picture of a whole core section from one of our wells. Now we normally think of shale as dense, silt or mudstone type of rock. But remember that we said that the Wolfcamp source rock in our lease area has high quartz and high carbonate content. So it has some of the same rock characteristics as conventional reservoirs. Now granted this is a significantly magnified view, but the black dark areas that you see are nice-looking pore spaces, pore spaces that can hold a lot of oil. And we see that kind of quality rock vertically up and down throughout the Wolfcamp shale section. 
On the upper left, we summarize our originally assumed Wolfcamp geologic and petrophysical parameters, and we've included the results so far from our first 4 wells on the right side of the table. All of the values in the table are for the entire Wolfcamp section. 
To date, we've only targeted the upper Wolfcamp, which is a little over half of the total thickness. And our published type curves and their future inventory only include the upper Wolfcamp section. All told, though, we are finding thicker sections and more net pay. The average porosity is higher and the organic content is very good. So we have a very nice looking interval, which is also why we see an industry competing aggressively to get into this part of the play. 
We've included some early production stats on Slide 22. We've tested 4 wells. The 38-29-1H was our pilot well, which we're only able to frac with 7 stages over a 2,000-foot interval, but achieved -- it still achieved good initial test rates. We've been experimenting with lateral length and a number of frac stages, and our last 3 wells have all tested nearly 300 barrels per day plus the associated gas. And the greater amount of gas in the oil has been positive. It's good news because it provides energy for more oil to be able to move to the pore spaces. But as we've discussed before, these wells also go on artificial lift almost immediately, and so more gas makes the pump selection a bit tricky. So pump design and a post-frac, flowback rates are also through the areas that we're optimizing.  We also have 2 wells nearing completion, shown on the bottom of the slide. One of them is a 7,000-foot lateral, and we plan to complete it with 24 frac stages. 
So I'll wrap up on Slide 23. While it's admittedly early days for the Wolfcamp program, and we still have a lot to learn, we're encouraged by the results of our pilot wells. The highest value items that we'll be optimizing include lateral links, the density or frequency of the frac stages, the artificial lift options, optimal initial producing rates and the facility design. And we are also considering drilling a vertical well this year to test the entire Wolfcamp section, including that lower portion. 
So I've covered a lot of high points for the quarter this morning, and I'll expand all of these discussions further on the 24th. But again, we're pleased with our execution so far this year and the way that our programs are advancing. And I'll now turn the call back to Doug for closing comments."

All this means that we're very excited about what we can accomplish this year. We are looking forward to being with all of you in New York later this month, where we intend to take a deeper dive into each of our 3 businesses, update our guidance for the year, and lay out the long-term strategy for the company at what is one of the most exciting points in our history.

And cost are right at a midpoint of the range that we've given you in the model before. So I think the lateral length is part of what we are optimizing with a number of fracs, and I don't think we'll necessarily see a degradation in the value, it will likely go up because we're going to get incremental oil per stage, we think, and we're going to get a good test to that with that 7,000-foot lateral and 24-stage frac. So I think we'll be optimizing and trying to find the best value proposition, but I think it will go up as we increase the lateral lengths, not down."

And that's where we'll be going into detail on the 24th. The short answer, I think that's going to be good news. If I could just add one thing, Carl, that the spread again, that we don't want to declare victor after the first quarter, but what we've seen so far is we're holding the line against service cost inflation. So if we do increase capital, it will be activity-driven, not necessarily -- not a response to higher cost.

Before we begin the call this morning, I'd like to reach out to all of our employees, their families, our customers and our neighbors in Alabama. Our thoughts and prayers are with you as you begin the recovery process following the recent horrific storms. El Paso and our employees are supporting Red Cross relief efforts and will continue to do so. Now for our first quarter results. 
We are delighted to have another good quarter in the books. The momentum we felt at year end has continued through the first quarter, and we hope to show evidence of that this morning and again on May 24 at our Analyst Day in New York. J.R. will go over our financial results in some detail, but let me say here that we are ahead of our own internal plan in virtually every financial area. The E&P team continues to hit on all cylinders, with volumes ahead of plan, unit cost coming down and inflation being kept in check with continuing efficiency gains. 
We announced earlier this quarter that after a lengthy process, we've decided to go it alone on our Eagle Ford acreage. We had a fulsome process and received quality bids. In the end, however, our judgment was that the highest return outcome for our shareholders was to hold this acreage and develop it ourselves at our pace. 
As we've matured our activity there, we've gained confidence that this is the kind of high-quality, repeatable resource that fits our strategy to a tee. As this occurred and we derisked the acreage, its value went up. And given current and anticipated commodity prices, we felt that the value of this high-quality liquids inventory was key to our ongoing E&P story. We'll give you a full update on the impacts of this decision to our overall plan for 2011 at our Analyst Day later this month, but the news will be good. 
Brent will talk in more detail about another exciting oil-related story, the Wolfcamp. But the short story is that we're extremely pleased with what we see on our own, as well as on offset acreage. We're still early, but we know enough already to know we will be drilling in the Wolfcamp for a very long time. With prices at the most recent university land sale having more than doubled since our entry less than a year ago, others apparently share that opinion. 
In the pipes, we continue to make progress in putting into service the balance of an $8 million backlog or growth projects. During the quarter, FGT Phase VIII went into service on time and on budget. The second phase of the SNG expansion will go into service June 1. And Jim will provide an update on activities at Ruby where we expect to go in service in July. 
Out West, EPNG has been our most challenging pipeline, given that it serves the Arizona and California markets, which have been particularly hard hit during the recent recession. We've alluded in the past to the potential for expansion at EPNG to serve new utility load in Mexico. We've now brought the first of those expansions to fruition with a project to serve 2 new power gen plants in the state of Sonora. This represents 185 million cubic feet a day of incremental firm transport on EPNG, a significant addition to loads on this pipe. And given that between TGP and EPNG we now provide 75% of the transport into Mexico, we expect to compete very favorably for any additional load going forward. This is a great piece of business and a big win for our team out West. 
While we don't have a report on our Midstream efforts today, I will say that we are very encouraged by recent announcements by Dow Chemical, Chevron Phillips Chemical and Westlake Chemical about their expansion plans, primarily on the Gulf Coast. Others have estimated that this could result in an additional demand in the Gulf Coast of over 250,000 barrels a day of ethane. This means that the Gulf Coast will continue to be the demand center for ethane. We believe our MEPS project is best positioned to move the large volumes of ethane produced from the Marcellus to the Gulf Coast, and we continue to work closely with our customers to get this one over the finish line. 
Finally, we completed our first MLP drop of the year in the first quarter, continuing a string of successful drop downs, with EPB issuing more than $450 million of new equity. As in the past, we continue to target MLP proceeds to improving our balance sheet strength, as we march toward investment grade. 
With that, I'll turn it over to J.R. to review our financial results for the quarter, and I'll come back at the end to wrap up."

As Doug just mentioned, we are off to a good start this year. So that makes my job this morning pretty straightforward. After highlighting our latest drop down to the MLP, I'll provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter and close with an update on our hedge positions. 
We completed yet another drop down to El Paso Pipeline Partners during the quarter, our first for 2011 and sixth since our IPO, raising $667 million of cash proceeds. Consistent with our stated strategy, we are using the proceeds to reduce debt at El Paso Corp. 
Continued balance sheet improvement remains a top priority for us. That means you should expect more of the same, as we move throughout the year. Although not mentioned in my slides this morning, we also converted our 4.99% preferred into about 58 million shares of El Paso common stock during the quarter. Now this action further demonstrates our commitment to the balance sheet and moves us closer to our goal of achieving an investment grade profile. Now the conversion does not have an impact on our previously announced 2011 earnings per share guidance. 
Moving to Slide 6. We reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.30 for the quarter, which was slightly below last year. Operational performance in the business units was offset by higher aggregate financing costs attributable to the pipeline expansion projects, namely Ruby. Our effective tax rate for the quarter on a GAAP basis was about 12%, driven by the resolution of several tax matters, as well as earned state tax credits related to recently completed capital projects. Now excluding these items, our effective rate would've been 22% for the quarter. Now our rate will remain well below the statutory rate of 35% and lower than 2010 due to the growth of earnings attributable to non-controlling interests, as we continue to drop more assets into the El Paso Pipeline Partners. 
Adjusted segment EBIT was essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, as increases in the Pipeline Group were offset by declines in E&P. In the pipes, higher revenues from the expansion projects placed in service, as well as an increase in allowance for funds used during construction related to Ruby were partially offset by lower revenues in our EPNG system. 
In E&P, declines from lower realized natural gas prices and a higher DD&A rate were partially offset by a 5% increase in equivalent production volumes, as well as higher crude oil prices. Now despite the lower earnings, E&P posted strong operational results, as Brett will discuss in a few minutes. 
And as we talked about back in our January guidance call, we're reporting business segment results using a new measure this year that excludes non-controlling interests from EBIT and EBITDA. Now remember, this change only impacted the Pipeline Group, and we've adjusted our 2010 measures to conform to the new presentation. 
So let's turn to operating cash flow and capital investment on Slide 7. We're essentially on track or even slightly ahead of where we expected to be at the end of the quarter. Cash flow from operations for the quarter exceeded the prior year due primarily to higher E&P cash flows and positive working capital changes. On the capital slide, you see the ramp up in pipeline spending from last year, as we progress through the final phases of several expansion projects, most notably our Ruby Pipeline. The first quarter capital level for the pipelines is expected to be the peak as our spending declines in subsequent quarters, as we near the completion of the original $8 billion expansion backlog. 
In our E&P business, spending was up for the quarter, reflecting higher horizontal drilling and completion activity in our core areas in 2011. On Slide 8, I'll close out my comments with an update on our hedge position. 
During the quarter, we added a bit to these positions. And as you can see, we are well protected from the risks of low natural gas prices in 2011, with 80% of our gas hedged at an average price of $5.78, well above current market prices. We also have nearly half of our 2012 natural gas production hedged at about $6.
And while the near-term gas price environment remains difficult to predict, we are pleased that our hedge positions will provide a level of stability to our cash flows, as we execute our business plans. In fact, since the end of the quarter, we've been able to add some very attractive oil positions that I'll share with you at our May 24 Analyst Day. 
So that's my update for you this morning. I'm very happy with our strong start to 2011, and look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim."

As J.R. showed, the pipes financials for the quarter reflect our expansion mode, very nice EBIT growth and big CapEx spend. And this year, we're continuing to complete more expansions, 5 additional projects enter service this year. The first one, as Doug said, the FGT Phase VIII expansion, was completed on budget and on-time on April 1. It's a big one, over $2.4 billion of CapEx, 800 a day of additional capacity increasing FGT's capacity into Florida by over 1/3. 
On the business development front, also as Doug said, we've just signed an agreement for EPNG to supply new power plants in Mexico. I'll review this project. Generally, it demonstrates the expected increase in exports to Mexico is happening and EPNG is well situated to capitalize on this trend. 
Slide 11 summarizes throughput trends for the first quarter versus last year. Overall, flat year-to-date. On the individual pipes, throughput was heavily influenced by weather. On our eastern pipes, significantly colder weather in the Northeast this year benefited TGP. TGP's throughput was at a record high. And in the Southeast, more normal winter temperatures after a very cold early 2010, resulted in lower throughput on SNG. 
Other than weather, on our recent pipes, a couple of recent trends continue. One, is that TGP continues to benefit from Marcellus production. Marcellus receipts into TGP are now 1.3 Bs a day, up from 1/2 B a day at this time last year. About 2/3 of all Marcellus production in Pennsylvania is flowing into TGP. As you know, we have $1 billion of expansion projects in process in Northeast Pennsylvania. They will significantly increase our takeaway capacity to help keep up with Marcellus production growth. 
Another trend also on SNG, note that despite the more normal winter weather, power gen loads increased up over 10% continuing a trend that we've now seen for the last couple of years. 
On our Rockies pipes, throughput decreased, generally WIC and Cheyenne Plains volumes were down due to slightly lower Rockies production and lower overall exports out of the region. CIG was also impacted by this, but much colder weather along the Front Range helped to offset it. 
Finally, on EPNG, throughput was down mostly due to higher withdrawals from storage in California this 
winter. This backed out interstate transport into California. But importantly, we see signs of increased throughput in the Southwest with the beginnings of an economic recovery there.  
So across the country, some ups and downs, but overall, flattish throughput. 
Also on EPNG, Slide 12 describes a meaningful new expansion project. This is to serve 2 new power gen plants in Mexico in the state of Sonora. EPNG will provide firm transportation, 185 a day, on our mainline and lateral that extends to the Mexican border. From there, third parties will transport the gas to the plants. This service will start in 2013, and we'll spend $18 million to upgrade the lateral. It means over $30 million in annual revenue for EPNG, which had EBIT of just over $200 million last year as a point of reference. 
This is the first in what may be more opportunities to serve growing exports to Mexico. As Doug said, between EPNG and TGP, today we transport about 3/4 of the 1 B a day that is exported to Mexico. We and most consultants expect those exports to double over the next several years, as Mexico turns to gas-fired power gen and as Pemex emphasizes oil production over gas. 
EPNG is particularly well positioned for this business. So while EPNG remains the most challenged of our pipes, we see some tangible signs now of improving market demand long-term. 
Slide 13 summarizes our big slate of expansion projects that will complete this year. With FGT VIII complete, the next one to go in service will be the second phase of the SNG expansion for Southern Company. It will go in service on June 1. It's on time and likely will be under budget. As you may recall, this expansion serves a newly converted coal plant of Southern's. It's a 2,500-megawatt plant. 
Then, next comes Ruby. I'll take a minute here to add some color on current construction activities on Ruby. We are nearly 90% welded out. We have about 80 miles left to complete, all in the western end of the route. About half of this 80 miles is in Western Nevada and half in Oregon. As we said on our last call, we largely shut down our Spread 5 in Western Nevada in March and April for the sage grouse mating season. Just recently, we brought back the pipe gang there and have restarted welding activities. And when the mating season ends on May 15, we'll resume construction on those restricted areas. 
During April, we also pulled most of the crews off our spreads in Oregon to let the right-of-way dry after a very wet weather in March. We're going back to work right now on that section. In the interim, we've completed most of the critical stream crossings in Oregon, which is a significant accomplishment. 
Outside of these areas that are on the western end, Ruby is very nearly complete. We expect to purge and pack the entire eastern portion of the pipe in May. Also, construction of the compressor stations is now over 90% complete, and commissioning is well underway at the Big Head Station at Opal. 
So the finish line on Ruby is in sight. Now as we get back to work on the western end, we'll know more about our progress toward final completion by the time of our Analyst Day at the end of the month. 
After Ruby, in the fourth quarter we'll complete 2 more projects. The LNG terminal in Pascagoula and our TGP Line 300 project across Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Both of these are fully subscribed with long-term contracts. So by the end of the year, essentially all of the original $8 billion backlog will be complete. 
Our focus at the pipes remains very clear, it's to complete these projects successfully. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brent."

And I also plan to keep my comments fairly high level and focused on the quarter, and then share more detail in New York on the 24th. 
After a strong finish to 2010, we're off to a great start so far this year in E&P. We continue to grow production, and the Haynesville core continues to perform very well on the gas side. And at the same time, oil and condensate volumes are rising fast, up roughly 24% year-over-year, consistent with our increase in oil-directed CapEx. And even though we are seeing cost inflation in many aspects of our business, our teams have done a great job of mitigating most of those costs, including drilling, completion and production operations by continuing to increase operating efficiencies. We're actively advancing our Eagle Ford and Wolfcamp oil programs, and the news is good on both fronts. We've delineated our Eagle Ford central acreage, so we now know what we have there, and the results have been at or above our models. 
Our early West Texas Wolfcamp drilling results are also encouraging. So far this year, we've drilled and completed 3 wells, which has told us a lot about our acreage. What seemed like a big step out just last September is shaping up to be another core program for us. We're on a steep learning curve, but we still like what we see in the Wolfcamp. And going forward, we'll continue to utilize the same approach that's proven successful in the development of our Haynesville and our Eagle Ford Shale programs. 
So turning then to Slide 16. We are pleased with our Q1 production and operating cash cost results. Our production was $821 million equivalent per day for the quarter, which is up 5% from last year and 3% from the fourth quarter. Again, liquids were up 18% from Q1 of last year. 
Cash costs were down $0.03 to $1.85, and that's primarily driven by higher volumes. And while there's been a lot of recent discussion regarding inflation of drilling and completion cost, it's also a cost pressure on the operating expense side, so reduce in unit cash cost is a big win for us. 
We have a pretty good example of how we are overcoming service cost inflation on Slide 17. The example shown is a fully completed Haynesville well, which is our most mature shale program. We began the year with completed well cost of about $9 million, well below the $10-plus million level for many of our peers. Drilling cost began to rise, as we increased the average lateral links and as rig rates have increased, but we fought off those increases with a 3-day reduction in drilling time. 
On the completion side, while we have a dedicated frac crew, there's still some costs that are being passed through such as some of the pumping cost, fuel and other non-pressure pumping completion cost. To offset those increases, we were able to reduce the time it takes to complete the wells. We're now pumping up to 5 frac stages per day. And I believe that many others in the play would consider 3 to 4 in a day to be a good day. 
In addition to the cost savings, the improvement efficiency also results in one additional well coming on production each month, which also contributed to our Q4 and our Q1 production results. Overall, our asset and our operations teams have done a great job of creating a continuous improvement culture and coming up with new ways to gain efficiencies across the board. 
Let's turn to the Eagle Ford on a -- with an update on Slide 18. Doug shared an overview of what's taken place in the Eagle Ford. But to expand a little, we currently have 4 rigs working in the play. They're all in the central area in La Salle County, which is up from 2 that we started the year with. And we've now fully delineated our central position, so we are very much in the pilot phase in the northern areas. And as you'd expect, we don't have much activity planned in the dry gas area in the South. We're still treating the southern area as a call option on higher gas prices. And we're working hard to deliver the same kind of cost efficiencies here that we're delivering in the Haynesville. 
On Slide 19, we provide a few more details of the central area. And remember this area, we expect 75% of recoverable reserves to be oil. We drilled 30 wells here, and we drilled them across the block, as you can see from the green dots, so we're developing a very good understanding of the well performance and our acreage position. 
As we learn more, we think we'll have the opportunity to move to even denser space and perhaps 80 or 100 hundred acres versus the current 120-acre space. And we're piloting that concept this year. If we're proven right, then we'd expect to drill more wells in this area and significantly increase our recoverable resources. 
Our productive capacity is growing rapidly, and along with Mark and in the Midstream company, we are actively building in-field infrastructure, which will result in a step-up in production rates later this summer. 
We're pleased with our results today, and we'll definitely spend more time laying out our Eagle Ford story in a few weeks. 
So let's move on to the Wolfcamp. We've included a map on Slide 20. Last summer before we bid on the university lands, we drilled a pilot well in the eastern side of our position. That well provided us with subsurface core and log data that gave us confidence to spend $180 million on land and to get into the play early, at least in this part of the play. And so far this year, we drilled and completed 3 wells, which are shown as red stars on the map. And as you can see, as you go across -- they go across our entire acreage position that spans roughly 35 miles. And we'll show you more of the technical subsurface data in New York, but we found a very consistent high-quality Wolfcamp section across this area. We're in the early days of the program and much optimization work remains, but everything that we've seen confirms the view that we showed you back in November. 
At that time, we showed a single average well model across the acreage, but we'll likely start to discuss a couple of different models from east to west as we continue our appraisal drilling. But overall, the models will be in line with our average type well. 
We've added a second rig in Q1 and will likely stay at this level for the remainder of the year. One very important development since our last call is we've now finalized unitization agreements with the university land office, where we've created 4 drilling units on the acreage that we picked up last September. And what this means is, instead of having a bunch of 640-acre section-size three-year term leases, we've now combined our leases to create groups of leases or units that we can hold by drilling for up to 7 years. Now forming these units is an example of the benefits of having all of our leases with a single co-development land owner. 
Turning to Slide 21. I can't resist including a little science. On the right-hand side of the chart is a picture of a whole core section from one of our wells. Now we normally think of shale as dense, silt or mudstone type of rock. But remember that we said that the Wolfcamp source rock in our lease area has high quartz and high carbonate content. So it has some of the same rock characteristics as conventional reservoirs. Now granted this is a significantly magnified view, but the black dark areas that you see are nice-looking pore spaces, pore spaces that can hold a lot of oil. And we see that kind of quality rock vertically up and down throughout the Wolfcamp shale section. 
On the upper left, we summarize our originally assumed Wolfcamp geologic and petrophysical parameters, and we've included the results so far from our first 4 wells on the right side of the table. All of the values in the table are for the entire Wolfcamp section. 
To date, we've only targeted the upper Wolfcamp, which is a little over half of the total thickness. And our published type curves and their future inventory only include the upper Wolfcamp section. All told, though, we are finding thicker sections and more net pay. The average porosity is higher and the organic content is very good. So we have a very nice looking interval, which is also why we see an industry competing aggressively to get into this part of the play. 
We've included some early production stats on Slide 22. We've tested 4 wells. The 38-29-1H was our pilot well, which we're only able to frac with 7 stages over a 2,000-foot interval, but achieved -- it still achieved good initial test rates. We've been experimenting with lateral length and a number of frac stages, and our last 3 wells have all tested nearly 300 barrels per day plus the associated gas. And the greater amount of gas in the oil has been positive. It's good news because it provides energy for more oil to be able to move to the pore spaces. But as we've discussed before, these wells also go on artificial lift almost immediately, and so more gas makes the pump selection a bit tricky. So pump design and a post-frac, flowback rates are also through the areas that we're optimizing.  We also have 2 wells nearing completion, shown on the bottom of the slide. One of them is a 7,000-foot lateral, and we plan to complete it with 24 frac stages. 
So I'll wrap up on Slide 23. While it's admittedly early days for the Wolfcamp program, and we still have a lot to learn, we're encouraged by the results of our pilot wells. The highest value items that we'll be optimizing include lateral links, the density or frequency of the frac stages, the artificial lift options, optimal initial producing rates and the facility design. And we are also considering drilling a vertical well this year to test the entire Wolfcamp section, including that lower portion. 
So I've covered a lot of high points for the quarter this morning, and I'll expand all of these discussions further on the 24th. But again, we're pleased with our execution so far this year and the way that our programs are advancing. And I'll now turn the call back to Doug for closing comments."

So I think the lateral length is part of what we are optimizing with a number of fracs, and I don't think we'll necessarily see a degradation in the value, it will likely go up because we're going to get incremental oil per stage, we think, and we're going to get a good test to that with that 7,000-foot lateral and 24-stage frac.

So if we do increase capital, it will be activity-driven, not necessarily -- not a response to higher cost. We're managing those with some of the efficiency gains that we tried to highlight with that one Haynesville well here."

I intend to keep my comments very  brief this morning. We told you when we announced the separation of our E&P company back in May that we do 2 things, get the spin done by year end and not take our eye off the ball in terms of execution in all 3 businesses. I think we've done that, and we'll show you the evidence of today's call. We had a good second quarter. Earnings and cash flow were up and the business units performed well operationally. We moved much closer to completion of our $8 billion backlog of growth projects at the pipes, Ruby's now in service and our other 2011 projects are on track. 
In E&P, production is up, costs are down, and we continue to make progress in all 4 of our core areas. Midstream had a good quarter, and made meaningful progress in moving the Marcellus ethane pipeline project along for a very successful open system. And finally, we completed another drop to the MLP during the quarter, once again using the proceeds to accelerate our balance sheet improvement as we move toward the separation prior to the year.
On the separation front, we continue to make great progress. The management teams and boards for the 2 separate companies are now in place. We filed for our IRS tax ruling. We're very close to filing the Form 10. And we're completing the various required separation agreements. Each of these is in any critical path to the spin and each of them are on track. We're also moving towards finalization of the capital structures or what so all of this is to say that there are a lot of work streams going on internally, but all of them are pointed toward completion by year end, and we remain on track for completion as originally contemplated. One final note, before I turn over the J.R., as you can see on Slide 4, we've completed our review and established the board for the 2 companies post-spin climb the to report that we're able to populate both boards from existing El Paso board, and we believe will create 2 outstanding well-governed boards, a key prerequisite to each company's success going forward.

We had another active and very productive quarter as we continue to make great progress, both financially and operationally. Our progress to date in 2011 puts in good shape to meet our full year financial goals. I'll briefly cover the financial highlights for the quarter, starting on Slide 6, and then Jim and Brent will update you on our operational progress.
Now back in May at the Analyst Meeting in New York, we talked a lot the importance of our MLP drop-down strategy and how the success of the strategy contributed to our ability to pursue a strategic separation this year far sooner than we would've thought possible back at the beginning of 2010. I hope you would agree that we've kept the RPMs running high on our MLP, maintaining an accelerated pace of drop-down through El Paso Pipeline Partners. During the quarter, we completed another drop to the MLP, our second this year and seventh since our IPO. The transaction rate is nearly $750 million in cash for El Paso, bringing our year-to-date total to $1.4 billion, nearly $1 billion of which in new MLP equity capital.
We're using the cash to reduce El Paso corporate debt and hopefully you saw our press release last week announcing the early results of our most recent liability management program. And although the tender and companion Dutch option are still in progress, we're confident we'll complete the entire $750 million transaction, further accelerating our balance sheet impairment.
While not so much a stated goal for 2011, a key goal for the finance team was to refinance our 3 primary credit facilities in El Paso Corp., El Paso Pipeline Partners and El Paso Exploration and Production. We did just that during the quarter. The very successful transaction involving over 20 financial institutions participating across all 3 facilities. The maturity dates of our $3.25 billion in aggregate credit have now been extended to 2016. The new facilities provide significant flexibility and position all 3 companies to successfully pursue their individual growth strategies. 
Finally, with Ruby's successfully in commercial operation, we anticipate meeting the conditions and the financing agreements that will result in the $1.5 billion of project that becoming nonrecourse to El Paso in the next 60 to 90 days. 
So let's turn to page and run through the numbers beginning on Slide 7. We reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.25 per quarter compared to $0.22 last year.
Higher segment earnings before interest and taxes from our core businesses, lower interest expense, the lower effective tax rate contributed to the increase. Our effective tax rate for the quarter on a GAAP basis was 10%, reflecting the favorable impact from the resolution of certain tax matters. Excluding these items, our effective tax rate for the quarter would've been 14%. As highlighted on previous calls, you should expect our effective tax rate to remain lower than prior years as we continue to drop more and more assets into our MLP.
Adjusted segment EBIT was just up over 2% for the quarter driven by increases in both Pipelines and E&P. Adjusted segment EBIT for the Pipeline Group itself about 9% from year ago, reflecting completed expansion projects going into service, higher non-cash AFUDC, principally from Ruby, a benefit related to our customer selection not to continue with Phase B of our Elba III expansion project. In E&P adjusted segment EBIT was up slightly for the quarter as a result of higher production volumes in crude oil prices, offset by lower realized natural gas prices and higher D&A rate.
Turning to operating cash flow and capital investment on Slide 8. We remain on track with our 2011 guidance for both. Cash flow from operations for the 6 months was up 11% from last year due to higher E&P cash flows, while interest payments and positive working capital changes. On the capital side, you can see the Pipeline spending ramped up from last year with Ruby as the largest consumer of capital. We're also nearing completion on our TGP Line 300 project, as well as Gulf LNG, which Jim will update you on shortly.
Growth capital spending in the pipelines will continue to be decline in subsequent quarters this year as we beauty completion of the originally $8 billion backlog. I expect the Pipeline Group to transition from being a consumer to a provider of free cash flow beginning in the fourth quarter of this year. 
In our E&P business, spending was up for the quarter, reflecting higher activity levels in our Eagle Ford oil program. And Brent is going to give you an update in just a few minutes on our noncore asset divestitures, which will more than adequately fund the increase in the Eagle Ford drilling and completion capital we announced back in May. 
Now I'll wrap up with the usual update on our hedge program on Slide 9. We continue to have an advantage hedge position particularly for the remainder of 2011. We remain well protected from low natural gas prices for the balance of the year with 80% of our second half 2011 gas volumes hedged at an average price of $5.89, substantially above current market prices. We added on the margin to our 2011 positions since our May meeting but have made no changes through 2012. Our hedges had been a key contributor to our E&P financial success this year in the current low natural gas price environment while settlements adding $140 million to adjusted segment EBIT and operating cash flows this year. That's my update for you this morning. I'm proud of the progress to date in 2011 and look forward to updating you periodically the rest of the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for an update on the Pipeline Group."

Pipeline financials continue to reflect our expansion mode, a nice growth in EBIT some due to noncash AFUDC as J.R said, also substantial capital spend. The completion of Ruby was a major milestone for us, obviously. And we're well underway now to our completing our big state of growth projects scheduled for this year. In the fourth quarter, we'll complete our final 2 projects as planned. We settled the major rig case on CIG this quarter, with a very good settlement for both our customers and us. It extends customer contracts and that provides great certainty most likely for the next 5 years.
Separately, on the rate case front. As you know, we have rate is ongoing to both TGP and EPNG, I don't have much news on either of these and settle discussions at an early stage. Finally, as we said at the New York City Analyst Day, we continue to see meaningful, new pipeline growth opportunities centered mostly on gas-fired power gen and the new shale plays.
Slide 12 summarizes throughput trends of this year versus last. Overall, up 2% year-to-date. TGP is having a record year through put up 12%. A lot of this is due to increasing Marcellus production. Marcellus receipts into TGP are now 1.5 BCF a day, up for about 0.6 a year ago. And TGP hasn't had over 1 B a day of fully subscribed expansion on northeast Pennsylvania to be completed over the next 2 years. So we continue to get our share of ourselves growth and TGP is well positioned to further expand.
SNG throughput reflects more normal winter weather this year after a very cold early 2010. Our gen loads on SNG continue to increase each quarter, up 13% year-to-date. Throughput on our Rockies pipe is down this year due to slightly lower Rockies production and lower exports out of the region. On EPNG, as you know, EPNG is our most challenged pipe due to the pipeline overcapacity in the Southwest. Throughput this year had decreased mostly due to higher withdrawals from California storage fields this winter. This back our interstate transport into California. But on the positive side, we see signs of the beginnings of an economic recovery in the Southwest also as expected, increasing exports to Mexico.
So across the country, some significant ups, mostly on TGP, offset by downs, overall up 2%. The next 4 slides speak to our progress on the expansion front. As you know, completed these projects is our primary focus this year. 
Slide 13 shows that we've now completed 3 of the 5 projects planned for services this year. And since our last call, the second phase of the SNG expansion for Southern Company was completed under budget -- nearly 20% under budget. And of course, Ruby, completed last week. And more on Ruby on this slide. But before going there, when we finished the quarter projects this year, we would've substantially completed the original $8 billion growth backlog. In total, during the last 5 years, we have completed 19 projects within 7% to 8% of budget, a track record significant better than our industry peers. And x Ruby, the other 18 projects are right about it in total. Importantly, these projects are approximately 90% subscribed with long-term contracts, so they will generate highly predicable cash flow.
On Ruby. We're in service and flowing gas for customers. In its first few days of August, Ruby has been flowing between 400 and 480 a day. Our results on Ruby construction. It was completed 4 months later than we original planned back in 2008. And it would be 23% over budget at our projected completion cost of approximately $3.65 billion. The general reasons for this has been well-documented, significant, permanent challenges, building through a wet winter and dealing with various fishing habitat or nesting issues. 
our project to take a minute to give a little bit more flavor for the scale and complexity of this construction project. Ruby is the largest U.S. natural gas pipeline project since the REX Pipeline at $6.8 billion. It was completed in 2009. And here are a few stats for you on Ruby. Before beginning construction, it took a whole 2.5 years to move Ruby for review process with BLM, FERC and the various local state and local agencies. At peak construction, nearly 5,300 people are working on Ruby. Pipe was produced in India, Arkansas, the Gulf Coast and France. It was moved the West in 110-unit trains, each up to 1 mile long. Ruby was constructed at elevations up to a few hundred feet an image those up to 14%. rainfall was 50% greater than normal February through April this year. At one point, we had over 200 archaeologists in the field. We have all board impacts towards 1,600 migratory birds nests, and there was no taking of any threatened or endangered species. We and stored over 1,100 wetlands and streams, all in accordance with government regs. Along the way, 8 lawsuits were filed to stop Ruby construction. 
So we're over budget, no excuses. At the same time, our team dealt with several obstacles professionally, and for the most part successfully to bring Ruby to completion. We also learned a lot to use up on future projects. So to the Ruby team, I want to say a very big thank you. Looking forward, much of the long-term macro for Ruby remains in place. The Rockies represents a huge resource base that needs to go to market and the West Coast markets pre-Ruby are heavily dependent on Canadian gas. And Canadian exports to the U.S. are declining down another 700 a day, this year-to-date versus last.
While Rockies production growth may be slower than would like to see, as we said before, Ruby is a long-term strategic asset for El Paso, for Rockies producers and for supplied diversity on the West Coast.
On Slide 15. Our next project to go in service will be Gulf LNG, a jointly owned rig facility in It's on-time and on budget. We took in 2 LNG cargoes in June to start the cool down process, and this is a major milestone toward in-service. It's important to Roberta this project is fully subscribed with long-term contracts, and these contracts demand chartered based, so that our profits here are not dependent on the utilization of the facility. 
Finally on Slide 16. In June Did some of you have visited our TGP line 300 expansion in New Jersey. Construction is in full swing across both Pennsylvania and New Jersey. It's on budget and on-time for completion this November. We're using 4 spreads, the right-of-way is about 90% clear do and we're nearly 50% welded up. A very long directional drill over a mile has just been completed. It took about 9 months as planned. And our compression work at 9 different stations is coming along very well. This project will provide 350 a day of additional capacity out of the Appalachian and Marcellus and is fully contracted long-term.
So in summary, we're focused on completing the remainder of the backlog this year. And when with the backlog complete, the pipes transition from cash user to significant cash provider. And given our pipelines footprints in the very best markets and supply basins, we have excellent opportunities for more growth. And now I'll turn it over to Brent."

It's been just a little over 2 months since our Investor and Analyst Meeting, and since then we've continued to make good progress in E&P on a number of fronts. I'll begin to update on this morning on Slide 19. As J.R.",1773,"Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. It's been just a little over 2 months since our Investor and Analyst Meeting, and since then we've continued to make good progress in E&P on a number of fronts. I'll begin to update on this morning on Slide 19. As J.R. noted, we had a very good quarter with a 7% increase in adjusted EBITDA, again probably driven by higher production, higher oil prices. Production was up 4% from last year's second quarter, even though we have to deal with the impact for some third-party downstream disruptions that I'll cover more in a moment. And in spite of those disruptions, our 2011 production target's still very much on track. While around 5% for the quarter and will continue to ramp up significantly in the second half of the year. And we've included a chart that shows our Eagle Ford program. And our Eagle Ford program will contribute to that growth. 
Unit cash costs were down again, $1.75 versus $1.77 in Q2 of '10. Lower is always better in this metric, but I'm especially pleased considering the cost inflation and our shift to more oil volumes. Maybe the biggest E&P for the quarter was flowing back our first 7,000 foot ladder in the Wolfcamp, which looks like a very nice well. We're right on track in our Eagle Ford program. And we've drilled another 14 wells since our May analyst meeting, all in the central area. And our productive capacity is increasing our infrastructure build-out is going very well. In aggregate, we continue to minimize our service in our supply cost inflation with efficiency gains and a $1.6 million capital program remains on track.
As Slide 20 shows, our second quarter production came in at 823 million a day, that's up 4% from a year ago. The most significant gains came from our Haynesville and our Eagle Ford programs, just as they have in recent quarters. We also experienced a couple of notable production constraints in the quarter. In the Gulf of Mexico, our Coast Guard dredging operation contacted an in-bridge line in the West Cameroon area, and the resulting shut-in impact to the quarter by about 12 million a day, and unfortunately, those repairs are scheduled to be complete until early the fourth quarter. 
In the northwest part -- northeast part of our Haynesville area, we sell some gas through a third-party plant that experienced extended unplanned downtime during the quarter which impacted our quarter volumes by about 5 million a day. And the message I want to leave you with those and our underlying production assets and our capital programs are performing were very well. And absent these third-party disruptions, our second quarter volumes would've been up closer to 7%. 
On Page 21, there's a summary of our current divestiture program. As J.R. mentioned, back in May, we announced that we'd raise our capital budget from $1.3 million to $1.6 million largely to cover incremental that interest in the Eagle Ford or incremental oil activity, and we'd fund that increase through noncore asset sales. We now believe the divestiture, the proceeds will be well above the $300 million capital increase. All the assets that we're selling are noncore and very consistent with the type of portfolio high-grading that we've done over the last few years. We've already closed the $122 million of divestiture, and we have 2 others that expect to get them either late in the third quarter her report. The sales included about 200 Bs of proved reserves and about 35 million to 40 million of current production, but the full year impact of the production will be like 15 million a day. And the size and timing of the divestitures and the timing of these downstream repairs will impact where we have in the range, we still expect to be within our guidance range of 830 million to 860 million a day. Now we've included a quick update on our joint plans for the remainder of the year on Slide 22.
We'll operate around 12 to 14 rigs for the rest of the year, which is fewer than we expected at the beginning of the year, but for the right reasons. Because of the drilling efficiencies, we're getting more footage and more wells drilled with fewer rigs. So for example, back in May, I said, that we may need one less rig to accomplish our planned Eagle Ford program and that will be the case the way that mistake earnings for the second half of the year. We'll run 2, 3 rigs in the Field a couple of rigs the Wolfcamp program and we'll keep 4 rigs running Haynesville. And then we could add a rig or 2 late in the year, depending on our capital growth and then step-up further in 2012.
And unless something in the macro environment changes dramatically, expect any of the incremental 2012 activity to be again oil-focused. So the punchline as our drilling team continues offer from our expectations and the core programs, and we're right on track for a total $1.6 billion capital program. So let's focus in on the Wolfcamp program beginning on Slide 23.
This is an update of the map that we showed back in May. Our guys in orange and so if you look back at that prior versions, you see quite a contrast from between then and now. For starters, we're now drilling our tent and 11 wells and also backing a, they we're only 4 total rigs working in the area today there's almost 30. Many of these are drilling longer laterals generally greater than 7,000 feet, and we continue to see a few operators as the vertical wells. And we also plan to drill 1 or 2 vertical wells this year. And we still believe that law that's also to be doing to go, but remember, we have a very big Waltham section, after 706 so we want to gather data on the entire section and test the potential vertical wells on our acreage, before we fully commit to horizontal development.
I mentioned that we had very good results and our first long lateral Wolfcamp well, and we've included the test results on Slide 24. That's the well shown on the bottom row. The university 43191 horizontal was drilled with a 70 100 foot lateral, and was completed with 24 stages. The 660 barrel per day equivalent test rate is right in line with our predations. We're now completing our 2nd 7000-foot lateral well and we're optimistic about the result of that will be fun what we've seen so far in the completion. So we're spending more for well than the 4,000 foot laterals better production and better value, which is summarized better on Slide 25 where we show you our current view of economics for the 7,000, 8,000 foot lateral wells. And we still expect initial production to be around the same, around 25 to 30 barrels per day per frac stage with the initial test rates approaching about 700,000 barrels per day on the high end of the range. And Note know that the return shown here assume $80 and $4 flat pricing. But again, compared to our previous type cost the completed cost will be higher but the initial production, reserves and project returns will all be improved.
I also want to update you on the Eagle Ford program this morning, and we've included a map on Slide 26. Now this is the same base map that we used in May, but we've been pretty busy since then. The numbers on the table includes 14 more wells drilled, 12 more wells completed and 15 more wells online and producing since May. We're also making great strides in our backlog of completions and for a period in time in the quarter, we had 3 frac crews working in the field, including moving our Haynesville crew down to the Eagle Ford and we currently only have 9 was waiting on completions and fracs. As market was made to team up to installing a gas gathering and a new oil gathering system in the field, in a moment other you have it infrastructure timing will shake the production profile in the second half of the year.
Slide 27 includes an updated chart showing the IP rates for all of our Eagle Ford central wells. The 1 is about 10 of the wells or about 10% of the total have IP rates greater than 800 barrels per day equivalent. And as we continue to delineate the central area, our wells are concerned consistently producing at or above our well. So we're quite happy with the outlook for this program and remember, this area has -- this central area has between 600 to 800 remaining drilling locations depending on the ultimate well spacing.
Turning to Slide 20. We've updated our Eagle Ford production outlook for the rest of the year. The blue bar shows the shut-in volumes, which China waiting for facilities, which we'll not be an issue by the fourth quarter. At that point, our gross production could to be up to 20,000 barrels a day equivalent, that's the right bar in the graph. And we have previously projected to be around 16,000 pounds a day at our meeting in May. Today, our net E&P productive capacity is about 7,700 barrels and 23 million a day and is growing rapidly. 
So I'll wrap up today on Slide 29. There's a lot of excitement in the E&P company. We're currently hitting our stride. Our teams are executing well which shows up in the results of our core programs. Our oil volumes show terrific growth in the second half of the year with the addition of the new Eagle Ford volumes. And as always we continue to work hard to improve capital efficiencies. Service cost pressures haven't let up, so we keep pushing on every aspect of our business to maintain the efficiency of our capital programs. 
Looking forward, we remain excited about our future opportunities, and although we have a healthy respect for our competitors, we think that post-spinoff, our performance is going to compete well with the best E&P companies. We've got a great drilling inventory, more than 10 years, is very high-quality, very repeatable and increasingly more oily. we've been very quickly that investors and as in the coming months, and we'd hope to see many of you at our E&P analyst meeting in New York on November 8 for a full update as we prepare for the separation. I'll now turn it back to Doug for closing comments."

I intend to keep my comments very  brief this morning. We told you when we announced the separation in spin of our E&P company back in May that we'll do 2 things: get the spin done by year end; and not take our eye off the ball in terms of execution in our 3 businesses. I think we've done that, and we hope to show you the evidence in today's call. We had a good second quarter. Earnings and cash flow were up and the business units performed well operationally. We've moved much closer to completion of our $8 billion backlog of growth projects at the pipes. Ruby's now in service and our other 2011 projects are on track. 
In E&P, production is up, costs are down, and we continue to make progress in all 4 of our core areas. Midstream had a good quarter and made meaningful progress in moving the Marcellus Ethane Pipeline project along with a very successful open season. And finally, we completed another drop to the MLP during the quarter, once again using the proceeds to accelerate our balance sheet improvement as we move toward the separation prior to the end of the year.
On the separation front, we continue to make great progress. The management teams and boards for the 2 separate companies are now in place. We filed for our IRS tax ruling, we're very close to filing the Form 10, and we're completing the various required separation agreements. Each of these is in the critical path to the spin and each of them are on track. We're also moving towards finalization of the capital structures for both entities. So all of these is to say that there are a lot of work streams going on internally, but all of them are pointed toward completion by year end, and we remain on track for completion as originally contemplated. One final note before I turn it over to J.R., as you can see on Slide 4, we've completed our review and established the boards for the 2 companies post-spin. I'm delighted to report that we're able to populate both boards from the existing El Paso board, and we believe we'll create 2 outstanding well-governed boards, a key prerequisite to each company's success going forward. Now I'll turn the call over to J.R. and come back at the end to wrap up."
1038355,118084842,152413,"El Paso Corp., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2011",2011-08-04,"Earnings Calls","El Paso LLC","Executives","Thanks, Doug, and good morning to everyone. Thanks for joining us. We had another active and very productive quarter as we continue to make great progress, both financially and operationally. Our progress to date in 2011 puts us in good shape to meet our",985,"Thanks, Doug, and good morning to everyone. Thanks for joining us. We had another active and very productive quarter as we continue to make great progress, both financially and operationally. Our progress to date in 2011 puts us in good shape to meet our full year financial goals. I'll briefly cover the financial highlights for the quarter, starting on Slide 6, and then Jim and Brent will update you on our operational progress.
Back in May, at the Analyst Meeting in New York, we talked a lot about the importance of our MLP drop down strategy and how the success of that strategy contributed to our ability to pursue a strategic separation this year, far sooner than even we would've thought possible back at the beginning of 2010. I hope you would agree that we've kept the RPMs running high on our MLP, maintaining an accelerated pace of drop downs through El Paso Pipeline Partners. During the quarter, we completed another drop to the MLP, our second this year and seventh since our IPO. The transaction raised nearly $750 million in cash for El Paso, bringing our year-to-date total to $1.4 billion, nearly $1 billion of which in new MLP equity capital. We're using the cash to reduce El Paso corporate debt and hopefully you saw our press release last week announcing the early results of our most recent liability management program. And although the tender and companion Dutch option are still in progress, we're confident we'll complete the entire $750 million transaction, further accelerating our balance sheet improvement.
While not so much a stated goal for 2011, a key goal for the finance team was to refinance our 3 primary credit facilities at El Paso Corp., El Paso Pipeline Partners and El Paso Exploration and Production. We didn't just add during the quarter. The very successful transaction involving over 20 financial institutions participating across all 3 facilities. The maturity dates of our $3.25 billion in aggregate credit have now been extended to 2016. The new facilities provide significant flexibility and position all 3 companies to successfully pursue their individual growth strategies. 
Finally, with Ruby's successfully in commercial operation, we anticipate meeting the conditions in the financing agreements that will result in the $1.5 billion of project debt becoming non-recourse to El Paso in the next 60 to 90 days. 
So let's turn to page and run through the numbers beginning on Slide 7. We reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.25 for the quarter, compared to $0.22 last year.
Higher segment earnings before interest and taxes from our core businesses, lower interest expense, the lower effective tax rate contributed to the increase. Our effective tax rate for the quarter on a GAAP basis was 10%, reflecting the favorable impact from the resolution of certain tax matters. Excluding these items, our effective tax rate for the quarter would've been 14%. As highlighted on previous calls, you should expect our effective tax rate to remain lower than prior years as we continue to drop more and more assets into our MLP.
Adjusted segment EBIT was up just over 2% for the quarter, driven by increases in both Pipelines and E&P. Adjusted segment EBIT for the Pipeline Group was up about 9% from year ago, reflecting completed expansion projects going into service, higher non-cash AFUDC, principally from Ruby, and a benefit related to a customer's election not to continue with Phase B of our Elba III expansion project. 
In E&P, adjusted segment EBIT was up slightly for the quarter as a result of higher production volumes in crude oil prices, offset by lower realized natural gas prices and a higher DD&A rate.
Turning to operating cash flow and capital investment on Slide 8. We remain on track with our 2011 guidance for both. Cash flow from operations for the 6 months was up 11% from last year due to higher E&P cash flows, lower interest payments and positive working capital changes. 
On the capital side, you can see the Pipeline spending ramped up from last year with Ruby as the largest consumer of capital. We're also nearing completion on our TGP Line 300 project, as well as Gulf LNG, which Jim will update to you on shortly.
Growth capital spending on the Pipelines will continue to decline in subsequent quarters this year as we near the completion of the original $8 billion backlog. I expect the Pipeline Group to transition from being a consumer to a provider of free cash flow beginning in the fourth quarter of this year. 
In our E&P business, spending was up for the quarter, reflecting higher activity levels in our Eagle Ford oil program. And Brent is going to give you an update in just a few minutes on our non-core asset divestitures, which will more than adequately fund the increase in the Eagle Ford drilling and completion capital we announced back in May. 
Now I'll wrap up with my usual update on our hedge program on Slide 9. We continue to have an advantage hedge position particularly for the remainder of 2011. We remain well protected from low natural gas prices for the balance of the year with 80% of our second half 2011 gas volumes hedged at an average price of $5.89, substantially above current market prices. We added on the margin to our 2011 positions since our May meeting but have made no changes for 2012. Our hedges have been a key contributor to our E&P financial success this year in the current low natural gas price environment with settlements adding $140 million to adjusted segment EBIT and operating cash flows this year. 
That's my update for you this morning. I'm proud of the progress to date in 2011 and look forward to updating you periodically the rest of the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for an update on the Pipeline Group. Jim?"

Pipeline financials continue to reflect our expansion mode, a nice growth in EBIT, some due to noncash AFUDC, as J.R said, also substantial CapEx spend. The completion of Ruby is a major milestone for us, obviously. And we're well on our way now toward completing our big slide of growth projects scheduled for this year. In the fourth quarter, we'll complete our final 2 projects as planned. We settled the major rig case on CIG this quarter. That's a very good settlement for both our customers and us. It extends customer contracts and it provides great certainty most likely for the next 5 years.
Separately, on the rate case front. As you know, we have rate cases ongoing on both TGP and EPNG. I don't have much news on either of these and a settlement discussion's at an early stage. Finally, as we've said at the New York City Analyst Day, we continue to see meaningful, new pipeline growth opportunities centered mostly on gas-fired power gen and the new shale plays.
Slide 12 summarizes throughput trends this year versus last. Overall, up 2% year-to-date. TGP is having a record year, through put up 21%. A lot of this is due to increasing Marcellus production. Marcellus receipts into TGP are now 1.5 Bcf a day, up for about 0.6 Bcfe a day a year ago. And TGP has in hand over 1 Bcfe a day of fully subscribed expansions in Northeast Pennsylvania to be completed over the next 2 years. So we'll continue to get our share of Marcellus' growth ourselves growth, and TGP is well positioned to further expand.
SNG throughput reflects more normal winter weather this year after a very cold early 2010. Powergen loads on SNG continue to increase each quarter, up 13% year-to-date. Throughput on our Rockies pipes is down this year due to slightly lower Rockies production and lower exports out of the region. 
On EPNG, as you know, EPNG is our most challenged pipe due to pipeline overcapacity in the Southwest. Throughput this year had decreased mostly due to higher withdrawals from California storage fields this winter. This backed down interstate transport into California. But on the positive side, we see signs of the beginnings of an economic recovery in the Southwest, also as expected, increasing exports to Mexico.
So across the country, some significant ups, mostly on TGP, offset by some downs, overall up 2%. The next 4 slides speak to our progress on the expansion front. As you know, completing these projects is our primary focus this year. 
Slide 13 shows that we've now completed 3 of the 5 projects planned for in service this year. And since our last call, the second phase of the SNG expansion for Southern Company was completed under budget -- nearly 20% under budget. And of course, Ruby, completed last week. And more on Ruby on the next slide. But before going there, when we finished the 2 other projects this year, we would've substantially completed the original $8 billion growth backlog. In total, during the last 5 years, we have completed 19 projects within 7% to 8% of budget, a track record significantly better than our industry peers. And x Ruby, the other 18 projects are right on budget in total. Importantly, these projects are approximately 90% subscribed with long-term contracts, so they will generate highly predicable cash flow.
On Ruby, we're in service and flowing gas for customers. In these first few days of August, Ruby has been flowing between 400 and 480 a day. Our results on Ruby construction, it was completed 4 months later than we original planned back in 2008. And it will be 23% over budget at our projected completion cost of approximately $3.65 billion. The general reasons for this have been well-documented: significant permanent challenges; building through a wet winter; and dealing with various fishing game habitat or nesting issues. 
But I owe it to our project team to take a minute to give a little bit more flavor for the scale and complexity of this construction project. Ruby is the largest U.S. natural gas pipeline project since the REX Pipeline. At $6.8 billion, it was completed in 2009. And here are a few stats for you on Ruby. Before beginning construction, it took a whole 2.5 years to move Ruby through the review process with BLM, FERC and the various federal state local state and local agencies. At peak construction, nearly 5,300 people were working on Ruby. Pipe was produced in India, Arkansas, the Gulf Coast and France. It was moved west in 110-unit trains, each up to 1 mile long. Ruby was constructed at elevations up to 8,800 feet and at grave slopes up to 14%. Oregon rainfall was 50% greater than normal, February through April of this year. At one point, we had over 200 archaeologists in the field. We avoided impacts to over 100 safe grass lacks [ph] 1,600 migratory birds nests, and there was no taking of any threatened or endangered species. We crossed and stored over 1,100 wetlands and streams, all in accordance with government reqs. Along the way, 8 lawsuits were filed to stop Ruby construction. So we're over budget, no excuses. At the same time, our team dealt with several obstacles professionally, and for the most part successfully to bring Ruby to completion. We also learned a lot to use on future projects. So to the Ruby team, I want to say a very big thank you. 
Looking forward, much of the long-term macro for Ruby remains in place. The Rockies represents a huge resource base that needs to get to market, and the West Coast markets pre-Ruby are heavily dependent on Canadian gas. And Canadian exports to the U.S. are declining, down another 700 a day this year-to-date versus last.
While Rockies production growth may be slower than would like to see, as we've said before, Ruby is a long-term strategic asset for El Paso, for Rockies producers and for supplied diversity on the West Coast.
On Slide 15. Our next project to go in service will be Gulf LNG, our jointly owned rig gas facility in Pascagoula. It's on time and on budget. We took in 2 LNG cargoes in June to start the cool down process, and this is a major milestone toward in service. It's important to remember that this project is fully subscribed with long-term contracts, and these contracts are demand-chartered based so that our profits here are not dependent on the utilization of the facility. 
Finally on Slide 16. In June, some of you visited our TGP line 300 expansion in New Jersey. Construction is in full swing across both Pennsylvania and New Jersey. It's on budget and on time for completion this November. We're using 4 spreads, the right-of-ways of that 90% cleared now, and we're nearly 50% welded up. A very long directional drill over a mile has just been completed. It took about 9 months as planned. And our compression work at 9 different stations is coming along very well. This project will provide 350 a day of additional forward hull capacity out of the Appalachians and Marcellus and is fully contracted long term.
So in summary, we're focused on completing the remainder of the backlog this year. And then with the backlog complete, the pipes' transition from cash user to a significant cash provider. And given our pipelines' footprints in the very best markets and supply basins, we have excellent opportunities for more growth. And now I'll turn it over to Brent."

It's been just a little over 2 months since our Investor and Analyst Meeting, and since then we've continued to make good progress in E&P on a number of fronts. I'll begin to update on this morning on Slide 19. As J.",1818,"Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. It's been just a little over 2 months since our Investor and Analyst Meeting, and since then we've continued to make good progress in E&P on a number of fronts. 
I'll begin to update on this morning on Slide 19. As J.R. noted, we had a very good quarter with a 7% increase in adjusted EBITDA, again primarily driven by higher production, higher oil prices. Production was up 4% from last year's second quarter, even though we had to deal with the impact for some third-party downstream disruptions that I'll cover more in a moment. And in spite of those disruptions, our 2011 production target's still very much on track. Well, I can say volumes were up 5% for the quarter and they'll continue to ramp up significantly in the second half of the year. And we've included a chart that shows our Eagle Ford program. And our Eagle Ford program will contribute to that growth. 
Unit cash costs were down again, $1.75 versus $1.77 in Q2 of '10. Lower is always better in this metric, but I'm especially pleased considering the cost inflation and our shift to more oil volumes. 
Maybe the biggest E&P highlight for the quarter was flowing back our first 7,000 foot ladder in the Wolfcamp, which looks like a very nice well. We're right on track in our Eagle Ford program. And we've drilled another 14 wells since our May Analyst Meeting, all in the central area. And our productive capacity is increasing, and our infrastructure build-out is going very well. In aggregate, we continue to minimize our service and our supply cost inflation with efficiency gains, and our $1.6 billion capital program remains on track.
As Slide 20 shows, our second quarter production came in at 823 million a day. That's up 4% from a year ago. The most significant gains came from our Haynesville and our Eagle Ford programs, just as they have in recent quarters. 
We also experienced a couple of notable production constraints in the quarter. In the Gulf of Mexico, our Coast Guard dredging operation contacted an in-bridge line in the West Cameron area, and the resulting shut-in impacted the quarter by about 12 million a day. And unfortunately, those repairs are not scheduled to be complete until early in the fourth quarter. 
In the northwest part -- northeast part of our Haynesville area, we sell some gas through a third-party plant that experienced extended unplanned downtime during the quarter, which impacted our quarter volumes by about 5 million a day. And the message I want to leave you with those is that our underlying production assets and our capital programs are performing very well. And absent these third-party disruptions, our second quarter volumes would've been up closer to 7%. 
On Page 21, there's a summary of our current divestiture program. As J.R. mentioned, back in May, we announced that we'd raise our capital budget from $1.3 billion to $1.6 billion largely to cover our incremental net interest in the Eagle Ford or incremental oil activity, and we'd fund that increase through non-core asset sales. We now believe that the divestiture -- the proceeds will be well above the $300 million capital increase. All the assets that we're selling are non-core and its very consistent with the type of portfolio high-grading that we've done over the last few years. We've already closed $122 million of divestitures, and we have 2 others that we expect to get done either late in the third quarter or early fourth. 
The sales included about 200 Bcfe of proved reserves and about 35 to 40 million a day of current production, but the full year impact of that production will be more like 15 million a day. And the size and the timing of the divestitures and the timing of these downstream repairs will impact where we end up in the range, but we still expect to be within our guiding range of 830 to 860 million a day. Now we've included a quick update of our drilling plans for the remainder of the year on Slide 22.
Now, we'll operate around 12 to 14 rigs for the rest of the year, which is fewer than we expected at the beginning of the year, but for the right reasons. Because of the drilling efficiencies, we're getting more footage and more wells drilled with fewer rigs. So for example, back in May, I said, that we may need one less rig to accomplish our planned Eagle Ford program and that will be the case. We'll likely stay at 3 rigs for the second half of the year. We'll run 2, 3 rigs in the Altamont field, a couple of rigs in the Wolfcamp program, and we'll keep 4 rigs running in the Haynesville. And then we could add a rig or 2 late in the year, depending on how our capital goes and then step up further in 2012.
And unless something in the macro environment changes dramatically, expect any of the incremental 2012 activity to again be oil-focused. So the punchline is our drilling team continues to outperform our expectations in our core programs, and we're right on track for our total $1.6 billion capital program. 
So let's focus in on the Wolfcamp program beginning on Slide 23. Now, this is an update of the map that we showed back in May, our record shown in orange. And so if you look back at that prior versions, you'll see quite a contrast from -- between then and now. For starters, we're now drilling our 10th and 11th wells. And also back in May, there were only 4 total rigs working in the area, and today there's almost 30. Many of these are drilling longer laterals generally greater than 7,000 feet, and we continue to see a few operators doing vertical wells. And we also plan to drill 1 or 2 vertical wells this year. And we still believe that long laterals is going to be the way to go. But remember, we have a very thick Wolfcamp section, up to 700 feet thick, so we want to gather data on the entire section and test the potential of vertical wells on our acreage, before we fully commit to horizontal development.
 
I mentioned that we had very good results in our first long lateral Wolfcamp well, and we've included the test results on Slide 24. That's the well shown in the bottom row. The university 43 19-1 horizontal was drilled with a 7,100-foot lateral and is completed with 24 stages. The 660 barrel per day equivalent test rate is right in line with our predictions. We're now completing our 2nd 7,000-foot lateral well, and we're optimistic about the results of that well based on what we've seen so far in the completion. So we're spending more for well than the 4,000-foot laterals, hoping for better production and better value, which is summarized better on Slide 25, where we show you our current view of the economics for the 7,000 to 8,000-foot lateral wells. And we still expect initial production to be around -- to be the same, around 25 to 30 barrels per day per frac stage with the initial test rates approaching about 700 barrels per day on the high end of the range. And note that the return shown here assumed $80 and $4 flat pricing. But again, compared to our previous type well, the completed cost here will be higher but the initial production, reserves and project returns will all be improved.
I also want to update you on the Eagle Ford program this morning, and we've included a map on Slide 26. Now this isn't the same base map again that we used in May, but we've been pretty busy since then. The numbers on the table include 14 more wells drilled, 12 more wells completed and 15 more wells online and producing since May. We're also making great strides in our backlog of completions, and for a period in time in the quarter, we had 3 frac crews working in the field, including moving our Haynesville crew down to the Eagle Ford. And we currently only have 9 wells waiting on completions in fracs. And market has Midstream team continue to make dear progress in installing a gas gathering and a new oil gathering system in the field. In a moment, I'll show you that infrastructure timing will shape the production profile on the second half of the year.
Slide 27 includes an updated chart showing the IP rates for all of our Eagle Ford central wells. The point is about 10 of the wells or about 40% of the total have IP rates greater than 800 barrels per day equivalent. And as we continue to delineate the central area, our wells are consistently producing at or above our type oil. So we're quite happy with the outlook for this program. And remember, this area has -- this central area has between 600 to 800 remaining drilling locations depending on the ultimate well spacing.
Turning to Slide 28. We've updated our Eagle Ford production outlook for the rest of the year. The blue bar shows shut-in volumes, which are shut-in waiting on facilities, which will not be an issue by the fourth quarter. At that point, our gross production could to be up to 20,000 barrels a day equivalent, that's the far right bar in the graph. And we have previously projected that to be around 16,000 barrels a day at our meeting in May. Today, our net E&P productive capacity is about 7,700 barrels and 23 million a day, and it's growing rapidly. 
So I'll wrap up today on Slide 29. There's a lot of excitement in the E&P company. We're currently hitting our stride. Our teams are executing well, which shows up in the results of our core programs. Our oil volumes show terrific growth in the second half of the year, with the addition of the new Eagle Ford volumes. And as always, we continue to work hard to improve capital efficiencies. Service cost pressures haven't let up, so we keep pushing on every aspect of our business to maintain the efficiency of our capital programs. 
Looking forward, we remain excited about our future opportunities. And although we have a healthy respect for our competitors, we think that post-spinoff, our performance is going to compete well with the best E&P companies. We've got a great drilling inventory, more than 10 years. It's very high-quality, very reputable and increasingly more oily. We'll be meeting frequently with investors and analysts in the coming months, and we hope to see many of you at our E&P analyst meeting in New York on November 8 for a full update as we prepare for the separation. 
I'll now turn it back to Doug for closing comments."

We've just had some -- we got some swept behind in our recompletion work over kind of program as a consequence of closing it in for office and relocating those teams here. But we're on that in this quarter, and we'll see that recover. Eagle Ford, you know the story there, that the production charts that we've updated reflect that we've been completing wells, but we can't always get them all the way to sales. And we've shown you those numbers, but we think that's remedied now through the end of the year and will be completely gone by the end of the year, most of the fourth quarter. And so those volumes, we can see ramping up just like we're giving in the chart. And then divestiture, we didn't give you a lot of detail because we've got one of those closed. And we've got 2 of them that are in progress. And I don't want any triangulating between valuations on all that. But think of them as noncore, the kinds of things that we're not spending capital on later in life, higher costs, lower inventory, things that we've got in the past."

But I think as a general comment, settlement discussions are in a very early stage. As the result of that, we continue down with the litigation path on EPNG. We filed our testimony. The customers have filed their testimony. We filed our battle testimony, I think, in September. And then we'll go to trial after that. TGP is probably a step or so behind that.

I intend to keep my comments very  brief this morning. We told you when we announced the separation in spin of our E&P Company back in May that we'll do 2 things: get the spin done by year end; and not take our eye off the ball in terms of execution in our 3 businesses. I think we've done that, and we hope to show you the evidence in today's call. We had a good second quarter. Earnings and cash flow were up and the business units performed well operationally. We've moved much closer to completion of our $8 billion backlog of growth projects at the pipes. Ruby's now in service and our other 2011 projects are on track. 
In E&P, production is up, costs are down, and we continue to make progress in all 4 of our core areas. Midstream had a good quarter and made meaningful progress in moving the Marcellus Ethane Pipeline project along with a very successful open season. And finally, we completed another drop to the MLP during the quarter, once again using the proceeds to accelerate our balance sheet improvement as we move toward the separation prior to the end of the year.
On the separation front, we continue to make great progress. The management teams and boards for the 2 separate companies are now in place. We filed for our IRS tax ruling, we're very close to filing the Form 10, and we're completing the various required separation agreements. Each of these is in the critical path to the spin and each of them are on track. We're also moving towards finalization of the capital structures for both entities. So all of these is to say that there are a lot of work streams going on internally, but all of them are pointed toward completion by year end, and we remain on track for completion as originally contemplated. One final note before I turn it over to J.R., as you can see on Slide 4, we've completed our review and established the boards for the 2 companies post-spin. I'm delighted to report that we're able to populate both boards from the existing El Paso board, and we believe we'll create 2 outstanding well-governed boards, a key prerequisite to each company's success going forward. Now I'll turn the call over to J.R. and come back at the end to wrap up."

We had another active and very productive quarter as we continue to make great progress, both financially and operationally. Our progress to date in 2011 puts us in good shape to meet our full year financial goals. I'll briefly cover the financial highlights for the quarter, starting on Slide 6, and then Jim and Brent will update you on our operational progress.
Back in May, at the Analyst Meeting in New York, we talked a lot about the importance of our MLP drop down strategy and how the success of that strategy contributed to our ability to pursue a strategic separation this year, far sooner than even we would've thought possible back at the beginning of 2010. I hope you would agree that we've kept the RPMs running high on our MLP, maintaining an accelerated pace of drop downs through El Paso Pipeline Partners. During the quarter, we completed another drop to the MLP, our second this year and seventh since our IPO. The transaction raised nearly $750 million in cash for El Paso, bringing our year-to-date total to $1.4 billion, nearly $1 billion of which in new MLP equity capital. We're using the cash to reduce El Paso corporate debt and hopefully you saw our press release last week announcing the early results of our most recent liability management program. And although the tender and companion Dutch option are still in progress, we're confident we'll complete the entire $750 million transaction, further accelerating our balance sheet improvement.
While not so much a stated goal for 2011, a key goal for the finance team was to refinance our 3 primary credit facilities at El Paso Corp., El Paso Pipeline Partners and El Paso Exploration and Production, We did just add during the quarter. The very successful transaction involving over 20 financial institutions participating across all 3 facilities. The maturity dates of our $3.25 billion in aggregate credit have now been extended to 2016. The new facilities provide significant flexibility and position all 3 companies to successfully pursue their individual growth strategies. 
Finally, with Ruby's successfully in commercial operation, we anticipate meeting the conditions in the financing agreements that will result in the $1.5 billion of project debt becoming non-recourse to El Paso in the next 60 to 90 days. 
So let's turn the page and run through the numbers beginning on Slide 7. We reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.25 for the quarter, compared to $0.22 last year.
Higher segment earnings before interest and taxes from our core businesses, lower interest expense, the lower effective tax rate contributed to the increase. Our effective tax rate for the quarter on a GAAP basis was 10%, reflecting the favorable impact from the resolution of certain tax matters. Excluding these items, our effective tax rate for the quarter would've been 14%. As highlighted on previous calls, you should expect our effective tax rate to remain lower than prior years as we continue to drop more and more assets into our MLP.
Adjusted segment EBIT was up just over 2% for the quarter, driven by increases in both Pipelines and E&P. Adjusted segment EBIT for the Pipeline Group was up about 9% from a year ago, reflecting completed expansion projects going into service, higher non-cash AFUDC, principally from Ruby, and a benefit related to a customer's election not to continue with Phase B of our Elba III expansion project. 
In E&P, adjusted segment EBIT was up slightly for the quarter as a result of higher production volumes in crude oil prices, offset by lower realized natural gas prices and a higher DD&A rate.
Turning to operating cash flow and capital investment on Slide 8. We remain on track with our 2011 guidance for both. Cash flow from operations for the 6 months was up 11% from last year due to higher E&P cash flows, lower interest payments and positive working capital changes. 
On the capital side, you can see the Pipeline spending ramped up from last year with Ruby as the largest consumer of capital. We're also nearing completion on our TGP Line 300 project, as well as Gulf LNG, which Jim will update to you on shortly.
Growth capital spending on the Pipelines will continue to decline in subsequent quarters this year as we near the completion of the original $8 billion backlog. I expect the Pipeline Group to transition from being a consumer to a provider of free cash flow beginning in the fourth quarter of this year. 
In our E&P business, spending was up for the quarter, reflecting higher activity levels in our Eagle Ford oil program. And Brent is going to give you an update in just a few minutes on our non-core asset divestitures, which will more than adequately fund the increase in the Eagle Ford drilling and completion capital we announced back in May. 
Now I'll wrap up with my usual update on our hedge program on Slide 9. We continue to have an advantage hedge position particularly for the remainder of 2011. We remain well protected from low natural gas prices for the balance of the year with 80% of our second half 2011 gas volumes hedged at an average price of $5.89, substantially above current market prices. We added on the margin to our 2011 positions since our May meeting but have made no changes for 2012. Our hedges have been a key contributor to our E&P financial success this year in the current low natural gas price environment with settlements adding $140 million to adjusted segment EBIT and operating cash flows this year. 
That's my update for you this morning. I'm proud of the progress to date in 2011 and look forward to updating you periodically the rest of the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for an update on the Pipeline Group. Jim?"

Pipeline financials continue to reflect our expansion mode, a nice growth in EBIT, some due to noncash AFUDC, as J.R said, also substantial CapEx spend. The completion of Ruby is a major milestone for us, obviously. And we're well on our way now toward completing our big slide of growth projects scheduled for this year. In the fourth quarter, we'll complete our final 2 projects as planned. We settled the major rig case on CIG this quarter. That's a very good settlement for both our customers and us. It extends customer contracts and it provides great certainty most likely for the next 5 years.
Separately, on the rate case front. As you know, we have rate cases ongoing on both TGP and EPNG. I don't have much news on either of these and a settlement discussions at an early stage. Finally, as we've said at the New York City Analyst Day, we continue to see meaningful, new pipeline growth opportunities centered mostly on gas-fired power gen and the new shale plays.
Slide 12 summarizes throughput trends this year versus last. Overall, up 2% year-to-date. TGP is having a record year, through put up 21%. A lot of this is due to increasing Marcellus production. Marcellus receipts into TGP are now 1.5 Bcf a day, up for about 0.6 Bcfe a day a year ago. And TGP has in hand over 1 Bcfe a day of fully subscribed expansions in Northeast Pennsylvania to be completed over the next 2 years. So we'll continue to get our share of Marcellus' growth, and TGP is well positioned to further expand.
SNG throughput reflects more normal winter weather this year after a very cold early 2010. Powergen loads on SNG continue to increase each quarter, up 13% year-to-date. Throughput on our Rockies pipes is down this year due to slightly lower Rockies production and lower exports out of the region. 
On EPNG, as you know, EPNG is our most challenged pipe due to pipeline overcapacity in the Southwest. Throughput this year had decreased mostly due to higher withdrawals from California storage fields this winter. This backed down interstate transport into California. But on the positive side, we see signs of the beginnings of an economic recovery in the Southwest, also as expected, increasing exports to Mexico.
So across the country, some significant ups, mostly on TGP, offset by some downs, overall up 2%. The next 4 slides speak to our progress on the expansion front. As you know, completing these projects is our primary focus this year. 
Slide 13 shows that we've now completed 3 of the 5 projects planned for in service this year. And since our last call, the second phase of the SNG expansion for Southern Company was completed under budget -- nearly 20% under budget. And of course, Ruby, completed last week. And more on Ruby on the next slide. But before going there, when we finished the 2 other projects this year, we would've substantially completed the original $8 billion growth backlog. In total, during the last 5 years, we will have completed 19 projects within 7% to 8% of budget, a track record significantly better than our industry peers. And x Ruby, the other 18 projects are right on budget in total. Importantly, these projects are approximately 90% subscribed with long-term contracts, so they will generate highly predicable cash flow.
On Ruby, we're in service and flowing gas for customers. In these first few days of August, Ruby has been flowing between 400 and 480 a day. Our results on Ruby construction, it was completed 4 months later than we original planned back in 2008. And it will be 23% over budget at our projected completion cost of approximately $3.65 billion. The general reasons for this have been well-documented: significant permanent challenges; building through a wet winter; and dealing with various fishing game habitat or nesting issues. 
But I owe it to our project team to take a minute to give a little bit more flavor for the scale and complexity of this construction project. Ruby is the largest U.S. natural gas pipeline project since the REX Pipeline, at $6.8 billion, it was completed in 2009. And here are a few stats for you on Ruby. Before beginning construction, it took a whole 2.5 years to move Ruby through the review process with BLM, FERC and the various federal state local state and local agencies. At peak construction, nearly 5,300 people were working on Ruby. Pipe was produced in India, Arkansas, the Gulf Coast and France. It was moved west in 110-unit trains, each up to 1 mile long. Ruby was constructed at elevations up to 8,800 feet and at grave slopes up to 14%. Oregon rainfall was 50% greater than normal, February through April of this year. At one point, we had over 200 archaeologists in the field. We avoided impacts to over 100 safe grass lacks [ph] 1,600 migratory birds' nests, and there was no taking of any threatened or endangered species. We crossed and restored over 1,100 wetlands and streams, all in accordance with government reqs. Along the way, 8 lawsuits were filed to stop Ruby construction. So we're over budget, no excuses. At the same time, our team dealt with several obstacles professionally and for the most part successfully to bring Ruby to completion. We also learned a lot to use on future projects. So to the Ruby team, I want to say a very big thank you. 
Looking forward, much of the long-term macro for Ruby remains in place. The Rockies represents a huge resource base that needs to get to market, and the West Coast markets pre-Ruby are heavily dependent on Canadian gas. And Canadian exports to the U.S. are declining, down another 700 a day this year-to-date versus last.
While Rockies production growth may be slower than would like to see, as we've said before, Ruby is a long-term strategic asset for El Paso, for Rockies producers and for supplied diversity on the West Coast.
On Slide 15. Our next project to go in service will be Gulf LNG, our jointly owned rig gas facility in Pascagoula. It's on time and on budget. We took in 2 LNG cargoes in June to start the cool down process, and this is a major milestone toward in service. It's important to remember that this project is fully subscribed with long-term contracts, and these contracts are demand-chartered based so that our profits here are not dependent on the utilization of the facility. 
Finally on Slide 16. In June, some of you visited our TGP line 300 expansion in New Jersey. Construction is in full swing across both Pennsylvania and New Jersey. It's on budget and on time for completion this November. We're using 4 spreads, the right-of-ways about 90% cleared now, and we're nearly 50% welded up. A very long directional drill over a mile has just been completed. It took about 9 months as planned. And our compression work at 9 different stations is coming along very well. This project will provide 350 a day of additional forward hull capacity out of the Appalachians and Marcellus and is fully contracted long term.
So in summary, we're focused on completing the remainder of the backlog this year. And then with the backlog complete, the pipes' transition from cash user to a significant cash provider. And given our pipelines' footprints in the very best markets and supply basins, we have excellent opportunities for more growth. And now I'll turn it over to Brent."

It's been just a little over 2 months since our Investor and Analyst Meeting, and since then we've continued to make good progress in E&P on a number of fronts. I'll begin to update on this morning on Slide 19. As J.",1822,"Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. It's been just a little over 2 months since our Investor and Analyst Meeting, and since then we've continued to make good progress in E&P on a number of fronts. 
I'll begin to update on this morning on Slide 19. As J.R. noted, we had a very good quarter with a 7% increase in adjusted EBITDA, again primarily driven by higher production, higher oil prices. Production was up 4% from last year's second quarter, even though we had to deal with the impact for some third-party downstream disruptions that I'll cover more in a moment. And in spite of those disruptions, our 2011 production target's still very much on track. Well, I can say volumes were up 5% for the quarter and they'll continue to ramp up significantly in the second half of the year. And we've included a chart that shows our Eagle Ford program, how our Eagle Ford program will contribute to that growth. 
Unit cash costs were down again, $1.75 versus $1.77 in Q2 of '10. Lower is always better in this metric, but I'm especially pleased considering the cost inflation and our shift to more oil volumes. 
Maybe the biggest E&P highlight for the quarter was flowing back our first 7,000 foot ladder in the Wolfcamp, which looks like a very nice well. We're right on track in our Eagle Ford program. And we've drilled another 14 wells since our May Analyst Meeting, all in the central area. And our productive capacity is increasing, and our infrastructure build-out is going very well. In aggregate, we continue to minimize our service and our supply cost inflation with efficiency gains, and our $1.6 billion capital program remains on track.
As Slide 20 shows, our second quarter production came in at 823 million a day. That's up 4% from a year ago. The most significant gains came from our Haynesville and our Eagle Ford programs, just as they have in recent quarters. 
We also experienced a couple of notable production constraints in the quarter. In the Gulf of Mexico, a Coast Guard dredging operation contacted an in-bridge line in the West Cameron area, and the resulting shut-in impacted the quarter by about 12 million a day. And unfortunately, those repairs are not scheduled to be complete until early in the fourth quarter. 
In the northwest part -- northeast part of our Haynesville area, we sell some gas through a third-party plant that experienced extended unplanned downtime during the quarter, which impacted our quarter volumes by about 5 million a day. And the message I want to leave you with those is that our underlying production assets and our capital programs are performing very well. And absent these third-party disruptions, our second quarter volumes would've been up closer to 7%. 
On Page 21, there's a summary of our current divestiture program. As J.R. mentioned, back in May, we announced that we'd raise our capital budget from $1.3 billion to $1.6 billion largely to cover our incremental net interest in the Eagle Ford or incremental oil activity, and that we'd fund that increase through non-core asset sales. We now believe that the divestiture -- the proceeds will be well above the $300 million capital increase. All the assets that we're selling are non-core and it's very consistent with the type of portfolio high-grading that we've done over the last few years. We've already closed $122 million of divestitures, and we have 2 others that we expect to get done either late in the third quarter or early fourth. 
The sales included about 200 Bcfe of proved reserves and about 35 to 40 million a day of current production, but the full year impact of that production will be more like 15 million a day. And the size and the timing of the divestitures and the timing of these downstream repairs will impact where we end up in the range, but we still expect to be within our guiding range of 830 to 860 million a day. Now we've included a quick update of our drilling plans for the remainder of the year on Slide 22.
Now, we'll operate around 12 to 14 rigs for the rest of the year, which is fewer than we expected at the beginning of the year, but for the right reasons. Because of the drilling efficiencies, we're getting more footage and more wells drilled with fewer rigs. So for example, back in May, I said, that we may need one less rig to accomplish our planned Eagle Ford program and that will be the case. We'll likely stay at 3 rigs for the second half of the year. We'll run 2, 3 rigs in the Altamont field, a couple of rigs in the Wolfcamp program, and we'll keep 4 rigs running in the Haynesville. And then we could add a rig or 2 late in the year, depending on how capital goes and then step up further in 2012.
And unless something in the macro environment changes dramatically, expect any of the incremental 2012 activity to again be oil-focused. So the punch line is that our drilling team continues to outperform our expectations in our core programs, and we're right on track for our total $1.6 billion capital program. 
So let's focus in on the Wolfcamp program beginning on Slide 23. Now, this is an update of the map that we showed back in May, our record shown in orange. And so if you look back at that prior versions, you'll see quite a contrast from -- between then and now. For starters, we're now drilling our 10th and 11th wells. And also back in May, there were only 4 total rigs working in the area, and today there's almost 30. Many of these are drilling longer laterals generally greater than 7,000 feet, and we continue to see a few operators doing vertical wells. And we also plan to drill 1 or 2 vertical wells this year. And we still believe that long laterals is going to be the way to go. But remember, we have a very thick Wolfcamp section, up to 700 feet thick, so we want to gather data on the entire section and test the potential of vertical wells on our acreage, before we fully commit to horizontal development.
 
I mentioned that we had very good results in our first long lateral Wolfcamp well, and we've included the test results on Slide 24. That's the well shown in the bottom row. The university 43 19-1 horizontal was drilled with a 7,100-foot lateral and is completed with 24 stages. The 660 barrel per day equivalent test rate is right in line with our predictions. We're now completing our second 7,000-foot lateral well, and we're optimistic about the results of that well based on what we've seen so far in the completion. So we're spending more for well than the 4,000-foot laterals, hoping for better production and better value, which is summarized better on Slide 25, where we show you our current view of the economics for the 7,000 to 8,000-foot lateral length wells. And we still expect initial production to be around -- to be the same, around 25 to 30 barrels per day per frac stage with the initial test rates approaching about 700 barrels per day on the high end of the range. And note that the return shown here assumed $80 and $4 flat pricing. But again, compared to our previous type well, the completed cost here will be higher but the initial production, reserves and project returns will all be improved.
I also want to update you on the Eagle Ford program this morning, and we've included a map on Slide 26. Now this isn't the same base map again that we used in May, but we've been pretty busy since then. The numbers on the table include 14 more wells drilled, 12 more wells completed and 15 more wells online and producing since May. We're also making great strides in our backlog of completions, and for a period in time in the quarter, we had 3 frac crews working in the field, including moving our Haynesville crew down to the Eagle Ford. And we currently only have 9 wells waiting on completions in fracs. And market has Midstream team continue to make dear progress in installing a gas gathering and a new oil gathering system in the field. In a moment, I'll show you that infrastructure timing will shape the production profile in the second half of the year.
Slide 27 includes an updated chart showing the IP rates for all of our Eagle Ford central wells. The point is about 10 of the wells or about 40% of the total have IP rates greater than 800 barrels per day equivalent. And as we continue to delineate the central area, our wells are consistently producing at or above our type oil. So we're quite happy with the outlook for this program. And remember, this area has -- this central area has between 600 to 800 remaining drilling locations depending on the ultimate well spacing.
Turning to Slide 28. We've updated our Eagle Ford production outlook for the rest of the year. The blue bar shows shut-in volumes, which are shut-in waiting on facilities, which will not be an issue by the fourth quarter. At that point, our gross production could to be up to 20,000 barrels a day equivalent, that's the far right bar in the graph. And we had previously projected that to be around 16,000 barrels a day at our meeting in May. Today, our net E&P productive capacity is about 7,700 barrels and 23 million a day, and it's growing rapidly. 
So I'll wrap up today on Slide 29. There's a lot of excitement in the E&P Company. We're currently hitting our stride. Our teams are executing well, which shows up in the results of our core programs. Our oil volumes show terrific growth in the second half of the year, with the addition of the new Eagle Ford volumes. And as always, we continue to work hard to improve capital efficiencies. Service cost pressures haven't let up, so we keep pushing on every aspect of our business to maintain the efficiency of our capital programs. 
Looking forward, we remain excited about our future opportunities. And although we have a healthy respect for our competitors, we think that post-spinoff, our performance is going to compete well with the best E&P companies. We've got a great drilling inventory, more than 10 years. It's very high-quality, very reputable and increasingly more oily. We'll be meeting frequently with investors and analysts in the coming months, and we hope to see many of you at our E&P and analyst meeting in New York on November 8 for a full update as we prepare for the separation. 
I'll now turn it back to Doug for closing comments."

The customers have filed their testimony. We filed rebuttal testimony, I think, in September. And then we'll go to trial after that. TGP is probably a step or so behind that. We filed our testimony. The customers, I think, they're up in September to do theirs. The litigation is not a bad thing. We've got a good reason people on our side and a reason people on the other side.
