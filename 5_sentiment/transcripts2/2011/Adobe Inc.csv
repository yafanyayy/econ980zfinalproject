This compares to $858.7 million reported in Q1 fiscal 2010 and $1,008,000,000 reported last quarter. Year-over-year, this represents 20% revenue growth. As a reminder, in Q1 fiscal 2010, we had an extra week of revenue due to our 52-53 week financial calendar. This extra week benefited our revenue in the year ago quarter by approximately $35 million and normalizing for the extra week results in high year-over-year growth rates across our business. 
We entered the first quarter with 5% of reported Q4 revenue in shippable backlog, and we exited the first quarter with no shippable backlog. Q1 GAAP operating expenses were $617.7 million compared to $592.5 million reported in Q1 fiscal 2010 and $613.8 million last quarter. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses in Q1 were $539.5 million compared to $498.7 million reported for Q1 fiscal 2010 and $535 million last quarter. GAAP operating income in Q1 fiscal 2011 was $302.3 million or 29.4% of revenue. This compares to GAAP operating income of $176.8 million or 20.6% of revenue in Q1 fiscal 2010 and $286.9 million or 28.5% of revenue last quarter. 
Non-GAAP operating income in Q1 fiscal 2011 was $400.1 million or 38.9% of revenue. This compares to non-GAAP operating income of $289.3 million or 33.7% of revenue in Q1 fiscal 2010 and $384 million or 38.1% of revenue last quarter. Adobe's effective GAAP tax rate in Q1 was 18% and the non-GAAP tax rate was 22%. 
Our GAAP tax rate was higher than targeted due to a one-time charge related to our acquisition of in Q1. Q1 GAAP net income was a $234.6 million compared to $127.2 million reported in Q1 fiscal 2010 and $268.9 million last quarter. Non-GAAP net income in Q1 was $298.1 million compared to $211.7 million reported in Q1 fiscal 2010 and $285.7 million last quarter. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q1 fiscal 2011 were $0.46 based on 511.3 million weighted average shares. This compares with GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.24 reported in Q1 fiscal 2010 based on 532.6 million weighted average shares and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.53 reported last quarter based on 511.9 million weighted average shares. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q1 fiscal 2011 were $0.58. This compares with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.40 in Q1 fiscal 2010 and $0.56 reported last quarter. 
I will now discuss Adobe's results in Q1 by business segment. As we explained in December, we have modified our reporting segments for fiscal 2011. Our Investor Relations website contains our Investor Data Sheet, which has updated fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 segment results to reflect the changes. Based on our prior business segment classification, Q1 results either achieved or exceeded the segment guidance we provided in December. Using our new FY 2011 business segments, results were as follows: Creative and Interactive Solutions segment revenue in Q1 was $424.8 million, compared to $332.6 million in Q1 fiscal 2010 and $404.8 million last quarter. The strength and adoption of our CS products that we experienced in Q4 continued in Q1. 
Digital Media Solutions Q1 revenue was $151.7 million compared to $130.6 million in Q1 fiscal 2010 and $165.9 million last quarter. Photoshop and our video products performed well with the sequential decline attributed to the normal seasonality of our hobbyist products. 
Digital Enterprise Solutions revenue was $286.6 million in Q1 compared to $244.8 million in Q1 fiscal 2010 and $273.3 million last quarter. Within Digital Enterprise Solutions, Knowledge Worker revenue was $181.8 million compared to $165.9 million in Q1 fiscal 2010 and $169.9 million last quarter. Knowledge Worker 10% year-over-year growth was due to Enterprise adoption of the new Acrobat 10 release as well as increases in unit pricing. 
Enterprise segment revenue was $104.8 million compared to $78.9 million in Q1 fiscal 2010 and $103.4 million last quarter. The value proposition of our customer experience management offering is resonating with customers, driving strong year-over-year growth particularly now that our solution includes the Day content management products. 
Omniture segment revenue in Q1 was $110.9 million compared to $96 million reported in Q1 of fiscal 2010 and $109 million last quarter. Omniture transactions increased to $1.38 trillion in Q1 compared to $1.32 trillion in Q4 and were up 12% on a year-over-year basis. Omniture revenue diversification continued with site catalyst at 52% of Q1 Omniture product revenue. Enterprise renewal rates remained at 95% in the quarter. 
Finally, Print and Publishing segment revenue was $53.7 million compared to $54.7 million in Q1 fiscal 2010 and $55 million last quarter. 
Turning to our geographic segments in Q1 results on a percent of revenue basis were as follows: The Americas, 49%; Europe, 31%; Asia, 20%. Revenue in Q1 was driven by strong performance with our Creative, Acrobat and Omniture solutions, as well as a rebound in the education market and seasonal strength in Japan. 
In Enterprise, we saw some large deals pushed out, adding to what was already a strong Enterprise pipeline in Q2. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX reduced revenue by $5.9 million. We had no hedge gains in Q1 FY11 and no hedge gains in Q1 FY10, thus the net year-over-year currency impact reduced Q1 revenue by $5.9 million. 
From a quarter-over-quarter perspective, FX reduced revenue by $1.7 million. We have no hedge gains in Q1 FY11 versus $0.7 million of hedge gains in Q4 FY10. Thus the net sequential decreased revenue considering hedging gains was $2.4 million. Employees at the end of Q1 totaled 9,503 versus 9,117 at the end of last quarter. The increase was primarily on sales and marketing as well as in R&D and lower cost geographies. 
Our trade DSO was 47 days, which compares to 40 days in the year ago quarter and 50 days last quarter. Our global channel inventory position at the end of the quarter was within company policy. 
During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $332 million. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $2.6 billion compared to $2.5 billion at the end of Q4. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares at a total cost of $83.4 million. 
Entering Q2, $41.6 million remains outstanding and open prepayments for stock repurchases. $875 billion of stock repurchase authority remains against the $1.6 billion stock repurchase authorization announced in July of last year. Deferred revenue in the quarter increased by $14 million in the quarter to a total of $443 million. 
This concludes my discussion of our financial results. I would now like to comment on our financial targets for the second quarter of fiscal 2011. 
Our hearts go out to everyone in Japan. Although Adobe has a very diversified business, Japan is our second largest country from a revenue perspective and March is typically our biggest revenue month of the year there due to fiscal year end spending. Given the uncertain business environment in Japan, we are being prudent and have reduced our revenue expectation for our second quarter by $50 million or roughly 1/3 of our original Q2 revenue expectation for Japan. With this reduction, we are targeting a Q2 revenue range of $970 million to $1,020,000,000. 
By business segment, we expect Omniture and Enterprise to grow sequentially and we expect all the other business segments to decline sequentially due to the impact from Japan. Geographically, we expect Asia to decline sequentially, whereas the Americas and EMEA are expected to be flat to slightly up. 
For margins, we are targeting a Q2 GAAP operating margin range of 24.5% to 27.5% and a non-GAAP operating margin range of 34% to 36%. We are targeting our Q2 share count to be 510 million to 512 million shares. We are targeting nonoperating expense to be between $16 million and $20 million on both our GAAP and non-GAAP basis. 
For our Q2 effective GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates, we are targeting 22%. These targets lead to a GAAP earnings per share range of $0.33 to $0.40 per share, and a non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.47 to $0.54. 
This concludes my section. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Shantanu."

Adobe is leading the revolution in how digital experiences are created, managed, distributed, measured and monetized in this multiscreen world. We continue to deliver innovative solutions to a broader set of customers, which is helping to successfully transform Adobe into a more diversified software company with large opportunities for new growth. 
As we have previously shared with you, we are focused on three significant growth opportunities: content offering, customer experience management and online marketing optimization, and I'll spend a few minutes covering the highlights from each area today. 
In content offering, we achieved strong year-over-year growth with our Creative products and CS5 continued to perform well. In Q1, we announced general availability of the Adobe Digital Publishing Suite, a comprehensive solution to create, distribute, monetize and analyze digital content including magazines, newspapers and corporate publications. Early demand for the Digital Publishing Suite has been strong across the world with over 150 titles already made available through app stores including National Geographic, Consumer Reports, Reader's Digest and Vogue. 
In addition, corporate publications from Credit Suisse, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo showed that used cases for this solution extend beyond newspapers and magazines, and we expect future publications to include catalogs and other traditional print content that will be migrated for consumption and use on tablets. 
The Digital Publishing Suite publishes to Android tablets included Motorola Zoom and Samsung Galaxy tab, as well as IOS devices. And in the future, to the Playbook when it is made available. We will continue to expand our content authoring offerings by providing a mid-cycle release to CS5. The release will enhance our Digital Publishing capabilities, help customers address the multi-screen challenges they face and includes new innovative features in areas like HTML and Flash authoring, application creation and video authoring and production. 
One of the pillars of our content authoring strategy is to continue to invest in HTML as a key part of our tools portfolio, and we made a Flash to HTML converter available last month. We anticipate this tool can be used by Flash designers and developers to extend their work in Flash to platforms that do not yet support the Flash Player. 
We continue to see strong momentum for our Flash and AIR technologies. Strategy analytics, forecast more than 132 million smart phones or 36% of all smart phones will support Flash player in 2011. More than 84 million smart phones and tablets support AIR, including IOS devices, and we expect that to grow to more than 200 million by the end of 2011. In 2010, we also drove 100% year-over-year growth in video streaming via Flash. 
Last Friday, we made Flash Player 10.2 available for download on the Android Market. This is a new release for Android devices as well as the beta release for new targets running. Flash Player 10.2 brings improved performance and a full Web browsing experience including video games and other interactive content. 
In customer experience management, awareness of our solution is growing as organizations are focusing on how to improve interactions with their customers in an increasingly digital world. We are well-positioned to lead this emerging category with new solutions, integrating our LiveCycle, Connect and Day products. The Day acquisition, which closed in Q4, has gone smoothly with the new version of the Day CQ 5 solution, integrating Omniture analytics capabilities already released earlier this month. 
This comprehensive Web content management, rich media delivery and social collaboration capabilities helped us close multiproduct agreements with customers such as Diamler, Nielsen and General Motors, more importantly, we enter Q4 with a strong Enterprise pipeline. 
Our Acrobat business performed well in Q1. Adoption of the new Acrobat 10 product was strong during the quarter, driven by strong Enterprise licensing adoption. In online marketing, momentum continues to be strong in our Omniture business. We add our Adobe Omniture Summit two years ago with the sellout crowd of 2,600 marketers. At the Summit, we announced a new next-generation platform for the Adobe Online Marketing Suite designed to handle increased loads of data from social, mobile and video. 
We also launched Adobe Social Analytics, a single application that can aggregate also social network and online community activity to determine the impact on sentiment, brand perception and business metrics. We are on pace to measure 5 trillion transactions this year for our customers with mobile being the fastest-growing segment of our Analytics business. 
Our acquisition of, a leading data management platform company, closed in January and has already begun enhancing our Omniture offerings with audience optimization capabilities to help advertisers and publishers to maximize their online ad investment. Those capabilities along with the Web content management capabilities acquired from Day Software has served as a compelling value proposition to online marketers and publishers. 
While our progress in each of the growth areas, content offering, customer experience management and online marketing optimization, is exciting individually, the real power is where we see these areas converging to serve our customers' entire workflow. For example, T-Mobile delivers outstanding customer service and saves millions annually by using Creative Suite, the Flash Platform, LiveCycle and Omniture to transform customer experience in stores and online. Likewise, MTV Networks uses Creative Suite and Flash to deliver its online content and Omniture to enhance customer viewing experiences and increase website revenues worldwide. 
An end-to-end value proposition is Adobe's unique differentiation. 
I would like to close by saying how concerned we are about the tragedy in Japan. We are grateful that all our employees in Japan are safe and hope that the situation improves soon. Given the uncertain business environment in Japan, we chose to be prudent with our Q2 financial targets. 
Adobe's vision of changing the world through digital experiences is more relevant than ever before. Moving forward, we will continue to focus on our three large growth opportunities: content offering, customer experience management and online marketing optimization.  Thank you for joining us today. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Mike."

So actually, let me start with maybe a little bit of color on the rest of this year and then I'll address your 10% question specifically. If you remember back in December, we said, if you look through the rest of the year that we would have a slight revenue increase in the second quarter that we would see a normal seasonal decline in the third quarter, and then we'd see seasonal strength in the sequential growth in the fourth quarter. And that OpEx will grow during the year, so as a result, margins would be slightly down in Q2, down again in Q3 and up in Q4. That's what we originally said back in December. That was of course, prior to the Japan tragedy and prior to what happened in Japan, we were on track to deliver against that guidance. There's kind of two scenarios now that I would paint for you. One is if Japan's Q2 is really impacted by the 50 million and then begins to recover, most likely, Q3 would now be up sequentially, and then seasonal strength would bring sequential growth again in the fourth quarter, margins would grow sequentially in Q3 and again in Q4. That's one scenario. The second would be if the impact of the situation in Japan is in Q2 much less than the $50 million, then our original quarter color is more likely to pan out. We continue to believe in our growth opportunities. We are taking prudent expense actions but nothing drastic on the operating expense side. But until we see Japan improve, we do plan to keep operating expense relatively flat from Q2 to Q3. There will probably be a seasonal uptick to OpEx in the fourth quarter primarily in sales and marketing. So if you look at all of that as it relates to your question over the 10%. Back in December, we did anticipate 10% revenue growth. But honestly, until we learn more about the true impact of Japan, it's just not prudent to comment on longer term targets right now."

If you look at the first quarter CS, Acrobat and Omniture all performed really well in the first quarter. The Enterprise value proposition is really resonating with customers. And we did see some large deals, as I said, push into the second order in the Enterprise space. Day was factored into our Q1 targets. It's now an integral part of that CEM solution. And it's a large reason why we believe we can continue to grow this business 20%. If some of those deals didn't push into the second quarter, we probably would've been frankly, towards the higher end of our range as opposed to over slightly over the middle of the range. And like I said as well, the Q2 pipeline for Enterprise is very strong. So if you net it out, we are happy with the quarter.

As Shantanu said, the most important thing is we've accounted for all of the employees. We have roughly 300 people in the Tokyo office in virtually every function, but primarily, sales and marketing with some R&D folks. We don't have any manufacturing operations in Japan as it relates to creating the Shrink Wrap. We have asked our employees to work from home for now given the rolling blackouts and the difficulties with transportation. If you look at our first quarter for Japan, it was seasonally strong just as a we had expected. And, if you look at it March, which falls in our Q2, is the largest month of the year for us in Japan. And the first week of Q2 prior to the earthquake was really strong so we got off to a great start in the second quarter as we expected, but there is no doubt that the pace of the revenue has changed since the earthquake. So what we're looking at in detail and we've spent quite a bit of time on this and frankly, is weekly sell-through data for the first few weeks of the quarter, sales on Adobe.com for the first few weeks of the quarter, our Enterprise sales pipeline and when we factor all that together and look at what we've seen so far, we come up with a $50 million negative impact or roughly 30% of our Q2 revenue. And that's all we can do frankly at this point in time. In terms of how that starts to improve and the pace of that improvement over Q2, Q3, Q4, it's honestly too early to say. But obviously, when we get through the quarter, we'll tell you exactly how we did in Japan and be very transparent about how that played out relative to this $50 million."

I think as it relates to the Digital Publishing Suite, the reason why we are excited is frankly, it enables us to deliver authoring content, authoring not just on the desktop the way we've been doing but we actually extend that offering by also providing a hosted solution. Just for others as well on the call, the revenue model associated with the Digital Publishing Suite, we have two editions right now. We have an Enterprise Edition and we have a Professional Edition. And the Enterprise Edition fundamentally has a few more customization as well as enterprise-level features, including analytics built in for example, using the Omniture Side Catalyst and the Professional editing addition is really more about the standardized midmarket. And as I said again, we really think that the Publishing Suite is going to be used not just for newspapers and magazines, which is the first beachhead but much like in design, we expect book publishers as well as Professional material to start using the Digital Publishing Suite. The cost of the solution currently, we charge a yearly platform fee. And then in addition to that, there's a downloaded per issue fee, which depends frankly on the publisher volume that exists. And in terms of the current beta testers now that they moved to the generally available version, our business model seems to be resonating with them and the pipeline continues to be healthy. That is so early in the development. But as you see more tablets and more, as you see every single publisher whether it be an Enterprise publisher, whether it be a government publisher or a Media publisher, they will need a solution what the Digital Publishing Suite to  get their content out to all of the different devices that exist. So I think that we're very well-positioned. All of the titles frankly, are still in the U.S. and when you start to think about how we get geographic expansion, there's a lot of opportunity up ahead for us."

This compares to $858.7 million reported in Q1 fiscal 2010 and $1,008,000,000 reported last quarter. Year-over-year, this represents 20% revenue growth. As a reminder, in Q1 fiscal 2010, we had an extra week of revenue due to our 52-53 week financial calendar. This extra week benefited our revenue in the year-ago quarter by approximately $35 million and normalizing for the extra week results in high year-over-year growth rates across our business. 
We entered the first quarter with 5% of reported Q4 revenue in shippable backlog, and we exited the first quarter with no shippable backlog. Q1 GAAP operating expenses were $617.7 million compared to $592.5 million reported in Q1 fiscal 2010 and $613.8 million last quarter. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses in Q1 were $539.5 million compared to $498.7 million reported for Q1 fiscal 2010 and $535 million last quarter. GAAP operating income in Q1 fiscal 2011 was $302.3 million or 29.4% of revenue. This compares to GAAP operating income of $176.8 million or 20.6% of revenue in Q1 fiscal 2010 and $286.9 million or 28.5% of revenue last quarter. 
Non-GAAP operating income in Q1 fiscal 2011 was $400.1 million or 38.9% of revenue. This compares to non-GAAP operating income of $289.3 million or 33.7% of revenue in Q1 fiscal 2010 and $384 million or 38.1% of revenue last quarter. Adobe's effective GAAP tax rate in Q1 was 18% and the non-GAAP tax rate was 22%. Our GAAP tax rate was higher than targeted due to a one-time charge related to our acquisition of Demdex in Q1. Q1 GAAP net income was $234.6 million compared to $127.2 million reported in Q1 fiscal 2010 and $268.9 million last quarter. Non-GAAP net income in Q1 was $298.1 million compared to $211.7 million reported in Q1 fiscal 2010 and $285.7 million last quarter. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q1 fiscal 2011 were $0.46 based on 511.3 million weighted average shares. This compares with GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.24 reported in Q1 fiscal 2010 based on 532.6 million weighted average shares and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.53 reported last quarter based on 511.9 million weighted average shares. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q1 fiscal 2011 were $0.58. This compares with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.40 in Q1 fiscal 2010 and $0.56 reported last quarter. 
I will now discuss Adobe's results in Q1 by business segment. As we explained in December, we have modified our reporting segments for fiscal 2011. Our Investor Relations website contains our Investor Data Sheet, which has updated fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 segment results to reflect the changes. Based on our prior business segment classification, Q1 results either achieved or exceeded the segment guidance we provided in December. Using our new FY 2011 business segments, results were as follows: Creative and Interactive Solutions segment revenue in Q1 was $424.8 million, compared to $332.6 million in Q1 fiscal 2010 and $404.8 million last quarter. The strength and adoption of our CS products that we experienced in Q4 continued in Q1. 
Digital Media Solutions Q1 revenue was $151.7 million compared to $130.6 million in Q1 fiscal 2010 and $165.9 million last quarter. Photoshop and our video products performed well with the sequential decline attributed to the normal seasonality of our hobbyist products. 
Digital Enterprise Solutions revenue was $286.6 million in Q1 compared to $244.8 million in Q1 fiscal 2010 and $273.3 million last quarter. Within Digital Enterprise Solutions, Knowledge Worker revenue was $181.8 million compared to $165.9 million in Q1 fiscal 2010 and $169.9 million last quarter. Knowledge Worker 10% year-over-year growth was due to Enterprise adoption of the new Acrobat 10 release, as well as increases in unit pricing. 
Enterprise segment revenue was $104.8 million compared to $78.9 million in Q1 fiscal 2010 and $103.4 million last quarter. The value proposition of our customer experience management offering is resonating with customers, driving strong year-over-year growth, particularly now that our solution includes the Day content management products. 
Omniture segment revenue in Q1 was $110.9 million compared to $96 million reported in Q1 of fiscal 2010 and $109 million last quarter. Omniture transactions increased to $1.38 trillion in Q1 compared to $1.32 trillion in Q4, and were up 12% on a year-over-year basis. Omniture revenue diversification continued with site catalyst at 52% of Q1 Omniture product revenue. Enterprise renewal rates remained at 95% in the quarter. Finally, Print and Publishing segment revenue was $53.7 million compared to $54.7 million in Q1 fiscal 2010 and $55 million last quarter. 
Turning to our geographic segments in Q1 results on a percent of revenue basis were as follows: The Americas, 49%; Europe, 31%; Asia, 20%. Revenue in Q1 was driven by strong performance with our Creative, Acrobat and Omniture solutions, as well as a rebound in the education market and seasonal strength in Japan. 
In Enterprise, we saw some large deals pushed out, adding to what was already a strong Enterprise pipeline in Q2. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX reduced revenue by $5.9 million. We had no hedge gains in Q1 FY11 and no hedge gains in Q1 FY10, thus the net year-over-year currency impact reduced Q1 revenue by $5.9 million. 
From a quarter-over-quarter perspective, FX reduced revenue by $1.7 million. We had no hedge gains in Q1 FY11 versus $0.7 million of hedge gains in Q4 FY10. Thus the net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $2.4 million. Employees at the end of Q1 totaled 9,503 versus 9,117 at the end of last quarter. The increase was primarily on sales and marketing, as well as in R&D and lower cost geographies. 
Our trade DSO was 47 days, which compares to 40 days in the year-ago quarter and 50 days last quarter. Our global channel inventory position at the end of the quarter was within company policy. 
During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $332 million. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $2.6 billion compared to $2.5 billion at the end of Q4. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares at a total cost of $83.4 million. 
Entering Q2, $41.6 million remains outstanding and open prepayments for stock repurchases. $875 billion of stock repurchase authority remains against the $1.6 billion stock repurchase authorization announced in July of last year. Deferred revenue in the quarter increased by $14 million in the quarter to a total of $443 million. This concludes my discussion of our financial results. I would now like to comment on our financial targets for the second quarter of fiscal 2011. 
Our hearts go out to everyone in Japan. Although Adobe has a very diversified business, Japan is our second largest country from a revenue perspective, and March is typically our biggest revenue month of the year there due to fiscal year-end spending. Given the uncertain business environment in Japan, we are being prudent and have reduced our revenue expectation for our second quarter by $50 million or roughly 1/3 of our original Q2 revenue expectation for Japan. With this reduction, we are targeting a Q2 revenue range of $970 million to $1,020,000,000. 
By business segment, we expect Omniture and Enterprise to grow sequentially and we expect all the other business segments to decline sequentially due to the impact from Japan. Geographically, we expect Asia to decline sequentially, whereas the Americas and EMEA are expected to be flat to slightly up. 
For margins, we are targeting a Q2 GAAP operating margin range of 24.5% to 27.5% and a non-GAAP operating margin range of 34% to 36%. We are targeting our Q2 share count to be 510 million to 512 million shares. We are targeting nonoperating expense to be between $16 million and $20 million on both our GAAP and non-GAAP basis. 
For our Q2 effective GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates, we are targeting 22%. These targets lead to a GAAP earnings per share range of $0.33 to $0.40 per share, and a non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.47 to $0.54. This concludes my section. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Shantanu."

Adobe is leading the revolution in how digital experiences are created, managed, distributed, measured and monetized in this multiscreen world. We continue to deliver innovative solutions to a broader set of customers, which is helping to successfully transform Adobe into a more diversified software company with large opportunities for new growth. 
As we have previously shared with you, we are focused on three significant growth opportunities: content offering, customer experience management and online marketing optimization, and I'll spend a few minutes covering the highlights from each area today. 
In content offering, we achieved strong year-over-year growth with our Creative products and CS5 continue to perform well. In Q1, we announced general availability of the Adobe Digital Publishing Suite, a comprehensive solution to create, distribute, monetize and analyze digital content including magazines, newspapers and corporate publications. Early demand for the Digital Publishing Suite has been strong across the world with over 150 titles already made available through app stores including National Geographic, Consumer Reports, Reader's Digest and Vogue. 
In addition, corporate publications from Credit Suisse, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo showed that used cases for this solution extend beyond newspapers and magazines, and we expect future publications to include catalogs and other traditional print content that will be migrated for consumption and use on tablets. 
The Digital Publishing Suite publishes to Android tablets included Motorola Xoom and Samsung Galaxy Tab, as well as iOS devices. And in the future, to the Rim PlayBook when it is made available. We will continue to expand our content authoring offerings by providing a mid-cycle release to CS5. The release will enhance our Digital Publishing capabilities, help customers address the multi-screen challenges they face and include new innovative features in areas like HTML and Flash authoring, application creation and video authoring and production. 
One of the pillars of our content authoring strategy is to continue to invest in HTML as a key part of our tools portfolio, and we made a Flash to HTML converter available last month. We anticipate this tool can be used by Flash designers and developers to extend their work in Flash to platforms that do not yet support the Flash Player. 
We continue to see strong momentum for our Flash and AIR technologies. Strategy analytics, forecast more than 132 million smart phones or 36% of all smart phones will support Flash player in 2011. More than 84 million smart phones and tablets support AIR, including iOS devices, and we expect that to grow to more than 200 million by the end of 2011. In 2010, we also drove 100% year-over-year growth in video streaming via Flash. 
Last Friday, we made Flash Player 10.2 available for download on the Android Market. This is a new release for Android devices, as well as the beta release for new targets running Honeycomb. Flash Player 10.2 brings improved performance and a full Web browsing experience, including video games and other interactive content. 
In customer experience management, awareness of our solution is growing as organizations are focusing on how to improve interactions with their customers in an increasingly-digital world. We're well-positioned to lead this emerging category with new solutions, integrating our LiveCycle, Connect and Day products. The Day acquisition, which closed in Q4, has gone smoothly with the new version of the Day CQ5 solution, integrating Omniture analytics capabilities, already released earlier this month. 
This comprehensive Web content management, rich media delivery and social collaboration capabilities helped us close multiproduct agreements with customers such as Diamler, Nissan and General Motors, more importantly, we enter Q4 with a strong Enterprise pipeline. 
Our Acrobat business performed well in Q1. Adoption of the new Acrobat 10 product was strong during the quarter, driven by strong Enterprise licensing adoption. In online marketing, momentum continues to be strong in our Omniture business. We add our Adobe Omniture summit two weeks ago with a sellout crowd of 2,600 marketers. At the summit, we announced a new next-generation platform for the Adobe Online Marketing Suite designed to handle increased loads of data from social, mobile and video. 
We also launched Adobe SocialAnalytics, a single application that can aggregate all social network and online community activity to determine the impact on sentiment, brand perception and business metrics. We're on pace to measure 5 trillion transactions this year for our customers, with Mobile being the fastest-growing segment of our Analytics business. 
Our acquisition of Demdex, a leading data management platform company, closed in January and has already begun enhancing our Omniture offerings with audience optimization capabilities to help advertisers and publishers to maximize their online ad investment. Those capabilities, along with the Web content management capabilities acquired from Day Software, have served as a compelling value proposition to online marketers and publishers. 
While our progress in each of the three growth areas, content offering, customer experience management and online marketing optimization, is exciting individually, the real power is where we see these areas converging to serve our customers' entire workflow. For example, T-Mobile delivers outstanding customer service and saves millions annually by using Creative Suite, the Flash Platform, LiveCycle and Omniture to transform customer experience in stores and online. Likewise, MTV Networks uses Creative Suite and Flash to deliver its online content, and Omniture to enhance customer viewing experiences and increase website revenues worldwide. That end-to-end value proposition is Adobe's unique differentiation. 
I would like to close by saying how concerned we are about the tragedy in Japan. We are grateful that all our employees in Japan are safe and hope that the situation improves soon. Given the uncertain business environment in Japan, we chose to be prudent with our Q2 financial targets. 
Adobe's mission of changing the world through digital experiences is more relevant than ever before. Moving forward, we will continue to focus on our three large growth opportunities: content offering, customer experience management and online marketing optimization. Thank you for joining us today. Now I'll turn the call back over to Mike."

One is if Japan's Q2 is really impacted by the 50 million and then begins to recover, most likely, Q3 would now be up sequentially, and then seasonal strength would bring sequential growth again in the fourth quarter, margins would grow sequentially in Q3 and again in Q4. That's one scenario. The second would be if the impact of the situation in Japan is in Q2 much less than the $50 million, then our original quarter color is more likely to pan out. We continue to believe in our growth opportunities, we're taking prudent expense actions but nothing drastic on the operating expense side. But until we see Japan improve, we do plan to keep operating expense relatively flat from Q2 to Q3. There'll probably be a seasonal uptick to OpEx in the fourth quarter primarily, in sales and marketing. So if you look at all of that as it relates to your question over the 10%, back in December, we did anticipate 10% revenue growth. But honestly, until we learn more about the true impact of Japan, it's just not prudent to comment on longer-term targets right now."

If you look at the first quarter CS, Acrobat and Omniture all performed really well in the first quarter. The Enterprise value proposition is really resonating with customers. And we did see some large deals, as I said, push into the second order in the Enterprise space. Day was factored into our Q1 targets. It's now an integral part of that CEM Solution, and it's a large reason why we believe we can continue to grow this business 20%. If some of those deals didn't push into the second quarter, we probably would've been frankly, towards the higher end of our range as opposed to over slightly over the middle of the range. And like I said as well, the Q2 pipeline for Enterprise is very strong. So if you net it out, we're happy with the quarter. Yes, we ended the quarter with no backlog but again, that's factored into the guidance."

As Shantanu said, the most important thing is we've accounted for all the employees. We have roughly 300 people in the Tokyo office, in virtually every function, but primarily, sales and marketing with some R&D folks. We don't have any manufacturing operations in Japan as it relates to creating the shrink wrap. We have asked our employees to work from home for now, given the rolling blackouts and the difficulties with transportation. If you look at our first quarter for Japan, it was seasonally strong just as we had expected. And Brent, if you look at it March, which falls in our Q2, it is the largest month of the year for us in Japan. And the first week of Q2 prior to the earthquake was really strong, so we got off to a great start in the second quarter as we expected, but there is no doubt that the pace of the revenue has changed since the earthquake. So what we're looking at in detail, and we've spent quite a bit of time on this and frankly, is weekly sell-through data for the first few weeks of the quarter, sales on Adobe.com for the first few weeks of the quarter, our Enterprise sales pipeline and when we factor all that together and look at what we've seen so far, we come up with a $50 million negative impact or roughly 30% of our Q2 revenue. And that's all we can do frankly at this point in time. In terms of how that starts to improve and the pace of that improvement over Q2, Q3, Q4, it's honestly too early to say. But obviously, when we get through the quarter, we'll tell you exactly how we did in Japan and be very transparent about how that played out relative to this $50 million."

Just for others as well on the call, the revenue model associated with the Digital Publishing Suite, we have two editions right now. We have an Enterprise Edition and we have a Professional Edition. And the Enterprise Edition fundamentally has a few more customization, as well as enterprise-level features, including analytics built in for example, using the Omniture Side Catalyst and the Professional editing addition is really more about the standardized midmarket. And as I said again, we really think that the Publishing Suite is going to be used not just for newspapers and magazines, which is the first beachhead but much like in design, we expect book publishers as well as Professional material, to start using the Digital Publishing Suite. The cost of the solution currently, we charge a yearly platform fee. And then in addition to that, there's a downloaded per issue fee, which depends frankly on the publisher volume that exists. And in terms of the current beta testers now that they've moved to the generally available version, our business model seems to be resonating with them and the pipeline continues to be healthy. That is so early in the development. But as you see more tablets emerge, as you see every single publisher, whether it be an Enterprise publisher, whether it be a government publisher or a Media publisher, they will need a solution what the Digital Publishing Suite to get their content out to all of the different devices that exist. So I think they're very well-positioned. All of the titles frankly, are still in the U.S. and when you start to think about how we get geographic expansion, there's a lot of opportunity up ahead for us."

As it relates to Omniture, I do want to reiterate, we had a very, very successful Omniture Marketing summit that we had.

The real impetus for releasing a new version of the core platform is to frankly, enable it to continue to be efficient and to start to address the issues as it relates to social, video, as well as mobile. I mean the amount of mobile growth that we're seeing through side Catalyst, exceeds the growth that we're seeing, clearly on PCs. And so the upgrade process for most customers is fairly transparent. As you can imagine as a SaaS-based business, we moved them from one version of the product or platform to another version of the product. And so our new customers will start to move onto the new platform. We'll start to see the efficiencies associated with it. But frankly within the context of Adobe, and from a CapEx point of view, all of that is factored into the target that Mark gives.

This compares to $858.7 million reported in Q1 fiscal 2010 and $1,008,000,000 reported last quarter. Year-over-year, this represents 20% revenue growth. As a reminder, in Q1 fiscal 2010, we had an extra week of revenue due to our 52-53 week financial calendar. This extra week benefited our revenue in the year-ago quarter by approximately $35 million, and normalizing for the extra week results in high year-over-year growth rates across our business. 
We entered the first quarter with 5% of reported Q4 revenue in shippable backlog, and we exited the first quarter with no shippable backlog. Q1 GAAP operating expenses were $617.7 million compared to $592.5 million reported in Q1 fiscal 2010 and $613.8 million last quarter. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses in Q1 were $539.5 million compared to $498.7 million reported for Q1 fiscal 2010 and $535 million last quarter. GAAP operating income in Q1 fiscal 2011 was $302.3 million, or 29.4% of revenue. This compares to GAAP operating income of $176.8 million, or 20.6% of revenue in Q1 fiscal 2010, and $286.9 million, or 28.5% of revenue last quarter. 
Non-GAAP operating income in Q1 fiscal 2011 was $400.1 million, or 38.9% of revenue. This compares to non-GAAP operating income of $289.3 million, or 33.7% of revenue in Q1 fiscal 2010, and $384 million, or 38.1% of revenue last quarter. Adobe's effective GAAP tax rate in Q1 was 18% and the non-GAAP tax rate was 22%. Our GAAP tax rate was higher than targeted due to a one-time charge related to our acquisition of Demdex in Q1. Q1 GAAP net income was $234.6 million compared to $127.2 million reported in Q1 fiscal 2010 and $268.9 million last quarter. Non-GAAP net income in Q1 was $298.1 million compared to $211.7 million reported in Q1 fiscal 2010 and $285.7 million last quarter. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q1 fiscal 2011 were $0.46 based on 511.3 million weighted average shares. This compares with GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.24 reported in Q1 fiscal 2010 based on 532.6 million weighted average shares and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.53 reported last quarter based on 511.9 million weighted average shares. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q1 fiscal 2011 were $0.58. This compares with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.40 in Q1 fiscal 2010 and $0.56 reported last quarter. 
I will now discuss Adobe's results in Q1 by business segment. As we explained in December, we have modified our reporting segments for fiscal 2011. Our Investor Relations website contains our Investor Data Sheet, which has updated fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 segment results to reflect the changes. Based on our prior business segment classification, Q1 results either achieved or exceeded the segment guidance we provided in December. Using our new FY 2011 business segments, results were as follows: Creative and Interactive Solutions segment revenue in Q1 was $424.8 million, compared to $332.6 million in Q1 fiscal 2010 and $404.8 million last quarter. The strength and adoption of our CS products that we experienced in Q4 continued in Q1. 
Digital Media Solutions Q1 revenue was $151.7 million compared to $130.6 million in Q1 fiscal 2010 and $165.9 million last quarter. Photoshop and our video products performed well, with the sequential decline attributed to the normal seasonality of our hobbyist products. 
Digital Enterprise Solutions revenue was $286.6 million in Q1 compared to $244.8 million in Q1 fiscal 2010 and $273.3 million last quarter. Within Digital Enterprise Solutions, Knowledge Worker revenue was $181.8 million compared to $165.9 million in Q1 fiscal 2010 and $169.9 million last quarter. Knowledge Worker 10% year-over-year growth was due to Enterprise adoption of the new Acrobat 10 release as well as increases in unit pricing. 
Enterprise segment revenue was $104.8 million compared to $78.9 million in Q1 fiscal 2010 and $103.4 million last quarter. The value proposition of our customer experience management offering is resonating with customers, driving strong year-over-year growth, particularly now that our solution includes the Day content management products. 
Omniture segment revenue in Q1 was $110.9 million compared to $96 million reported in Q1 of fiscal 2010 and $109 million last quarter. Omniture transactions increased to $1.38 trillion in Q1 compared to $1.32 trillion in Q4 and were up 12% on a year-over-year basis. Omniture revenue diversification continued, with SiteCatalyst at 52% of Q1 Omniture product revenue. Enterprise renewal rates remained at 95% in the quarter. Finally, Print and Publishing segment revenue was $53.7 million compared to $54.7 million in Q1 fiscal 2010 and $55 million last quarter. 
Turning to our geographic segments in Q1, results on a percent of revenue basis were as follows: the Americas, 49%; Europe, 31%; Asia, 20%. Revenue in Q1 was driven by strong performance with our Creative, Acrobat and Omniture solutions as well as a rebound in the education market and seasonal strength in Japan. 
In Enterprise, we saw some large deals pushed out, adding to what was already a strong Enterprise pipeline in Q2. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX reduced revenue by $5.9 million. We had no hedge gains in Q1 FY11 and no hedge gains in Q1 FY10.  Thus the net year-over-year currency impact reduced Q1 revenue by $5.9 million. 
From a quarter-over-quarter perspective, FX reduced revenue by $1.7 million. We had no hedge gains in Q1 FY11 versus $0.7 million of hedge gains in Q4 FY10. Thus the net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $2.4 million. Employees at the end of Q1 totaled 9,503 versus 9,117 at the end of last quarter. The increase was primarily in sales and marketing as well as in R&D and lower-cost geographies. 
Our trade DSO was 47 days, which compares to 40 days in the year-ago quarter and 50 days last quarter. Our global channel inventory position at the end of the quarter was within company policy. 
During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $332 million. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $2.6 billion compared to $2.5 billion at the end of Q4. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares at a total cost of $83.4 million. 
Entering Q2, $41.6 million remains outstanding in open prepayments for stock repurchases. $875 billion of stock repurchase authority remains against the $1.6 billion stock repurchase authorization announced in July of last year. Deferred revenue in the quarter increased by $14 million in the quarter to a total of $443 million. 
This concludes my discussion of our financial results. I would now like to comment on our financial targets for the second quarter of fiscal 2011. 
Our hearts go out to everyone in Japan. Although Adobe has a very diversified business, Japan is our second-largest country from a revenue perspective, and March is typically our biggest revenue month of the year there due to fiscal year-end spending. Given the uncertain business environment in Japan, we are being prudent and have reduced our revenue expectation for our second quarter by $50 million, or roughly 1/3 of our original Q2 revenue expectation for Japan. With this reduction, we are targeting a Q2 revenue range of $970 million to $1,020,000,000. 
By business segment, we expect Omniture and Enterprise to grow sequentially, and we expect all the other business segments to decline sequentially due to the impact from Japan. Geographically, we expect Asia to decline sequentially, whereas the Americas and EMEA are expected to be flat to slightly up. 
For margins, we are targeting a Q2 GAAP operating margin range of 24.5% to 27.5% and a non-GAAP operating margin range of 34% to 36%. We are targeting our Q2 share count to be 510 million to 512 million shares. We are targeting non-operating expense to be between $16 million and $20 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. 
For our Q2 effective GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates, we are targeting 22%. These targets lead to a GAAP earnings per share range of $0.33 to $0.40 per share and a non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.47 to $0.54. 
This concludes my section. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Shantanu."

Adobe is leading the revolution in how digital experiences are created, managed, distributed, measured and monetized in this multiscreen world. We continue to deliver innovative solutions to a broader set of customers, which is helping to successfully transform Adobe into a more diversified software company with large opportunities for new growth. 
As we have previously shared with you, we are focused on three significant growth opportunities: content offering, customer experience management and online marketing optimization, and I'll spend a few minutes covering the highlights from each area today. 
In content offering, we achieved strong year-over-year growth with our Creative products, and CS5 continue to perform well. In Q1, we announced general availability of the Adobe Digital Publishing Suite, a comprehensive solution to create, distribute, monetize and analyze digital content including magazines, newspapers and corporate publications. Early demand for the Digital Publishing Suite has been strong across the world, with over 150 titles already made available through app stores including National Geographic, Consumer Reports, Reader's Digest and Vogue. 
In addition, corporate publications from Credit Suisse, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo showed that use cases for this solution extend beyond newspapers and magazines, and we expect future publications to include catalogs and other traditional print content that will be migrated for consumption and use on tablets. 
The Digital Publishing Suite publishes to Android tablets, including Motorola Xoom and Samsung Galaxy Tab, as well as iOS devices and, in the future, to the RIM PlayBook when it is made available. We will continue to expand our content authoring offerings by providing a mid-cycle release to CS5. The release will enhance our Digital Publishing capabilities, help customers address the multi-screen challenges they face and include new innovative features in areas like HTML and Flash authoring, application creation and video authoring and production. 
One of the pillars of our content authoring strategy is to continue to invest in HTML as a key part of our tools portfolio, and we made a Flash-to-HTML converter available last month. We anticipate this tool can be used by Flash designers and developers to extend their work in Flash to platforms that do not yet support the Flash Player. 
We continue to see strong momentum for our Flash and AIR technologies. Strategy analytics forecast more than 132 million smart phones, or 36% of all smart phones, will support Flash player in 2011. More than 84 million smart phones and tablets support AIR, including iOS devices, and we expect that to grow to more than 200 million by the end of 2011. In 2010, we also drove 100% year-over-year growth in video streaming via Flash. 
Last Friday, we made Flash Player 10.2 available for download on the Android Market. This is a new release for Android devices as well as the beta release for new tablets running Honeycomb. Flash Player 10.2 brings improved performance and a full Web browsing experience, including video games and other interactive content. 
In customer experience management, awareness of our solution is growing as organizations are focusing on how to improve interactions with their customers in an increasingly digital world. We're well-positioned to lead this emerging category with new solutions integrating our LiveCycle, Connect and Day products. The Day acquisition, which closed in Q4, has gone smoothly with the new version of the Day CQ5 solution integrating Omniture analytics capabilities already released earlier this month. 
This comprehensive Web content management, rich media delivery and social collaboration capabilities helped us close multiproduct agreements with customers such as Daimler, Nissan and General Motors.  More importantly, we enter Q4 with a strong Enterprise pipeline. 
Our Acrobat business performed well in Q1. Adoption of the new Acrobat 10 product was strong during the quarter, driven by strong Enterprise licensing adoption. In online marketing, momentum continues to be strong in our Omniture business. We had our Adobe Omniture summit two weeks ago with a sellout crowd of 2,600 marketers. At the summit, we announced a new next-generation platform for the Adobe Online Marketing Suite designed to handle increased loads of data from social, mobile and video. 
We also launched Adobe SocialAnalytics, a single application that can aggregate all social network and online community activity to determine the impact on sentiment, brand perception and business metrics. We're on pace to measure 5 trillion transactions this year for our customers, with Mobile being the fastest-growing segment of our Analytics business. 
Our acquisition of Demdex, a leading data management platform company, closed in January and has already begun enhancing our Omniture offerings with audience optimization capabilities to help advertisers and publishers to maximize their online ad investment. Those capabilities along with the Web content management capabilities acquired from Day Software have served as a compelling value proposition to online marketers and publishers. 
While our progress in each of the three growth areas, content offering, customer experience management and online marketing optimization, is exciting individually; the real power is where we see these areas converging to serve our customers' entire workflow. For example, T-Mobile delivers outstanding customer service and saves millions annually by using Creative Suite, the Flash Platform, LiveCycle and Omniture to transform customer experience in stores and online. Likewise, MTV Networks uses Creative Suite and Flash to deliver its online content and Omniture to enhance customer viewing experiences and increase website revenues worldwide. That end-to-end value proposition is Adobe's unique differentiation. 
I would like to close by saying how concerned we are about the tragedy in Japan. We are grateful that all our employees in Japan are safe and hope that the situation improves soon. Given the uncertain business environment in Japan, we chose to be prudent with our Q2 financial targets. 
Adobe's mission of changing the world through digital experiences is more relevant than ever before. Moving forward, we will continue to focus on our three large growth opportunities: content offering, customer experience management and online marketing optimization. 
Thank you for joining us today. Now I'll turn the call back over to Mike."

So actually, let me start with maybe a little bit of color on the rest of this year, and then I'll address your 10% question specifically. If you remember, back in December, we said if you looked through the rest of the year that we would have a slight revenue increase in the second quarter, that we would see a normal seasonal decline in the third quarter, and then we'd see seasonal strength and a sequential growth in the fourth quarter, and that OpEx would grow during the year, so as a result, margins would be slightly down in Q2, down again in Q3 and up in Q4. That's what we originally said back in December. That was, of course, prior to the Japan tragedy, and prior to what happened in Japan, we were on track to deliver against that guidance. There's kind of two scenarios now that I would paint for you. One is if Japan's Q2 is really impacted by the $50 million and then begins to recover, most likely, Q3 would now be up sequentially and then seasonal strength would bring sequential growth again in the fourth quarter, margins would grow sequentially in Q3 and again in Q4. That's one scenario. The second would be if the impact of the situation in Japan is, in Q2, much less than the $50 million, then our original quarter color is more likely to pan out. We continue to believe in our growth opportunities, we're taking prudent expense actions, but nothing drastic on the operating expense side, but until we see Japan improve, we do plan to keep operating expense relatively flat from Q2 to Q3. There'll probably be a seasonal uptick to OpEx in the fourth quarter, primarily in sales and marketing. So if you look at all of that as it relates to your question over the 10%, back in December, we did anticipate 10% revenue growth. But honestly, until we learn more about the true impact of Japan, it's just not prudent to comment on longer-term targets right now."

If you look at the first quarter CS, Acrobat and Omniture all performed really well in the first quarter. The Enterprise value proposition is really resonating with customers. And we did see some large deals, as I said, push into the second quarter in the Enterprise space. Day was factored into our Q1 targets. It's now an integral part of that CEM Solution, and it's a large reason why we believe we can continue to grow this business 20%. If some of those deals didn't push into the second quarter, we probably would've been, frankly, towards the higher end of our range as opposed to over -- slightly over the middle of the range. And like I said as well, the Q2 pipeline for Enterprise is very strong. So if you net it out, we're happy with the quarter. Yes, we ended the quarter with no backlog, but, again, that's factored into the guidance."

As Shantanu said, the most important thing is we've accounted for all the employees. We have roughly 300 people in the Tokyo office, in virtually every function, but primarily sales and marketing with some R&D folks. We don't have any manufacturing operations in Japan as it relates to creating the shrink wrap. We have asked our employees to work from home for now, given the rolling blackouts and the difficulties with transportation. If you look at our first quarter for Japan, it was seasonally strong, just as we had expected. And Brent, if you look at it, March, which falls in our Q2, it is the largest month of the year for us in Japan. And the first week of Q2, prior to the earthquake, was really strong, so we got off to a great start in the second quarter, as we expected.  But there is no doubt that the pace of the revenue has changed since the earthquake. So what we're looking at in detail, and we've spent quite a bit of time on this, frankly, is weekly sell-through data for the first few weeks of the quarter, sales on Adobe.com for the first few weeks of the quarter, our Enterprise sales pipeline, and when we factor all that together and look at what we've seen so far, we come up with a $50 million negative impact, or roughly 30% of our Q2 revenue. And that's all we can do, frankly, at this point in time. In terms of how that starts to improve and the pace of that improvement over Q2, Q3, Q4, it's honestly too early to say. But obviously, when we get through the quarter, we'll tell you exactly how we did in Japan and be very transparent about how that played out relative to this $50 million."

And the Enterprise Edition fundamentally has a few more customization as well as enterprise-level features, including analytics, built in.  For example, using the Omniture SiteCatalyst and the Professional editing edition is really more about the standardized mid-market. And as I said, again, we really think that the Publishing Suite is going to be used not just for newspapers and magazines, which is the first beachhead, but much like InDesign, we expect book publishers as well as professional material to start using the Digital Publishing Suite. The cost of the solution, currently, we charge a yearly platform fee. And then in addition to that, there's a downloaded per-issue fee, which depends, frankly, on the publisher volume that exists. And in terms of the current beta testers, now that they've moved to the generally available version, our business model seems to be resonating with them, and the pipeline continues to be healthy. That is so early in the development. But as you see more tablets emerge, as you see every single publisher, whether it be an enterprise publisher, whether it be a government publisher or a media publisher, they will need a solution like the Digital Publishing Suite to get their content out to all of the different devices that exist. So I think they're very well-positioned. All of the titles, frankly, are still in the U.S., and when you start to think about how we get geographic expansion, there's a lot of opportunity up ahead for us."

We continued to see good strength in the Omniture business, and we would expect to see 2011 also continue to grow bookings the 20% that we've talked to you about. As it relates to the customer experience management, what we did very successfully in Q1 was, frankly, to start to position the entire offering integrating Day.

I mean, the amount of mobile growth that we're seeing through SiteCatalyst exceeds the growth that we're seeing, clearly, on PCs. And so the upgrade process for most customers is fairly transparent.

Our strong performance reflects our unique value proposition in the industry. We enable our customers to make, manage, mobilize and measure digital experiences across screens in ways no other company can. This end-to-end approach is resonating with our customers and fueling our growth across an increasingly diverse set of markets. 
As we have previously shared with you, we are focused on 3 significant growth opportunities, content authoring, digital marketing optimization and customer experience management. We're executing well in each area. 
In content authoring, we successfully launched Creative Suite 5.5, an update to the CSI product family. The release features enhancements for mobile content and application creation, new innovations for HTML 5 and Flash offering and amazing new features and productivity improvements in our video authoring solutions. 
CS5 5.5 is the first release in our transition to an annual release cycle, enabling us to deliver a content creation innovations to our customers more frequently in response to the rapidly evolving marketplace. It also allows us to augment our business model to drive incremental revenue. In addition to the perpetual license model we've always offered, we now offer a new subscription addition with CS 5.5 that provides a lower upfront price point for customers. 
Whether it be HTML, Flash or any other output format, the goal of CS 5.5 is to be the best offering suite regardless of platform, browser or operating system. Response to our HTML 5 tooling capabilities in CS 5.5 has been positive and we recently made new contributions to the HTML standards process by proposing enhancements to build complex, magazine-like layouts in web browsers using web standards. 
We're working on an implementation of this proposal in the web open-source HTML engine with Apple, Google and other members of the community. Looking forward, we will deliver a beta release of Adobe Edge in July, which is a new Creative tool for creating expressive animations in HTML for desktops and devices. 
While we help advance HTML capabilities, we will also continue to innovate with our Flash technology, particularly in areas such as a premium video content delivery and measurement, rich Internet applications and gaming. 
In premium video content, services such as Amazon Instant Video, HBO Go and Hulu and media companies such as ABC and CBS, the BBC in the U.K., AM6 in France, MTV, Turner and many others rely on Adobe's platform for delivering and monetizing their assets. 
For mobile apps, the industry is starting to recognize the power of utilizing Flash through the Adobe AIR runtime for devices running Android, iOS, RIM's BlackBerry tablet OS and others. IDC cited Adobe as having a, ""leading multiplatform multidevelopment environment."" 
This week, we released version 4.5 of Flash Builder and Flex to extend the capabilities of our Developer Tools Platform. CS 5.5 integrates with our new Digital Publishing Solution, which enables publishers to create, distribute and monetize their digital publications to use on tablets. 
Our digital publishing solution has enabled our customers to launch over 400 titles already in over 40 countries. We continue to be excited about the opportunity that the tablet market offers us, not only as a consumption device, but also as a creation Platform for Adobe applications in the future. 
Looking forward, expect this type of innovation to continue. We intend to share for the next milestone release of Creative Suite in 2012 and that we'll include an updated version of Photoshop. 
In digital marketing optimization, Q2 was another record revenue quarter. It's clear that the digital marketing category is exploding as evidenced by our sold-out Digital Marketing Summits in Salt Lake City and London. 
We announced our next-generation Platform for the Adobe online marketing suite that helps our customers more quickly analyze and derive actionable insight from video, social and mobile traffic. We also introduced Adobe Tag Manager, which provides a tag management framework to accelerate digital campaigns within the suite.  These innovations ensure that we continue to have the most comprehensive offering in this space. 
The social media becomes an integral part of our customers' marketing. Digital marketers find it critical to measure the impact of social media in their campaigns. In March, we announced the beta release of our new Adobe SocialAnalytics product and reaction from customers has been strong. The new product enables users to actively correlate social media sentiment to business impact. Recent customer wins in our digital marketing business include Del, Lenovo, the European financial group, UniCredit and Vodafone. 
In Customer Experience Management, we achieved year-over-year growth of 34%. The integration of our desk software acquisition has gone well with Q2 customer wins, including Delta Air Lines, SAP, Barclays Services, Louis Vuitton and Café Pacific. 
Yesterday we announced the new Adobe Digital Enterprise Platform, a unified solution for customer experience management and a suite of Adobe customer experience solutions to power engaging digital experiences across multiple communication channels. This platform and set of solutions incorporate Day's web content management capabilities, along with our life cycle capabilities and the measurement and analytics of our online marketing suite. We will rollout these offerings beginning later this summer and we are excited about the progress that we're making in delivering integrated solutions, which leverage many of our products. 
This strategy is helping to grow the size of our engagements and sales with large enterprise customers as we are increasingly benefiting from the synergy among our offerings to help customers create differentiated and effective digital experiences. 
For example, both Nike and publishing from Meredith Corporation purchased multiproduct solutions across our Omniture and Day product lines in Q2. So that retail and online stores H&M, Marks & Spencer and Nordstrom. 
Success in selling multimillion dollar Enterprise solutions such as these, demonstrate how we've increased the value we provide to customers and how we are increasingly becoming mission-critical to how our customers run their online business. Later, I will have some closing comments. But first, I will now turn the call over to Mark for a look at the financial results in the quarter. Mark?"

In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, Adobe achieved revenue of $1,023,000,000. This compares to $943 million reported in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $1,028,000,000 reported last quarter. Year-over-year, this represents 9% revenue growth. Q2 GA",1311,"Thanks, Shantanu. In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, Adobe achieved revenue of $1,023,000,000. This compares to $943 million reported in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $1,028,000,000 reported last quarter. Year-over-year, this represents 9% revenue growth. 
Q2 GAAP operating expenses were $637.3 million compared to $607.9 million reported in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $617.7 million last quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses in Q2 were $556.7 million compared to $520.2 million reported for Q2 fiscal 2010 and $539.5 million last quarter. 
GAAP operating income in Q2 fiscal 2011 was $276.7 million or 27% of revenue. This compares to GAAP operating income of $227.3 million or 24.1% of revenue in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $302.3 million or 29.4% of revenue last quarter. Non-GAAP operating income in Q2 fiscal 2011 was $376.4 million or 36.8% of revenue. This compares to non-GAAP operating income of $334.5 million or 35.5% of revenue in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $400.1 million or 38.9% of revenue last quarter. 
Adobe's effective GAAP tax rate in Q2 was 11.5% and the non-GAAP tax rate was 22%. Our GAAP tax rate was lower in Q2 due to the favorable impact of a state income tax ruling. GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q2 fiscal 2011 were $0.45. This compares with GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.28 reported in Q2 fiscal 2010 and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.46 reported last quarter. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q2 fiscal 2011 were $0.55. This compares with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.44 in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $0.58 reported last quarter. 
I will now discuss Adobe's results in Q2 by business segment. Creative and Interactive Solutions segment revenue in Q2 was $433.1 million compared to $423.3 million in Q2 fiscal 2010 when we launched CS 5 and $424.8 million last quarter. 
While it's only been a matter of weeks since 5.5  shift, we can make the following observations. The release of CS 5.5 in Q2 has helped maintain a solid run rate that CS5 established during the prior 4 quarters. Interest in Master Collection, as well as Web premium and the production premium and video suites has been strong, indicating positive reception to the key innovations and new features that we're added to those products. 
Adoption of the new subscription addition has met our expectations and is attracting new users. We expect this to build a new recurring revenue stream overtime. Digital Media Solutions Q2 revenue was $136.7 million compared to $139.3 million in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $151.7 million last quarter. The sequential revenue decline is primarily attributed to product lifecycle timing. 
Digital Enterprise Solutions revenue was $283.5 million in Q2, compared to $231.9 million in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $286.6 million last quarter. Within Digital Enterprise Solutions, Knowledge Worker revenue was $182 million compared to $156 million in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $181.8 million last quarter. 
Acrobat grew 17% year-over-year driven by an increase in both ASPs and units. Enterprise segment revenue was $101.5 million compared to $75.9 million in Q2 fiscal 2010 and a $104.8 million last quarter. Year-over-year revenue growth of 34% was driven by strong adoption of Day content management and the increased awareness of our broad customer experience management solutions. 
Omniture segment revenue in Q2 was a record $115.9 million compared to $91.9 million reported in Q2 of fiscal 2010 and $110.9 million last quarter. Omniture server transactions were up 13% on a year-over-year basis. Mobile and tablet device traffic remains the fastest-growing part of the Omniture business with the number of transactions we measured for mobile devices growing 24% quarter-over-quarter in Q2. 
Omniture revenue diversification continued with site Catalyst at 51% of Q2 Omniture product revenue. Conversion and multichannel analytics products are growing in size as Analytics business becomes a smaller percentage of the business. Enterprise renewal rates remained at 95% in the quarter. 
Finally, Print and Publishing segment revenue was $54 million compared to $56.6 million in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $53.7 million last quarter. 
Turning to our geographic segments in Q2. Results on a percent of revenue basis were as follows: the Americas, 48%; Europe, 30%; Asia, 22%. At the time of our Q1 earnings call in March, the unfortunate events in Japan caused us to estimate that as much as $50 million in Q2 revenue was at risk in that market. Fortunately, through the strong work of our team in Japan and the resiliency demonstrated in the country, we estimate the impact was only $10 million in the quarter. This helped to drive a sequential increase in our Asia revenue versus our estimate that revenue would decline sequentially. 
Partially offsetting the Q2 upside in Japan, we experienced weaker-than-expected demand in EMEA. In the Americas, the demand environment remained stable. From a year-over-year occurrence ease perspective, FX increased revenue by $35 million. We had $0.2 million hedge gain in Q2 fiscal '11 versus a $6.2 million hedge gain in Q2 fiscal attend, thus the net year-over-year currency increase to revenue considering hedging gains was $29 million. 
From a quarter-over-quarter perspective, FX increased revenue by $15.6 million. We had a $0.2 million hedge gain in Q2 fiscal '11 versus no hedge gain in Q1 fiscal '11. Thus, the net sequential currency increase to revenue considering hedging gains was $15.8 million. 
We entered and exited the second quarter with no shippable backlog. Employees at the end of Q2 totaled 9,770 versus 9,503 at the end of the last quarter. The increase was primarily due to the addition of summer interns and hiring in sales and marketing. 
Our trade DSO was 51 days, which compares to 42 days in the year ago quarter and 47 days last quarter. Our global channel inventory position at the end of the quarter was within company policy. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $389 million. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $2.6 billion, the same as it was at the end of Q1. 
Deferred revenue in the quarter increased by $38.6 million in the quarter to a total of $482 million. In Q2, we repurchased approximately 13.7 million shares at a total cost of $461.6 million. Entering Q3, $455 million of stock repurchase authority remains against the $1.6 billion stock repurchase authorization announced in July of last year. 
This concludes my discussion of our financial results. I would now like to comment on our financial targets for the third quarter of fiscal 2011. 
We are targeting a Q3 revenue range of $1 billion to $1,050,000,000. At the midpoint of this targeted range, we would expect Omniture and Enterprise segments to grow sequentially. We would expect Creative and Interactive, as well as digital Media solutions to be flat to slightly up. We would expect Knowledge Worker to decline and that we would expect Print and Publishing to be flat. Geographically, we would expect Americas to grow sequentially, offset by an expected sequential decline in Asia and EMEA due to normal seasonality in those markets. 
For margins, we are targeting a Q3 GAAP operating margin range of 24.5% to 27.5% and a non-GAAP operating margin range of 34% to 36%. We are targeting our Q3 share count to be 501 million to 503 million shares. We are targeting nonoperating expense to be between $17 million and $21 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. For our Q3 effective GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates, we are targeting 22%. These targets lead to a GAAP earnings per share range of $0.35 to $0.42 and a non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.50 to $0.56. 
We are also reaffirming today our 10% annual revenue growth target for fiscal year 2011. In addition, we are targeting our full year operating margin to be approximately 27.5% on a GAAP basis and approximately 37% on a non-GAAP basis. 
This concludes my section. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Shantanu."

The company is undergoing a significant transformation and our mission of changing the world through digital experiences has never been more relevant. We continue to focus on our 3 large growth opportunities: content authoring, digital optimization and customer experience management, and most importantly, on the synergies among them. 
Increasingly, we are finding that the real power is increasing customer solutions like digital publishing and web experience management that integrate our product lines. This will be a major thrust for us moving forward. Regardless of whether our customers are major media companies, enterprises, government agencies or educational institutions, we all faced the same challenge with their digital content and applications. They need to make compelling experiences that will scale across media and devices, manage their assets to streamline touch points with customers, mobilize the experiences to easily reach their audience across every channel and measure the effectiveness of experiences to maximize customer conversion and revenue. This need has never been more critical than it is right now. And we see the opportunities for Adobe continuing to grow as the digital landscape becomes richer and more diverse. 
Adobe's success has always been due to our incredible team of employees throughout the world. I would like to especially recognize the contributions of our employees in Japan who showed a tremendous commitment to serving customers following the earthquakes and tsunami. Their dedication help limit the impact on our business in Q2. Thank you for joining us today. Now I'll turn the call back over to Mike"

But before I answer that specifically, let me give you maybe a few more observations on 5.5 as we looked at it after the first quarter. And clearly, it was the first step in us moving to an annual cycle. And so I think we've successfully transitioned against that strategy which really allows us to deliver more innovations on a more regular basis and introduce new business models. When we saw the results, it is clearly demonstrating that it's extending the life of CS5 and we expect to see the CS5 and 5.5 revenue actually across the CS revenue in the comparable period right now. So it's clear that it continues to do well in the marketplace. The products that were updated in CS 5.5 and you know that all products were not updated, we're clearly off to a strong start, which I think again, reflects the need in the marketplace. So the Web and video products, specifically the Master Collection production premium and Web premium. And Steve, think there are a couple features that seem to resonate particularly with the customers. Clearly, the HTML offering that we're providing is resonating. Mobile app creation, now that we can have mobile apps that are created and deployed across the i devices, Android devices and the RIM devices. The other thing that we're also seeing frankly is the tie in for those products to our digital publishing suite. And so for people who wish to use our digital publishing suite, a lot of those products also enable you to participate in that entire workflow. So I think that's a sampling of what we've seen. And with respect to which customers, I mean we clearly have very, very loyal customers. So a number of the customers who adopted are customers who were on CS5. But in addition to that, as we've said, we are targeting the earlier version customers, namely the CS 4 and the CS3 customers."

I wouldn't say that it was concentrated more towards the end of the quarter or at the beginning of the quarter. I think it was fairly consistent top-selling throughout the quarter.

I think there's actually going to be a YouTube video that's being posted up later this day to talk about some of the key new functionality. Clearly, what Flash did a phenomenal job offers, everything from rich Internet advertising to completely interactive games. That's where people are using Flash for. And that's actually increasing. When it comes to delivering these capabilities for PC, we've seen no letup whatsoever in people using Flash. But now people are trying to push the envelope with how they can use HTML 5 to do the same things whether it's apps for mobile devices, whether it's an attractive games and completely new and attractive websites. And so think of it as everything that you will do with Flash Professional as that capability gets added to HTML overtime, it could take many years before the functionality is comparable, we want Adobe Edge to be the best way in which people create whether it's animation, interactive or Internet applications using HTML 5. So that sort of conceptually what we're doing. With annual releases, we're still very focused right now on 5.5 and also the question that Brent asked, continuing to drive that through the cycle until we release the next version. But I think it is fair to say that when you go to an Annual Release, the cadence will be about the same quarter because that's what really enables us even with Enterprises to get to be far more of an annual release cycle and have maintenance be a more meaningful part of the business."

Any provider that provides tools that enable people to deliver applications across those environments, that value proposition is strong. I think it's clearly true that with Apple first, people started to build native applications. But as you are starting to see these new platforms take off whether they be Android, whether they be what HP is going to come out with a touchpad, as Microsoft and RIM delivered their mobile environments. Customers are clearly struggling with being able to deal with all of these different platforms. The other thing that we've done and with Flash Builder for our 0.5, which is also being released is we actually now allow native extensions. And so one of the things that I think we've done very creatively is allow people to use a common framework for the most part but optimize for each of these native environments using the native extensions. And that's clearly something that's resonating. So you can take advantage of any specific features that you have whether they be in Android or iOS. And we have thousands of applications that people are building cross-platform and I just think as there are more platforms, people are going to deliver that. And the last thing I would say is when you build applications, people are building applications both within the web browser and they're building standalone applications. And if you can bridge that gap, I think there's a value proposition there for application developers around the world."

At the analyst meeting we'll give you an update on the available market in the sizing of the market. But clearly, I look at it and it's going to be the same kind of growth that you saw with websites.

So watch out for some really exciting new products. We've already delivered some for Photoshop. They've actually got a very good reception. But you will see Adobe deliver a very comprehensive product suite on all of these tablet devices. And given that the last question, may be I'll just end with a few summary remarks again, which is it's an exciting time. We're really executing well against the transformation agenda that we set for ourselves. And frankly, it leverages the tremendous franchise that we have at both our Creative and our PDF tools. What we're clearly seeing is that a new category is being created for marketing within the Enterprise, much like finance happened with ERP or sales happened with CRM. And this area of marketing online, I don't think there's a company that's better positioned with a more comprehensive set of solutions for all of these marketers. So whether it's creating the authoring tools to create the content, whether it's a platform to manage and deliver and transport that content and measuring and monetizing and delivering it across all mobile environments. We think that's a category that's going to increase significantly. And all of our products are very well-positioned to be able to deal with that particular marketplace. We're very well-positioned in SaaS with all of these offerings as a combination of what we've done with digital marketing and customer experience. And mobile is also clearly driving a lot of the interest, whether it's on authoring, analytics or creating the multichannel solutions. So exciting time that I think it was a strong quarter for us. And we look forward to continuing to execute against the agenda we've set for ourselves."

Our strong performance reflects our unique value proposition in the industry. We enable our customers to make, manage, mobilize and measure digital experiences across screens in ways no other company can. This end-to-end approach is resonating with our customers and fueling our growth across an increasingly diverse set of markets. 
As we have previously shared with you, we're focused on 3 significant growth opportunities, content 
authoring, digital marketing optimization and customer experience management. We're executing well in each area. 
In content authoring, we successfully launched Creative Suite 5.5, an update to the CS5 product family. The release features enhancements for mobile content and application creation, new innovations for HTML5 and Flash authoring, and amazing new features and productivity improvements in our video authoring solutions. 
CS5.5 is the first release in our transition to an annual release cycle, enabling us to deliver content creation innovations to our customers more frequently in response to the rapidly evolving marketplace. It also allows us to augment our business model to drive incremental revenue. In addition to the perpetual license model we've always offered, we now offer a new subscription addition with CS5.5 that provides a lower upfront price point for customers. 
Whether it be HTML, Flash or any other output format, the goal of CS5.5 is to be the best authoring suite, regardless of platform, browser or operating system. Response to our HTML 5 tooling capabilities in CS5.5 has been positive and we recently made new contributions to the HTML standards process by proposing enhancements to build complex, magazine-like layouts in web browsers using web standards. 
We are working on an implementation of this proposal in the WebKit open-source HTML engine with Apple, Google and other members of the community. Looking forward, we will deliver a beta release of Adobe Edge in July, which is a new Creative tool for creating expressive animations in HTML for desktops and devices. 
While we work to help advance HTML capabilities, we will also continue to innovate with our Flash technology, particularly in areas such as premium video content delivery and measurement, rich Internet applications and gaming. 
In premium video content, services such as Amazon Instant Video, HBO Go and Hulu and media companies such as ABC and CBS, the BBC in the U.K., M6 in France, MTV, Turner and many others rely on Adobe's platform for delivering and monetizing their assets. 
For mobile apps, the industry is starting to recognize the power of utilizing Flash through the Adobe AIR runtime for devices running Android, iOS, RIM's BlackBerry tablet OS and others. IDC cited Adobe as having a, ""leading multiplatform mobile-development environment."" 
This week, we released version 4.5 of Flash Builder and Flex to extend the capabilities of our developer tools platform. CS5.5 integrates with our new Digital Publishing Solution, which enables publishers to create, distribute and monetize their digital publications for use on tablets. 
Our digital publishing solution has enabled our customers to launch over 400 titles already in over 40 countries. We continue to be excited about the opportunity that the tablet market offers us, not only as a consumption device, but also as a creation Platform for Adobe applications in the future. 
Looking forward, expect this type of innovation to continue. We intend to share the next milestone release of Creative Suite in 2012, and that will include an updated version of Photoshop. 
In digital marketing optimization, Q2 was another record revenue quarter. It's clear that the digital marketing category is exploding, as evidenced by our sold-out digital marketing summits in Salt Lake City and London. 
We announced our next-generation platform for the Adobe online marketing suite that helps our customers more quickly analyze and derive actionable insight from video, social and mobile traffic. We also introduced Adobe Tag Manager, which provides a tag management framework to accelerate digital campaigns within the suite. These innovations ensure that we continue to have the most comprehensive offering in the space. 
The social media becomes an integral part of our customers' marketing. Digital marketers find it critical to measure the impact of social media in their campaigns. In March, we announced a beta release of our new Adobe SocialAnalytics product, and reaction from customers has been strong. The new product enables users to actively correlate social media sentiment to business impact. Recent customer wins in our Digital Marketing business include Dell, Lenovo, the European financial group, UniCredit and Vodafone. 
In customer experience management, we achieved year-over-year growth of 34%. The integration of our desk software acquisition has gone well, with Q2 customer wins, including Delta Airlines, SAP, Barclays services, Louis Vuitton and Café Pacific. 
Yesterday, we announced the new Adobe Digital Enterprise Platform, a unified solution for customer experience management and a suite of Adobe customer experience solutions to power engaging digital experiences across multiple communication channels. This platform and set of solutions, incorporate Day's web content management capabilities, along with our LiveCycle capabilities and the measurement and analytics of our online marketing suite. We will roll out these offerings beginning later this summer and we're excited about the progress that we're making in delivering integrated solutions, which leverage many of our products. 
This strategy is helping to grow the size of our engagements and sales with large enterprise customers, as we're increasingly benefiting from the synergy among our offerings to help customers create differentiated and effective digital experiences. 
For example, both Nike and publishing from Meredith Corp. purchased multiproduct solutions across our Omniture and Day product lines in Q2. So did retail and online stores H&M, Marks & Spencer and Nordstrom. 
Success in selling multimillion dollar Enterprise solutions such as these, demonstrate how we've increased the value we provide to customers and how we're increasingly becoming mission-critical to how our customers run their Online business. Later, I will have some closing comments. But first, I will now turn the call over to Mark for a look at the financial results in the quarter. Mark?"

In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, Adobe achieved revenue of $1,023,000,000. This compares to $943 million reported in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $1,028,000,000 reported last quarter. Year-over-year, this represents 9% revenue growth. Q2 GA",1306,"Thanks, Shantanu. In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, Adobe achieved revenue of $1,023,000,000. This compares to $943 million reported in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $1,028,000,000 reported last quarter. Year-over-year, this represents 9% revenue growth. 
Q2 GAAP operating expenses were $637.3 million compared to $607.9 million reported in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $617.7 million last quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses in Q2 were $556.7 million compared to $520.2 million reported for Q2 fiscal 2010 and $539.5 million last quarter. 
GAAP operating income in Q2 fiscal 2011 was $276.7 million or 27% of revenue. This compares to GAAP operating income of $227.3 million or 24.1% of revenue in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $302.3 million or 29.4% of revenue last quarter. Non-GAAP operating income in Q2 fiscal 2011 was $376.4 million or 36.8% of revenue. This compares to non-GAAP operating income of $334.5 million or 35.5% of revenue in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $400.1 million or 38.9% of revenue last quarter. 
Adobe's effective GAAP tax rate in Q2 was 11.5% and the non-GAAP tax rate was 22%. Our GAAP tax rate was lower in Q2, due to the favorable impact of a state income tax ruling. GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q2 fiscal 2011 were $0.45. This compares with GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.28 reported in Q2 fiscal 2010, and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.46 reported last quarter. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q2 fiscal 2011 were $0.55. This compares with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.44 in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $0.58 reported last quarter. 
I will now discuss Adobe's results in Q2 by business segment. Creative and Interactive Solutions segment revenue in Q2 was $433.1 million compared to $423.3 million in Q2 fiscal 2010 when we launched CS 5 and $424.8 million last quarter. 
While it's only been a matter of weeks since 5.5  shift, we can make the following observations. The release of CS 5.5 in Q2 has helped maintain a solid run rate that CS5 established during the prior 4 quarters. Interest in Master Collection, as well as Web premium and the production premium video suites has been strong, indicating positive reception to the key innovations and new features that we're added to those products. 
Adoption of the new subscription addition has met our expectations and is attracting new users. We expect this to build a new recurring revenue stream overtime. Digital Media Solutions Q2 revenue was $136.7 million compared to $139.3 million in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $151.7 million last quarter. The sequential revenue decline is primarily attributed to product LifeCycle timing. 
Digital Enterprise Solutions revenue was $283.5 million in Q2, compared to $231.9 million in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $286.6 million last quarter. Within Digital Enterprise Solutions, Knowledge Worker revenue was $182 million compared to $156 million in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $181.8 million last quarter. 
Acrobat grew 17% year-over-year driven by an increase in both ASPs and units. Enterprise segment revenue was $101.5 million compared to $75.9 million in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $104.8 million last quarter. Year-over-year revenue growth of 34% was driven by strong adoption of Day content management and the increased awareness of our broad customer experience management solutions. 
Omniture segment revenue in Q2 was a record $115.9 million compared to $91.9 million reported in Q2 of fiscal 2010 and $110.9 million last quarter. Omniture server transactions were up 13% on a year-over-year basis. Mobile and tablet device traffic remains the fastest-growing part of the Omniture business, with the number of transactions we measured for mobile devices growing 24% quarter-over-quarter in Q2. 
Omniture revenue diversification continued with site Catalyst at 51% of Q2 Omniture product revenue. Conversion and multichannel analytics products are growing in size as Analytics business becomes a smaller percentage of the business. Enterprise renewal rates remained at 95% in the quarter.  Finally, Print and Publishing segment revenue was $54 million compared to $56.6 million in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $53.7 million last quarter. 
Turning to our geographic segments in Q2. Results on a percent of revenue basis were as follows: the Americas, 48%; Europe, 30%; Asia, 22%. At the time of our Q1 earnings call in March, the unfortunate events in Japan caused us to estimate that as much as $50 million in Q2 revenue was at risk in that market. Fortunately, through the strong work of our team in Japan and the resiliency demonstrated in the country, we estimate the impact was only $10 million in the quarter. This helped to drive a sequential increase in our Asia revenue versus our estimate that revenue would decline sequentially. 
Partially offsetting the Q2 upside in Japan, we experienced weaker-than-expected demand in EMEA. In the Americas, the demand environment remained stable. From a year-over-year currency's perspective, FX increased revenue by $35 million. We had $0.2 million hedge gain in Q2 fiscal '11 versus a $6.2 million hedge gain in Q2 fiscal '10, thus the net year-over-year currency increase to revenue considering hedging gains was $29 million. 
From a quarter-over-quarter perspective, FX increased revenue by $15.6 million. We had a $0.2 million hedge gain in Q2 fiscal '11 versus no hedge gain in Q1 fiscal '11. Thus, the net sequential currency increase to revenue, considering hedging gains was $15.8 million. 
We entered and exited the second quarter with no shippable backlog. Employees at the end of Q2 totaled 9,770 versus 9,503 at the end of the last quarter. The increase was primarily due to the addition of summer interns and hiring in sales and marketing. 
Our trade DSO was 51 days, which compares to 42 days in the year ago quarter and 47 days last quarter. Our global channel inventory position at the end of the quarter was within company policy. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $389 million. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $2.6 billion, the same as it was at the end of Q1. 
Deferred revenue in the quarter increased by $38.6 million in the quarter to a total of $482 million. In Q2, we repurchased approximately 13.7 million shares at a total cost of $461.6 million. Entering Q3, $455 million of stock repurchase authority remains against the $1.6 billion stock repurchase authorization announced in July of last year. 
This concludes my discussion of our financial results. I would now like to comment on our financial targets for the third quarter of fiscal 2011. 
We are targeting a Q3 revenue range of $1 billion to $1,050,000,000. At the midpoint of this targeted range, we would expect Omniture and Enterprise segments to grow sequentially. We would expect Creative and Interactive, as well as digital Media solutions to be flat to slightly up. We would expect Knowledge Worker to decline and we would expect Print and Publishing to be flat. Geographically, we would expect Americas to grow sequentially, offset by an expected sequential decline in Asia and EMEA due to normal seasonality in those markets. 
For margins, we are targeting a Q3 GAAP operating margin range of 24.5% to 27.5% and a non-GAAP operating margin range of 34% to 36%. We are targeting our Q3 share count to be 501 million to 503 million shares. We are targeting nonoperating expense to be between $17 million and $21 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. For our Q3 effective GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates, we are targeting 22%. These targets lead to a GAAP earnings per share range of $0.35 to $0.42 and a non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.50 to $0.56. 
We are also reaffirming today our 10% annual revenue growth target for fiscal year 2011. In addition, we are targeting our full-year operating margin to be approximately 27.5% on a GAAP basis and approximately 37% on a non-GAAP basis. 
This concludes my section. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Shantanu."

The company is undergoing a significant transformation and our mission of changing the world through digital experiences has never been more relevant. We continue to focus on our 3 large growth opportunities: content authoring, digital marketing optimization and customer experience management, and most importantly, on the synergies among them. 
Increasingly, we are finding that the real power is in creating customer solutions like digital publishing and web experience management that integrate our product lines. This will be a major thrust for us moving forward. Regardless of whether our customers are major media companies, enterprises, government agencies or educational institutions, they all face the same challenge with their digital content and applications. They need to make compelling experiences that will scale across media and devices, manage their assets to streamline touch points with customers, mobilize the experiences to easily reach their audience across every channel and measure the effectiveness of experiences to maximize customer conversion and revenue. This need has never been more critical than it is right now. And we see the opportunities for Adobe continuing to grow as the digital landscape becomes richer and more diverse. 
Adobe's success has always been due to our incredible team of employees throughout the world.

But before I answer that specifically, let me maybe give you a few more observations on 5.5 as we looked at it after the first quarter. And clearly, it was the first step in us moving to an annual cycle. And so I think we've successfully transitioned against that strategy which really allows us to deliver more innovations on a more regular basis and introduce new business models. When we saw the results, it is clearly demonstrating that it's extending the life of CS5 and we expect to see the CS5 and 5.5 revenue actually cross the CS3 revenue within the comparable period right now. So it's clear that it continues to do well in the marketplace. The products that were updated in the CS5.5, and you know that all products were not updated, we're clearly off to a strong start, which I think again, reflects the need in the marketplace. So the Web and video products, specifically the Master Collection, production premium and Web premium. And Steve, think there are a couple features that seem to resonate particularly with the customers. Clearly, the HTML offering that we're providing is resonating. Mobile app creation, now that we can have mobile apps that are created and deployed across the i devices, Android devices and the RIM devices. The other thing that we're also seeing frankly is the tie in from those products to our digital publishing suite. And so for people who wish to use our digital publishing suite, a lot of those products also enable you to participate in that entire workflow. So I think that's a sampling of what we've seen. And with respect to which customers, I mean we clearly have very, very loyal customers. So a number of the customers who adopted were customers who were on CS5. But in addition to that, as we've said, we're targeting the earlier version customers, namely the CS4 and the CS3 customers."

It did go up $39 million like I said. It's driven by a few things. It's clearly driven by the Omniture SaaS kind of ratable model which drives a lot of deferred revenue every quarter, especially as we see their bookings doing so well. We also have some royalty agreements that represent deferred revenue in there as well as maintenance and support. So it's kind of a combination of all those frankly, but obviously, a very good result from a deferred revenue perspective. And as it relates to Europe, it was somewhat off of our expectations. It was primarily in Northern Europe, which is the Nordic countries in the U.K., obviously. I wouldn't say that it was concentrated more towards the end of the quarter or the beginning of the quarter. I think it was fairly consistent tough-selling throughout the quarter. But again, we're very fortunate that we have a diversified model from a geographic perspective. Japan did a little better this quarter, Europe did a little worse than we thought and in the end, overall, we had a good quarter."

So Brent, I mean I think with respect to 5.5, the fact that we've embraced and we're actually rapidly doing future development for HTML5, as people think about the different media formats, that's clearly resonating with customers. I'll say Digital publishing has really been a pleasant surprise as it relates to people whether they're publishing catalogs, magazines, video training material, all of the media solutions, that's been a pleasant surprise. We're definitely starting to see as we sell content management and we sell analytics people want Creative Suite part of that. So I mean what's really playing out nicely is as we're selling to the marketers, each of the different products are leading to other product sales. So we've seen some fairly significant multimillion dollar deals with all of the Creative customers. And I think people are looking forward frankly, to the next release as well, because there's a significant anticipation that's being built up for all the cool thing that we can do in imaging with Photoshop. And there's a lot of exciting stuff underway. Maybe the last comment is video, I mean we are definitely making significant traction in video with our offering tools. People have seen the quality that we've put in so for broadcast as well as high-end video. We're clearly gaining market share. And on subscriptions, I think, Mark just alluded to that. We are seeing new customers coming to the platform as a result of subscription. So it's not material yet, but what we are pleased with is people who would otherwise, not be attracted to the Adobe Platform. It's clear that subscriptions is helping attract new customers to the platform."

I think there's actually going to be a YouTube video that's being posted up later this day to talk about some of the key new functionality. Clearly, what Flash did a phenomenal job offers, everything from rich Internet advertising to completely interactive games. That's what people are using Flash for. And that's actually increasing. When it comes to delivering these capabilities for PC, we've seen no letup whatsoever in people using Flash. But now people are trying to push the envelope with how they can use HTML5 to do the same things, whether it's apps for mobile devices, whether it's interactive games and completely new interactive websites. And so think of it as everything that you could do with Flash Professional as that capability gets added to HTML overtime, and it will take many years before the functionality is comparable, we want Adobe Edge to be the best way in which people create, whether it's animation, interactivity or rich Internet applications using HTML5. So that sort of conceptually what we're doing. With annual releases, we're still very focused right now on 5.5 and to also the question that Brent asked, continuing to drive that through the cycle until we release the next version. But I think it is fair to say that when we go to an Annual Release, the cadence will be about the same quarter because that's what really enables us even with Enterprises to get to be far more of an annual release cycle and have maintenance be a more meaningful part of the business."

Any provider that provides tools that enable people to deliver applications across those environments, that value proposition is strong. I think it's clearly true that with Apple first, people started to build native applications. But as you are starting to see these new platforms take off, whether they be Android, whether they be what HP is going to come out with the touchpad, as Microsoft and RIM delivered their mobile environments. Customers are clearly struggling with being able to deal with all of these different platforms. The other thing that we've done and with Flash Builder for our 0.5, which is also being released, is we actually now allow native extensions. And so one of the things that I think we've done very creatively is allow people to use a common framework for the most part, but optimize for each of these native environments using the native extensions. And that's clearly something that's resonating. So you can take advantage of any specific features that you have. Whether they be in Android or iOS. And we have thousands of applications that people are building cross-platform. And I just think as there are more platforms, people are going to deliver that. And the last thing I would say is when you build applications, people are building applications both within the web browser and they're building standalone applications. And if you can bridge that gap, I think there's a value proposition there for application developers around the world."

So clearly, the business is going to scale as more and more people target tablet devices across the world. Again as I said for a variety of different magazines, catalogs, newspapers and publishing systems, the other thing we do also is for people who want their Digital Publishing Suite, the tie-in with the Creative Suite. And that the Creative Suite is the best way to author our photo SaaS-based services so that's how we think about it. At the analyst meeting, we'll give you an update on the available market and the sizing of the market.

Basically, what you find is that as you look at the revenue guidance we've provided for the third quarter, we're still ramping on the expense side as we hire, primarily in sales and marketing for capacity for 2012. And as a result of that, you've got some additional OpEx, with not as much growth on the revenue line in the third quarter, but then, we more than make up for that in the fourth quarter with strong margin improvement, and that's why you end up on the year with approximately 37%, which is up from last year."

Same thing is true of the Online Marketing, Digital Marketing business. And we haven't answered any questions yet about that, but that was record bookings again. And when you think about what's happening with respect to digital marketing, that category is exploding. Social analytics, we announced a beta of out product, and we add over 100 customers wanting to sign up. The businesses diversifying, side catalysts is again, the lowest percentage of the overall business. So the suite approach. And there again, without a doubt, as we add sales capacity, they're actually coming up to speed incredibly fast and contributing to the bottom line. Digital publishing and everything that's happening with Creative Suite, we've successfully transformed that to an annual cycle. We've dealt with mobile, we've built with HTML and Flash. And so the things that we've outlined in terms of the core businesses for the company, we're executing against all of those. And Acrobat again, continues to perform well. If there is a significant downturn, I think Mark has always demonstrated that we will find a way to deal with that situation.

And given that's the last question, maybe I'll just end with a few summary remarks again, which is it's an exciting time. We're really executing well against the transformation agenda that we set for ourselves. And frankly, it leverages the tremendous franchise that we have with both our Creative and our PDF tools. What we're clearly seeing is that a new category is being created for marketing within the Enterprise, much like finance happened with ERP or sales happened with CRM. And this area of marketing online, I don't think there's a company that's better positioned with a more comprehensive set of solutions for all of these marketers. So whether it's creating the authoring tools to create the content, whether it's a platform to manage and deliver and transport that content and measuring and monetizing and delivering it across all mobile environments. We think that's a category that's going to increase significantly. And all of our products are very well-positioned to be able to deal with that particular marketplace. We're very well-positioned in SaaS with all of these offerings as a combination of what we've done with digital marketing and customer experience.

CS5.5 is the first release in our transition to an annual release cycle, enabling us to deliver content creation innovations to our customers more frequently in response to the rapidly evolving marketplace. It also allows us to augment our business model to drive incremental revenue. In addition to the perpetual license model we've always offered, we now offer a new subscription addition with CS5.5 that provides a lower upfront price point for customers. 
Whether it be HTML, Flash or any other output format, the goal of CS5.5 is to be the best authoring suite, regardless of platform, browser or operating system. Response to our HTML 5 tooling capabilities in CS5.5 has been positive and we recently made new contributions to the HTML standards process by proposing enhancements to build complex, magazine-like layouts in web browsers using web standards. 
We are working on an implementation of this proposal in the WebKit open-source HTML engine with Apple, Google and other members of the community. Looking forward, we will deliver a beta release of Adobe Edge in July, which is a new Creative tool for creating expressive animations in HTML for desktops and devices. 
While we work to help advance HTML capabilities, we will also continue to innovate with our Flash technology, particularly in areas such as premium video content delivery and measurement, rich Internet applications and gaming. 
In premium video content, services such as Amazon Instant Video, HBO Go and Hulu and media companies such as ABC and CBS, the BBC in the U.K., M6 in France, MTV, Turner and many others rely on Adobe's platform for delivering and monetizing their assets. 
For mobile apps, the industry is starting to recognize the power of utilizing Flash through the Adobe AIR runtime for devices running Android, iOS, RIM's BlackBerry tablet OS and others. IDC cited Adobe as having a, ""leading multiplatform mobile-development environment."" 
This week, we released version 4.5 of Flash Builder and Flex to extend the capabilities of our developer tools platform. CS5.5 integrates with our new Digital Publishing Solution, which enables publishers to create, distribute and monetize their digital publications for use on tablets. 
Our digital publishing solution has enabled our customers to launch over 400 titles already in over 40 countries. We continue to be excited about the opportunity that the tablet market offers us, not only as a consumption device, but also as a creation Platform for Adobe applications in the future. 
Looking forward, expect this type of innovation to continue. We intend to ship the next milestone release of Creative Suite in 2012, and that will include an updated version of Photoshop. 
In digital marketing optimization, Q2 was another record revenue quarter. It's clear that the digital marketing category is exploding, as evidenced by our sold-out digital marketing summits in Salt Lake City and London. 
We announced our next-generation platform for the Adobe online marketing suite that helps our customers more quickly analyze and derive actionable insight from video, social and mobile traffic. We also introduced Adobe Tag Manager, which provides a tag management framework to accelerate digital campaigns within the suite. These innovations ensure that we continue to have the most comprehensive offering in the space. 
As social media becomes an integral part of our customers' marketing, digital marketers find it critical to measure the impact of social media in their campaigns. In March, we announced a beta release of our new Adobe SocialAnalytics product, and reaction from customers has been strong. The new product enables users to actively correlate social media sentiment to business impact. Recent customer wins in our Digital Marketing business include Dell, Lenovo, the European financial group, UniCredit and Vodafone. 
In customer experience management, we achieved year-over-year growth of 34%. The integration of our desk software acquisition has gone well, with Q2 customer wins, including Delta Airlines, SAP, Barclays services, Louis Vuitton and Café Pacific. 
Yesterday, we announced the new Adobe Digital Enterprise Platform, a unified solution for customer experience management and a suite of Adobe customer experience solutions to power engaging digital experiences across multiple communication channels. This platform and set of solutions, incorporate Day's web content management capabilities, along with our LiveCycle capabilities and the measurement and analytics of our online marketing suite. We will roll out these offerings beginning later this summer and we're excited about the progress that we're making in delivering integrated solutions, which leverage many of our products. 
This strategy is helping to grow the size of our engagements and sales with large enterprise customers, as we're increasingly benefiting from the synergy among our offerings to help customers create differentiated and effective digital experiences. 
For example, both Nike and publishing from Meredith Corp. purchased multiproduct solutions across our Omniture and Day product lines in Q2. So did retail and online stores H&M, Marks & Spencer and Nordstrom. 
Success in selling multimillion dollar Enterprise solutions such as these, demonstrate how we've increased the value we provide to customers and how we're increasingly becoming mission-critical to how our customers run their Online business. Later, I will have some closing comments. But first, I will now turn the call over to Mark for a look at the financial results in the quarter. Mark?"

In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, Adobe achieved revenue of $1,023,000,000. This compares to $943 million reported in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $1,028,000,000 reported last quarter. Year-over-year, this represents 9% revenue growth. Q2 GA",1305,"Thanks, Shantanu. In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, Adobe achieved revenue of $1,023,000,000. This compares to $943 million reported in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $1,028,000,000 reported last quarter. Year-over-year, this represents 9% revenue growth. 
Q2 GAAP operating expenses were $637.3 million compared to $607.9 million reported in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $617.7 million last quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses in Q2 were $556.7 million compared to $520.2 million reported for Q2 fiscal 2010 and $539.5 million last quarter. 
GAAP operating income in Q2 fiscal 2011 was $276.7 million or 27% of revenue. This compares to GAAP operating income of $227.3 million or 24.1% of revenue in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $302.3 million or 29.4% of revenue last quarter. Non-GAAP operating income in Q2 fiscal 2011 was $376.4 million or 36.8% of revenue. This compares to non-GAAP operating income of $334.5 million or 35.5% of revenue in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $400.1 million or 38.9% of revenue last quarter. 
Adobe's effective GAAP tax rate in Q2 was 11.5% and the non-GAAP tax rate was 22%. Our GAAP tax rate was lower in Q2, due to the favorable impact of a state income tax ruling. GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q2 fiscal 2011 were $0.45. This compares with GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.28 reported in Q2 fiscal 2010, and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.46 reported last quarter. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q2 fiscal 2011 were $0.55. This compares with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.44 in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $0.58 reported last quarter. 
I will now discuss Adobe's results in Q2 by business segment. Creative and Interactive Solutions segment revenue in Q2 was $433.1 million compared to $423.3 million in Q2 fiscal 2010 when we launched CS 5 and $424.8 million last quarter. 
While it's only been a matter of weeks since 5.5  shipped, we can make the following observations. The release of CS5.5 in Q2 has helped maintain a solid run rate that CS5 established during the prior 4 quarters. Interest in Master Collection, as well as Web premium and the production premium video suites has been strong, indicating positive reception to the key innovations and new features that were added to those products. 
Adoption of the new subscription addition has met our expectations and is attracting new users. We expect this to build a new recurring revenue stream overtime. Digital Media Solutions Q2 revenue was $136.7 million compared to $139.3 million in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $151.7 million last quarter. The sequential revenue decline is primarily attributed to product LifeCycle timing. 
Digital Enterprise Solutions revenue was $283.5 million in Q2, compared to $231.9 million in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $286.6 million last quarter. Within Digital Enterprise Solutions, Knowledge Worker revenue was $182 million compared to $156 million in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $181.8 million last quarter. 
Acrobat grew 17% year-over-year driven by an increase in both ASPs and units. Enterprise segment revenue was $101.5 million compared to $75.9 million in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $104.8 million last quarter. Year-over-year revenue growth of 34% was driven by strong adoption of Day content management and the increased awareness of our broad customer experience management solutions. 
Omniture segment revenue in Q2 was a record $115.9 million compared to $91.9 million reported in Q2 of fiscal 2010 and $110.9 million last quarter. Omniture server transactions were up 13% on a year-over-year basis. Mobile and tablet device traffic remains the fastest-growing part of the Omniture business, with the number of transactions we measured for mobile devices growing 24% quarter-over-quarter in Q2. 
Omniture revenue diversification continued with site Catalyst at 51% of Q2 Omniture product revenue. Conversion and multichannel analytics products are growing in size as Analytics business becomes a smaller percentage of the business. Enterprise renewal rates remained at 95% in the quarter.  Finally, Print and Publishing segment revenue was $54 million compared to $56.6 million in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $53.7 million last quarter. 
Turning to our geographic segments in Q2. Results on a percent of revenue basis were as follows: the Americas, 48%; Europe, 30%; Asia, 22%. At the time of our Q1 earnings call in March, the unfortunate events in Japan caused us to estimate that as much as $50 million in Q2 revenue was at risk in that market. Fortunately, through the strong work of our team in Japan and the resiliency demonstrated in the country, we estimate the impact was only $10 million in the quarter. This helped to drive a sequential increase in our Asia revenue versus our estimate that revenue would decline sequentially. 
Partially offsetting the Q2 upside in Japan, we experienced weaker-than-expected demand in EMEA. In the Americas, the demand environment remained stable. From a year-over-year currency's perspective, FX increased revenue by $35 million. We had $0.2 million hedge gain in Q2 fiscal '11 versus a $6.2 million hedge gain in Q2 fiscal '10, thus the net year-over-year currency increase to revenue considering hedging gains was $29 million. 
From a quarter-over-quarter perspective, FX increased revenue by $15.6 million. We had a $0.2 million hedge gain in Q2 fiscal '11 versus no hedge gain in Q1 fiscal '11. Thus, the net sequential currency increase to revenue, considering hedging gains was $15.8 million. 
We entered and exited the second quarter with no shippable backlog. Employees at the end of Q2 totaled 9,770 versus 9,503 at the end of the last quarter. The increase was primarily due to the addition of summer interns and hiring in sales and marketing. 
Our trade DSO was 51 days, which compares to 42 days in the year ago quarter and 47 days last quarter. Our global channel inventory position at the end of the quarter was within company policy. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $389 million. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $2.6 billion, the same as it was at the end of Q1. 
Deferred revenue in the quarter increased by $38.6 million in the quarter to a total of $482 million. In Q2, we repurchased approximately 13.7 million shares at a total cost of $461.6 million. Entering Q3, $455 million of stock repurchase authority remains against the $1.6 billion stock repurchase authorization announced in July of last year. 
This concludes my discussion of our financial results. I would now like to comment on our financial targets for the third quarter of fiscal 2011. 
We are targeting a Q3 revenue range of $1 billion to $1,050,000,000. At the midpoint of this targeted range, we would expect Omniture and Enterprise segments to grow sequentially. We would expect Creative and Interactive, as well as digital Media solutions to be flat to slightly up. We would expect Knowledge Worker to decline and we would expect Print and Publishing to be flat. Geographically, we would expect Americas to grow sequentially, offset by an expected sequential decline in Asia and EMEA due to normal seasonality in those markets. 
For margins, we are targeting a Q3 GAAP operating margin range of 24.5% to 27.5% and a non-GAAP operating margin range of 34% to 36%. We are targeting our Q3 share count to be 501 million to 503 million shares. We are targeting non-operating expense to be between $17 million and $21 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. For our Q3 effective GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates, we are targeting 22%. These targets lead to a GAAP earnings per share range of $0.35 to $0.42 and a non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.50 to $0.56. 
We are also reaffirming today our 10% annual revenue growth target for fiscal year 2011. In addition, we are targeting our full-year operating margin to be approximately 27.5% on a GAAP basis and approximately 37% on a non-GAAP basis. 
This concludes my section. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Shantanu."

The company is undergoing a significant transformation and our mission of changing the world through digital experiences has never been more relevant. We continue to focus on our 3 large growth opportunities: content authoring, digital marketing optimization and customer experience management, and most importantly, on the synergies among them. 
Increasingly, we are finding that the real power is in creating customer solutions like digital publishing and web experience management that integrate our product lines. This will be a major thrust for us moving forward. Regardless of whether our customers are major media companies, enterprises, government agencies or educational institutions, they all face the same challenge with their digital content and applications. They need to make compelling experiences that will scale across media and devices, manage their assets to streamline touch points with customers, mobilize the experiences to easily reach their audience across every channel and measure the effectiveness of experiences to maximize customer conversion and revenue. This need has never been more critical than it is right now. And we see the opportunities for Adobe continuing to grow as the digital landscape becomes richer and more diverse. 
Adobe's success has always been due to our incredible team of employees throughout the world. I would like to especially recognize the contributions of our employees in Japan who showed tremendous commitment to serving customers following the earthquakes and tsunami. Their dedication help limit the impact on our business in Q2. Thank you for joining us today. Now I'll turn the call back over to Mike."

But before I answer that specifically, let me maybe give you a few more observations on 5.5 as we looked at it after the first quarter. And clearly, it was the first step in us moving to an annual cycle. And so I think we've successfully transitioned against that strategy which really allows us to deliver more innovations on a more regular basis and introduce new business models. When we saw the results, it is clearly demonstrating that it's extending the life of CS5 and we expect to see the CS5 and 5.5 revenue actually cross the CS3 revenue within the comparable period right now. So it's clear that it continues to do well in the marketplace. The products that were updated in the CS5.5, and you know that all products were not updated, we're clearly off to a strong start, which I think again, reflects the need in the marketplace. So the Web and video products, specifically the Master Collection, production premium and Web premium. And Steve, I think there are a couple features that seem to resonate particularly with the customers. Clearly, the HTML offering that we're providing is resonating. Mobile app creation, now that we can have mobile apps that are created and deployed across the i devices, Android devices and the RIM devices. The other thing that we're also seeing frankly is the tie in from those products to our digital publishing suite. And so for people who wish to use our digital publishing suite, a lot of those products also enable you to participate in that entire workflow. So I think that's a sampling of what we've seen. And with respect to which customers, I mean we clearly have very, very loyal customers. So a number of the customers who adopted were customers who were on CS5. But in addition to that, as we've said, we're targeting the earlier version customers, namely the CS4 and the CS3 customers."

We also have some royalty agreements that represent deferred revenue in there as well as maintenance and support. So it's kind of a combination of all those frankly, but obviously, a very good result from a deferred revenue perspective. And as it relates to Europe, it was somewhat off of our expectations. It was primarily in Northern Europe, which is the Nordic countries in the U.K., obviously. I wouldn't say that it was concentrated more towards the end of the quarter or the beginning of the quarter. I think it was fairly consistent tough-selling throughout the quarter. But again, we're very fortunate that we have a diversified model from a geographic perspective. Japan did a little better this quarter, Europe did a little worse than we thought and in the end, overall, we had a good quarter."

So I mean what's really playing out nicely is as we're selling to the marketers, each of the different products are leading to other product sales. So we've seen some fairly significant multimillion dollar deals with all of the Creative customers. And I think people are looking forward frankly, to the next release as well, because there's a significant anticipation that's being built up for all the cool thing that we can do in imaging with Photoshop. And there's a lot of exciting stuff underway. Maybe the last comment is video, I mean we are definitely making significant traction in video with our offering tools.

I think there's actually going to be a YouTube video that's being posted up later this day to talk about some of the key new functionality. Clearly, what Flash did a phenomenal job of is, everything from rich Internet advertising to completely interactive games. That's what people are using Flash for. And that's actually increasing. When it comes to delivering these capabilities for PC, we've seen no letup whatsoever in people using Flash. But now people are trying to push the envelope with how they can use HTML5 to do the same things, whether it's apps for mobile devices, whether it's interactive games and completely new interactive websites. And so think of it as everything that you could do with Flash Professional as that capability gets added to HTML overtime, and it will take many years before the functionality is comparable, we want Adobe Edge to be the best way in which people create, whether it's animation, interactivity or rich Internet applications using HTML5. So that sort of conceptually what we're doing. With annual releases, we're still very focused right now on 5.5 and to also the question that Brent asked, continuing to drive that through the cycle until we release the next version. But I think it is fair to say that when we go to an Annual Release, the cadence will be about the same quarter because that's what really enables us even with Enterprises to get to be far more of an annual release cycle and have maintenance be a more meaningful part of the business."

Any provider that provides tools that enable people to deliver applications across those environments, that value proposition is strong. I think it's clearly true that with Apple first, people started to build native applications. But as you are starting to see these new platforms take off, whether they be Android, whether they be what HP is going to come out with the touchpad, as Microsoft and RIM deliver their mobile environments. Customers are clearly struggling with being able to deal with all of these different platforms. The other thing that we've done and with Flash Builder for our 0.5, which is also being released, is we actually now allow native extensions. And so one of the things that I think we've done very creatively is allow people to use a common framework for the most part, but optimize for each of these native environments using the native extensions. And that's clearly something that's resonating. So you can take advantage of any specific features that you have. Whether they be in Android or iOS. And we have thousands of applications that people are building cross-platform. And I just think as there are more platforms, people are going to deliver that. And the last thing I would say is when you build applications, people are building applications both within the web browser and they're building standalone applications. And if you can bridge that gap, I think there's a value proposition there for application developers around the world."

So again, just to clarify what the business model is with the digital publishing suite, which was in beta up until very recently.

So clearly, the business is going to scale as more and more people target tablet devices across the world. Again as I said for a variety of different magazines, catalogs, newspapers and publishing systems. The other thing we do also is for people who want their Digital Publishing Suite, the tie-in with the Creative Suite and that the Creative Suite is the best way to author our photo SaaS-based services. So that's how we think about it. At the analyst meeting, we'll give you an update on the available market and the sizing of the market. But clearly, I look at it and it's going to be the same kind of growth that you saw with websites. Everybody's going to target these tablet devices and I think digital publishing suite positions us very effectively in that space.

And as a result of that, you've got some additional OpEx, with not as much growth on the revenue line in the third quarter, but then, we more than make up for that in the fourth quarter with strong margin improvement, and that's why you end up on the year with approximately 37%, which is up from last year."

And you're right, Dan, in that we do have a fairly comprehensive offering of products, while they use captivate in the e-learning solution. All of that stuff is actually played back in Flash as people build training and curriculum. And I would also reflect the fact that whether it's electronic books, our digital publishing suite can also be used for publishing electronic books. So the education vertical, the move towards electronic, whether it's textbooks, quizzes, surveys et cetera, it's clearly an area where people are using our tools. And that entire area drive for innovation. And I think we're well-positioned there."

The whole idea for Captivate was to target nonprogrammers, with being able to create compelling content and deliver that across. But you also referred to tablets, we've talked about how we're going to be very aggressive about getting tablets not just to be a consumption device, which is what they are today, but also to be a Creative device. So watch out for some really exciting new products. We've already delivered some for Photoshop. They've actually got a very good reception. But you will see Adobe deliver a very comprehensive product suite on all of these tablet devices. 
And given that's the last question, maybe I'll just end with a few summary remarks again, which is it's an exciting time. We're really executing well against the transformation agenda that we set for ourselves. And frankly, it leverages the tremendous franchise that we have with both our Creative and our PDF tools. What we're clearly seeing is that a new category is being created for marketing within the Enterprise, much like finance happened with ERP or sales happened with CRM. And this area of marketing online, I don't think there's a company that's better positioned with a more comprehensive set of solutions for all of these marketers. So whether it's creating the authoring tools to create the content, whether it's a platform to manage and deliver and transport that content and measuring and monetizing and delivering it across all mobile environments. We think that's a category that's going to increase significantly. And all of our products are very well-positioned to be able to deal with that particular marketplace. We're very well-positioned in SaaS with all of these offerings as a combination of what we've done with digital marketing and customer experience. And mobile is also clearly driving a lot of the interest, whether it's on authoring, analytics or creating the multichannel solutions. So exciting time, I think it was a strong quarter for us. And we look forward to continuing to execute against the agenda we've set for ourselves."

Our strong performance reflects our unique value proposition in the industry. We enable our customers to make, manage, mobilize and measure digital experiences across screens in ways no other company can. This end-to-end approach is resonating with our customers and fueling our growth across an increasingly diverse set of markets. 
As we have previously shared with you, we're focused on 3 significant growth opportunities, content 
authoring, digital marketing optimization and customer experience management. We're executing well in each area. 
In content authoring, we successfully launched Creative Suite 5.5, an update to the CS5 product family. The release features enhancements for mobile content and application creation, new innovations for HTML5 and Flash authoring, and amazing new features and productivity improvements in our video authoring solutions. 
CS5.5 is the first release in our transition to an annual release cycle, enabling us to deliver content creation innovations to our customers more frequently in response to the rapidly evolving marketplace. It also allows us to augment our business model to drive incremental revenue. In addition to the perpetual license model we've always offered, we now offer a new subscription addition with CS5.5 that provides a lower upfront price point for customers. 
Whether it be HTML, Flash or any other output format, the goal of CS5.5 is to be the best authoring suite, regardless of platform, browser or operating system. Response to our HTML 5 tooling capabilities in CS5.5 has been positive and we recently made new contributions to the HTML standards process by proposing enhancements to build complex, magazine-like layouts in web browsers using web standards. 
We are working on an implementation of this proposal in the WebKit open-source HTML engine with Apple, Google and other members of the community. Looking forward, we will deliver a beta release of Adobe Edge in July, which is a new Creative tool for creating expressive animations in HTML for desktops and devices. 
While we work to help advance HTML capabilities, we will also continue to innovate with our Flash technology, particularly in areas such as premium video content delivery and measurement, rich Internet applications and gaming. 
In premium video content, services such as Amazon Instant Video, HBO Go and Hulu and media companies such as ABC and CBS, the BBC in the U.K., M6 in France, MTV, Turner and many others rely on Adobe's platform for delivering and monetizing their assets. 
For mobile apps, the industry is starting to recognize the power of utilizing Flash through the Adobe AIR runtime for devices running Android, iOS, RIM's BlackBerry tablet OS and others. IDC cited Adobe as having a, ""leading multiplatform mobile-development environment."" 
This week, we released version 4.5 of Flash Builder and Flex to extend the capabilities of our developer tools platform. CS5.5 integrates with our new Digital Publishing Solution, which enables publishers to create, distribute and monetize their digital publications for use on tablets. 
Our digital publishing solution has enabled our customers to launch over 400 titles already in over 40 countries. We continue to be excited about the opportunity that the tablet market offers us, not only as a consumption device, but also as a creation Platform for Adobe applications in the future. 
Looking forward, expect this type of innovation to continue. We intend to ship the next milestone release of Creative Suite in 2012, and that will include an updated version of Photoshop. 
In digital marketing optimization, Q2 was another record revenue quarter. It's clear that the digital marketing category is exploding, as evidenced by our sold-out digital marketing summits in Salt Lake City and London. 
We announced our next-generation platform for the Adobe online marketing suite that helps our customers more quickly analyze and derive actionable insight from video, social and mobile traffic. We also introduced Adobe Tag Manager, which provides a tag management framework to accelerate digital campaigns within the suite. These innovations ensure that we continue to have the most comprehensive offering in the space. 
As social media becomes an integral part of our customers' marketing, digital marketers find it critical to measure the impact of social media in their campaigns. In March, we announced a beta release of our new Adobe SocialAnalytics product, and reaction from customers has been strong. The new product enables users to actively correlate social media sentiment to business impact. Recent customer wins in our Digital Marketing business include Dell, Lenovo, the European financial group, UniCredit and Vodafone. 
In customer experience management, we achieved year-over-year growth of 34%. The integration of our desk software acquisition has gone well, with Q2 customer wins, including Delta Airlines, SAP, Barclays services, Louis Vuitton and Café Pacific. 
Yesterday, we announced the new Adobe Digital Enterprise Platform, a unified solution for customer experience management and a suite of Adobe customer experience solutions to power engaging digital experiences across multiple communication channels. This platform and set of solutions, incorporate Day's web content management capabilities, along with our LiveCycle capabilities and the measurement and analytics of our online marketing suite. We will roll out these offerings beginning later this summer and we're excited about the progress that we're making in delivering integrated solutions, which leverage many of our products. 
This strategy is helping to grow the size of our engagements and sales with large enterprise customers, as we're increasingly benefiting from the synergy among our offerings to help customers create differentiated and effective digital experiences. 
For example, both Nike and publishing from Meredith Corp. purchased multiproduct solutions across our Omniture and Day product lines in Q2. So did retail and online stores H&M, Marks & Spencer and Nordstrom. 
Success in selling multimillion dollar Enterprise solutions such as these, demonstrate how we've increased the value we provide to customers and how we're increasingly becoming mission-critical to how our customers run their Online business. Later, I will have some closing comments. But first, I will now turn the call over to Mark for a look at the financial results in the quarter. Mark?"

In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, Adobe achieved revenue of $1,023,000,000. This compares to $943 million reported in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $1,028,000,000 reported last quarter. Year-over-year, this represents 9% revenue growth. Q2 GA",1305,"Thanks, Shantanu. In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, Adobe achieved revenue of $1,023,000,000. This compares to $943 million reported in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $1,028,000,000 reported last quarter. Year-over-year, this represents 9% revenue growth. 
Q2 GAAP operating expenses were $637.3 million compared to $607.9 million reported in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $617.7 million last quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses in Q2 were $556.7 million compared to $520.2 million reported for Q2 fiscal 2010 and $539.5 million last quarter. 
GAAP operating income in Q2 fiscal 2011 was $276.7 million or 27% of revenue. This compares to GAAP operating income of $227.3 million or 24.1% of revenue in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $302.3 million or 29.4% of revenue last quarter. Non-GAAP operating income in Q2 fiscal 2011 was $376.4 million or 36.8% of revenue. This compares to non-GAAP operating income of $334.5 million or 35.5% of revenue in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $400.1 million or 38.9% of revenue last quarter. 
Adobe's effective GAAP tax rate in Q2 was 11.5% and the non-GAAP tax rate was 22%. Our GAAP tax rate was lower in Q2, due to the favorable impact of a state income tax ruling. GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q2 fiscal 2011 were $0.45. This compares with GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.28 reported in Q2 fiscal 2010, and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.46 reported last quarter. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q2 fiscal 2011 were $0.55. This compares with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.44 in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $0.58 reported last quarter. 
I will now discuss Adobe's results in Q2 by business segment. Creative and Interactive Solutions segment revenue in Q2 was $433.1 million compared to $423.3 million in Q2 fiscal 2010 when we launched CS 5 and $424.8 million last quarter. 
While it's only been a matter of weeks since 5.5  shipped, we can make the following observations. The release of CS5.5 in Q2 has helped maintain a solid run rate that CS5 established during the prior 4 quarters. Interest in Master Collection, as well as Web premium and the production premium video suites has been strong, indicating positive reception to the key innovations and new features that were added to those products. 
Adoption of the new subscription addition has met our expectations and is attracting new users. We expect this to build a new recurring revenue stream overtime. Digital Media Solutions Q2 revenue was $136.7 million compared to $139.3 million in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $151.7 million last quarter. The sequential revenue decline is primarily attributed to product LifeCycle timing. 
Digital Enterprise Solutions revenue was $283.5 million in Q2, compared to $231.9 million in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $286.6 million last quarter. Within Digital Enterprise Solutions, Knowledge Worker revenue was $182 million compared to $156 million in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $181.8 million last quarter. 
Acrobat grew 17% year-over-year driven by an increase in both ASPs and units. Enterprise segment revenue was $101.5 million compared to $75.9 million in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $104.8 million last quarter. Year-over-year revenue growth of 34% was driven by strong adoption of Day content management and the increased awareness of our broad customer experience management solutions. 
Omniture segment revenue in Q2 was a record $115.9 million compared to $91.9 million reported in Q2 of fiscal 2010 and $110.9 million last quarter. Omniture server transactions were up 13% on a year-over-year basis. Mobile and tablet device traffic remains the fastest-growing part of the Omniture business, with the number of transactions we measured for mobile devices growing 24% quarter-over-quarter in Q2. 
Omniture revenue diversification continued with site Catalyst at 51% of Q2 Omniture product revenue. Conversion and multichannel analytics products are growing in size as Analytics business becomes a smaller percentage of the business. Enterprise renewal rates remained at 95% in the quarter.  Finally, Print and Publishing segment revenue was $54 million compared to $56.6 million in Q2 fiscal 2010 and $53.7 million last quarter. 
Turning to our geographic segments in Q2. Results on a percent of revenue basis were as follows: the Americas, 48%; Europe, 30%; Asia, 22%. At the time of our Q1 earnings call in March, the unfortunate events in Japan caused us to estimate that as much as $50 million in Q2 revenue was at risk in that market. Fortunately, through the strong work of our team in Japan and the resiliency demonstrated in the country, we estimate the impact was only $10 million in the quarter. This helped to drive a sequential increase in our Asia revenue versus our estimate that revenue would decline sequentially. 
Partially offsetting the Q2 upside in Japan, we experienced weaker-than-expected demand in EMEA. In the Americas, the demand environment remained stable. From a year-over-year currency's perspective, FX increased revenue by $35 million. We had $0.2 million hedge gain in Q2 fiscal '11 versus a $6.2 million hedge gain in Q2 fiscal '10, thus the net year-over-year currency increase to revenue considering hedging gains was $29 million. 
From a quarter-over-quarter perspective, FX increased revenue by $15.6 million. We had a $0.2 million hedge gain in Q2 fiscal '11 versus no hedge gain in Q1 fiscal '11. Thus, the net sequential currency increase to revenue, considering hedging gains was $15.8 million. 
We entered and exited the second quarter with no shippable backlog. Employees at the end of Q2 totaled 9,770 versus 9,503 at the end of the last quarter. The increase was primarily due to the addition of summer interns and hiring in sales and marketing. 
Our trade DSO was 51 days, which compares to 42 days in the year ago quarter and 47 days last quarter. Our global channel inventory position at the end of the quarter was within company policy. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $389 million. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $2.6 billion, the same as it was at the end of Q1. 
Deferred revenue in the quarter increased by $38.6 million in the quarter to a total of $482 million. In Q2, we repurchased approximately 13.7 million shares at a total cost of $461.6 million. Entering Q3, $455 million of stock repurchase authority remains against the $1.6 billion stock repurchase authorization announced in July of last year. 
This concludes my discussion of our financial results. I would now like to comment on our financial targets for the third quarter of fiscal 2011. 
We are targeting a Q3 revenue range of $1 billion to $1,050,000,000. At the midpoint of this targeted range, we would expect Omniture and Enterprise segments to grow sequentially. We would expect Creative and Interactive, as well as digital Media solutions to be flat to slightly up. We would expect Knowledge Worker to decline and we would expect Print and Publishing to be flat. Geographically, we would expect Americas to grow sequentially, offset by an expected sequential decline in Asia and EMEA due to normal seasonality in those markets. 
For margins, we are targeting a Q3 GAAP operating margin range of 24.5% to 27.5% and a non-GAAP operating margin range of 34% to 36%. We are targeting our Q3 share count to be 501 million to 503 million shares. We are targeting non-operating expense to be between $17 million and $21 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. For our Q3 effective GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates, we are targeting 22%. These targets lead to a GAAP earnings per share range of $0.35 to $0.42 and a non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.50 to $0.56. 
We are also reaffirming today our 10% annual revenue growth target for fiscal year 2011. In addition, we are targeting our full-year operating margin to be approximately 27.5% on a GAAP basis and approximately 37% on a non-GAAP basis. 
This concludes my section. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Shantanu."

The company is undergoing a significant transformation and our mission of changing the world through digital experiences has never been more relevant. We continue to focus on our 3 large growth opportunities: content authoring, digital marketing optimization and customer experience management, and most importantly, on the synergies among them. 
Increasingly, we are finding that the real power is in creating customer solutions like digital publishing and web experience management that integrate our product lines. This will be a major thrust for us moving forward. Regardless of whether our customers are major media companies, enterprises, government agencies or educational institutions, they all face the same challenge with their digital content and applications. They need to make compelling experiences that will scale across media and devices, manage their assets to streamline touch points with customers, mobilize the experiences to easily reach their audience across every channel and measure the effectiveness of experiences to maximize customer conversion and revenue. This need has never been more critical than it is right now. And we see the opportunities for Adobe continuing to grow as the digital landscape becomes richer and more diverse. 
Adobe's success has always been due to our incredible team of employees throughout the world.

But before I answer that specifically, let me maybe give you a few more observations on 5.5 as we looked at it after the first quarter. And clearly, it was the first step in us moving to an annual cycle. And so I think we've successfully transitioned against that strategy which really allows us to deliver more innovations on a more regular basis and introduce new business models. When we saw the results, it is clearly demonstrating that it's extending the life of CS5 and we expect to see the CS5 and 5.5 revenue actually cross the CS3 revenue within the comparable period right now. So it's clear that it continues to do well in the marketplace. The products that were updated in the CS5.5, and you know that all products were not updated, we're clearly off to a strong start, which I think again, reflects the need in the marketplace. So the Web and video products, specifically the Master Collection, production premium and Web premium. And Steve, I think there are a couple features that seem to resonate particularly with the customers. Clearly, the HTML offering that we're providing is resonating. Mobile app creation, now that we can have mobile apps that are created and deployed across the i devices, Android devices and the RIM devices. The other thing that we're also seeing frankly is the tie in from those products to our digital publishing suite. And so for people who wish to use our digital publishing suite, a lot of those products also enable you to participate in that entire workflow. So I think that's a sampling of what we've seen. And with respect to which customers, I mean we clearly have very, very loyal customers. So a number of the customers who adopted were customers who were on CS5. But in addition to that, as we've said, we're targeting the earlier version customers, namely the CS4 and the CS3 customers."

It did go up $39 million like I said. It's driven by a few things. It's clearly driven by the Omniture SaaS kind of ratable model which drives a lot of deferred revenue every quarter, especially as we see their bookings doing so well. We also have some royalty agreements that represent deferred revenue in there as well as maintenance and support. So it's kind of a combination of all those frankly, but obviously, a very good result from a deferred revenue perspective. And as it relates to Europe, it was somewhat off of our expectations. It was primarily in Northern Europe, which is the Nordic countries in the U.K., obviously. I wouldn't say that it was concentrated more towards the end of the quarter or the beginning of the quarter. I think it was fairly consistent tough-selling throughout the quarter. But again, we're very fortunate that we have a diversified model from a geographic perspective. Japan did a little better this quarter, Europe did a little worse than we thought and in the end, overall, we had a good quarter."

So Brent, I mean I think with respect to 5.5, the fact that we've embraced and we're actually rapidly doing future development for HTML5, as people think about the different media formats, that's clearly resonating with customers. I'll say Digital publishing has really been a pleasant surprise as it relates to people whether they're publishing catalogs, magazines, video training material, all of the media solutions, that's been a pleasant surprise. We're definitely starting to see as we sell content management and we sell analytics people want Creative Suite part of that. So I mean what's really playing out nicely is as we're selling to the marketers, each of the different products are leading to other product sales. So we've seen some fairly significant multimillion dollar deals with all of the Creative customers. And I think people are looking forward frankly, to the next release as well, because there's a significant anticipation that's being built up for all the cool thing that we can do in imaging with Photoshop. And there's a lot of exciting stuff underway. Maybe the last comment is video, I mean we are definitely making significant traction in video with our offering tools. People have seen the quality that we've put in so for broadcast as well as high-end video. We're clearly gaining market share. And on subscriptions, I think, Mark just alluded to that. We are seeing new customers coming to the platform as a result of subscription. So it's not material yet, but what we are pleased with is people who would otherwise, not be attracted to the Adobe Platform. It's clear that subscriptions is helping attract new customers to the platform."

I think there's actually going to be a YouTube video that's being posted up later this day to talk about some of the key new functionality. Clearly, what Flash did a phenomenal job of is, everything from rich Internet advertising to completely interactive games. That's what people are using Flash for. And that's actually increasing. When it comes to delivering these capabilities for PC, we've seen no letup whatsoever in people using Flash. But now people are trying to push the envelope with how they can use HTML5 to do the same things, whether it's apps for mobile devices, whether it's interactive games and completely new interactive websites. And so think of it as everything that you could do with Flash Professional as that capability gets added to HTML overtime, and it will take many years before the functionality is comparable, we want Adobe Edge to be the best way in which people create, whether it's animation, interactivity or rich Internet applications using HTML5. So that sort of conceptually what we're doing. With annual releases, we're still very focused right now on 5.5 and to also the question that Brent asked, continuing to drive that through the cycle until we release the next version. But I think it is fair to say that when we go to an Annual Release, the cadence will be about the same quarter because that's what really enables us even with Enterprises to get to be far more of an annual release cycle and have maintenance be a more meaningful part of the business."

Any provider that provides tools that enable people to deliver applications across those environments, that value proposition is strong. I think it's clearly true that with Apple first, people started to build native applications. But as you are starting to see these new platforms take off, whether they be Android, whether they be what HP is going to come out with the touchpad, as Microsoft and RIM deliver their mobile environments. Customers are clearly struggling with being able to deal with all of these different platforms. The other thing that we've done and with Flash Builder for our 0.5, which is also being released, is we actually now allow native extensions. And so one of the things that I think we've done very creatively is allow people to use a common framework for the most part, but optimize for each of these native environments using the native extensions. And that's clearly something that's resonating. So you can take advantage of any specific features that you have. Whether they be in Android or iOS. And we have thousands of applications that people are building cross-platform. And I just think as there are more platforms, people are going to deliver that. And the last thing I would say is when you build applications, people are building applications both within the web browser and they're building standalone applications. And if you can bridge that gap, I think there's a value proposition there for application developers around the world."

So clearly, the business is going to scale as more and more people target tablet devices across the world. Again as I said for a variety of different magazines, catalogs, newspapers and publishing systems. The other thing we do also is for people who want their Digital Publishing Suite, the tie-in with the Creative Suite and that the Creative Suite is the best way to author our photo SaaS-based services. So that's how we think about it. At the analyst meeting, we'll give you an update on the available market and the sizing of the market.

It would go down in Q3 due to seasonality of revenue and then back up in Q4. We're actually following that trend exactly as we anticipated. Basically, what you find is that as you look at the revenue guidance we've provided for the third quarter, we're still ramping on the expense side as we hire, primarily in sales and marketing for capacity for 2012. And as a result of that, you've got some additional OpEx, with not as much growth on the revenue line in the third quarter, but then, we more than make up for that in the fourth quarter with strong margin improvement, and that's why you end up on the year with approximately 37%, which is up from last year."

Same thing is true of the Online Marketing, Digital Marketing business. And we haven't answered any questions yet about that, but that was record bookings again. And when you think about what's happening with respect to digital marketing, that category is exploding. Social analytics, we announced a beta of our product, and we add over 100 customers wanting to sign up. The businesses diversifying, side catalysts is again, the lowest percentage of the overall business. So the suite approach. And there again, without a doubt, as we add sales capacity, they're actually coming up to speed incredibly fast and contributing to the bottom line. Digital publishing and everything that's happening with Creative Suite, we've successfully transformed that to an annual cycle. We've dealt with mobile, we've built with HTML and Flash. And so the things that we've outlined in terms of the core businesses for the company, we're executing against all of those. And Acrobat again, continues to perform well. If there is a significant downturn, I think Mark has always demonstrated that we will find a way to deal with that situation.

But you will see Adobe deliver a very comprehensive product suite on all of these tablet devices. 
And given that's the last question, maybe I'll just end with a few summary remarks again, which is it's an exciting time. We're really executing well against the transformation agenda that we set for ourselves. And frankly, it leverages the tremendous franchise that we have with both our Creative and our PDF tools. What we're clearly seeing is that a new category is being created for marketing within the Enterprise, much like finance happened with ERP or sales happened with CRM. And this area of marketing online, I don't think there's a company that's better positioned with a more comprehensive set of solutions for all of these marketers. So whether it's creating the authoring tools to create the content, whether it's a platform to manage and deliver and transport that content and measuring and monetizing and delivering it across all mobile environments. We think that's a category that's going to increase significantly. And all of our products are very well-positioned to be able to deal with that particular marketplace. We're very well-positioned in SaaS with all of these offerings as a combination of what we've done with digital marketing and customer experience. And mobile is also clearly driving a lot of the interest, whether it's on authoring, analytics or creating the multichannel solutions. So exciting time, I think it was a strong quarter for us.

This compares to $990.3 million reported in Q3 fiscal 2010 and $1,023,000,000 reported last quarter. Q3 GAAP operating expenses were $634.4 million compared to $589.2 million reported in Q3 fiscal 2010 and $637.3 million last quarter. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses in Q3 were $560.1 million compared to $524.7 million reported for Q3 fiscal 2010 and $556.7 million last quarter. 
GAAP operating income in Q3 fiscal 2011 was $274.1 million or 27.1% of revenue. This compares to GAAP operating income of $302 million or 30.5% of revenue in Q3 fiscal 2010 and $276.7 million or 27% of revenue last quarter. Non-GAAP operating income in Q3 fiscal 2011 was $366.1 million or 36.1% of revenue. This compares to non-GAAP operating income of $384.9 million or 38.9% of revenue in Q3 fiscal 2010 and $376.4 million or 36.8% of revenue last quarter. 
Adobe's effective GAAP tax rate in Q3 was 24%, and the effective non-GAAP tax rate was 22%. The difference between the GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates is due to our acquisition of EchoSign during the quarter. GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q3 fiscal 2011 were $0.39. This compares with GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.44 reported in Q3 fiscal 2010 and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.45 reported last quarter. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q3 fiscal 2011 were $0.55. This compares with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.54 in Q3 fiscal 2010 and $0.55 reported last quarter. 
I'll now discuss Adobe's results in Q3 by business segment. Creative and Interactive Solutions segment revenue in Q3 was $417.9 million compared to $416.9 million in Q3 fiscal 2010 and $433.1 million last quarter.  Digital Media Solutions Q3 revenue was $151.1 million compared to $157.7 million in Q3 fiscal 2010 and $136.7 million last quarter. 
Creative Suite revenue in Q3 was consistent with revenue achieved in the year-ago quarter, demonstrating that CS5.5 continues to maintain the solid run rate that CS5 established. We also had a strong quarter and record revenue in the education market in Q3. 
When comparing the performance of recent Creative Suite releases, CS5 and CS5.5 combined revenue has now achieved approximately the same amount of revenue that we achieved with CS3 for the comparable amount of time and has exceeded revenue achieved with CS4 by approximately 25%. 
Our subscription offering with CS5.5 is attracting new users. More than 1/3 of the subscribers have never bought an Adobe product before, and 2/3 of the subscribers today tell us they would not have purchased without this offering. 
We will continue to target Final Cut Pro and Avid customers with our switcher program and believe we are gaining market share in digital video with our Premiere Pro and Production Premium products. 
Digital Enterprise Solutions revenue was $270.4 million in Q3 compared to $256.1 million in Q3 fiscal 2010 and $283.5 million last quarter. Within Digital Enterprise Solutions, Knowledge Worker revenue was $174.6 million compared to $162.6 million in Q3 fiscal 2010 and $182 million last quarter. Our 7% year-over-year growth demonstrates the continued strength of Acrobat as a standard tool in small and large enterprises. 
Our Q3 acquisition of EchoSign, a leading web-based provider of electronic signatures and signature automation, enhances our document exchange capabilities and will be a key part of our goal to increase the value of Acrobat in the document access, review and approval processes. 
Enterprise segment revenue was $95.8 million compared to $93.5 million in Q3 fiscal 2010 and $101.5 million last quarter. We continue to see strong demand for the combination of our Day content management and Omniture online marketing solution. As a result, we are focusing more field resources on the integrated product line. 
Omniture segment revenue in Q3 was $118.2 million compared to $99.8 million reported in Q3 of fiscal 2010 and $115.9 million last quarter. Omniture year-over-year bookings growth continues to exceed 20%, and enterprise renewal rates remain strong at 95% in the quarter. Mobile and tablet device traffic remains the fastest-growing part of the Omniture business, with a number of transactions we measured for mobile devices growing to 11% of total transactions in Q3, up from 7% last quarter. 
Omniture revenue diversification continued with SiteCatalyst decreasing to 50% of Q3 Omniture product revenue. Conversion and multichannel analytics products are growing in size as the analytics business becomes a smaller percentage of the business.  
We are seeing strong demand for our new Demdex and SocialAnalytics offerings. Our SocialAnalytics product is the industry's first analytics solution to tie social activity to business results. 
Finally, Print and Publishing segment revenue was $55.6 million compared to $59.8 million in Q3 fiscal 2010 and $54 million last quarter. 
Turning to our geographic segments in Q3. Results on a percent of revenue basis were as follows: The Americas, 50%; Europe, 29%; Asia, 21%. We experienced stable demand in the Americas and Asia, the weakness in EMEA that we experienced in Q2 continued into Q3. 
From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $37.6 million. We had no hedged gains in Q3 fiscal 2011 versus a $13.2 million hedge gain in Q3 fiscal 2010, thus the net year-over-year currency increase to revenue considering hedging gains was $24.4 million. 
From a quarter-over-quarter perspective, FX increased revenue by $4.6 million. We had no hedged gains in Q3 fiscal 2011 versus a $0.2 million hedge gain in Q2 fiscal 2011, thus the net sequential currency increase to revenue considering hedging gains was $4.4 million. 
Employees at the end of Q3 totaled 10,041 versus 9,770 at the end of last quarter. Our trade DSO was 50 days, which compares to 45 days in the year-ago quarter and 51 days last quarter. Our global channel inventory position at the end of the quarter was within company policy. 
During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $325 million. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $2.7 billion compared to $2.6 billion at the end of Q2. Deferred revenue in the quarter increased by approximately $2 million in the quarter to a total of $484 million. 
In Q3, we repurchased approximately 3.6 million shares at a total cost of $100 million. Entering Q4, $355 million of stock repurchase authority remains against the $1.6 billion stock repurchase authorization announced in July of last year. 
This concludes my discussion of our financial results. I would now like to comment on our financial targets for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. We are targeting a Q4 revenue range between $1,075,000,000 and $1,125,000,000. At the midpoint of this targeted range, we would expect all of our business segments to grow sequentially except Print and Publishing, which we expect to be relatively flat. We would also expect all of our major geographies to grow sequentially. 
For margins, we are targeting a Q4 GAAP operating margin range of 26.5% to 29.5% and a non-GAAP operating margin range of 36% to 38%. We are targeting our Q4 share count to be 497 million to 499 million shares. We are targeting nonoperating expense to be between $17 million and $21 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. 
For our Q4 effective GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates, we are targeting 22%. These targets lead to a GAAP earnings per share range of $0.41 to $0.50 per share and a non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.57 to $0.64. 
At the high end of our financial targets for our fourth quarter, we will achieve our 10% annual revenue growth target, as well as earnings growth of 20% for the fiscal year. 
This concludes my section. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Shantanu."

Tablets and smartphones have become the new devices of choice. Software is moving to the cloud. Business models are evolving the subscription offerings and app stores and technologies like HTML5 are gaining favor. 
These trends are having a significant impact on our customers. From publishers to marketers the educational institutions, our customers face the same challenge: the need to create compelling digital content and applications that work on both desktops and devices and the need to measure the impact of those experiences. 
Adobe's heritage is in content authoring. We built the category and we remain the market leader. Today, we enable our core audience of publishers, designers and developers to create the world's best websites, applications and games using our Creative Suite desktop software. We will continue to innovate on the desktop, providing new functionality to address the challenges our customers face. 
With the shifting landscape that favors HTML5-based content and application delivery, we are doubling down in our investment in this area. CS5.5 deliver enhanced HTML5 capabilities. We recently previewed Adobe Edge, a new HTML5 web motion and interaction design tool, which allows web designers to create cutting-edge animations for their websites. Interest in this tool far exceeded our expectations. 
We just introduced the beta release of a new product codenamed Muse, which allows designers to create and publish HTML-based websites without writing complex HTML code. We're also contributing new innovations to WebKit to allow for a more expressive web. These initiatives show our commitment to help drive the evolution of browsers and be the leading tools provider for HTML5, and this is only the beginning. 
The explosion of tablets is changing the paradigm for content authoring. We believe that content will be consumed and created on these devices. Similar to the desktop, we intend to be the leading provider of creative authoring applications on tablets. 
We will soon be introducing a broad set of tablet-based and cloud-connected apps and services across iOS, Android and other mobile platforms that represent a new revenue stream. We're excited about the recent introduction of Adobe Carousel, an innovative new cloud-connected imaging app for Mac OS and iOS devices. As we bring these new products to market, expect to see us place a greater emphasis on new customer acquisition and the introduction of subscription offerings to drive more recurring revenue. 
One of the highest priorities for our publishing customers is to deliver, measure and monetize their content on tablets. With CS5 and our Digital Publishing Suite, we've helped our customers deliver over 600 titles through app stores. As more publishers move their magazines, newspapers and catalogs to tablets, our addressable market and our offerings in this space will grow. 
In addition to publishers, every major enterprise is moving more of its business online. We are helping our customers re-platform their digital assets, optimize their marketing spend and drive more digital commerce. We will continue to integrate our Creative Suite content authoring, our Day content management and our Omniture online marketing solutions to meet the needs of publishers, advertising agencies and marketeers. The strong growth in our Omniture and Day bookings this year is evidence of our success in this space already. 
In digital marketing, the opportunity is massive, with worldwide ad spend expected to grow to more than $100 billion by 2013 according to IBC. Adobe's online marketing suite is one of the largest cloud-based software offerings in the world. Our solutions enable marketeers to drive their business across all marketing channels, including web, mobile, e-mail, search, display and social. We're a leader in this category and will continue to introduce new technologies like the SocialAnalytics product we delivered this quarter. We will also align our field and marketing resources to more aggressively target the digital marketing opportunity and accelerate the momentum we have already achieved. 
Document services and the use of Acrobat and PDF continue to have huge momentum. Content protection and reliable document delivery remain priorities for customers across every segment. Adobe will increase its investment in cloud-based document exchange services with electronic signatures being a new growth opportunity. 
At Adobe MAX in early October, we will unveil some of our newest innovations in the content authoring arena. In November, we will host a Financial Analyst Meeting where we will provide a comprehensive update on our strategy and opportunities.

As we think about the evolution of Creative Suite moving forward, I think there are a couple of different things that we're hearing from our customers in terms of what would be catalysts for Creative Suite. And HTML5 and support for HTML5, whether that's browser-based content or creating standalone applications are certainly one of it.  And so as you can expect, we will be taking the tools that we've been delivering like Adobe Edge and Muse, and you might see that in future versions of the Creative Suite. So that's one example of how we're continuing to monetize HTML because we want to be clearly the leader in HTML authoring. The other way is as HTML video is also taking off, you've probably seen that we announced a new version of the Flash Media Server and the Flash Media Server also now serves up content not just to Flash video but in addition to that also to HTML video. And finally, the Digital Publishing Solutions. The Digital Publishing Solutions also export all of these newspapers, magazines, catalogs that we are preparing in either Flash content or AIR or as HTML. So big picture, I would say as HTML is getting more prevalent, we're clearly both embracing it from the point of view of tools and being the leader in tools but also contributing aggressively to the evolution of HTML as a standard."

But I think it's important to keep in mind that Q3 is always our tough quarter due to summer seasonality the way our calendar falls so we were very pleased with where we came in, in our target range. And if you look at the guidance we provided, like I said at the high end, we would grow the business 10% just like we anticipated before the start of the year. Margins are improving year-over-year. Earnings growth will be around 20% at the high end of the range. Shantanu said CS5.5 is having the effect of keeping the run rate up late in the cycle. Omniture bookings are growing over 20%, and Acrobat's doing very well. So overall, we're really pleased. We were definitely off the most in Europe. The weakness that we saw last quarter, like I said, continued.

And so it is our intent to continue to be strong in the video space. At the IBC conference recently, we also announced high-end color. And so the video is a strong business for us not just on the authoring tools but frankly for the entire workflow because now we also have the ability to deliver that content into content protection.

In terms of whether penetration is for CS5, as Mark said in his prepared remarks, it's actually the revenue has now -- it's on par with CS3 and considerably greater than it is for CS4. We have about something like 40% of our customers on CS now on CS5 so that gives you some sense of the penetration.  And what CS5 has done is really accomplish a couple of the objectives that we had set out to do. The first is how do we drive continued strong run rate of 5% while moving to the annual cycle so that we could enable more frequent innovation. The second goal that we clearly had was to continue to update our products more frequently to allow our customers to deal with what was happening in the marketplace.  And as we look forward, frankly, to the next version of CS, we think there are a lot of things that are going to drive the new version of CS and not least of which is a new version of our franchise imaging application. But in addition to that, the things that I mentioned earlier, video, expect to see a fair amount of HTML5 innovation coming in the next CS and the combination frankly of both the Creative applications, the tablet applications and what we provide as cloud services. So a lot of excitement about what we're going to deliver next year."

So clea",298,"Sure, there are multiple questions in that. For the current subscriptions, the customers that we are attracting are, I would say, fall into 2 categories: the new customers and these are customers who have never experienced an Adobe product before. So clearly, what we're doing with having attractive entry-level prices, attracting brand new customers. It's also converting customers when we would have traditionally call version skippers are to stay more current with the CS set of products. So that's how I would characterize what we are seeing with the subscription pricing. In terms of moving forward and in future releases of CS, the goal clearly is to have our current creative professionals stay current at higher numbers than we've seen with CS5 and prior releases.  And with everything that's changing in the Creative environment, we believe that this really allows us to have more innovation. Take a product like Edge. If you have a product like Edge that's on subscription, that's offered to a lot of the subscription people, that provides incentive for people to stay current.  And today, with the 18-month cycles, you aren't allowed to do that, as you know, given financial accounting. So that's the strategic rationale for continuing to drive towards subscriptions and attracting new customers to the platform. On the tablet side specifically, I think we would all say it's early. We do believe strongly that tablets will be used not just for consumption devices but for creation devices. You're going to continue to see styluses added to tablet devices which make it an even more compelling offering. We will have a comprehensive set of products, and I think it's early to say how rapidly that will grow but we do think that's a new revenue stream that will be meaningful for Adobe."

And Adobe intends to play in both of those categories with our Creative tools. As it relates to HTML, I think it's still in its infancy but we will work collaboratively with the entire community to make rich internet applications possible in HTML through the use of new frameworks. We will push video as a capability within HTML. We'll do the same thing for video.  And I think that's going to evolve over the next 4 or 5 years. The browser support is just beginning to happen frankly in terms of browsers that are supporting HTML both on desktops as well as on smartphones. And so I think big picture, that's a big opportunity for a company like Adobe. And our customers are clearly telling us, they want us to help reduce the complexity of authoring for these new richer expressive paradigms through our Creative tools. In terms of Microsoft specifically, yes, I think they will also offer developer tools, and they'll be one of many companies that targets this larger opportunity. On the standalone application side as well, we continue to make progress. I think the #1 selling iPad application in I think something like 13 countries was an application that was built in Flash and then recompiled in AIR to run on the AIR platform. So expect us to continue to also invest in making sure that for standalone applications, whether they be on the Apple platform, the Android platform or the Microsoft platform, we also expect our technology to work standalone on those environments."

In terms of our enterprise go-to-market, again, Mark said, that's the reason for aligning more and more of our sales force as well as our marketing programs to align around that joint offering to the customer because that's really resonating.

And having a unified message, having a unified marketing program actually helps us paint a bigger experience and a higher into enterprise. So expect to continue to see effort on that."

We have been acquiring, like we said, mostly on the smaller size, mid to smaller sized companies, and I always want to make sure we have cash on hand to do that.  And then whatever excess U.S. cash we have after those 2 things, we've been driving towards share repurchase.  And I would argue we've done a great job over 5 to 7 years of buying back incredible amount of stock, probably close to $1 billion a year every year for the past 5 or more years.

But as we preview what we are going to be talking about a lot more at the Analyst Meeting, our focus for 2012 really is in 2 areas: In content authoring, the 4 key initiatives that we have, continuing to drive innovation and Creative Suite in imaging and video with our publishing solutions as well as in HTML; the introduction of new tablet applications as well as cloud services to continue to innovate in terms of how people author; Digital Publishing and monetization solutions, we have over 600 titles. We're going to continue to focus on having newspapers, magazines and catalogs move online; and document services with things like ensuring document security, creation of PDF and electronic signatures continues to grow for us. And the large opportunity associated with digital marketing, targeting marketers who all want an online presence and want to make sure that they're serving their customers well. Publishers being able to sell both their ads and content and finally advertisers, enabling them to optimize their ad spend. And we certainly believe that there's hundreds of billions that's moving online.  And we're very well positioned with online marketing with our cloud-based services.

This compares to $990.3 million reported in Q3 fiscal 2010 and $1,023,000,000 reported last quarter. Q3 GAAP operating expenses were $634.4 million compared to $589.2 million reported in Q3 fiscal 2010 and $637.3 million last quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses in Q3 were $560.1 million compared to $524.7 million reported for Q3 fiscal 2010 and $556.7 million last quarter. 
GAAP operating income in Q3 fiscal 2011 was $274.1 million or 27.1% of revenue. This compares to GAAP operating income of $302 million or 30.5% of revenue in Q3 fiscal 2010 and $276.7 million or 27% of revenue last quarter. Non-GAAP operating income in Q3 fiscal 2011 was $366.1 million or 36.1% of revenue. This compares to non-GAAP operating income of $384.9 million or 38.9% of revenue in Q3 fiscal 2010 and $376.4 million or 36.8% of revenue last quarter. 
Adobe's effective GAAP tax rate in Q3 was 24%, and the effective non-GAAP tax rate was 22%. The difference between the GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates is due to our acquisition of EchoSign during the quarter. GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q3 fiscal 2011 were $0.39. This compares with GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.44 reported in Q3 fiscal 2010 and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.45 reported last quarter. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q3 fiscal 2011 were $0.55. This compares with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.54 in Q3 fiscal 2010 and $0.55 reported last quarter. I'll now discuss Adobe's results in Q3 by business segment. 
Creative and Interactive Solutions segment revenue in Q3 was $417.9 million compared to $416.9 million in Q3 fiscal 2010 and $433.1 million last quarter. Digital Media Solutions Q3 revenue was $151.1 million compared to $157.7 million in Q3 fiscal 2010 and $136.7 million last quarter. 
Creative Suite revenue in Q3 was consistent with revenue achieved in the year-ago quarter, demonstrating that CS5.5 continues to maintain the solid run rate that CS5 established. We also had a strong quarter and record revenue in the education market in Q3. When comparing the performance of recent Creative Suite releases, CS5 and CS5.5 combined revenue has now achieved approximately the same amount of revenue that we achieved with CS3 for the comparable amount of time and has exceeded revenue achieved with CS4 by approximately 25%.  
Our subscription offering with CS5.5 is attracting new users. More than 1/3 of the subscribers have never bought an Adobe product before, and 2/3 of the subscribers today tell us they would not have purchased without this offering. We will continue to target Final Cut Pro and Avid customers with our switcher program and believe we are gaining market share in digital video with our Premiere Pro and Production Premium products. 
Digital Enterprise Solutions revenue was $270.4 million in Q3 compared to $256.1 million in Q3 fiscal 2010 and $283.5 million last quarter. Within Digital Enterprise Solutions, Knowledge Worker revenue was $174.6 million compared to $162.6 million in Q3 fiscal 2010 and $182 million last quarter. Our 7% year-over-year growth demonstrates the continued strength of Acrobat as a standard tool in small and large enterprises. 
Our Q3 acquisition of EchoSign, a leading web-based provider of electronic signatures and signature automation, enhances our document exchange capabilities and will be a key part of our goal to increase the value of Acrobat in the document access, review and approval processes. 
Enterprise segment revenue was $95.8 million compared to $93.5 million in Q3 fiscal 2010 and $101.5 million last quarter. We continue to see strong demand for the combination of our Day content management and Omniture online marketing solution. As a result, we are focusing more field resources on the integrated product line. 
Omniture segment revenue in Q3 was $118.2 million compared to $99.8 million reported in Q3 of fiscal 2010 and $115.9 million last quarter. Omniture year-over-year bookings growth continues to exceed 20%, and enterprise renewal rates remain strong at 95% in the quarter. Mobile and tablet device traffic remains the fastest-growing part of the Omniture business, with a number of transactions we measured from mobile devices growing to 11% of total transactions in Q3, up from 7% last quarter. Omniture revenue diversification continued with SiteCatalyst decreasing to 50% of Q3 Omniture product revenue. Conversion and multichannel analytics products are growing in size as the analytics business becomes a smaller percentage of the business. We are seeing strong demand for our new Demdex and SocialAnalytics offerings. Our SocialAnalytics product is the industry's first analytics solution to tie social activity to business results. 
Finally, Print and Publishing segment revenue was $55.6 million compared to $59.8 million in Q3 fiscal 2010 and $54 million last quarter. Turning to our geographic segments in Q3. Results on a percent of revenue basis were as follows: The Americas, 50%; Europe, 29%; Asia, 21%. We experienced stable demand in the Americas and Asia, the weakness in EMEA that we experienced in Q2 continued into Q3. 
From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $37.6 million. We had no hedged gains in Q3 fiscal 2011 versus a $13.2 million hedge gain in Q3 fiscal 2010, thus the net year-over-year currency increase to revenue considering hedging gains was $24.4 million.  From a quarter-over-quarter perspective, FX increased revenue by $4.6 million. We had no hedged gains in Q3 fiscal 2011 versus a $0.2 million hedge gain in Q2 fiscal 2011, thus the net sequential currency increase to revenue, considering hedging gains was $4.4 million. 
Employees at the end of Q3 totaled 10,041 versus 9,770 at the end of last quarter. Our trade DSO was 50 days, which compares to 45 days in the year-ago quarter and 51 days last quarter. Our global channel inventory position at the end of the quarter was within company policy. 
During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $325 million. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $2.7 billion compared to $2.6 billion at the end of Q2. Deferred revenue in the quarter increased by approximately $2 million in the quarter to a total of $484 million. 
In Q3, we repurchased approximately 3.6 million shares at a total cost of $100 million. Entering Q4, $355 million of stock repurchase authority remains against the $1.6 billion stock repurchase authorization announced in July of last year. 
This concludes my discussion of our financial results. I would now like to comment on our financial targets for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. We are targeting a Q4 revenue range between $1,075,000,000 and $1,125,000,000. At the midpoint of this targeted range, we would expect all of our business segments to grow sequentially except Print and Publishing, which we expect to be relatively flat. We would also expect all of our major geographies to grow sequentially. 
For margins, we are targeting a Q4 GAAP operating margin range of 26.5% to 29.5% and a non-GAAP operating margin range of 36% to 38%. We are targeting our Q4 share count to be 497 million to 499 million shares. We are targeting nonoperating expense to be between $17 million and $21 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. 
For our Q4 effective GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates, we are targeting 22%. These targets lead to a GAAP earnings per share range of $0.41 to $0.50 per share and a non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.57 to $0.64. 
At the high end of our financial targets for our fourth quarter, we will achieve our 10% annual revenue growth target, as well as earnings growth of 20% for the fiscal year. 
This concludes my section. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Shantanu."

Our industry is in the midst of a major transformation. Tablets and smartphones have become the new devices of choice. Software is moving to the cloud.

Tablets and smartphones have become the new devices of choice. Software is moving to the cloud. Business models are evolving with subscription offerings and app stores and technologies like HTML5 are gaining favor. 
These trends are having a significant impact on our customers. From publishers to marketers to educational institutions, our customers face the same challenge: they need to create compelling digital content and applications that work on both desktops and devices and they need to measure the impact of those experiences. 
Adobe's heritage is in content authoring. We built the category and we remain the market leader. Today, we enable our core audience of publishers, designers and developers to create the world's best websites, applications and games using our Creative Suite desktop software. We will continue to innovate on the desktop, providing new functionality to address the challenges our customers face. 
With the shifting landscape that favors HTML5-based content and application delivery, we are doubling down in our investment in this area. CS5.5 delivered enhanced HTML5 capabilities. We recently previewed Adobe Edge, a new HTML5 web motion and interaction design tool, which allows web designers to create cutting-edge animations for their websites. Interest in this tool far exceeded our expectations. 
We just introduced the beta release of a new product codename Muse, which allows designers to create and publish HTML-based websites without writing complex HTML code. We're also contributing new innovations to WebKit to allow for a more expressive web. These initiatives show our commitment to help drive the evolution of browsers and be the leading tools provider for HTML5, and this is only the beginning. 
The explosion of tablets is changing the paradigm for content authoring. We believe that content will be consumed and created on these devices. Similar to the desktop, we intend to be the leading provider of creative authoring applications on tablets. 
We will soon be introducing a broad set of tablet-based and cloud-connected apps and services across iOS, Android and other mobile platforms that represent a new revenue stream. We're excited about the recent introduction of Adobe Carousel, an innovative new cloud-connected imaging app for Mac OS and iOS devices. As we bring these new products to market, expect to see us place a greater emphasis on new customer acquisition and the introduction of subscription offerings to drive more recurring revenue. 
One of the highest priorities for our publishing customers is to deliver, measure and monetize their content on tablets. With CS5 and our Digital Publishing Suite, we've helped our customers deliver over 600 titles through app stores. As more publishers move their magazines, newspapers and catalogs to tablets, our addressable market and our offerings in this space will grow. 
In addition to publishers, every major enterprise is moving more of its business online. We are helping our customers re-platform their digital assets, optimize their marketing spend and drive more digital commerce. We will continue to integrate our Creative Suite content authoring, our Day content management and our Omniture online marketing solutions to meet the needs of publishers, advertising agencies and marketeers. The strong growth in our Omniture and Day bookings this year is evidence of our success in this space already. 
In digital marketing, the opportunity is massive, with worldwide ad spend expected to grow to more than $100 billion by 2013 according to IDC. Adobe's online marketing suite is one of the largest cloud-based software offerings in the world. Our solutions enable marketeers to drive their business across all marketing channels, including web, mobile, e-mail, search, display and social. We're a leader in this category and will continue to introduce new technologies like the SocialAnalytics product we delivered this quarter. We will also align our field and marketing resources to more aggressively target the digital marketing opportunity and accelerate the momentum we have already achieved. 
Document services and the use of Acrobat and PDF continue to have huge momentum. Content protection and reliable document delivery remain priorities for customers across every segment. Adobe will increase its investment in cloud-based document exchange services with electronic signatures being a new growth opportunity. 
At Adobe MAX in early October, we will unveil some of our newest innovations in the content authoring arena. In November, we will host a Financial Analyst Meeting where we will provide a comprehensive update on our strategy and opportunities. Thank you for joining us today. Now I'll turn the call back over to Mike."

As we think about the evolution of Creative Suite moving forward, I think there are a couple of different things that we're hearing from our customers in terms of what would be catalysts for Creative Suite. And HTML5 and support for HTML5, whether that's browser-based content or creating standalone applications are certainly one of it.  So as you can expect, we will be taking the tools that we've been delivering like Adobe Edge and Muse, and you might see that in future versions of the Creative Suite. So that's one example of how we're continuing to monetize HTML because we want to be clearly the leader in HTML authoring. The other way is as HTML video is also taking off, you've probably seen that we announced a new version of the Flash Media Server and the Flash Media Server also now serves up content not just to Flash video but in addition to that, also to HTML video. So -- and finally, the Digital Publishing Solutions. The Digital Publishing Solutions also export all of these newspapers, magazines, catalogs that we are preparing in either Flash content or AIR or as HTML. So big picture, I would say as HTML is getting more prevalent, we're clearly both embracing it from the point of view of tools and being the leader in tools but also contributing aggressively to the evolution of HTML as a standard."

The weakness that we saw in the second quarter did continue into the third quarter in Europe. But I think it's important to keep in mind that Q3 is always our tough quarter due to summer seasonality the way our calendar falls so we were very pleased with where we came in, in our target range. And if you look at the guidance we provided, like I said at the high end, we would grow the business 10% just like we anticipated before the start of the year. Margins are improving year-over-year. Earnings growth will be around 20% at the high end of the range. Shantanu said CS5.5 is having the effect of keeping the run rate up late in the cycle. Omniture bookings are growing over 20%, and Acrobat's doing very well. So overall, we're really pleased. We were definitely off the most in Europe. The weakness that we saw last quarter, like I said, continued. The largest miss within Europe was in the Enterprise segment but we've got a strong pipeline for Q4 and we just now need to execute on our fourth quarter."

And then just a general question about the subscription revenue line growing 2.5% q-on-q, what kind of objective do you have to really stimulate that line with the tab apps and this further initiative around subscription adoption?"

For the current subscriptions, the customers that we are attracting are, I would say, fall into 2 categories: the new customers and these are customers who have never experienced an Adobe product before. So clea",299,"Sure, there are multiple questions in that. For the current subscriptions, the customers that we are attracting are, I would say, fall into 2 categories: the new customers and these are customers who have never experienced an Adobe product before. So clearly, what we are doing with having attractive entry-level prices, attracting brand new customers. It's also converting customers when we would have traditionally call version skippers are to stay more current with the CS set of products. So that's how I would characterize what we are seeing with the subscription pricing. In terms of moving forward and in future releases of CS, the goal clearly is to have our current creative professionals stay current at higher numbers than we've seen with CS5 and prior releases. And with everything that's changing in the Creative environment, we believe that this really allows us to have more innovation. Take a product like Edge. If you have a product like Edge that's on subscription, that's offered to a lot of the subscription people, that provides incentive for people to stay current. And today, with the 18-month cycles, you aren't allowed to do that, as you know, given financial accounting. So that's the strategic rationale for continuing to drive towards subscriptions and attracting new customers to the platform. On the tablet side specifically, I think we would all say it's early. We do believe strongly that tablets will be used not just for consumption devices but for creation devices. You're going to continue to see styluses added to tablet devices which make it an even more compelling offering. We will have a comprehensive set of products, and I think it's early to say how rapidly that will grow, but we do think that's a new revenue stream that will be meaningful for Adobe."

And Adobe intends to play in both of those categories with our Creative tools. As it relates to HTML, I think it's still in its infancy but we will work collaboratively with the entire community to make rich internet applications possible in HTML through the use of new frameworks. We will push video as a capability within HTML. We'll do the same thing for video. And I think that's going to evolve over the next 4 or 5 years. The browser support is just beginning to happen frankly in terms of browsers that are supporting HTML both on desktops, as well as on smartphones. And so I think big picture, that's a big opportunity for a company like Adobe. And our customers are clearly telling us, they want us to help reduce the complexity of authoring for these new richer expressive paradigms through our Creative tools. In terms of Microsoft specifically, yes, I think they will also offer developer tools, and they'll be one of many companies that targets this large opportunity. On the standalone application side as well, we continue to make progress. I think the #1 selling iPad application, in I think something like 13 countries was an application that was built in Flash, and then recompiled in AIR to run on the i platform. So expect us to continue to also invest in making sure that for standalone applications, whether they be on the Apple platform, the Android platform or the Microsoft platform, we also expect our technology to work standalone on those environments."

As more and more students use our products for digital literacy, we're continuing to see good growth in that.

In terms of our enterprise go-to-market, again, Mark said, that's the reason for aligning more and more of our sales force, as well as our marketing programs to align around our joint offering to the customer because that's really resonating. Both the Day as well as the Omniture bookings are growing over 20% a year, and so that will continue to be a focus. You're right. We're able to -- we recruit back Garrett, who's heading up our North America sales effort. Garrett used to head up all of SAP's Japan efforts, so we were pleased with that.

This compares to $990.3 million reported in Q3 fiscal 2010 and $1,023,000,000 reported last quarter. Q3 GAAP operating expenses were $634.4 million compared to $589.2 million reported in Q3 fiscal 2010 and $637.3 million last quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses in Q3 were $560.1 million compared to $524.7 million reported for Q3 fiscal 2010 and $556.7 million last quarter. 
GAAP operating income in Q3 fiscal 2011 was $274.1 million or 27.1% of revenue. This compares to GAAP operating income of $302 million or 30.5% of revenue in Q3 fiscal 2010 and $276.7 million or 27% of revenue last quarter. Non-GAAP operating income in Q3 fiscal 2011 was $366.1 million or 36.1% of revenue. This compares to non-GAAP operating income of $384.9 million or 38.9% of revenue in Q3 fiscal 2010 and $376.4 million or 36.8% of revenue last quarter. 
Adobe's effective GAAP tax rate in Q3 was 24%, and the effective non-GAAP tax rate was 22%. The difference between the GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates is due to our acquisition of EchoSign during the quarter. GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q3 fiscal 2011 were $0.39. This compares with GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.44 reported in Q3 fiscal 2010 and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.45 reported last quarter. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q3 fiscal 2011 were $0.55. This compares with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.54 in Q3 fiscal 2010 and $0.55 reported last quarter. I'll now discuss Adobe's results in Q3 by business segment. 
Creative and Interactive Solutions segment revenue in Q3 was $417.9 million compared to $416.9 million in Q3 fiscal 2010 and $433.1 million last quarter. Digital Media Solutions Q3 revenue was $151.1 million compared to $157.7 million in Q3 fiscal 2010 and $136.7 million last quarter. 
Creative Suite revenue in Q3 was consistent with revenue achieved in the year-ago quarter, demonstrating that CS5.5 continues to maintain the solid run rate that CS5 established. We also had a strong quarter and record revenue in the education market in Q3. When comparing the performance of recent Creative Suite releases, CS5 and CS5.5 combined revenue has now achieved approximately the same amount of revenue that we achieved with CS3 for the comparable amount of time and has exceeded revenue achieved with CS4 by approximately 25%.  
Our subscription offering with CS5.5 is attracting new users. More than 1/3 of the subscribers have never bought an Adobe product before, and 2/3 of the subscribers today tell us they would not have purchased without this offering. We will continue to target Final Cut Pro and Avid customers with our switcher program and believe we are gaining market share in digital video with our Premiere Pro and Production Premium products. 
Digital Enterprise Solutions revenue was $270.4 million in Q3 compared to $256.1 million in Q3 fiscal 2010 and $283.5 million last quarter. Within Digital Enterprise Solutions, Knowledge Worker revenue was $174.6 million compared to $162.6 million in Q3 fiscal 2010 and $182 million last quarter. Our 7% year-over-year growth demonstrates the continued strength of Acrobat as a standard tool in small and large enterprises. 
Our Q3 acquisition of EchoSign, a leading web-based provider of electronic signatures and signature automation, enhances our document exchange capabilities and will be a key part of our goal to increase the value of Acrobat in the document access, review and approval processes. 
Enterprise segment revenue was $95.8 million compared to $93.5 million in Q3 fiscal 2010 and $101.5 million last quarter. We continue to see strong demand for the combination of our Day content management and Omniture online marketing solution. As a result, we are focusing more field resources on the integrated product line. 
Omniture segment revenue in Q3 was $118.2 million compared to $99.8 million reported in Q3 of fiscal 2010 and $115.9 million last quarter. Omniture year-over-year bookings growth continues to exceed 20%, and enterprise renewal rates remain strong at 95% in the quarter. Mobile and tablet device traffic remains the fastest-growing part of the Omniture business, with a number of transactions we measured from mobile devices growing to 11% of total transactions in Q3, up from 7% last quarter. Omniture revenue diversification continued with SiteCatalyst decreasing to 50% of Q3 Omniture product revenue. Conversion and multichannel analytics products are growing in size as the analytics business becomes a smaller percentage of the business. We are seeing strong demand for our new Demdex and SocialAnalytics offerings. Our SocialAnalytics product is the industry's first analytics solution to tie social activity to business results. 
Finally, Print and Publishing segment revenue was $55.6 million compared to $59.8 million in Q3 fiscal 2010 and $54 million last quarter. Turning to our geographic segments in Q3. Results on a percent of revenue basis were as follows: The Americas, 50%; Europe, 29%; Asia, 21%. We experienced stable demand in the Americas and Asia, the weakness in EMEA that we experienced in Q2 continued into Q3. 
From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $37.6 million. We had no hedged gains in Q3 fiscal 2011 versus a $13.2 million hedge gain in Q3 fiscal 2010, thus the net year-over-year currency increase to revenue considering hedging gains was $24.4 million.  From a quarter-over-quarter perspective, FX increased revenue by $4.6 million. We had no hedged gains in Q3 fiscal 2011 versus a $0.2 million hedge gain in Q2 fiscal 2011, thus the net sequential currency increase to revenue, considering hedging gains, was $4.4 million. 
Employees at the end of Q3 totaled 10,041 versus 9,770 at the end of last quarter. Our trade DSO was 50 days, which compares to 45 days in the year-ago quarter and 51 days last quarter. Our global channel inventory position at the end of the quarter was within company policy. 
During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $325 million. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $2.7 billion compared to $2.6 billion at the end of Q2. Deferred revenue in the quarter increased by approximately $2 million in the quarter to a total of $484 million. 
In Q3, we repurchased approximately 3.6 million shares at a total cost of $100 million. Entering Q4, $355 million of stock repurchase authority remains against the $1.6 billion stock repurchase authorization announced in July of last year. 
This concludes my discussion of our financial results. I would now like to comment on our financial targets for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. We are targeting a Q4 revenue range between $1,075,000,000 and $1,125,000,000. At the midpoint of this targeted range, we would expect all of our business segments to grow sequentially except Print and Publishing, which we expect to be relatively flat. We would also expect all of our major geographies to grow sequentially. 
For margins, we are targeting a Q4 GAAP operating margin range of 26.5% to 29.5% and a non-GAAP operating margin range of 36% to 38%. We are targeting our Q4 share count to be 497 million to 499 million shares. We are targeting nonoperating expense to be between $17 million and $21 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. 
For our Q4 effective GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates, we are targeting 22%. These targets lead to a GAAP earnings per share range of $0.41 to $0.50 per share and a non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.57 to $0.64. 
At the high end of our financial targets for our fourth quarter, we will achieve our 10% annual revenue growth target, as well as earnings growth of 20% for the fiscal year. 
This concludes my section. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Shantanu."

Our industry is in the midst of a major transformation. Tablets and smartphones have become the new devices of choice. Software is moving to the cloud. Business models are evolving with subscription offerings and app stores and technologies",745,"Thanks, Mark. Our industry is in the midst of a major transformation. Tablets and smartphones have become the new devices of choice. Software is moving to the cloud. Business models are evolving with subscription offerings and app stores and technologies like HTML5 are gaining favor. 
These trends are having a significant impact on our customers. From publishers to marketers to educational institutions, our customers face the same challenge: they need to create compelling digital content and applications that work on both desktops and devices and they need to measure the impact of those experiences. 
Adobe's heritage is in content authoring. We built the category and we remain the market leader. Today, we enable our core audience of publishers, designers and developers to create the world's best websites, applications and games using our Creative Suite desktop software. We will continue to innovate on the desktop, providing new functionality to address the challenges our customers face. 
With the shifting landscape that favors HTML5-based content and application delivery, we are doubling down in our investment in this area. CS5.5 delivered enhanced HTML5 capabilities. We recently previewed Adobe Edge, a new HTML5 web motion and interaction design tool, which allows web designers to create cutting-edge animations for their websites. Interest in this tool far exceeded our expectations. 
We just introduced the beta release of a new product, codename Muse, which allows designers to create and publish HTML-based websites without writing complex HTML code. We're also contributing new innovations to WebKit to allow for a more expressive web. These initiatives show our commitment to help drive the evolution of browsers and be the leading tools provider for HTML5, and this is only the beginning. 
The explosion of tablets is changing the paradigm for content authoring. We believe that content will be consumed and created on these devices. Similar to the desktop, we intend to be the leading provider of creative authoring applications on tablets. 
We will soon be introducing a broad set of tablet-based and cloud-connected apps and services across iOS, Android and other mobile platforms that represent a new revenue stream. We're excited about the recent introduction of Adobe Carousel, an innovative new cloud-connected imaging app for Mac OS and iOS devices. As we bring these new products to market, expect to see us place a greater emphasis on new customer acquisition and the introduction of subscription offerings to drive more recurring revenue. 
One of the highest priorities for our publishing customers is to deliver, measure and monetize their content on tablets. With CS5 and our Digital Publishing Suite, we've helped our customers deliver over 600 titles through app stores. As more publishers move their magazines, newspapers and catalogs to tablets, our addressable market and our offerings in this space will grow. 
In addition to publishers, every major enterprise is moving more of its business online. We are helping our customers re-platform their digital assets, optimize their marketing spend and drive more digital commerce. We will continue to integrate our Creative Suite content authoring, our Day content management and our Omniture online marketing solutions to meet the needs of publishers, advertising agencies and marketeers. The strong growth in our Omniture and Day bookings this year is evidence of our success in this space already. 
In digital marketing, the opportunity is massive, with worldwide ad spend expected to grow to more than $100 billion by 2013 according to IDC. Adobe's online marketing suite is one of the largest cloud-based software offerings in the world. Our solutions enable marketeers to drive their business across all marketing channels, including web, mobile, e-mail, search, display and social. We're a leader in this category and will continue to introduce new technologies, like the SocialAnalytics product we delivered this quarter. We will also align our field and marketing resources to more aggressively target the digital marketing opportunity and accelerate the momentum we have already achieved. 
Document services and the use of Acrobat and PDF continue to have huge momentum. Content protection and reliable document delivery remain priorities for customers across every segment. Adobe will increase its investment in cloud-based document exchange services with electronic signatures being a new growth opportunity. 
At Adobe MAX in early October, we will unveil some of our newest innovations in the content authoring arena. In November, we will host a Financial Analyst Meeting where we will provide a comprehensive update on our strategy and opportunities.

So Steve, as we think about the evolution of Creative Suite moving forward, I think there are a couple of different things that we're hearing from our customers in terms of what would be catalysts for Creative Suite. And HTML5 and support for HTML5, whether that's browser-based content or creating standalone applications, are certainly one of it.  So as you can expect, we will be taking the tools that we've been delivering, like Adobe Edge and Muse, and you might see that in future versions of the Creative Suite. So that's one example of how we're continuing to monetize HTML, because we want to be clearly the leader in HTML authoring. The other way is as HTML video is also taking off, you've probably seen that we announced a new version of the Flash Media Server. And the Flash Media Server also now serves up content not just to Flash video but, in addition to that, also to HTML video. So -- and finally, the Digital Publishing Solutions. The Digital Publishing Solutions also export all of these newspapers, magazines, catalogs that we are preparing in either Flash content or AIR or as HTML. So big picture, I would say as HTML is getting more prevalent, we're clearly both embracing it from the point of view of tools and being the leader in tools but also contributing aggressively to the evolution of HTML as a standard."

The weakness that we saw in the second quarter did continue into the third quarter in Europe. But I think it's important to keep in mind that Q3 is always our tough quarter due to summer seasonality, the way our calendar falls. So we were very pleased with where we came in, in our target range. And if you look at the guidance we provided, like I said, at the high end we would grow the business 10%, just like we anticipated before the start of the year. Margins are improving year-over-year. Earnings growth will be around 20% at the high end of the range. Shantanu said CS5.5 is having the effect of keeping the run rate up late in the cycle. Omniture bookings are growing over 20%, and Acrobat's doing very well. So overall, we're really pleased. We were definitely off the most in Europe. The weakness that we saw last quarter, like I said, continued. The largest miss within Europe was in the Enterprise segment.

So it is our intent to continue to be strong in the video space. At the IDC conference recently, we also announced high-end color. And so the video is a strong business for us, not just on the authoring tools but, frankly, for the entire workflow because now we also have the ability to deliver that content and do content protection.

So the year is playing out exactly right. Q3 was a little different than we had expected, driven by Europe."

In terms of where the penetration is for CS5, as Mark said in his prepared remarks, it's actually the revenue has now -- it's on par with CS3, and considerably greater than it is for CS4. We have about something like 40% of our customers on CS now on CS5 so that gives you some sense of the penetration. And what CS5 has done is really accomplish a couple of the objectives that we had set out to do. The first is, how do we drive continued strong run rate of 5% while moving to the annual cycle so that we could enable more frequent innovation. The second goal that we clearly had was to continue to update our products more frequently to allow our customers to deal with what was happening in the marketplace.  And as we look forward, frankly, to the next version of CS, we can get a lot of things that are going to drive the new version of CS, and not least of which is a new version of our franchise imaging application. But in addition to that, the things that I mentioned earlier, video, expect to see a fair amount of HTML5 innovation coming in the next CS, and the combination, frankly, of both the Creative applications, the tablet applications and what we provide as cloud services. So a lot of excitement about what we're going to deliver next year."

For the current subscriptions, the customers that we are attracting are, I would say, fall into 2 categories. The new customers, and these are customers who have never experienced an Adobe product before, so clearly what we are doing with having attractive entry-level prices, attracting brand new customers. It's also converting customers whom we would have traditionally called version skippers to stay more current with the CS set of products. So that's how I would characterize what we are seeing with the subscription pricing. In terms of moving forward and in future releases of CS, the goal clearly is to have our current creative professionals stay current at higher numbers than we've seen with CS5 and prior releases. And with everything that's changing in the Creative environment, we believe that this really allows us to have more innovation. Take a product like Edge. If you have a product like Edge that's on subscription, that's offered to all of the subscription people, that provides incentive for people to stay current. And today, with the 18-month cycles, you aren't allowed to do that, as you know, given financial accounting. So that's the strategic rationale for continuing to drive towards subscriptions and attracting new customers to the platform. On the tablet side specifically, I think we would all say it's early. We do believe strongly that tablets will be used not just for consumption devices but for creation devices. You're going to continue to see styluses added to tablet devices which make it an even more compelling offering. We will have a comprehensive set of products, and I think it's early to say how rapidly that will grow, but we do think that's a new revenue stream that will be meaningful for Adobe."

And Adobe intends to play in both of those categories with our Creative tools. As it relates to HTML, I think it's still in its infancy but we will work collaboratively with the entire community to make rich internet applications possible in HTML through the use of new frameworks. We will push video as a capability within HTML. We'll do the same thing for video. And I think that's going to evolve over the next 4 or 5 years. The browser support is just beginning to happen, frankly, in terms of browsers that are supporting HTML, both on desktops as well as on smartphones. And so I think, big picture, that's a big opportunity for a company like Adobe. And our customers are clearly telling us, they want us to help reduce the complexity of authoring for these new richer expressive paradigms through our Creative tools. In terms of Microsoft specifically, yes, I think they will also offer developer tools, and they'll be one of many companies that targets this large opportunity. On the standalone application side as well, we continue to make progress. I think the #1 selling iPad application in I think something like 13 countries, was an application that was built in Flash and then recompiled in AIR to run on the i platform. So expect us to continue to also invest in making sure that for standalone applications, whether they be on the Apple platform, the Android platform or the Microsoft platform, we also expect our technology to work standalone on those environments."

Both the Day as well as the Omniture bookings are growing over 20% a year. And so that will continue to be a focus. You're right, we were able to -- we recruit back Garrett, who's heading up our North America sales effort. Garrett used to head up all of SAP's Japan efforts, so we were pleased with that.

Clearly, we make sure we have the right level of cash we need to invest in the organic part of the business. We have been acquiring, like we said, mostly on the smaller size, mid to smaller size companies, and I always want to make sure we have cash on hand to do that. And then whatever excess U.S. cash we have after those 2 things, we've been driving towards share repurchase. And I would argue we've done a great job over 5 to 7 years of buying back incredible amount of stock, probably close to $1 billion a year, every year, for the past 5 or more years. And we've now got the share count down below $500 million -- 500 million shares, and I think that's been strategic in driving value to the shareholders. The second part was what?"

In content authoring, the 4 key initiatives that we have, continuing to drive innovation and Creative Suite in imaging and video with our publishing solutions, as well as in HTML; the introduction of new tablet applications, as well as cloud services to continue to innovate in terms of how people author; our Digital Publishing and monetization solutions, we have over 600 titles, we're going to continue to focus on having newspapers, magazines and catalogs move online; and document services with things like ensuring their document security, creation of PDF and electronic signatures continues to grow for us. And the large opportunity associated with digital marketing, targeting marketers who all want an online presence and want to make sure that they're serving their customers well; publishers being able to sell both their ads and content; and finally, advertisers, enabling them to optimize their ad spend. And we certainly believe that there's hundreds of billions that's moving online, and we're very well positioned with online marketing with our cloud-based services.

This performance helped us achieve record revenue of $4,216,000,000 in fiscal year 2011, which represents 11% annual growth. 
Our Q4 results demonstrate we are executing exceptionally well against our strategy. We achieved quarterly revenue with 14% year-over-year growth, 5 quarters in a row with more than $1 billion of revenue with strong profit and cash flow results for the year. We accomplished these milestones while putting in place a long-term strategy that will solidify our leadership position in 2 fast-growing markets. 
Our strategy centers have a unique capability to help customers make, manage, measure and monetize their digital experiences. Customers are asking for our help in accelerating their digital businesses and we're doubling down in areas where digital content is mission-critical, digital media and digital marketing. We have organized Adobe to focus on these opportunities and we're investing to win in each area. 
After I recap some of the accomplishments we achieved during the year, I'll turn it over to Mark for more details on our financial performance in the quarter and the year. Later, I'll close with a summary of our priorities in 2012, and then we'll take your questions. 
This was a big year for innovation in our Digital Media business, which delivers solutions that allow customers to create, publish, promote and monetize their content on any device. We introduced the latest version of our flagship desktop product, CS5.5, which achieved strong revenue during the year. We introduced brand-new applications such as Edge and Muse that leverage advances in HTML5 while continuing to push the envelope of the expressive Internet with Flash Player and Air. 
As part of our HTML strategy, we acquired Nitobi, maker of Phone Gap to allow our customers to not only deliver of content for browsers but also make those experiences available as standalone mobile applications. 
We announced Creative Cloud, a comprehensive subscription offering that reimagines the creative process. Subscribers will have access to our Creative desktop tools, touch applications, creative and publishing services and a strong community. 
We introduced several new touch applications for use on tablets including Photoshop Touch, Photo, Debut, Collage and Ideas. We will offer cloud services based on our Digital Publishing and Business Catalyst Solutions as well as Typekit, a web phone service that we acquired. 
Creative Cloud membership will be launched in fiscal 2012 to coincide with the next release of our CS products. We will aggressively acquire new users as well as help customers migrate from all CS versions to the latest releases of our products. 
We are successfully targeting publishers who wish to monetize their digital content through our solution offerings. Our Digital Publishing Solution enables creation, distribution and monetization of digital content through app stores and newsstand services. To date, our Digital Publishing customers have delivered more than 1,200 titles, and with our new single edition, we will broaden the base to smaller publishers. 
Video monetization is a nascent but high-growth opportunity. With CS Production Premium, our Adobe solution for TV everywhere and our acquisition of Auto-Tune, we now have a comprehensive creation to playback offering for video distribution and video ad delivery. 
Document Services continues to be a growth opportunity, and we're expanding our Acrobat franchise through the delivery of new document services in the cloud. Our acquisition of EchoSign, a leading web-based provider of electronic signatures and signature automation, enhances our document exchange capabilities and will be a key part of our goal to increase the value of Acrobat in the document access, review and approval processes. 
In Digital Marketing, our mission is to be the standard for the way digital marketing and advertising is created, managed, executed and optimized. We are focused on 4 strategic areas to drive growth in this business. 
The core of our Digital Marketing suite is our analytics and reporting offering. Site Catalyst is the leading Enterprise solution for measuring web traffic across PC and mobile devices. We introduced social analytics to extend this offering and enable our customers to measure the impact of their social media campaigns. We have seen strong interest and adoption of this product since its launch a few months ago. 
Our second area of investment is personalized engagement where we offer a Web experience management solution, which combines our Day and Digital Marketing Suite products. Our goal is to deliver an integrated offering, which helps marketeers deliver personalized Web experiences and increase conversion rates. We're already driving explosive growth in this category. Revenue for day doubled year-over-year. 
A third area of focus is multichannel campaign execution, helping digital marketeers understand what's working across all their marketing channels so they can optimize their spending and attract new customers. We're focused on search, social and display advertising, areas where we continue to see strong customer need. 
The final area is media monetization, which is focused on helping publishers sell their available ad inventory for higher rates. Early this year, we acquired Demdex, which gives us a data management platform that provides realtime audience segmentation and connects that audience data to systems advertisers used to buy inventory. 
With our recent acquisition of Auditude, we can expand our monetization capabilities especially in the high growth video advertising segment. 
Late in Q4, we announced our intent to acquire Efficient Frontier, a leader in digital ad buying and optimization. In the acquisition, which we expect will close later this quarter, we'll add multichannel campaign forecasting, execution and optimization capabilities to our existing Digital Marketing Suite. 
More specifically, Efficient Frontier strengthens our digital market offering in several key areas. In social marketing, Efficient Frontier brings a social ad buying capability for Facebook, and we expect synergy with our existing Facebook ad buying functionality in our center product. They also bring a social marketing engagement platform to help customers build, manage, monitor and measure their brand presence across the social web. 
We will augment the social engagement capability with our social analytics product to provide an analytics solution that moves beyond social monitoring to tie social media to business results. 
In search marketing, Efficient Frontier extends our center solution with a complementary search portfolio optimization system. In display marketing, Efficient Frontier has a realtime bidding system to enable our Digital Marketing customers to increase ad performance on major display inventory sources. And in multichannel optimization, Efficient Frontier enables marketeers to take the guess work on how to spend marketing dollars across search, display and social media platforms by optimizing bids and allocating budget across all these digital channels for maximum ROI. 
Our Digital Marketing opportunity is exciting not only because of its strong performance this year but also for its strategic value as a software-as-a-service business. We believe we're in the sweet spot for growth as the demands on marketeers continue to gain an urgency and complexity. As a result, we expect this business to drive a $1 billion of SaaS-based revenue in the coming years. 
In summary, 2011 was a great year for Adobe financially and strategically. Now I'll turn it over to Mark for a discussion of our financial results. Mark?"

Adobe achieved revenue of $4,216,000,000 in the year compared to $3,800,000,000 in fiscal 2010. This represents 11% year-over-year growth, exceeding the 10% growth target we gave at the outset of the year. 
In addition, we generated $1.5 billion in cash flow during the year. We committed $695 million towards share repurchases and we made several strategic acquisitions that position Adobe to be the market leader in Digital Media and Digital Marketing, 2 large and growing markets that complement one another. 
Our success in fiscal 2011 demonstrates significant progress against our goal to transform our business. As we enter fiscal 2012, we do so as one of the largest providers of cloud-based software in the world. This has helped grow our recurring revenue to approach 20% of total revenue, and with additional business model changes we are implementing, we expect this percentage to double within the next 3 years. 
GAAP operating income in fiscal 2011 was $1,099,000,000 compared to $993 million in fiscal 2010. GAAP operating margin for the year was 26.1%, the same as it was in fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP operating income in fiscal 2011 was $1,587,000,000 compared to $1,393,000,000 in fiscal 2010. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 37.6% in fiscal 2011 compared to 36.6% in fiscal 2010. 
Adobe's annual GAAP net income was $833 million in fiscal 2011 compared to $775 million in fiscal 2010. Adobe's annual non-GAAP net income was $1,183,000,000 in fiscal 2011 compared to $1,016,000,000 in fiscal 2010. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2011 were $1.65 compared to $1.47 in fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.35 in fiscal 2011 compared to $1.93 in fiscal 2010, representing 22% year-over-year growth. 
Now I will discuss our Q4 results. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, Adobe achieved revenue of $1,152,000,000. This compares to $1,008,000,000 reported in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $1,013,000,000 reported last quarter. Q4 GAAP operating expenses were $789.7 million compared to $613.8 million reported in Q4 of fiscal 2010 and $634.4 million last quarter. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses in Q4 were $611.9 million compared to $535 million reported for Q4 fiscal 2010 and $560.1 million last quarter. GAAP operating income in Q4 fiscal 2011 was $246.1 million or 21.4% of revenue. This compares to GAAP operating income of $286.9 million or 28.5% of revenue in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $274.1 million or 27.1% of revenue last quarter. 
Non-GAAP operating income in Q4 fiscal 2011 was $444.5 million or 38.6% of revenue. This compares to non-GAAP operating income of $384 million or 38.1% of revenue in Q4 of fiscal 2010 and $366.1 million or 36.1% of revenue last quarter. 
In Q4, Adobe's effective tax rate was 25.5% on a GAAP basis and 22% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP rate was higher than targeted due to the acquisition of Typekit and Auditude in the quarter. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q4 fiscal 2011 were $0.35. This compares with GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.53 reported in Q4 fiscal 2010 and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.39 reported last quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q4 fiscal 2011 were $0.67. This compares with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.56 in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $0.55 reported last quarter. 
I will now discuss Adobe's results in Q4 by business segment. Creative and Interactive Solutions segment revenue in Q4 was $437.2 million compared to $404.8 million in Q4 of fiscal 2010 and $417.9 million last quarter. Digital Media Solutions Q4 revenue was $186.4 million compared to $165.9 million in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $151.1 million last quarter. 
In Q4, we achieved the highest quarter of CS revenue during the current CS5 release cycle, driven by record volume licensing with Enterprise customers and strong Adobe.com sales. We also continued to attract new customers with our CS5.5 subscription offering, with 40% of subscribers being first-time CS users. In addition, our Digital Imaging and Digital Video products achieved strong results in Q4. 
Digital Enterprise Solutions revenue was $342.4 million in Q4 compared to $273.3 million in Q4 of fiscal 2010 and $270.4 million last quarter. Within Digital Enterprise Solutions, Knowledge Worker revenue was $201.7 million compared to $169.9 million in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $174.6 million last quarter. 
Acrobat revenue was the highest we've achieved in a non-launch quarter in its history. This performance was driven by strong Q4 Enterprise licensing. For the year, Knowledge Worker revenue grew 13% when compared to fiscal 2010. 
Enterprise segment revenue was $140.7 million compared to $103.4 million in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $95.8 million last quarter. This growth was driven by strong licensing of our Day Web experience management offering and record revenue in the government vertical. Omniture segment revenue in Q4 was $131.1 million compared to $109 million reported in Q4 of fiscal 2010 and $118.2 million last quarter. 
Our Digital Marketing sales team finished a strong year with an outstanding quarter. In Q4, the team closed more than 20 contracts than annual contract value greater than $500,000. This exceeds the number of contracts greater than $500,000 that Omniture closed in all of 2009. Driving this performance is increasing demand for multiple products within the Digital Marketing suite. We continue to diversify our overall Omniture revenue. 
Our core offering, SiteCatalyst now accounts for 49% of our overall Digital Marketing revenue. We are driving growth in conversion and multichannel analytics products and have made some key acquisitions this quarter to further expand our offering. 
Omniture Enterprise renewal rates remains strong at 95% in the quarter. On Cyber Monday, we saw our single highest day of transactions ever. Mobile transactions increased to 13% of our transactions in the quarter, up from 11% last quarter and 7% in Q2. 
Finally, Print and Publishing segment revenue was $55.1 million compared to $55 million in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $55.6 million last quarter. 
Turning to our geographic segments in Q4, results on a percent of revenue basis were as follows: the Americas, 48%; Europe, 33%; Asia, 19%. We experienced strong demand in all major geographies during Q4. 
From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $12.1 million. We had $3.6 million in hedge gains in Q4 fiscal 2011 versus a $0.7 million hedge gain in Q4 of fiscal 2010, thus the net year-over-year currency increased revenue considering hedging gains was $15 million. 
From a quarter-over-quarter perspective, FX decreased revenue by $9.5 million. We had $3.6 million in hedge gains in Q4 fiscal 2011 versus no hedge gain in Q3 fiscal 2011, thus the net sequential currency decreased to revenue considering hedging gains was $5.9 million. 
Employees at the end of Q4 totaled 9,925 versus 10,041 at the end of last quarter. The decrease was almost entirely due to the departure of interns in the quarter. The impact of our Q4 reduction in force will occur in Q1. 
Our trade DSO was 50 days which compares to 50 days in the year-ago quarter and 50 days last quarter. Our global channel inventory position at the end of the quarter was within company policy. 
During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $497 million. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $2.9 billion compared to $2.7 billion at the end of Q3. Deferred revenue increased by approximately $48 million in the quarter to a total of $531.7 million. 
In Q4, we repurchased approximately 2 million shares at a total cost of $50 million. For the year, we repurchased approximately 21.8 million shares at a total cost of $695 million. Entering Q1, $305 million of stock repurchase authority remains against the $1.6 billion stock repurchase authorization announced in July of last year. 
This concludes my discussion of our results. I would now like to discuss our financial targets beginning with our fiscal 2012 annual targets. We continue to target 4% to 6% revenue growth in fiscal 2012. As we discussed in our financial analyst meeting in November, 2012 is a transition year, and our revenue growth target factors are reduced focused on certain product lines, which we expect to impact our revenue by approximately $150 million in the year. It also factors the potential impact from migration to our Creative Cloud subscription offering. 
By quarter, we expect revenue in Q1 to decline sequentially due to seasonality. We expect revenue in Q2 to increase sequentially due to the planned launch of our new Creative products. We would also expect Q3 and Q4 to follow normal historical patterns, with a sequential decline in Q3 due to normal summer seasonality followed by a strong Q4. 
We are targeting a fiscal 2012 annual GAAP earnings per share range of $1.70 to $1.83 per share and a non-GAAP earnings per share range of $2.37 to $2.47. 
In Q1, we are targeting a revenue range between $1,025,000,000 and $1,075,000,000. At the midpoint of the Q1 targeted range, roughly half of the expected sequential decline from Q4 is from our decision to reduce focus on certain product lines. The other half of the expected sequential decline is due to normal Enterprise and hobbyist product seasonality. 
We are targeting a Q1 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.37 to $0.43 per share and a Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.54 to $0.59. 
In addition, we are targeting our Q1 share count to be 500 million to 502 million shares. We are targeting nonoperating expense of be between $19 million and $22 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q1 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate of 23%. The expiration of the R&D tax credit this week impacts our tax rates by a full percentage point as we enter fiscal 2012. 
Our planned acquisition of Efficient Frontier is not factored into these targets. Assuming we close the transaction as planned later this quarter, we would expect the acquisition to add between $60 million and $80 million to our annual revenue in fiscal 2012. It would also result in the use of approximately $400 million of our domestic cash and add approximately 350 employees to our headcount. We expect the acquisition to be slightly accretive to non-GAAP earnings for the year. 
This concludes my section. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Shantanu."

Our vision at Adobe is to change the world through digital experiences. Over the last few years, we've laid the groundwork for the future of the company through product innovation, acquisitions and business model changes. We now believe it's time to double down and accelerate our growth in the 2 areas where we see the largest market opportunities: Digital Media and Digital Marketing. 
The goal of our Digital Media business is to revolutionize the creative process. We believe our Creative Cloud offering will deliver a comprehensive set of Creative tools, applications and services that will take content creation to the next level and bring hundreds of thousands of new customers to Adobe. 
In the exploding Digital Marketing category, our goal is to be mission-critical to digital marketeers by transforming how they manage, measure and optimize their marketing campaigns. In doing so, we expect to build a billion-dollar SaaS business. 
Both of these opportunities will drive a more significant recurring revenue stream, increasing the predictability of our business, delivering strong cash flow and increasing our growth potential over the long term. 
We have successfully transformed Adobe several times in the past, and I speak for the entire management team and employees when I say that we're completely energized by this next chapter for the company. 
Thank you for joining us today. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Mike."

Consistent with the strategy we discussed at our Analyst Meeting and the way we operate the company, we will adjust our business segment reporting in fiscal 2012 beginning with our Q1 results.

We are also merging our Omniture segment with our Enterprise segment into a new reported segment called Digital Marketing Solutions. Our Print and Publishing segment remains as it was last year. 
In addition, we intend to provide supplementary business segment information to help the financial community understand the strategic and business model decisions we are making. These updated business segments are outlined in the Investor Datasheet that we've made available on our Investor Relations website today.

And from our point of view, we certainly have our models. We look at it and say and I've got this question a lot from investors. If the current model and people don't move as quickly, then you'll see the growth as it relates to the pent-up demand for all of the innovation that we've provided in CS6.

We continue to believe that the best way to return cash to shareholders is in the form of share buyback, and we're continuing to work our way down the authorization that we put in place a while ago. We only have about 300 million left on that actually. The reason the buyback is maybe a little bit more muted now is, as I've said in the past, we have a significant offshore cash balance, and I obviously can't use that to buy back stock. So we balanced the use of onshore cash between both M&A and share buyback. So when I have excess U.S. cash, it goes towards share buyback but first comes M&A if you kind of go down the pecking order. And that's why it was a little bit lower this quarter. You saw that we bought Efficient Frontier, and I mentioned in my prepared remarks that, that was about a $400 million use of onshore cash. And yes, as we guide, we guide roughly flat on the share count. We don't guide towards any particular buyback because that's more opportunistic. As it relates to deferred, it's made up of 2 things: It's made up of primarily the Omniture deferred revenue balance because that is a SaaS business as you know, and it's also made up of Enterprise maintenance, and those 2 things were the bigger drivers in the increase in deferred this quarter. The subscription side of the business doesn't kick in until really the second half of next year as we discussed."

So Ross, first, as it relates to the Creative and the Acrobat business, Enterprise has continuously grown as a percentage of the revenue that we get. And I think the investment that we've made in the field organization over the years has continued to pay off in terms of the strategic relationships that we're having with those customers. Increasingly, what we're finding is that as we go in and sell to the marketing departments, that serves as a great entrée for us to be able to ask them about their replatforming efforts. And we're clearly seeing the demand for Day is coming from businesses wanting to move online, wanting a social presence, wanting to be able to deliver mobile applications and the need for commerce. And so we're clearly seeing the synergy frankly as we go into these enterprises between everything that we've delivered to them on the desktop and what we've delivered to them as part of our Digital Marketing solutions. We had some very, very significant multiproduct wins as well, where the combination of Day plus the Creative product line plus what we are doing with the Digital Marketing suite. And that's exactly in line with the strategy that we laid out. As it relates to a LiveCycle specifically, yes. I mean, in the government as we said, we continue to see good adoption within the government. And there was clearly the pipe that we have built up for life cycle. We did a successful job in closing that."

This performance helped us achieve record revenue of $4,216,000,000 in fiscal year 2011, which represents 11% annual growth. 
Our Q4 results demonstrate we are executing exceptionally well against our strategy. We achieved quarterly revenue with 14% year-over-year growth, 5 quarters in a row with more than $1 billion of revenue with strong profit and cash flow results for the year. We accomplished these milestones while putting in place a long-term strategy that will solidify our leadership position in 2 fast-growing markets. 
Our strategy centers on our unique capability to help customers make, manage, measure and monetize their digital experiences. Customers are asking for our help in accelerating their digital businesses, and we're doubling down in areas where digital content is mission-critical: Digital media and digital marketing. We have organized Adobe to focus on these opportunities, and we're investing to win in each area. 
After I recap some of the accomplishments we achieved during the year, I'll turn it over to Mark for more details on our financial performance in the quarter and the year. Later, I will close with a summary of our priorities in 2012, and then we'll take your questions. 
This was a big year for innovation in our digital media business, which delivers solutions that allow customers to create, publish, promote and monetize their content on any device. We introduced the latest version of our flagship desktop product, CS5.5, which achieved strong revenue during the year. We introduced brand new applications such as Edge and Muse that leverage advances in HTML5 while continuing to push the envelope of the expressive Internet with Flash Player and AIR. 
As part of our HTML strategy, we acquired Nitobi, maker of PhoneGap to allow our customers to not only deliver interactive content for browsers, but also make those experiences available as standalone mobile applications. 
We announced Creative Cloud, a comprehensive subscription offering that reimagines the creative process. Subscribers will have access to our creative desktop tools, touch applications, creative and publishing services and a strong community. 
We introduced several new touch applications for use on tablets including Photoshop Touch, Proto, Debut, Collage and Ideas. We will offer cloud services based on our Digital Publishing and Business Catalyst solutions as well as Typekit, a web phone service that we acquired. 
Creative Cloud membership will be launched in fiscal 2012 to coincide with the next release of our CS products. We will aggressively acquire new users as well as help customers migrate from all CS versions to the latest releases of our products. 
We are successfully targeting publishers who wish to monetize their digital content through our solution offerings. Our Digital Publishing Solution enables creation, distribution and monetization of digital content through app stores and newsstand services. To date, our Digital Publishing customers have delivered more than 1,200 titles. And with our new single edition, we will broaden the base to smaller publishers. 
Video monetization is a nascent, but high-growth opportunity. With CS Production Premium, our Adobe Pass solution for TV Everywhere and our acquisition of Auditude, we now have a comprehensive creation-to-playback offering for video distribution and video ad delivery. 
Document Services continues to be a growth opportunity, and we're expanding our Acrobat franchise through the delivery of new document services in the cloud. Our acquisition of EchoSign, a leading web-based provider of electronic signatures and signature automation, enhances our document exchange capabilities and will be a key part of our goal to increase the value of Acrobat in the document access, review and approval processes. 
In digital marketing, our mission is to be the standard for the way digital marketing and advertising is created, managed, executed and optimized. We are focused on 4 strategic areas to drive growth in this business. 
The core of our Digital Marketing Suite is our analytics and reporting offering. SiteCatalyst is the leading enterprise solution for measuring web traffic across PC and mobile devices. We introduced SocialAnalytics to extend this offering and enable our customers to measure the impact of their social media campaigns. We have seen strong interest and adoption of this product since it's launch a few months ago. 
Our second area of investment is personalized engagement where we offer a Web Experience Management solution, which combines our Day and Digital Marketing Suite products. Our goal is to deliver an integrated offering, which helps marketeers deliver personalized Web experiences and increase conversion rates. We're already driving explosive growth in this category. Revenue for Day doubled year-over-year. 
Our third area of focus is multi-channel campaign execution, helping digital marketeers understand what's working across all their marketing channels so they can optimize their spending and attract new customers. We're focused on search, social and display advertising, areas where we continue to see strong customer need. 
The final area is media monetization, which is focused on helping publishers sell their available ad inventory for higher rates. Early this year, we acquired Demdex, which gives us a data management platform that provides realtime audience segmentation and connects that audience data to systems advertisers use to buy inventory. 
With our recent acquisition of Auditude, we can expand our monetization capabilities especially in the high-growth video advertising segment. 
Late in Q4, we announced our intent to acquire Efficient Frontier, a leader in digital ad buying and optimization. In the acquisition, which we expect will close later this quarter, we'll add multi-channel ad campaign forecasting, execution and optimization capabilities to our existing Digital Marketing Suite. More specifically, Efficient Frontier strengthens our digital market offering in several key areas. 
In social marketing, Efficient Frontier brings a social ad buying capability for Facebook, and we expect synergy with our existing Facebook ad buying functionality in our SearchCenter product. They also bring a social marketing engagement platform to help customers build, manage, monitor and measure their brand presence across the social Web. We will augment the social engagement capability with our social analytics product to provide an analytics solution that moves beyond social monitoring to tie social media to business results. 
In search marketing, Efficient Frontier extends our SearchCenter solution with a complementary search portfolio optimization system. 
In display marketing, Efficient Frontier has a realtime bidding system to enable our digital marketing customers to increase ad performance on major display inventory sources. 
And in multi-channel optimization, Efficient Frontier enables marketeers to take the guesswork out of how to spend marketing dollars across search, display and social media platforms by optimizing bids and allocating budget across all these digital channels for maximum ROI. 
Our digital marketing opportunity is exciting not only because of its strong performance this year, but also for its strategic value as a Software-as-a-Service business. We believe we're in the sweet spot for growth as the demands on marketeers continue to gain an urgency and complexity. As a result, we expect this business to drive a $1 billion of SaaS-based revenue in the coming years. 
In summary, 2011 was a great year for Adobe financially and strategically. Now I'll turn it over to Mark for a discussion of our financial results. Mark?"

Our earnings report today covers both Q4 and fiscal year 2011 results. I will first comment on our fiscal year 2011 results. 
Adobe achieved revenue of $4,216,000,000 in the year compared to $3,800,000,000 in fiscal 2010. This represents 11% year-over-year growth, exceeding the 10% growth target we gave at the outset of the year. 
In addition, we generated $1.5 billion in cash flow during the year. We committed $695 million towards share repurchases, and we made several strategic acquisitions that position Adobe to be the market leader in digital media and digital marketing, 2 large and growing markets that complement one another. 
Our success in fiscal 2011 demonstrates significant progress against our goal to transform our business. As we enter fiscal 2012, we do so as one of the largest providers of cloud-based software in the world. This has helped grow our recurring revenue to approach 20% of total revenue, and with additional business model changes we are implementing, we expect this percentage to double within the next 3 years. 
GAAP operating income in fiscal 2011 was $1,099,000,000 compared to $993 million in fiscal 2010. GAAP operating margin for the year was 26.1%, the same as it was in fiscal 2010. 
Non-GAAP operating income in fiscal 2011 was $1,587,000,000 compared to $1,393,000,000 in fiscal 2010. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 37.6% in fiscal 2011 compared to 36.6% in fiscal 2010. 
Adobe's annual GAAP net income was $833 million in fiscal 2011 compared to $775 million in fiscal 2010. Adobe's annual non-GAAP net income was $1,183,000,000 in fiscal 2011 compared to $1,016,000,000 in fiscal 2010. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2011 were $1.65 compared to $1.47 in fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.35 in fiscal 2011 compared to $1.93 in fiscal 2010, representing 22% year-over-year growth. 
Now I will discuss our Q4 results. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, Adobe achieved revenue of $1,152,000,000. This compares to $1,008,000,000 reported in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $1,013,000,000 reported last quarter. Q4 GAAP operating expenses were $789.7 million compared to $613.8 million reported in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $634.4 million last quarter. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses in Q4 were $611.9 million compared to $535 million reported for Q4 fiscal 2010 and $560.1 million last quarter. GAAP operating income in Q4 fiscal 2011 was $246.1 million or 21.4% of revenue. This compares to GAAP operating income of $286.9 million or 28.5% of revenue in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $274.1 million or 27.1% of revenue last quarter. 
Non-GAAP operating income in Q4 fiscal 2011 was $444.5 million or 38.6% of revenue. This compares to non-GAAP operating income of $384 million or 38.1% of revenue in Q4 of fiscal 2010 and $366.1 million or 36.1% of revenue last quarter. 
In Q4, Adobe's effective tax rate was 25.5% on a GAAP basis and 22% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP rate was higher than targeted due to the acquisition of Typekit and Auditude in the quarter. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q4 fiscal 2011 were $0.35. This compares with GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.53 reported in Q4 fiscal 2010 and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.39 reported last quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q4 fiscal 2011 were $0.67. This compares with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.56 in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $0.55 reported last quarter. 
I will now discuss Adobe's results in Q4 by business segment. Creative and interactive solutions segment revenue in Q4 was $437.2 million compared to $404.8 million in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $417.9 million last quarter. Digital media solutions' Q4 revenue was $186.4 million compared to $165.9 million in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $151.1 million last quarter. 
In Q4, we achieved the highest quarter of CS revenue during the current CS5 release cycle, driven by record volume licensing with enterprise customers and strong Adobe.com sales. We also continued to attract new customers with our CS5.5 subscription offering, with 40% of subscribers being first-time CS users. In addition, our digital imaging and digital video products achieved strong results in Q4. 
Digital Enterprise solutions revenue was $342.4 million in Q4 compared to $273.3 million in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $270.4 million last quarter. Within Digital Enterprise solutions, Knowledge Worker revenue was $201.7 million compared to $169.9 million in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $174.6 million last quarter. 
Acrobat revenue was the highest we've achieved in a non-launch quarter in its history. This performance was driven by strong Q4 Enterprise licensing. For the year, Knowledge Worker revenue grew 13% when compared to fiscal 2010. 
Enterprise segment revenue was $140.7 million compared to $103.4 million in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $95.8 million last quarter. This growth was driven by strong licensing of our Day Web experience management offering and record revenue in the government vertical. 
Omniture segment revenue in Q4 was $131.1 million compared to $109 million reported in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $118.2 million last quarter. 
Our digital marketing sales team finished a strong year with an outstanding quarter. In Q4, the team closed more than 20 contracts with an annual contract value greater than $500,000. This exceeds the number of contracts greater than $500,000 that Omniture closed in all of 2009. Driving this performance is increasing demand for multiple products within the Digital Marketing Suite. We continue to diversify our overall Omniture revenue. 
Our core offering, SiteCatalyst, now accounts for 49% of our overall digital marketing revenue. We are driving growth in conversion and multi-channel analytics products and have made some key acquisitions this quarter to further expand our offering. 
Omniture enterprise renewal rates remains strong at 95% in the quarter. On Cyber Monday, we saw our single highest day of transactions ever. Mobile transactions increased to 13% of our transactions in the quarter, up from 11% last quarter and 7% in Q2. 
Finally, print and publishing segment revenue was $55.1 million compared to $55 million in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $55.6 million last quarter. 
Turning to our geographic segments in Q4, results on a percent of revenue basis were as follows: The Americas, 48%; Europe, 33%; Asia, 19%. We experienced strong demand in all major geographies during Q4. 
From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $12.1 million. We had $3.6 million in hedge gains in Q4 fiscal 2011 versus a $0.7 million hedge gain in Q4 fiscal 2010, thus the net year-over-year currency increase to revenue considering hedging gains was $15 million. 
From a quarter-over-quarter perspective, FX decreased revenue by $9.5 million. We had $3.6 million in hedge gains in Q4 fiscal 2011 versus no hedge gain in Q3 fiscal 2011, thus the net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $5.9 million. 
Employees at the end of Q4 totaled 9,925 versus 10,041 at the end of last quarter. The decrease was almost entirely due to the departure of interns in the quarter. The impact of our Q4 reduction in force will occur in Q1. 
Our trade DSO was 50 days, which compares to 50 days in the year-ago quarter and 50 days last quarter. Our global channel inventory position at the end of the quarter was within company policy. 
During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $497 million. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $2.9 billion compared to $2.7 billion at the end of Q3. Deferred revenue increased by approximately $48 million in the quarter to a total of $531.7 million. 
In Q4, we repurchased approximately 2 million shares at a total cost of $50 million. For the year, we repurchased approximately 21.8 million shares at a total cost of $695 million. Entering Q1, $305 million of stock repurchase authority remains against the $1.6 billion stock repurchase authorization announced in July of last year. 
This concludes my discussion of our results. I would now like to discuss our financial targets beginning with our fiscal 2012 annual targets. We continue to target 4% to 6% revenue growth in fiscal 2012. As we discussed in our financial Analyst Meeting in November, 2012 is a transition year, and our revenue growth target factors are reduced focus on certain product lines, which we expect to impact our revenue by approximately $150 million in the year. It also factors the potential impact from migration to our Creative Cloud subscription offering. 
By quarter, we expect revenue in Q1 to decline sequentially due to seasonality. We expect revenue in Q2 to increase sequentially due to the planned launch of our new Creative products. We would also expect Q3 and Q4 to follow normal historical patterns, with a sequential decline in Q3 due to normal summer seasonality followed by a strong Q4. 
We are targeting a fiscal 2012 annual GAAP earnings per share range of $1.70 to $1.83 per share and a non-GAAP earnings per share range of $2.37 to $2.47. 
In Q1, we are targeting a revenue range between $1,025,000,000 and $1,075,000,000. At the midpoint of the Q1 targeted range, roughly half of the expected sequential decline from Q4 is from our decision to reduce focus on certain product lines. The other half of the expected sequential decline is due to normal enterprise and hobbyist product seasonality. 
We are targeting a Q1 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.37 to $0.43 per share and a Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.54 to $0.59. 
In addition, we are targeting our Q1 share count to be 500 million to 502 million shares. We are targeting nonoperating expense of be between $19 million and $22 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q1 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate of 23%. The expiration of the R&D tax credit this week impacts our tax rates by a full percentage point as we enter fiscal 2012. 
Our planned acquisition of Efficient Frontier is not factored into these targets. Assuming we close the transaction as planned later this quarter, we would expect the acquisition to add between $60 million and $80 million to our annual revenue in fiscal 2012. It would also result in the use of approximately $400 million of our domestic cash and add approximately 350 employees to our headcount. We expect the acquisition to be slightly accretive to non-GAAP earnings for the year. 
This concludes my section. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Shantanu."

Our vision at Adobe is to change the world through digital experiences. Over the last few years, we've laid the groundwork for the future of the company through product innovation, acquisitions and business model changes. We now believe it's time to double down and accelerate our growth in the 2 areas where we see the largest market opportunities: Digital media and digital marketing. 
The goal of our digital media business is to revolutionize the creative process. We believe our Creative Cloud offering will deliver a comprehensive set of Creative tools, applications and services that will take content creation to the next level and bring hundreds of thousands of new customers to Adobe. 
In the exploding digital marketing category, our goal is to be mission-critical to digital marketeers by transforming how they manage, measure and optimize their marketing campaigns. In doing so, we expect to build a billion dollar SaaS business. 
Both of these opportunities will drive a more significant recurring revenue stream, increasing the predictability of our business, delivering strong cash flow and increasing our growth potential over the long term. 
We have successfully transformed Adobe several times in the past, and I speak for the entire management team and employees when I say that we're completely energized by this next chapter for the company.

We continue to believe that the best way to return cash to shareholders is in the form of share buyback, and we're continuing to work our way down the authorization that we put in place a while ago. We only have about 300 million left on that actually. The reason the buyback is maybe a little bit more muted now is, as I've said in the past, we have a significant offshore cash balance. And I obviously can't use that to buy back stock. So we balanced the use of onshore cash between both M&A and share buyback. So when I have excess U.S. cash, it goes towards share buyback, but first comes M&A if you kind of go down the pecking order. And that's why it was a little bit lower this quarter. You saw that we bought Efficient Frontier, and I mentioned in my prepared remarks that, that was about a $400 million use of onshore cash. And yes, as we guide, we guide roughly flat on the share count. We don't guide towards any particular buyback because that's more opportunistic. As it relates to deferred, it's made up of 2 things. It's made up of primarily the Omniture deferred revenue balance because that is a SaaS business as you know, and it's also made up of enterprise maintenance. And those 2 things were the bigger drivers in the increase in deferred this quarter. The subscription side of the business doesn't kick in until really the second half of next year as we discussed."

Our Q4 results demo",1187,"Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon. I'm excited to report we delivered record revenue of $1,152,000,000 in Q4. This performance helped us achieve record revenue of $4,216,000,000 in fiscal year 2011, which represents 11% annual growth. 
Our Q4 results demonstrate we are executing exceptionally well against our strategy. We achieved quarterly revenue with 14% year-over-year growth, 5 quarters in a row with more than $1 billion of revenue with strong profit and cash flow results for the year. We accomplished these milestones while putting in place a long-term strategy that will solidify our leadership position in 2 fast-growing markets. 
Our strategy centers on our unique capability to help customers make, manage, measure and monetize their digital experiences. Customers are asking for our help in accelerating their digital businesses, and we're doubling down in areas where digital content is mission-critical: Digital media and digital marketing. We have organized Adobe to focus on these opportunities, and we're investing to win in each area. 
After I recap some of the accomplishments we achieved during the year, I'll turn it over to Mark for more details on our financial performance in the quarter and the year. Later, I will close with a summary of our priorities in 2012, and then we'll take your questions. 
This was a big year for innovation in our digital media business, which delivers solutions that allow customers to create, publish, promote and monetize their content on any device. We introduced the latest version of our flagship desktop product, CS5.5, which achieved strong revenue during the year. We introduced brand new applications such as Edge and Muse that leverage advances in HTML5 while continuing to push the envelope of the expressive Internet with Flash Player and AIR. 
As part of our HTML strategy, we acquired Nitobi, maker of PhoneGap, to allow our customers to not only deliver interactive content for browsers, but also make those experiences available as standalone mobile applications. 
We announced Creative Cloud, a comprehensive subscription offering that reimagines the creative process. Subscribers will have access to our creative desktop tools, touch applications, creative and publishing services and a strong community. 
We introduced several new touch applications for use on tablets including Photoshop Touch, Proto, Debut, Collage and Ideas. We will offer cloud services based on our Digital Publishing and Business Catalyst solutions as well as Typekit, a web phone service that we acquired. 
Creative Cloud membership will be launched in fiscal 2012 to coincide with the next release of our CS products. We will aggressively acquire new users as well as help customers migrate from all CS versions to the latest releases of our products. 
We are successfully targeting publishers who wish to monetize their digital content through our solution offerings. Our Digital Publishing Solution enables creation, distribution and monetization of digital content through app stores and newsstand services. To date, our Digital Publishing customers have delivered more than 1,200 titles. And with our new single edition, we will broaden the base to smaller publishers. 
Video monetization is a nascent, but high-growth opportunity. With CS Production Premium, our Adobe Pass solution for TV Everywhere and our acquisition of Auditude, we now have a comprehensive creation-to-playback offering for video distribution and video ad delivery. 
Document Services continues to be a growth opportunity, and we're expanding our Acrobat franchise through the delivery of new document services in the cloud. Our acquisition of EchoSign, a leading web-based provider of electronic signatures and signature automation, enhances our document exchange capabilities and will be a key part of our goal to increase the value of Acrobat in the document access, review and approval processes. 
In digital marketing, our mission is to be the standard for the way digital marketing and advertising is created, managed, executed and optimized. We are focused on 4 strategic areas to drive growth in this business. 
The core of our Digital Marketing Suite is our analytics and reporting offering. SiteCatalyst is the leading enterprise solution for measuring web traffic across PC and mobile devices. We introduced SocialAnalytics to extend this offering and enable our customers to measure the impact of their social media campaigns. We have seen strong interest and adoption of this product since its launch a few months ago. 
A second area of investment is personalized engagement where we offer a Web Experience Management solution, which combines our Day and Digital Marketing Suite products. Our goal is to deliver an integrated offering, which helps marketeers deliver personalized Web experiences and increase conversion rates. We're already driving explosive growth in this category. Revenue for Day doubled year-over-year. 
Our third area of focus is multi-channel campaign execution, helping digital marketeers understand what's working across all their marketing channels so they can optimize their spending and attract new customers. We're focused on search, social and display advertising, areas where we continue to see strong customer need. 
The final area is media monetization, which is focused on helping publishers sell their available ad inventory for higher rates. Early this year, we acquired Demdex, which gives us a data management platform that provides real-time audience segmentation and connects that audience data to systems advertisers use to buy inventory. 
With our recent acquisition of Auditude, we can expand our monetization capabilities especially in the high-growth video advertising segment. 
Late in Q4, we announced our intent to acquire Efficient Frontier, a leader in digital ad buying and optimization. In the acquisition, which we expect will close later this quarter, we'll add multi-channel ad campaign forecasting, execution and optimization capabilities to our existing Digital Marketing Suite. More specifically, Efficient Frontier strengthens our digital market offering in several key areas. 
In social marketing, Efficient Frontier brings a social ad buying capability for Facebook, and we expect synergy with our existing Facebook ad buying functionality in our SearchCenter product. They also bring a social marketing engagement platform to help customers build, manage, monitor and measure their brand presence across the social Web. We will augment the social engagement capability with our social analytics product to provide an analytics solution that moves beyond social monitoring to tie social media to business results. 
In search marketing, Efficient Frontier extends our SearchCenter solution with a complementary search portfolio optimization system. 
In display marketing, Efficient Frontier has a real-time bidding system to enable our digital marketing customers to increase ad performance on major display inventory sources. 
And in multi-channel optimization, Efficient Frontier enables marketeers to take the guesswork out of how to spend marketing dollars across search, display and social media platforms by optimizing bids and allocating budget across all these digital channels for maximum ROI. 
Our digital marketing opportunity is exciting not only because of its strong performance this year, but also for its strategic value as a Software-as-a-Service business. We believe we're in the sweet spot for growth as the demands on marketeers continue to gain in urgency and complexity. As a result, we expect this business to drive a $1 billion of SaaS-based revenue in the coming years. 
In summary, 2011 was a great year for Adobe financially and strategically. Now I'll turn it over to Mark for a discussion of our financial results. Mark?"

Adobe achieved revenue of $4,216,000,000 in the year compared to $3,800,000,000 in fiscal 2010. This represents 11% year-over-year growth, exceeding the 10% growth target we gave at the outset of the year. 
In addition, we generated $1.5 billion in cash flow during the year. We committed $695 million towards share repurchases, and we made several strategic acquisitions that position Adobe to be the market leader in digital media and digital marketing, 2 large and growing markets that complement one another. 
Our success in fiscal 2011 demonstrates significant progress against our goal to transform our business. As we enter fiscal 2012, we do so as one of the largest providers of cloud-based software in the world. This has helped grow our recurring revenue to approach 20% of total revenue, and with additional business model changes we are implementing, we expect this percentage to double within the next 3 years. 
GAAP operating income in fiscal 2011 was $1,099,000,000 compared to $993 million in fiscal 2010. GAAP operating margin for the year was 26.1%, the same as it was in fiscal 2010. 
Non-GAAP operating income in fiscal 2011 was $1,587,000,000 compared to $1,393,000,000 in fiscal 2010. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 37.6% in fiscal 2011 compared to 36.6% in fiscal 2010. 
Adobe's annual GAAP net income was $833 million in fiscal 2011 compared to $775 million in fiscal 2010. Adobe's annual non-GAAP net income was $1,183,000,000 in fiscal 2011 compared to $1,016,000,000 in fiscal 2010. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2011 were $1.65 compared to $1.47 in fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.35 in fiscal 2011 compared to $1.93 in fiscal 2010, representing 22% year-over-year growth. 
Now I will discuss our Q4 results. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, Adobe achieved revenue of $1,152,000,000. This compares to $1,008,000,000 reported in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $1,013,000,000 reported last quarter. Q4 GAAP operating expenses were $789.7 million compared to $613.8 million reported in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $634.4 million last quarter. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses in Q4 were $611.9 million compared to $535 million reported for Q4 fiscal 2010 and $560.1 million last quarter. GAAP operating income in Q4 fiscal 2011 was $246.1 million or 21.4% of revenue. This compares to GAAP operating income of $286.9 million or 28.5% of revenue in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $274.1 million or 27.1% of revenue last quarter. 
Non-GAAP operating income in Q4 fiscal 2011 was $444.5 million or 38.6% of revenue. This compares to non-GAAP operating income of $384 million or 38.1% of revenue in Q4 of fiscal 2010 and $366.1 million or 36.1% of revenue last quarter. 
In Q4, Adobe's effective tax rate was 25.5% on a GAAP basis and 22% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP rate was higher than targeted due to the acquisition of Typekit and Auditude in the quarter. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q4 fiscal 2011 were $0.35. This compares with GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.53 reported in Q4 fiscal 2010 and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.39 reported last quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q4 fiscal 2011 were $0.67. This compares with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.56 in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $0.55 reported last quarter. 
I will now discuss Adobe's results in Q4 by business segment. Creative and interactive solutions segment revenue in Q4 was $437.2 million compared to $404.8 million in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $417.9 million last quarter. Digital media solutions' Q4 revenue was $186.4 million compared to $165.9 million in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $151.1 million last quarter. 
In Q4, we achieved the highest quarter of CS revenue during the current CS5 release cycle, driven by record volume licensing with enterprise customers and strong Adobe.com sales. We also continued to attract new customers with our CS5.5 subscription offering, with 40% of subscribers being first-time CS users. In addition, our digital imaging and digital video products achieved strong results in Q4. 
Digital Enterprise solutions revenue was $342.4 million in Q4 compared to $273.3 million in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $270.4 million last quarter. Within Digital Enterprise solutions, Knowledge Worker revenue was $201.7 million compared to $169.9 million in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $174.6 million last quarter. 
Acrobat revenue was the highest we've achieved in a non-launch quarter in its history. This performance was driven by strong Q4 Enterprise licensing. For the year, Knowledge Worker revenue grew 13% when compared to fiscal 2010. 
Enterprise segment revenue was $140.7 million compared to $103.4 million in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $95.8 million last quarter. This growth was driven by strong licensing of our Day Web experience management offering and record revenue in the government vertical. 
Omniture segment revenue in Q4 was $131.1 million compared to $109 million reported in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $118.2 million last quarter. 
Our digital marketing sales team finished a strong year with an outstanding quarter. In Q4, the team closed more than 20 contracts with an annual contract value greater than $500,000. This exceeds the number of contracts greater than $500,000 that Omniture closed in all of 2009. Driving this performance is increasing demand for multiple products within the Digital Marketing Suite. We continue to diversify our overall Omniture revenue. 
Our core offering, SiteCatalyst, now accounts for 49% of our overall digital marketing revenue. We are driving growth in conversion and multi-channel analytics products and have made some key acquisitions this quarter to further expand our offering. 
Omniture enterprise renewal rates remains strong at 95% in the quarter. On Cyber Monday, we saw our single highest day of transactions ever. Mobile transactions increased to 13% of our transactions in the quarter, up from 11% last quarter and 7% in Q2. 
Finally, print and publishing segment revenue was $55.1 million compared to $55 million in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $55.6 million last quarter. 
Turning to our geographic segments in Q4, results on a percent of revenue basis were as follows: The Americas, 48%; Europe, 33%; Asia, 19%. We experienced strong demand in all major geographies during Q4. 
From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $12.1 million. We had $3.6 million in hedge gains in Q4 fiscal 2011 versus a $0.7 million hedge gain in Q4 fiscal 2010, thus the net year-over-year currency increase to revenue considering hedging gains was $15 million. 
From a quarter-over-quarter perspective, FX decreased revenue by $9.5 million. We had $3.6 million in hedge gains in Q4 fiscal 2011 versus no hedge gain in Q3 fiscal 2011, thus the net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $5.9 million. 
Employees at the end of Q4 totaled 9,925 versus 10,041 at the end of last quarter. The decrease was almost entirely due to the departure of interns in the quarter. The impact of our Q4 reduction in force will occur in Q1. 
Our trade DSO was 50 days, which compares to 50 days in the year-ago quarter and 50 days last quarter. Our global channel inventory position at the end of the quarter was within company policy. 
During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $497 million. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $2.9 billion compared to $2.7 billion at the end of Q3. Deferred revenue increased by approximately $48 million in the quarter to a total of $531.7 million. 
In Q4, we repurchased approximately 2 million shares at a total cost of $50 million. For the year, we repurchased approximately 21.8 million shares at a total cost of $695 million. Entering Q1, $305 million of stock repurchase authority remains against the $1.6 billion stock repurchase authorization announced in July of last year. 
This concludes my discussion of our results. I would now like to discuss our financial targets beginning with our fiscal 2012 annual targets. We continue to target 4% to 6% revenue growth in fiscal 2012. As we discussed at our financial Analyst Meeting in November, 2012 is a transition year, and our revenue growth target factors are reduced focus on certain product lines, which we expect to impact our revenue by approximately $150 million in the year. It also factors the potential impact from migration to our Creative Cloud subscription offering. 
By quarter, we expect revenue in Q1 to decline sequentially due to seasonality. We expect revenue in Q2 to increase sequentially due to the planned launch of our new Creative products. We would also expect Q3 and Q4 to follow normal historical patterns, with a sequential decline in Q3 due to normal summer seasonality followed by a strong Q4. 
We are targeting a fiscal 2012 annual GAAP earnings per share range of $1.70 to $1.83 per share and a non-GAAP earnings per share range of $2.37 to $2.47. 
In Q1, we are targeting a revenue range between $1,025,000,000 and $1,075,000,000. At the midpoint of the Q1 targeted range, roughly half of the expected sequential decline from Q4 is from our decision to reduce focus on certain product lines. The other half of the expected sequential decline is due to normal enterprise and hobbyist product seasonality. 
We are targeting a Q1 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.37 to $0.43 per share and a Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.54 to $0.59. 
In addition, we are targeting our Q1 share count to be 500 million to 502 million shares. We are targeting nonoperating expense to be between $19 million and $22 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q1 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate of 23%. The expiration of the R&D tax credit this week impacts our tax rates by a full percentage point as we enter fiscal 2012. 
Our planned acquisition of Efficient Frontier is not factored into these targets. Assuming we close the transaction as planned later this quarter, we would expect the acquisition to add between $60 million and $80 million to our annual revenue in fiscal 2012. It would also result in the use of approximately $400 million of our domestic cash and add approximately 350 employees to our headcount. We expect the acquisition to be slightly accretive to non-GAAP earnings for the year. 
This concludes my section. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Shantanu."

Over the last few years, we've laid the groundwork for the future of the company through product innovation, acquisitions and business model changes. We now believe it's time to double down and accelerate our growth in the 2 areas where we see the largest market opportunities: Digital media and digital marketing. 
The goal of our digital media business is to revolutionize the creative process. We believe our Creative Cloud offering will deliver a comprehensive set of Creative tools, applications and services that will take content creation to the next level and bring hundreds of thousands of new customers to Adobe. 
In the exploding digital marketing category, our goal is to be mission-critical to digital marketeers by transforming how they manage, measure and optimize their marketing campaigns. In doing so, we expect to build a billion dollar SaaS business. 
Both of these opportunities will drive a more significant recurring revenue stream, increasing the predictability of our business, delivering strong cash flow and increasing our growth potential over the long term.

And so we're going to certainly start to see subscriptions accelerate after that because while we have a subscription offering right now, the subscription offering changes quite a bit. And from our point of view, we certainly have our models. We look at it and say, and I've got this question a lot from investors, if the current model and people don't move as quickly, then you'll see the growth as it relates to the pent-up demand for all of the innovation that we've provided in CS6.

We continue to believe that the best way to return cash to shareholders is in the form of share buyback, and we're continuing to work our way down the authorization that we put in place a while ago. We only have about 300 million left on that actually. The reason the buyback is maybe a little bit more muted now is, as I've said in the past, we have a significant offshore cash balance. And I obviously can't use that to buy back stock. So we balanced the use of onshore cash between both M&A and share buyback. So when I have excess U.S. cash, it goes towards share buyback, but first comes M&A if you kind of go down the pecking order. And that's why it was a little bit lower this quarter. You saw that we bought Efficient Frontier, and I mentioned in my prepared remarks that, that was about a $400 million use of onshore cash. And yes, as we guide, we guide roughly flat on the share count. We don't guide towards any particular buyback because that's more opportunistic. As it relates to deferred, it's made up of 2 things. It's made up of primarily the Omniture deferred revenue balance because that is a SaaS business as you know, and it's also made up of enterprise maintenance. And those 2 things were the bigger drivers in the increase in deferred this quarter. The subscription side of the business doesn't kick in until really the second half of next year as we discussed."

This performance helped us achieve record revenue of $4,216,000,000 in fiscal year 2011, which represents 11% annual growth. 
Our Q4 results demonstrate we are executing exceptionally well against our strategy. We achieved quarterly revenue with 14% year-over-year growth, 5 quarters in a row with more than $1 billion of revenue with strong profit and cash flow results for the year. We accomplished these milestones while putting in place a long-term strategy that will solidify our leadership position in 2 fast-growing markets. 
Our strategy centers on our unique capability to help customers make, manage, measure and monetize their digital experiences. Customers are asking for our help in accelerating their digital businesses, and we're doubling down in areas where digital content is mission-critical: Digital media and digital marketing. We have organized Adobe to focus on these opportunities, and we're investing to win in each area. 
After I recap some of the accomplishments we achieved during the year, I'll turn it over to Mark for more details on our financial performance in the quarter and the year. Later, I will close with a summary of our priorities in 2012, and then we'll take your questions. 
This was a big year for innovation in our digital media business, which delivers solutions that allow customers to create, publish, promote and monetize their content on any device. We introduced the latest version of our flagship desktop product, CS5.5, which achieved strong revenue during the year. We introduced brand new applications such as Edge and Muse that leverage advances in HTML5 while continuing to push the envelope of the expressive Internet with Flash Player and AIR. 
As part of our HTML strategy, we acquired Nitobi, maker of PhoneGap, to allow our customers to not only deliver interactive content for browsers, but also make those experiences available as standalone mobile applications. 
We announced Creative Cloud, a comprehensive subscription offering that reimagines the creative process. Subscribers will have access to our creative desktop tools, touch applications, creative and publishing services and a strong community. 
We introduced several new touch applications for use on tablets including Photoshop Touch, Proto, Debut, Collage and Ideas. We will offer cloud services based on our Digital Publishing and Business Catalyst solutions as well as Typekit, a web phone service that we acquired. 
Creative Cloud membership will be launched in fiscal 2012 to coincide with the next release of our CS products. We will aggressively acquire new users as well as help customers migrate from all CS versions to the latest releases of our products. 
We are successfully targeting publishers who wish to monetize their digital content through our solution offerings. Our Digital Publishing Solution enables creation, distribution and monetization of digital content through app stores and newsstand services. To date, our Digital Publishing customers have delivered more than 1,200 titles. And with our new single edition, we will broaden the base to smaller publishers. 
Video monetization is a nascent, but high-growth opportunity. With CS Production Premium, our Adobe Pass solution for TV Everywhere and our acquisition of Auditude, we now have a comprehensive creation-to-playback offering for video distribution and video ad delivery. 
Document Services continues to be a growth opportunity, and we're expanding our Acrobat franchise through the delivery of new document services in the cloud. Our acquisition of EchoSign, a leading web-based provider of electronic signatures and signature automation, enhances our document exchange capabilities and will be a key part of our goal to increase the value of Acrobat in the document access, review and approval processes. 
In digital marketing, our mission is to be the standard for the way digital marketing and advertising is created, managed, executed and optimized. We are focused on 4 strategic areas to drive growth in this business. 
The core of our Digital Marketing Suite is our analytics and reporting offering. SiteCatalyst is the leading enterprise solution for measuring web traffic across PC and mobile devices. We introduced SocialAnalytics to extend this offering and enable our customers to measure the impact of their social media campaigns. We have seen strong interest and adoption of this product since its launch a few months ago. 
A second area of investment is personalized engagement where we offer a Web Experience Management solution, which combines our Day and Digital Marketing Suite products. Our goal is to deliver an integrated offering, which helps marketeers deliver personalized Web experiences and increase conversion rates. We're already driving explosive growth in this category. Revenue for Day doubled year-over-year. 
Our third area of focus is multi-channel campaign execution, helping digital marketeers understand what's working across all their marketing channels so they can optimize their spending and attract new customers. We're focused on search, social and display advertising, areas where we continue to see strong customer need. 
The final area is media monetization, which is focused on helping publishers sell their available ad inventory for higher rates. Early this year, we acquired Demdex, which gives us a data management platform that provides real-time audience segmentation and connects that audience data to systems advertisers use to buy inventory. 
With our recent acquisition of Auditude, we can expand our monetization capabilities especially in the high-growth video advertising segment. 
Late in Q4, we announced our intent to acquire Efficient Frontier, a leader in digital ad buying and optimization. In the acquisition, which we expect will close later this quarter, we'll add multi-channel ad campaign forecasting, execution and optimization capabilities to our existing Digital Marketing Suite. More specifically, Efficient Frontier strengthens our digital market offering in several key areas. 
In social marketing, Efficient Frontier brings a social ad buying capability for Facebook, and we expect synergy with our existing Facebook ad buying functionality in our SearchCenter product. They also bring a social marketing engagement platform to help customers build, manage, monitor and measure their brand presence across the social Web. We will augment the social engagement capability with our social analytics product to provide an analytics solution that moves beyond social monitoring to tie social media to business results. 
In search marketing, Efficient Frontier extends our SearchCenter solution with a complementary search portfolio optimization system. 
In display marketing, Efficient Frontier has a real-time bidding system to enable our digital marketing customers to increase ad performance on major display inventory sources. 
And in multi-channel optimization, Efficient Frontier enables marketeers to take the guesswork out of how to spend marketing dollars across search, display and social media platforms by optimizing bids and allocating budget across all these digital channels for maximum ROI. 
Our digital marketing opportunity is exciting not only because of its strong performance this year, but also for its strategic value as a Software-as-a-Service business. We believe we're in the sweet spot for growth as the demands on marketeers continue to gain in urgency and complexity. As a result, we expect this business to drive a $1 billion of SaaS-based revenue in the coming years. 
In summary, 2011 was a great year for Adobe financially and strategically. Now I'll turn it over to Mark for a discussion of our financial results. Mark?"

Our earnings report today covers both Q4 and fiscal year 2011 results. I will first comment on our fiscal year 2011 results. 
Adobe achieved revenue of $4,216,000,000 in the year compared to $3,800,000,000 in fiscal 2010. This represents 11% year-over-year growth, exceeding the 10% growth target we gave at the outset of the year. 
In addition, we generated $1.5 billion in cash flow during the year. We committed $695 million towards share repurchases, and we made several strategic acquisitions that position Adobe to be the market leader in digital media and digital marketing, 2 large and growing markets that complement one another. 
Our success in fiscal 2011 demonstrates significant progress against our goal to transform our business. As we enter fiscal 2012, we do so as one of the largest providers of cloud-based software in the world. This has helped grow our recurring revenue to approach 20% of total revenue, and with additional business model changes we are implementing, we expect this percentage to double within the next 3 years. 
GAAP operating income in fiscal 2011 was $1,099,000,000 compared to $993 million in fiscal 2010. GAAP operating margin for the year was 26.1%, the same as it was in fiscal 2010. 
Non-GAAP operating income in fiscal 2011 was $1,587,000,000 compared to $1,393,000,000 in fiscal 2010. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 37.6% in fiscal 2011 compared to 36.6% in fiscal 2010. 
Adobe's annual GAAP net income was $833 million in fiscal 2011 compared to $775 million in fiscal 2010. Adobe's annual non-GAAP net income was $1,183,000,000 in fiscal 2011 compared to $1,016,000,000 in fiscal 2010. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2011 were $1.65 compared to $1.47 in fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.35 in fiscal 2011 compared to $1.93 in fiscal 2010, representing 22% year-over-year growth. 
Now I will discuss our Q4 results. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, Adobe achieved revenue of $1,152,000,000. This compares to $1,008,000,000 reported in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $1,013,000,000 reported last quarter. Q4 GAAP operating expenses were $789.7 million compared to $613.8 million reported in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $634.4 million last quarter. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses in Q4 were $611.9 million compared to $535 million reported for Q4 fiscal 2010 and $560.1 million last quarter. GAAP operating income in Q4 fiscal 2011 was $246.1 million or 21.4% of revenue. This compares to GAAP operating income of $286.9 million or 28.5% of revenue in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $274.1 million or 27.1% of revenue last quarter. 
Non-GAAP operating income in Q4 fiscal 2011 was $444.5 million or 38.6% of revenue. This compares to non-GAAP operating income of $384 million or 38.1% of revenue in Q4 of fiscal 2010 and $366.1 million or 36.1% of revenue last quarter. 
In Q4, Adobe's effective tax rate was 25.5% on a GAAP basis and 22% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP rate was higher than targeted due to the acquisition of Typekit and Auditude in the quarter. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q4 fiscal 2011 were $0.35. This compares with GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.53 reported in Q4 fiscal 2010 and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.39 reported last quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q4 fiscal 2011 were $0.67. This compares with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.56 in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $0.55 reported last quarter. 
I will now discuss Adobe's results in Q4 by business segment. Creative and interactive solutions segment revenue in Q4 was $437.2 million compared to $404.8 million in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $417.9 million last quarter. Digital media solutions' Q4 revenue was $186.4 million compared to $165.9 million in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $151.1 million last quarter. 
In Q4, we achieved the highest quarter of CS revenue during the current CS5 release cycle, driven by record volume licensing with enterprise customers and strong Adobe.com sales. We also continued to attract new customers with our CS5.5 subscription offering, with 40% of subscribers being first-time CS users. In addition, our digital imaging and digital video products achieved strong results in Q4. 
Digital Enterprise solutions revenue was $342.4 million in Q4 compared to $273.3 million in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $270.4 million last quarter. Within Digital Enterprise solutions, Knowledge Worker revenue was $201.7 million compared to $169.9 million in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $174.6 million last quarter. 
Acrobat revenue was the highest we've achieved in a non-launch quarter in its history. This performance was driven by strong Q4 Enterprise licensing. For the year, Knowledge Worker revenue grew 13% when compared to fiscal 2010. 
Enterprise segment revenue was $140.7 million compared to $103.4 million in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $95.8 million last quarter. This growth was driven by strong licensing of our Day Web experience management offering and record revenue in the government vertical. 
Omniture segment revenue in Q4 was $131.1 million compared to $109 million reported in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $118.2 million last quarter. 
Our digital marketing sales team finished a strong year with an outstanding quarter. In Q4, the team closed more than 20 contracts with an annual contract value greater than $500,000. This exceeds the number of contracts greater than $500,000 that Omniture closed in all of 2009. Driving this performance is increasing demand for multiple products within the Digital Marketing Suite. We continue to diversify our overall Omniture revenue. 
Our core offering, SiteCatalyst, now accounts for 49% of our overall digital marketing revenue. We are driving growth in conversion and multi-channel analytics products and have made some key acquisitions this quarter to further expand our offering. 
Omniture enterprise renewal rates remains strong at 95% in the quarter. On Cyber Monday, we saw our single highest day of transactions ever. Mobile transactions increased to 13% of our transactions in the quarter, up from 11% last quarter and 7% in Q2. 
Finally, print and publishing segment revenue was $55.1 million compared to $55 million in Q4 fiscal 2010 and $55.6 million last quarter. 
Turning to our geographic segments in Q4, results on a percent of revenue basis were as follows: The Americas, 48%; Europe, 33%; Asia, 19%. We experienced strong demand in all major geographies during Q4. 
From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $12.1 million. We had $3.6 million in hedge gains in Q4 fiscal 2011 versus a $0.7 million hedge gain in Q4 fiscal 2010, thus the net year-over-year currency increase to revenue considering hedging gains was $15 million. 
From a quarter-over-quarter perspective, FX decreased revenue by $9.5 million. We had $3.6 million in hedge gains in Q4 fiscal 2011 versus no hedge gain in Q3 fiscal 2011, thus the net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $5.9 million. 
Employees at the end of Q4 totaled 9,925 versus 10,041 at the end of last quarter. The decrease was almost entirely due to the departure of interns in the quarter. The impact of our Q4 reduction in force will occur in Q1. 
Our trade DSO was 50 days, which compares to 50 days in the year-ago quarter and 50 days last quarter. Our global channel inventory position at the end of the quarter was within company policy. 
During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $497 million. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $2.9 billion compared to $2.7 billion at the end of Q3. Deferred revenue increased by approximately $48 million in the quarter to a total of $531.7 million. 
In Q4, we repurchased approximately 2 million shares at a total cost of $50 million. For the year, we repurchased approximately 21.8 million shares at a total cost of $695 million. Entering Q1, $305 million of stock repurchase authority remains against the $1.6 billion stock repurchase authorization announced in July of last year. 
This concludes my discussion of our results. I would now like to discuss our financial targets beginning with our fiscal 2012 annual targets. We continue to target 4% to 6% revenue growth in fiscal 2012. As we discussed at our financial Analyst Meeting in November, 2012 is a transition year, and our revenue growth target factors are reduced focus on certain product lines, which we expect to impact our revenue by approximately $150 million in the year. It also factors the potential impact from migration to our Creative Cloud subscription offering. 
By quarter, we expect revenue in Q1 to decline sequentially due to seasonality. We expect revenue in Q2 to increase sequentially due to the planned launch of our new Creative products. We would also expect Q3 and Q4 to follow normal historical patterns, with a sequential decline in Q3 due to normal summer seasonality followed by a strong Q4. 
We are targeting a fiscal 2012 annual GAAP earnings per share range of $1.70 to $1.83 per share and a non-GAAP earnings per share range of $2.37 to $2.47. 
In Q1, we are targeting a revenue range between $1,025,000,000 and $1,075,000,000. At the midpoint of the Q1 targeted range, roughly half of the expected sequential decline from Q4 is from our decision to reduce focus on certain product lines. The other half of the expected sequential decline is due to normal enterprise and hobbyist product seasonality. 
We are targeting a Q1 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.37 to $0.43 per share and a Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.54 to $0.59. 
In addition, we are targeting our Q1 share count to be 500 million to 502 million shares. We are targeting nonoperating expense to be between $19 million and $22 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q1 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate of 23%. The expiration of the R&D tax credit this week impacts our tax rates by a full percentage point as we enter fiscal 2012. 
Our planned acquisition of Efficient Frontier is not factored into these targets. Assuming we close the transaction as planned later this quarter, we would expect the acquisition to add between $60 million and $80 million to our annual revenue in fiscal 2012. It would also result in the use of approximately $400 million of our domestic cash and add approximately 350 employees to our headcount. We expect the acquisition to be slightly accretive to non-GAAP earnings for the year. 
This concludes my section. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Shantanu."

Our vision at Adobe is to change the world through digital experiences. Over the last few years, we've laid the groundwork for the future of the company through product innovation, acquisitions and business model changes. We now believe it's time to double down and accelerate our growth in the 2 areas where we see the largest market opportunities: Digital media and digital marketing. 
The goal of our digital media business is to revolutionize the creative process. We believe our Creative Cloud offering will deliver a comprehensive set of Creative tools, applications and services that will take content creation to the next level and bring hundreds of thousands of new customers to Adobe. 
In the exploding digital marketing category, our goal is to be mission-critical to digital marketeers by transforming how they manage, measure and optimize their marketing campaigns. In doing so, we expect to build a billion dollar SaaS business. 
Both of these opportunities will drive a more significant recurring revenue stream, increasing the predictability of our business, delivering strong cash flow and increasing our growth potential over the long term. 
We have successfully transformed Adobe several times in the past, and I speak for the entire management team and employees when I say that we're completely energized by this next chapter for the company.

PDF is a great format for that whether it's for archival, whether it's for information, dissemination. I think you're seeing all the major mobile platforms support PDF. So the core Acrobat business in terms of file dissemination continues to be very strong. The newer document services that we are providing as well continue to also see traction. And I would say specifically, the strength in the quarter, again, was good performance within enterprises, as enterprises standardize on Acrobat across all of their desktops in order to be able to reliably and frankly securely share information. We continue to be excited about the electronic signatures opportunity as we are getting up to close to 1 million contracts where people are touching this. We think that's a nice disruptive opportunity that plays into our strength, both with document services and reader proliferation. So good quarter there."

We continue to believe that the best way to return cash to shareholders is in the form of share buyback, and we're continuing to work our way down the authorization that we put in place a while ago.

We continue to believe that the best way to return cash to shareholders is in the form of share buyback, and we're continuing to work our way down the authorization that we put in place a while ago. We only have about 300 million left on that actually. The reason the buyback is maybe a little bit more muted now is, as I've said in the past, we have a significant offshore cash balance. And I obviously can't use that to buy back stock. So we balanced the use of onshore cash between both M&A and share buyback. So when I have excess U.S. cash, it goes towards share buyback, but first comes M&A if you kind of go down the pecking order. And that's why it was a little bit lower this quarter. You saw that we bought Efficient Frontier, and I mentioned in my prepared remarks that, that was about a $400 million use of onshore cash. And yes, as we guide, we guide roughly flat on the share count. We don't guide towards any particular buyback because that's more opportunistic. As it relates to deferred, it's made up of 2 things. It's made up of primarily the Omniture deferred revenue balance because that is a SaaS business as you know, and it's also made up of enterprise maintenance. And those 2 things were the bigger drivers in the increase in deferred this quarter. The subscription side of the business doesn't kick in until really the second half of next year as we discussed."

Increasingly, what we are finding is that as we go in and sell to the marketing departments, that serves as a great entrée for us to be able to ask them about their re-platforming efforts. And we're clearly seeing the demand for Day is coming from businesses wanting to move online, wanting a social presence, wanting to be able to deliver mobile applications and a need for commerce. And so we're clearly seeing the synergy, frankly, as we go into these enterprises between everything that we've delivered to them on the desktop and what we've delivered to them as part of our digital marketing solutions. We had some very, very significant multiproduct wins as well, where the combination of Day plus the Creative product line plus what we are doing with the Digital Marketing Suite.
