Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. 
2010 was a great year for the company. It was the first full year of our new structure and the My Macy's strategy, and we are very pleased with our results. We are successfully establishing more of a growth culture and focusing more than ever on the customer. Since comp store sales growth is the best proxy for how the customer grades our performance, we are particularly happy with our performance on that metric this year. 
The 4.6% annual comp store increase was our best performance in at least 15 years and it also compared favorably to our key competitors. At this time last year, we expected comp store sales growth of 1% to 2% for 2010 and we obviously far exceeded that. That delta is important and enabled us to produce higher-than-expected earnings and cash flow. 
The Macy's customers are reacting very favorably to our new strategy. I'd like to list four as being particularly important to driving sales. First is the My Macy's localization strategy. I hope that as you are in our stores across the country, you are seeing the evidence of our better meeting local needs for sizes, colors, vendors et cetera. Sometimes, the contrast can be best seen when you walk our store and then compare it to the competition in the mall. We have made lots of progress but we believe there is so much more to achieve. 
Number two is private brands and exclusive market brands. We had another great year with our private brands and exclusive market brands. And the penetration of a private brand sales grew to 20% this year and the percentage of our business done in private, exclusive and limited distribution brands is now approximately 43%. 
The third key strategy would be M.A.G.I.C. selling. This is our training program, which is designed to increase engagement with our customers on the selling floor and it is supported by intense coaching. We have trained over 130,000 associates, which is something we have never done before. This is all part of the shift in our culture to being more customer centric. 
People often ask what M.A.G.I.C. stands for. The M. stands for meet and make a connection. The A, ask and listen. G, give options, give advice. I, inspire to buy and sell more. And the C, celebrate the purchase. This has been really powerful in helping our associates better engage with the customer but we have a long way to go. In fact, all associates will be going through a refresher course this spring. 
And the fourth key strategy driving our sales is our omni-channel offering. We still are only at the early stages of maximizing the opportunity from having strong websites and digital marketing capabilities. 
Our Internet business grew far faster than expected this year causing us to accelerate the expansion of a one of our distribution centers as well as the start of construction of a fourth major fulfillment center. We continue to invest in this business, both at Macy's and at Bloomingdale's, given its potential for driving sales growth both online and in-store. And we were able to achieve these great sales results this year while also improving our profitability and generating significant cash flow. 
Our operating income grew 32% excluding asset impairment, store closing and division consolidation costs. And earnings per share grew 55% on that same basis and also excluding charges relating to the early retirement of debt. We ended the year with $1.5 billion of cash having repurchased or paid off at maturity $1.2 billion of debt and having contributed $825 million to our pension plan during the year. And our return on invested capital grew to 17.4% this year from 14.9% last year. It truly was a year of great progress on all dimensions and fortunately, there is lots more to come. 
Let's go back now and talk a bit about the fourth quarter results and then I'll move on to discuss our key planning assumptions for 2011. 
Our sales in the fourth quarter, which increased 4.3% in comparable stores, were on the high end of the aggressive sales guidance we set for ourselves. EPS also exceeded our updated expectations, primarily due to lower SG&A than anticipated. As we look back on the fourth quarter, so many of our strategies at Macy's were successful. The focus on private and exclusive market brands, the gift strategy, directed merchandise moves into what we call, whitespace, and the focus on key headquarters store businesses like Men's apparel and accessories, Women's shoes, cosmetics and fragrances, watches and luggage. Where we did less well as you've heard, was the traditional parts of Women's apparel. 
Geographically, our business did well in the fourth quarter in all eight of our Macy's regions with Florida deserving a special call out for very strong results there in the quarter and also for the full year. Bloomingdale's also had a terrific quarter and year. Sales performance compare favorably to the direct of scale competition and exceeded our expectations. 
Bloomingdales.com grew far faster than expected. We successfully opened a very exciting store in Santa Monica. And we initiated a licensing arrangement for Bloomingdale's in Dubai and opened what I am told is an absolutely magnificent store in one of the world's best shopping malls. And we also launched the Bloomingdale's Outlet concept by opening four stores towards the end of the year. 
Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 41.3%, down from last year's 41.5% at the current accounting treatment been in effect. This decline was as expected. Starting in the first quarter of 2011 by the way, we will have year rounded those changes in accounting treatment so we can go back to comparing to reported numbers. 
We ended the year with inventory up 3.1%. This is a little higher than we had expected earlier on in the year but it was due primarily to a conscious effort to accelerate the receipts of replenishment goods to get back in stock after we took inventory in January. We saw this as a sales-getting opportunity and it's still lower than our rate of comp store sales growth. 
SG&A in the fourth quarter was $2,245,000,000, up just 0.4% over last year at the current accounting treatment been in effect. As a percent of sales, SG&A was 27.2%, 90 basis points below last year at the current accounting treatment been in effect. This is better than expected due to a solid expense control throughout the company as well as property tax settlements and other year-end adjustments. 
This year in the fourth quarter, we booked $18 million of asset impairment charges and $7 million of store closing-related costs for a total of $25 million. Last year in the fourth quarter, we booked a total of $186 million in asset impairment store closing and division consolidation costs in the quarter. Excluding these items, operating income was a $1,169,000,000 or 14.1% of sales this year. On this basis, operating income was up 10% over last year. And as a percent of sales, up 70 basis points had at the current accounting treatment been in effect.  Including these items, operating income was $1,144,000,000 or less than $25 million. 
Interest expense in the quarter was $118 million as expected, reflecting savings from the debt repurchases earlier in the year. Tax expense was $359 million in the quarter. This brings our annual rate to 36%. Most of the reason for the lower-than-expected rate is a change in the basis of recording deferred state income taxes from an estimated blended basis to a separate entity basis. We believe the revised methodology results in a better estimate of deferred tax liabilities and is more consistent with the accounting literature. We will be reflecting the effects of this change retroactively to 2008 and you can see the details of this change on our website. 
The 2010 expense was lowered by $9 million versus what it otherwise would have been. We had not anticipated making this change, which did help earnings per share in the quarter by $0.02 a share. This change increased last year's tax expense by $21 million or reducing the earnings per share by a nickel. This change has no impact on cash nor on operating earnings. Remember, also last year's tax in the fourth quarter included $21 million or $0.05 a share benefit due to favorable tax settlement last year in the fourth quarter. 
Net income in the quarter was $667 million. Diluted share count, 429 million shares. Earnings per share therefore, on a diluted basis in the fourth quarter was $1.55 or $1.59 excluding the asset impairment and store closing costs. 
Our guidance for the quarter had been $1.44 to $1.49, which we far exceeded. On this basis, last year's earnings per share in the fourth quarter was $1.35. As discussed earlier, sales for the full year of $25 billion were up 4.6% over last year on a comp store basis. The gross margin rates for the year was 40.7% or up 50 basis points versus last year at the current accounting treatment been in effect. 
SG&A dollars were up 1.2% had the current accounting treatment been in effect. And as a rate, SG&A was down 110 basis points on that basis. Diluted EPS was $1.98 on a reported basis versus $0.78 last year. But on the adjusted more comparable basis, excluding store closing and division consolidation costs, asset impairment and debt premium costs, earnings per share on a diluted basis was $2.11, up 55% over last year's $1.36. 
Cash flow was also very strong in 2010. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.5 billion, down from last year's $1.75 billion. Keep in mind that this year, we contributed $825 million to the pension plan versus $370 million last year. This explains more than the difference between the two years. 
Capital spending in the year including capitalized software was $505 million as compared to our budgeted $550 million. Including construction in progress, we did utilize our whole budget but some of the cash won't be expended until after year end. We are not, however, increasing the budget in 2011 to cover this because it's our assumption we'll have a comparable carry forward at the end of 2011 into 2012. 
As discussed earlier, we used excess cash to pay down over $1.2 billion of debt, and again, we ended the year with a $1.5 billion of cash. This company continues to generate significant cash, much of it has been used to reduce debt and to fund our pension liability. While we made significant progress last year in strengthening our balance sheet, we are still working towards regaining our investment grade ratings at Moody's and at S&P, and we'll continue to use some of the excess cash to reduce debt. 
Let's move on now to our key planning assumptions for 2011. We are entering the year with building momentum, which gives us confidence that we should have another strong year. As part of our transformation to having more of a growth culture, we are setting our targets for sales growth higher than in the past, and we have identified strategies that we expect will enable us to at least achieve and may be exceed those targets. 
As we talk about our assumptions for 2011, the subject of commodity price increases is a key one. We are taking this challenge very seriously but you need to keep this issue in perspective. As a better fashion retailer, we are less reliant on opening price point basics and have the ability to add quality features and fashion details that command a higher price point. Average unit retails in these categories will increase but into a lane in which we have successfully played prior to the recent recession. Also remember that a significant portion of our business is in categories that are not impacted by the escalation in raw material prices. 
Having said that, there are seven things that we are doing to help address this issue. One, while some price increases are unavoidable, we are being very careful to maintain competitive value in highly sensitive commodities. Two, because we are a very important customer for most of our vendors, we are able to work very closely with them to optimize our mutual pricing strategies. And through our vendor collaboration efforts, we've been able to work closely together with specific vendors to increase efficiencies and take cost out of the system. This is enabling us both to offset some of the higher input costs. 
Three, we will increase the use of Search and Send to enable us to provide fringe color, size and assortment option to our customers while limiting inventory risks. Search and Send is when a customer comes to our store and we don't have what she wants in stock in that store. We now are able to send it to her directly from our direct-to-customer distribution facilities. We are also expanding the ability to access inventory from other stores to increase the probability of meeting the customers' needs. 
Four, we will continue to drive key item penetration and editing peripheral assortments, which will enable us to improve the cost. Five, as to our private brand programs, we have a very experienced team of executives who live and work in countries where we produce goods. They are working very closely with our suppliers with whom we have very long relationships, and together, we are dealing with the challenges that we are both racing. 
Six, we are testing and monitoring price increases this spring to understand better price elasticity on programs and individual styles within program. And seven, we now have a pricing team in place to provide more analysis on pricing decisions. 
With that into backdrop, our assumption for comp store sales is approximately 3% for the full year of 2011. Total sales for the year will be up by approximately the same percentages comp but it could vary slightly by quarter. At this time, we are planning to open three Bloomingdale's outlets and no new department stores. 
We are assuming a flattish gross margin rate for the year 2011. In addition to the pressure on margin from the added cost in some categories of merchandise, the decision to move to free delivery for purchases over $99 everyday on macys.com as well as the growing use of Search and Send is going to put pressure on our gross margin rate. We expect to be able to offset this impact, however, after the first quarter when we year round on the rollout of Search and Send. 
We are assuming that SG&A dollars will increase roughly 2% to 2.5% for the year. This therefore, assumes that our SG&A rate as a percent of sales will continue to decline as sales rise. This increase in SG&A is a little higher than a normal run rate due to the investments we're making to grow our online and multichannel business, including the expanded warehouse and the construction of the new mega center and ongoing site and customer service improvement. 
Depreciation and amortization is assumed to be $1,110,000,000 for the year or down $40 million from 2010. Interest expense is assumed to be approximately $450 million in 2011 versus $574 million in 2010, which includes the $66 million premium on the debt repurchase. For tax expense, we still believe the rate should be approximately 37% for the year, although it will continue to vary quarter-to-quarter. 
We are assuming an average diluted share count for the year of 432 million shares. This all leads to the earnings per share guidance of $2.25 to $2.30 for the year 2011. And in terms of assumptions for forecasting cash, here are three that should help. 
The first, we're assuming CapEx of $800 million. Two, while we are still finalizing our plans for a pension contribution this year, for now, we are assuming a contribution of approximately $225 million, which should again, approximately get us back to being fully funded by the end of 2011. Three, we plan to pay off the approximately $450 million of debt that matures in 2011. And while we are on the subject of debt, as a reminder, we have approximately $1.1 billion maturing in 2012. 
As our team enters 2011, we are focused on four key strategic imperative. The first, to drive the growth culture. This involves encouraging risks, maximizing big ideas, mining whitespaces for opportunities that we see to fill in our offering, focus on vendor collaboration and continue to grow our private and exclusive market brand. 
Two, maximize My Macy's. We need to continue to respond to the local needs of our customer. This includes doing a better job on key subjects like sizing, climatic variation and multi-cultural differences. 
Three, we need to continue to embrace customer centricity. We need to continue to live M.A.G.I.C. selling, which focuses on engaging with customers and we need to drive our coaching to support these efforts. We are also rolling out a new scheduling system that is designed to better match staffing to when customers are in the department. And through our new online customer survey, which is providing better and quicker feedback combined with the use of Dunnhumby analysis, we hope to be much better able to meet the needs of our customers. 
And fourth, drive the omni-channel business. We need to continue to align our store and our Internet merchandising and marketing strategies. And we need to continue to build our capabilities for getting customers what they want whether it be fulfilled in a central warehouse or from a store. And we also need to do a better job of embracing technology in our stores and bringing more of our online learnings into the store. This whole area is very exciting and will continue to be a terrific source of growth for us. 
The bottom line, we had a great year in 2010 and we expect an even better one in 2011. Our new structure is enabling us to make faster, bigger and better decisions while at the same time staying very close to the customer at the local level. And there is a so much progress we expect to make as we go forward because most of our key strategies are in a very early stages of producing the results we expect. At the same time, we are mining and testing new ideas and new ways of thinking to drive the business forward. And we are comfortable taking more calculated risks consistent with our interest in building a sustainable growth culture. 
And with that, I'll take any questions you have."

Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. 
2010 was a great year for the company. It was the first full year of our new structure and the My Macy's strategy, and we are very pleased with our results. We are successfully establishing more of a growth culture and focusing more than ever on the customer. Since comp store sales growth is the best proxy for how the customer grades our performance, we are particularly happy with our performance on that metric this year. 
The 4.6% annual comp store increase was our best performance in at least 15 years, and it also compared favorably to our key competitors. At this time last year, we expected comp store sales growth of 1% to 2% for 2010 and we obviously far exceeded that. That delta is important and enabled us to produce higher-than-expected earnings and cash flow. 
The Macy's customers are reacting very favorably to our new strategy. I'd like to list four as being particularly important to driving sales. First is the My Macy's localization strategy. I hope that as you are in our stores across the country, you are seeing the evidence of our better meeting local needs for sizes, colors, vendors, et cetera. Sometimes, the contrast can be best seen when you walk our store and then compare it to the competition in the mall. We have made lots of progress but we believe there is so much more to achieve. 
Number two is private brands and exclusive market brands. We had another great year with our private brands and exclusive market brands. And the penetration of private brand sales grew to 20% this year and the percentage of our business done in private, exclusive and limited distribution brands is now approximately 43%. 
The third key strategy would be M.A.G.I.C. selling. This is our training program, which is designed to increase engagement with our customers on the selling floor, and it is supported by intense coaching. We have trained over 130,000 salesmen associates, which is something we have never done before. This is all part of the shift in our culture to being more customer centric. 
People often ask what M.A.G.I.C. stands for. The M stands for meet and make a connection. The A, ask and listen. G, give options, give advice. I, inspire to buy and sell more. And the C, celebrate the purchase. This has been really powerful in helping our associates better engage with the customer, but we have a long way to go. In fact, all associates will be going through a refresher course this spring. 
And the fourth key strategy driving our sales is our omnichannel offering. We still are only at the early stages of maximizing the opportunity from having strong websites and digital marketing capabilities. 
Our Internet businesses grew far faster than expected this year, causing us to accelerate the expansion of a one of our distribution centers, as well as the start of construction of a fourth major fulfillment center. We continue to invest in this business, both at Macy's and at Bloomingdale's, given its potential for driving sales growth both online and in-store. And we were able to achieve these great sales results this year while also improving our profitability and generating significant cash flow. 
Our operating income grew 32%, excluding asset impairment, store closing and division consolidation costs. And earnings per share grew 55% on that same basis and also excluding charges relating to the early retirement of debt. We ended the year with $1.5 billion of cash, having repurchased or paid off at maturity, $1.2 billion of debt and having contributed $825 million to our pension plan during the year. And our return on invested capital grew to 17.4% this year from 14.9% last year. It truly was a year of great progress on all dimensions and fortunately, there is lots more to come. 
Let's go back now and talk a bit about the fourth quarter results, and then I'll move on and discuss our key planning assumptions for 2011. 
Our sales in the fourth quarter, which increased 4.3% in comparable stores, were on the high end of the aggressive sales guidance we set for ourselves. EPS also exceeded our updated expectations, primarily due to lower SG&A than anticipated. As we look back on the fourth quarter, so many of our strategies at Macy's were successful. The focus on private and exclusive market brands, the gift strategy, directed merchandise moves into what we call, whitespace, and the focus on key headquarter store businesses like Men's apparel and accessories, Women's shoes, cosmetics and fragrances, watches and luggage. Where we did less well as you've heard, was the traditional parts of Women's apparel. 
Geographically, our business did well in the fourth quarter in all eight of our Macy's regions with Florida deserving a special call out for very strong results there in the quarter and also for the full year. Bloomingdale's also had a terrific quarter and year. Sales performance compared favorably to the direct upscale competition and exceeded our expectations. 
bloomingdales.com grew far faster than expected. We successfully opened a very exciting store in Santa Monica. And we initiated a licensing arrangement for Bloomingdale's in Dubai and opened what I am told is an absolutely magnificent store in one of the world's best shopping malls. And we also launched the Bloomingdale's Outlet concept by opening four stores towards the end of the year. 
Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 41.3%, down from last year's 41.5%, had the current accounting treatment been in effect. This decline was as expected. Starting in the first quarter of 2011, by the way, we will have year rounded those changes in accounting treatment so we can go back to comparing to reported numbers. 
We ended the year with inventory up 3.1%. This is a little higher than we had expected earlier in the year, but it was due primarily to a conscious effort to accelerate the receipts of replenishment goods to get back in stock after we took inventory in January. We saw this as a sales-getting opportunity, and it's still lower than our rate of comp store sales growth. 
SG&A in the fourth quarter was $2,245,000,000, up just 0.4% over last year, had the current accounting treatment been in effect. As a percent of sales, SG&A was 27.2%, 90 basis points below last year, had the current accounting treatment been in effect. This is better than expected due to solid expense control throughout the company as well as property tax settlements and other year-end adjustments. 
This year in the fourth quarter, we booked $18 million of asset impairment charges and $7 million of store closing-related costs for a total of $25 million. Last year in the fourth quarter, we booked a total of $186 million in asset impairment store closing and division consolidation costs in the quarter. Excluding these items, operating income was a $1,169,000,000 or 14.1% of sales this year. On this basis, operating income was up 10% over last year. And as a percent of sales, up 70 basis points, had the current accounting treatment been in effect.  Including these items, operating income was $1,144,000,000 or less the $25 million. 
Interest expense in the quarter was $118 million as expected, reflecting savings from the debt repurchases earlier in the year. Tax expense was $359 million in the quarter. This brings our annual rate to 36%. Most of the reason for the lower-than-expected rate is a change in the basis of recording deferred state income taxes from an estimated blended basis to a separate entity basis. We believe the revised methodology results in a better estimate of deferred tax liabilities and is more consistent with the accounting literature. We will be reflecting the effects of this change retroactively to 2008, and you can see the details of this change on our website. 
The 2010 expense was lowered by $9 million versus what it otherwise would have been. We had not anticipated making this change, which did help earnings per share in the quarter by $0.02 a share. This change increased last year's tax expense by $21 million or reducing the earnings per share by a nickel. This change has no impact on cash nor on operating earnings. Remember, also last year's tax in the fourth quarter included $21 million or $0.05 a share benefit due to favorable tax settlements last year in the fourth quarter. 
Net income in the quarter was $667 million. Diluted share count, 429 million shares. Earnings per share, therefore, on a diluted basis in the fourth quarter was $1.55 or $1.59 excluding the asset impairment and store closing costs. 
Our guidance for the quarter had been $1.44 to $1.49, which we far exceeded. On this basis, last year's earnings per share in the fourth quarter was $1.35. As discussed earlier, sales for the full year of $25 billion were up 4.6% over last year on a comp store basis. The gross margin rate for the year was 40.7% or up 50 basis points versus last year, had the current accounting treatment been in effect. 
SG&A dollars were up 1.2%, had the current accounting treatment been in effect. And as a rate, SG&A was down 110 basis points on that basis. Diluted EPS was $1.98 on a reported basis versus $0.78 last year. But on the adjusted more comparable basis, excluding store closing and division consolidation costs, asset impairment and debt premium costs, earnings per share on a diluted basis was $2.11, up 55% over last year's $1.36. 
Cash flow was also very strong in 2010. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.5 billion, down from last year's $1.75 billion. Keep in mind that this year, we contributed $825 million to the pension plan versus $370 million last year. This explains more than the difference between the two years. 
Capital spending in the year including capitalized software was $505 million as compared to our budgeted $550 million. Including construction in progress, we did utilize our whole budget but some of the cash won't be expended until after year end. We are not, however, increasing the budget in 2011 to cover this because it's our assumption we'll have a comparable carry forward at the end of 2011 into 2012. 
As discussed earlier, we used excess cash to pay down over $1.2 billion of debt, and again, we ended the year with a $1.5 billion of cash. This company continues to generate significant cash, much of it has been used to reduce debt and to fund our pension liability. While we made significant progress last year in strengthening our balance sheet, we are still working towards regaining our investment grade ratings at Moody's and at S&P, and we'll continue to use some of the excess cash to reduce debt. 
Let's move on now to our key planning assumptions for 2011. We are entering the year with building momentum, which gives us confidence that we should have another strong year. As part of our transformation to having more of a growth culture, we are setting our targets for sales growth higher than in the past, and we have identified strategies that we expect will enable us to at least achieve and maybe exceed those targets. 
As we talk about our assumptions for 2011, the subject of commodity price increases is a key one. We are taking this challenge very seriously but you need to keep this issue in perspective. As a better fashion retailer, we are less reliant on opening price point basics and have the ability to add quality features and fashion details that command a higher price point. Average unit retails in these categories will increase but into a lane in which we have successfully played prior to the recent recession. Also, remember that a significant portion of our business is in categories that are not impacted by the escalation in raw material prices. 
Having said that, there are seven things that we are doing to help address this issue. One, while some price increases are unavoidable, we are being very careful to maintain competitive value in highly sensitive commodities. Two, because we are a very important customer for most of our vendors, we are able to work very closely with them to optimize our mutual pricing strategies. And through our vendor collaboration efforts, we've been able to work closely together with specific vendors to increase efficiencies and take cost out of the system. This is enabling us both to offset some of the higher input costs. 
Three, we will increase the use of Search and Send to enable us to provide fringe color, size and assortment option to our customers while limiting inventory risks. Search and Send is when a customer comes to our store and we don't have what she wants in stock in that store. We now are able to send it to her directly from our direct-to-customer distribution facilities. We are also expanding the ability to access inventory from other stores to increase the probability of meeting the customers' needs. 
Four, we will continue to drive key item penetration and editing peripheral assortments, which will enable us to improve the cost. Five, as to our private brand programs, we have a very experienced team of executives who live and work in countries where we produce goods. They are working very closely with our suppliers with whom we have very long relationships, and together, we are dealing with the challenges that we are both facing. 
Six, we are testing and monitoring price increases this spring to understand better price elasticity on programs and individual styles within programs. And seven, we now have a pricing team in place to provide more analysis on pricing decisions. 
With that into backdrop, our assumption for comp store sales is approximately 3% for the full year of 2011. Total sales for the year will be up by approximately the same percentages comp, but it could vary slightly by quarter. At this time, we are planning to open three Bloomingdale's outlets and no new department stores. 
We are assuming a flattish gross margin rate for the year 2011. In addition to the pressure on margin from the added cost in some categories of merchandise, the decision to move to free delivery for purchases over $99 everyday on macys.com, as well as the growing use of Search and Send, is going to put pressure on our gross margin rate. We expect to be able to offset this impact, however, after the first quarter when we year round on the rollout of Search and Send. 
We are assuming that SG&A dollars will increase roughly 2% to 2.5% for the year. This therefore assumes that our SG&A rate as a percent of sales will continue to decline as sales rise. This increase in SG&A is a little higher than a normal run rate due to the investments we're making to grow our online and multichannel business, including the expanded warehouse and the construction of the new mega center and ongoing site and customer service improvement. 
Depreciation and amortization is assumed to be $1,110,000,000 for the year or down $40 million from 2010. Interest expense is assumed to be approximately $450 million in 2011 versus $574 million in 2010, which includes the $66 million premium on the debt repurchase. For tax expense, we still believe the rate should be approximately 37% for the year, although it will continue to vary quarter-to-quarter. 
We are assuming an average diluted share count for the year of 432 million shares. This all leads to the earnings per share guidance of $2.25 to $2.30 for the year 2011. And in terms of assumptions for forecasting cash, here are three that should help. 
The first, we're assuming CapEx of $800 million. Two, while we are still finalizing our plans for a pension contribution this year, for now, we are assuming a contribution of approximately $225 million, which should again, approximately get us back to being fully funded by the end of 2011. Three, we plan to pay off the approximately $450 million of debt that matures in 2011. And while we are on the subject of debt, as a reminder, we have approximately $1.1 billion maturing in 2012. 
As our team enters 2011, we are focused on four key strategic imperative. The first, to drive a growth culture. This involves encouraging risks, maximizing big ideas, mining whitespaces for opportunities that we see to fill in our offering, focus on vendor collaboration and continue to grow our private and exclusive market brand. 
Two, maximize My Macy's. We need to continue to respond to the local needs of our customer. This includes doing a better job on key subjects like sizing, climatic variation and multi-cultural differences. 
Three, we need to continue to embrace customer centricity. We need to continue to live M.A.G.I.C. selling, which focuses on engaging with customers and we need to drive our coaching to support these efforts. We are also rolling out a new scheduling system that is designed to better match staffing to when customers are in the department. And through our new online customer survey, which is providing better and quicker feedback combined with the use of dunnhumby analysis, we hope to be much better able to meet the needs of our customers. 
And fourth, drive the Omnichannel business. We need to continue to align our store and our Internet merchandising and marketing strategies. And we need to continue to build our capabilities for getting customers what they want whether it be fulfilled in a central warehouse or from a store. And we also need to do a better job of embracing technology in our stores and bringing more of our online learnings into the store. This whole area is very exciting and will continue to be a terrific source of growth for us. 
The bottom line, we had a great year in 2010 and we expect an even better one in 2011. Our new structure is enabling us to make faster, bigger and better decisions while at the same time, staying very close to the customer at the local level. And there is so much progress we expect to make as we go forward because most of our key strategies are in a very early stages of producing the results we expect. At the same time, we are mining and testing new ideas and new ways of thinking to drive the business forward. And we are comfortable taking more calculated risks consistent with our interest in building a sustainable growth culture. 
And with that, I'll take any questions you have."

And one of the things that we are busy doing, particularly through technology, is investing in the stores to, again, utilize online so that we grow store sales also. If all we do is transfer business from store to the Internet, that's not a success. So what's been great this past couple of years is that both are growing faster than they had grown and we'll continue to do that.

2010 was a great year for the company. It was the first full year of our new structure and the My Macy's strategy, and we are very pleased with our results. We are successfully establishing more of a growth culture and focusing more than ever on the customer. Since comp store sales growth is the best proxy for how the customer grades our performance, we are particularly happy with our performance on that metric this year. 
The 4.6% annual comp store increase was our best performance in at least 15 years, and it also compared favorably to our key competitors. At this time last year, we expected comp store sales growth of 1% to 2% for 2010, and we obviously far exceeded that. That delta is important and enabled us to produce higher-than-expected earnings and cash flow. 
The Macy's customers are reacting very favorably to our new strategies. I'd like to list four as being particularly important to driving sales. First is the My Macy's localization strategy. I hope that as you are in our stores across the country, you are seeing the evidence of our better meeting local needs for sizes, colors, vendors, et cetera. Sometimes, the contrast can be best seen when you walk our store and then compare it to the competition in the mall. We have made lots of progress, but we believe there is so much more to achieve. 
Number two is private brands and exclusive market brands. We had another great year with our private brands and exclusive market brands. And the penetration of private brand sales grew to 20% this year, and the percentage of our business done in private, exclusive and limited distribution brands is now approximately 43%. 
The third key strategy would be M.A.G.I.C. selling. This is our training program, which is designed to increase engagement with our customers on the selling floor, and it is supported by intense coaching. We have trained over 130,000 associates, which is something we have never done before. This is all part of the shift in our culture to being more customer-centric. 
People often ask what M.A.G.I.C. stands for. The M stands for meet and make a connection. The A, ask and listen. G, give options, give advice. I, inspire to buy and sell more. And the C, celebrate the purchase. This has been really powerful in helping our associates better engage with the customer, but we have a long way to go. In fact, all associates will be going through a refresher course this spring. 
And the fourth key strategy driving our sales is our omnichannel offering. We still are only at the early stages of maximizing the opportunity from having strong websites and digital marketing capabilities. 
Our Internet businesses grew far faster than expected this year, causing us to accelerate the expansion of one of our distribution centers, as well as the start of construction of a fourth major fulfillment center. We continue to invest in this business, both at Macy's and at Bloomingdale's, given its potential for driving sales growth both online and in-store. And we were able to achieve these great sales results this year while also improving our profitability and generating significant cash flow. 
Our operating income grew 32%, excluding asset impairment, store closing and division consolidation costs. And earnings per share grew 55% on that same basis and also excluding charges relating to the early retirement of debt. We ended the year with $1.5 billion of cash, having repurchased or paid off at maturity $1.2 billion of debt and having contributed $825 million to our pension plan during the year. And our return on invested capital grew to 17.4% this year from 14.9% last year. It truly was a year of great progress on all dimensions, and fortunately, there is lots more to come. 
Let's go back now and talk a bit about the fourth quarter results, and then I'll move on and discuss our key planning assumptions for 2011. 
Our sales in the fourth quarter, which increased 4.3% in comparable stores, were on the high end of the aggressive sales guidance we set for ourselves. EPS also exceeded our updated expectations, primarily due to lower SG&A than anticipated. As we look back on the fourth quarter, so many of our strategies at Macy's were successful. The focus on private and exclusive market brands, the gift strategy, directed merchandise moves into what we call whitespace and the focus on key headquarter store businesses like Men's apparel and accessories, Women's shoes, cosmetics and fragrances, watches and luggage. Where we did less well, as you've heard, were the traditional parts of Women's apparel. 
Geographically, our business did well in the fourth quarter in all eight of our Macy's regions with Florida deserving a special callout for very strong results there in the quarter and also for the full year. Bloomingdale's also had a terrific quarter and year. Sales performance compared favorably to the direct upscale competition and exceeded our expectations. 
bloomingdales.com grew far faster than expected. We successfully opened a very exciting store in Santa Monica. And we initiated a licensing arrangement for Bloomingdale's in Dubai and opened what I am told is an absolutely magnificent store in one of the world's best shopping malls. And we also launched the Bloomingdale's Outlet concept by opening four stores towards the end of the year. 
Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 41.3%, down from last year's 41.5%, had the current accounting treatment been in effect. This decline was as expected. Starting in the first quarter of 2011, by the way, we will have year rounded those changes in accounting treatment so we can go back to comparing to reported numbers. 
We ended the year with inventory up 3.1%. This is a little higher than we had expected earlier in the year, but it was due primarily to a conscious effort to accelerate the receipts of replenishment goods to get back in stock after we took inventory in January. We saw this as a sales-getting opportunity, and it's still lower than our rate of comp store sales growth. 
SG&A in the fourth quarter was $2,245,000,000, up just 0.4% over last year, had the current accounting treatment been in effect. As a percent of sales, SG&A was 27.2%, 90 basis points below last year, had the current accounting treatment been in effect. This is better than expected due to solid expense control throughout the company as well as property tax settlements and other year-end adjustments. 
This year in the fourth quarter, we booked $18 million of asset impairment charges and $7 million of store closing-related costs for a total of $25 million. Last year in the fourth quarter, we booked a total of $186 million in asset impairment, store closing and division consolidation costs in the quarter. Excluding these items, operating income was a $1,169,000,000 or 14.1% of sales this year. On this basis, operating income was up 10% over last year and, as a percent of sales, up 70 basis points, had the current accounting treatment been in effect.  Including these items, operating income was $1,144,000,000 or less the $25 million. 
Interest expense in the quarter was $118 million as expected, reflecting savings from the debt repurchases earlier in the year. Tax expense was $359 million in the quarter. This brings our annual rate to 36%. Most of the reason for the lower-than-expected rate is a change in the basis of recording deferred state income taxes from an estimated blended basis to a separate entity basis. We believe the revised methodology results in a better estimate of deferred tax liabilities and is more consistent with the accounting literature. We will be reflecting the effects of this change retroactively to 2008, and you can see the details of this change on our website. 
The 2010 expense was lowered by $9 million versus what it otherwise would have been. We had not anticipated making this change, which did help earnings per share in the quarter by $0.02 a share. This change increased last year's tax expense by $21 million or reducing the earnings per share by a nickel. This change has no impact on cash nor on operating earnings. Remember also, last year's tax in the fourth quarter included $21 million or $0.05 a share benefit due to favorable tax settlements last year in the fourth quarter. 
Net income in the quarter was $667 million. Diluted share count, 429 million shares. Earnings per share, therefore, on a diluted basis in the fourth quarter was $1.55 or $1.59, excluding the asset impairment and store closing costs. 
Our guidance for the quarter had been $1.44 to $1.49, which we far exceeded. On this basis, last year's earnings per share in the fourth quarter was $1.35. As discussed earlier, sales for the full year of $25 billion were up 4.6% over last year on a comp store basis. The gross margin rate for the year was 40.7% or up 50 basis points versus last year, had the current accounting treatment been in effect. 
SG&A dollars were up 1.2%, had the current accounting treatment been in effect. And as a rate, SG&A was down 110 basis points on that basis. Diluted EPS was $1.98 on a reported basis versus $0.78 last year. But on the adjusted more comparable basis, excluding store closing and division consolidation costs, asset impairment and debt premium costs, earnings per share on a diluted basis was $2.11, up 55% over last year's $1.36. 
Cash flow was also very strong in 2010. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.5 billion, down from last year's $1.75 billion. Keep in mind that this year, we contributed $825 million to the pension plan versus $370 million last year. This explains more than the difference between the two years. 
Capital spending in the year, including capitalized software, was $505 million as compared to our budgeted $550 million. Including construction in progress, we did utilize our whole budget, but some of the cash won't be expended until after year end. We are not, however, increasing the budget in 2011 to cover this because it's our assumption we'll have a comparable carry forward at the end of 2011 into 2012. 
As discussed earlier, we used excess cash to pay down over $1.2 billion of debt, and again, we ended the year with a $1.5 billion of cash. This company continues to generate significant cash. Much of it has been used to reduce debt and to fund our pension liability. While we made significant progress last year in strengthening our balance sheet, we are still working towards regaining our investment grade ratings at Moody's and at S&P, and we'll continue to use some of the excess cash to reduce debt. 
Let's move on now to our key planning assumptions for 2011. We are entering the year with building momentum, which gives us confidence that we should have another strong year. As part of our transformation to having more of a growth culture, we are setting our targets for sales growth higher than in the past, and we have identified strategies that we expect will enable us to at least achieve and maybe exceed those targets. 
As we talk about our assumptions for 2011, the subject of commodity price increases is a key one. We are taking this challenge very seriously, but you need to keep this issue in perspective. As a better fashion retailer, we are less reliant on opening price point basics and have the ability to add quality features and fashion details that command a higher price point. Average unit retails in these categories will increase but into a lane in which we have successfully played prior to the recent recession. Also, remember that a significant portion of our business is in categories that are not impacted by the escalation in raw material prices. 
Having said that, here are seven things that we are doing to help address this issue. One, while some price increases are unavoidable, we are being very careful to maintain competitive value in highly sensitive commodities. Two, because we are a very important customer for most of our vendors, we are able to work very closely with them to optimize our mutual pricing strategies. And through our vendor collaboration efforts, we've been able to work closely together with specific vendors to increase efficiencies and take cost out of the system. This is enabling us both to offset some of the higher input costs. 
Three, we will increase the use of Search and Send to enable us to provide fringe color, size and assortment option to our customers while limiting inventory risks. Search and Send is when a customer comes to our store and we don't have what she wants in stock in that store. We now are able to send it to her directly from our direct-to-customer distribution facilities. We’re also expanding the ability to access inventory from other stores to increase the probability of meeting a customer's needs. 
Four, we will continue to drive key item penetration and editing peripheral assortments, which will enable us to improve the cost. Five, as to our private brand programs, we have a very experienced team of executives who live and work in countries where we produce goods. They are working very closely with our suppliers with whom we have very long relationships, and together, we’re dealing with the challenges that we’re both facing. 
Six, we are testing and monitoring price increases this spring to understand better price elasticity on programs and individual styles within programs. And seven, we now have a pricing team in place to provide more analysis on pricing decisions. 
With that as a backdrop, our assumption for comp store sales is approximately 3% for the full year of 2011. Total sales for the year will be up by approximately the same percentages comp, but it could vary slightly by quarter. At this time, we are planning to open three Bloomingdale's outlets and no new department stores. 
We are assuming a flattish gross margin rate for the year 2011. In addition to the pressure on margin from the added costs in some categories of merchandise, the decision to move to free delivery for purchases over $99 everyday on macys.com, as well as the growing use of Search and Send, is going to put pressure on our gross margin rate. We expect to be able to offset this impact, however, after the first quarter when we year round on the rollout of Search and Send. 
We are assuming that SG&A dollars will increase roughly 2% to 2.5% for the year. This, therefore, assumes that our SG&A rate as a percent of sales will continue to decline as sales rise. This increase in SG&A is a little higher than a normal run rate due to the investments we're making to grow our online and multichannel business, including the expanded warehouse and the construction of the new mega center and ongoing site and customer service improvements. 
Depreciation and amortization is assumed to be $1,110,000,000 for the year or down $40 million from 2010. Interest expense is assumed to be approximately $450 million in 2011 versus $574 million in 2010, which includes the $66 million premium on the debt repurchase. For tax expense, we still believe the rate should be approximately 37% for the year, although it will continue to vary quarter-to-quarter. 
We are assuming an average diluted share count for the year of 432 million shares. This all leads to the earnings per share guidance of $2.25 to $2.30 for the year 2011. And in terms of assumptions for forecasting cash, here are three that should help. 
The first, we're assuming CapEx of $800 million. Two, while we’re still finalizing our plans for a pension contribution this year, for now, we’re assuming a contribution of approximately $225 million, which should, again, approximately get us back to being fully funded by the end of 2011. Three, we plan to pay off the approximately $450 million of debt that matures in 2011. And while we’re on the subject of debt, as a reminder, we have approximately $1.1 billion maturing in 2012. 
As our team enters 2011, we’re focused on four key strategic imperatives. The first, to drive a growth culture. This involves encouraging risk, maximizing big ideas, mining whitespaces for opportunities that we see to fill in our offering, focus on vendor collaboration and continue to grow our private and exclusive market brand. 
Two, maximize My Macy's. We need to continue to respond to the local needs of our customer. This includes doing a better job on key subjects like sizing, climatic variation and multi-cultural differences. 
Three, we need to continue to embrace customer centricity. We need to continue to live M.A.G.I.C. selling, which focuses on engaging with customers, and we need to drive our coaching to support these efforts. We were also rolling out a new scheduling system that is designed to better match staffing to when customers are in a department. And through our new online customer survey, which is providing better and quicker feedback, combined with the use of dunnhumby analysis, we hope to be much better able to meet the needs of our customers. 
And fourth, drive the omnichannel business. We need to continue to align our store and our Internet merchandising and marketing strategies. And we need to continue to build our capabilities for getting customers what they want, whether it be fulfilled in a central warehouse or from a store. And we also need to do a better job of embracing technology in our stores and bringing more of our online learnings into the store. This whole area is very exciting and will continue to be a terrific source of growth for us. 
The bottom line, we had a great year in 2010, and we expect an even better one in 2011. Our new structure is enabling us to make faster, bigger and better decisions, while at the same time, staying very close to the customer at the local level. And there is so much progress we expect to make as we go forward because most of our key strategies are in the very early stages of producing the results we expect. At the same time, we are mining and testing new ideas and new ways of thinking to drive the business forward. And we are comfortable taking more calculated risks consistent with our interest in building a sustainable growth culture. 
And with that, I'll take any questions you have."

So that's probably the biggest offset against the pressures that we had talked about. The other is successful private brand merchandise helps margins a bit. As you know, we develop our private brands not to drive gross margin rate, more to drive comp store sales and provide value and unique offerings. But having said that, when they do well, we do get a margin benefit. So that should help also."

But we believe at this point that while the Internet is growing rapidly, we think most of that business is actually incremental. And one of the things that we’re busy doing, particularly through technology, is investing in the stores to, again, utilize online so that we grow store sales also. If all we do is transfer business from store to the Internet, that's not a success. So what's been great this past couple of years is that both are growing faster than they had grown, and we'll continue to do that.

Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.
We feel great about our performance in the first quarter. Our sales growth continued strong, producing a 5.4% comp store sales increase on top of last year's 5.5% increase. As we have said repeatedly, the momentum from our restructuring and the implementation of My Macy's is building and bodes very well for our future.
And the profitability of the business increased dramatically in the quarter, with earnings per share more than tripling. We reported a earnings per share on a diluted basis of $0.30 versus last year's $0.09 when we exclude the expense related to the early extinguishment of debt.
And with the continued confidence in our operating results and our balance sheet now in a stronger position, we've doubled the size of our annual dividend from $0.20 a share to $0.40. This is an important step in returning more value directly to our shareholders.
Let's first talk a bit about the quarter, and then I'll discuss the outlook for the remainder of the year. Sales in the first quarter were $5,889,000,000, up 5.7% over last year. While ahead of our expectations across the country our southern regions, the Southeast, the southwest and south-central, did best given the more favorable weather in that part of the country. And the Upper Midwest also had a strong quarter.
This should bode well for the second quarter sales in the north, as the weather warms up. Bloomingdale's had another terrific quarter, and continues to do very well versus their peer group. Sales on the Internet were also very strong in the quarter, with a 38% increase. We are very happy with how our army omni channel strategy is evolving at both Macy’s and Bloomingdale's. We believe both the stores and the Internet sales are benefiting from these efforts and investments.
In the first quarter, sales of jewelry and watches, cosmetics, Men's and Home were very strong, as were our private and exclusive brands, led by I.N.C. The weaker businesses included Women's traditional and casual apparel, Women's suits and intimate apparel. In the quarter, average unit retail was up approximately 1%. Our inventory continues to be in great shape, both in terms of quantity and quality. At the end of April, comp store inventory was up 2.8%, well below our expectation for comp sales in the second quarter. 
And even though we are controlling our inventory, we are making investments in new businesses, like outdoor furniture, expanding successful businesses, such as Impulse Beauty and designer fashion watches, as well as funding incremental merchandise receipts to support the fast-growing businesses.
Gross margin in the quarter was 39.1%. While still 30 basis points below last year, it is better than we had expected. As you recall, the key reason for the decline versus last year relates to the growth of Search and Send and overall free shipping on macys.com.
SG&A in the quarter was $1,973,000,000, or 33.5% of sales, which is down 1% in dollars, and 230 basis points as a rate versus last year. This is much better than we had expected. Part of this favorability does relate to timing, and therefore, will come back in future quarters but most of the good news is permanent. The biggest upside surprise came from credit. 
The profitability of our Credit business improved by $25 million versus last year in the quarter, which was significantly better than we had expected. The portfolio experienced a big improvement in bad debt, and in addition, the penetration of our proprietary credit card was 46.7%, which is flat with last year and better than we had expected.
Also in the quarter, stock-based compensation expense was lower than expected, and was $16 million this year versus $29 million last year. Depreciation and amortization was $19 million below last year as expected, and we've benefited in the quarter from the $12 million gain from the sale of our shares in the not.
Operating income in the quarter was $330 million, $127 million, or 63% higher than last year, and 200 basis points higher as a percent of sales.  Interest expense was $116 million in the quarter, which is $19 million below last year, excluding the cost associated with the debt repurchase. This is obviously due to our reduction in debt over the last year.
Tax expense was $83 million, bringing net income to $131 million in the quarter, compared to $23 million last year. Average diluted share count in the quarter was 430 million shares, and as I said earlier, earnings per share was $0.30 in the quarter as compared to $0.05 per share last year, or $0.09 per share, excluding the expense associated with the early retirement of debt.
Cash flow was also very strong in the quarter. Cash provided by operating activities was $67 million versus a used last year of $149 million. Net cash used by investing activities was a $64 million, $20 million higher than last year due to the increase in our capital expenditure budget this year.  So cash provided by operating activities net of investing activities was $196 million higher than last year. 
During the quarter, we've paid down $335 million of debt at maturity and contributed $225 million to the pension plan. We believe this puts our balance sheet in very good shape, such that we are able to begin returning cash to the shareholders while still working toward our objective of becoming investment grade activities at Moody's and at S&P.
Given this crossroad, we thought it would be the right time to discuss the key credit metrics that we are now tracking and our targets for these metrics. As you know, S&P, Moody's and Fitch calculate credit ratios using different definitions. And we've attempted to combine the best of all three in setting our own definitions. 
The details of these calculations are all on our website under financial information. But essentially, we're using reported debt, EBITDA and interest expense, and making adjustments for leases and for any underfunding of our postretirement plans.
So we are tracking two key ratios, one leverage or the adjusted debt-to-EBITDA, and the other coverage, adjusted EBITDA to interest. So for 2010, our adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio was 3.0. And on a rolling four quarters basis, through the first quarter of 2011, this ratio improved to 2.8. Our current target for this ratio is 2.4 to 2.7.
For 2010, our adjusted EBITDA to interest was 5.6, and on a rolling four quarters basis through the first quarter of 2011, this ratio improved to 6.0. Our current target is 6.4 to 6.6.
We expect to achieve or come very close to achieving these targets by the end of 2011. We believe that these targets are consistent with what would be necessary to achieve investment grade, although as you know, there are many other quantitative, as well as qualitative factors that go into the rating decision.
The first quarter was a great one, and we are so pleased that the momentum continues to build. Our organization is completely focused on keeping the sales growth trend growing. We are all focusing on better serving our customers, both in-store and online, with great, locally tailored assortment, terrific value and Magic Selling.
As you saw in the press release, we increased our guidance for comp store sales growth for the remainder of the year to approximately 4%, which would translate to approximately 4.3% for the full year, as compared to our original guidance of 3%.
For the second quarter, we are expecting comp store sales growth of around that 4%. Although we I should add that we expect the highest sales growth in the quarter in the month of May, the next highest in the month of June and the lowest in July, given prior year's performance.
Earnings per share, we're guiding to $2.40 to $2.45, or up $0.15 from the original guidance, and CapEx is still budgeted at $800 million. We are off to another strong start this year, and we have every expectation it will continue. There has been a lot of speculation about how the consumer will react to higher gas prices, price inflation, stagnant housing prices and a myriad of other macroeconomic factors. No one, of course, knows how this would all play out. But we do feel great about our company's ability to continue to outperform the competition no matter the environment.
We have a tremendous amount of ammunition in place, and as I have said repeatedly, the My Macy's culture and structure combined with the Army channel strategy are making an enormous difference. We couldn't be happier with the progress we have made, and we are all feeling very positive about the potential in front of us.
And with that, I will take your questions."

I'm just wondering if you're setting yourself up for this disappointment, because it was five or six years ago that Penny also had similar kinds of metrics and was actually performing very well, and the rating agencies did not take them into investment grade, but because that's kind of a dim view they have for the industry.

Please refer to the Investor Relations section of our website for discussion and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures discussed this morning.
Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.
We feel great about our performance in the first quarter. Our sales growth continued strong, producing a 5.4% comp store sales increase on top of last year's 5.5% increase. As we have said repeatedly, the momentum from our restructuring and the implementation of My Macy's is building and bodes very well for our future. And the profitability of the business increased dramatically in the quarter, with earnings per share more than tripling. 
We reported a earnings per share on a diluted basis of $0.30 versus last year's $0.09 when we exclude the expense related to the early extinguishment of debt. And with the continued confidence in our operating results and our balance sheet now in a stronger position, we've doubled the size of our annual dividend from $0.20 a share to $0.40. This is an important step in returning more value directly to our shareholders.
Let's first talk a bit about the quarter, and then I will discuss the outlook for the remainder of the year. Sales in the first quarter were $5,889,000,000, up 5.7% over last year. While ahead of our expectations across the country, our Southern regions, the Southeast, the Southwest and South Central, did best given the more favorable weather in that part of the country, and the Upper Midwest also had a strong quarter. This should bode well for the second quarter sales in the North as the weather warms up. 
Bloomingdale's had another terrific quarter and continues to do very well versus their peer group. Sales on the Internet were also very strong in the quarter with a 38% increase. We are very happy with how our army omnichannel strategy is evolving at both Macy’s and Bloomingdale's. We believe both the stores and the Internet sales are benefiting from these efforts and investments.
In the first quarter, sales of jewelry and watches, cosmetics, Men's and home were very strong, as were our private and exclusive brands, led by I.N.C. The weaker businesses included Women's traditional and casual apparel, Women's suits and intimate apparel. 
In the quarter, average unit retail was up approximately 1%. Our inventory continues to be in great shape, both in terms of quantity and quality. At the end of April, comp store inventory was up 2.8%, well below our expectation for comp sales in the second quarter. And even though we are controlling our inventory, we are making investments in new businesses like outdoor furniture, expanding successful businesses such as Impulse Beauty and designer fashion watches, as well as funding incremental merchandise receipts to support the fast-growing businesses.
Gross margin in the quarter was 39.1%. While still 30 basis points below last year, it is better than we had expected. As you recall, the key reason for the decline versus last year relates to the growth of Search and Send and overall free shipping on macys.com.
SG&A in the quarter was $1,973,000,000 or 33.5% of sales, which is down 1% in dollars and 230 basis points as a rate versus last year. This is much better than we had expected. Part of this favorability does relate to timing, and therefore, will come back in future quarters but most of the good news is permanent. 
The biggest upside surprise came from credit. The profitability of our Credit business improved by $25 million versus last year in the quarter, which was significantly better than we had expected. The portfolio experienced a big improvement in bad debt. And in addition, the penetration of our proprietary credit card was 46.7%, which is flat with last year and better than we had expected.
Also in the quarter, stock-based compensation expense was lower than expected and was $16 million this year versus $29 million last year. Depreciation and amortization was $19 million below last year as expected, and we benefited in the quarter from the $12 million gain from the sale of our shares in the not. [ph] 
Operating income in the quarter was $330 million, $127 million or 63% higher than last year, and 200 basis points higher as a percent of sales.  Interest expense was $116 million in the quarter, which is $19 million below last year, excluding the cost associated with the debt repurchase. This is obviously due to our reduction in debt over the last year.
Tax expense was $83 million, bringing net income to $131 million in the quarter compared to $23 million last year. Average diluted share count in the quarter was 430 million shares, and as I said earlier, earnings per share was $0.30 in the quarter as compared to $0.05 per share last year, or $0.09 per share excluding the expense associated with the early retirement of debt.
Cash flow was also very strong in the quarter. Cash provided by operating activities was $67 million versus the used last year of $149 million. Net cash used by investing activities was a $64 million, $20 million higher than last year due to the increase in our capital expenditure budget this year. So cash provided by operating activities, net of investing activities, was $196 million higher than last year. 
During the quarter, we've paid down $335 million of debt at maturity and contributed $225 million to the pension plan. We believe this puts our balance sheet in very good shape such that we are able to begin returning cash to the shareholders while still working toward our objective of becoming investment grade at Moody's and at S&P.
Given this crossroad, we thought it would be the right time to discuss the key credit metrics that we are now tracking and our targets for these metrics. As you know, S&P, Moody's and Fitch calculate credit ratios using different definitions. And we've attempted to combine the best of all three in setting our own definitions. 
The details of these calculations are all on our website under Financial Information. But essentially, we're using reported debt, EBITDA and interest expense and making adjustments for leases and for any underfunding of our post-retirement plans.
So we are tracking two key ratios: one, leverage for the adjusted debt to EBITDA; and the other, coverage, adjusted EBITDA to interest. So for 2010, our adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio was 3.0. And on a rolling 4-quarters basis through the first quarter of 2011, this ratio improved to 2.8. Our current target for this ratio is 2.4:2.7. For 2010, our adjusted EBITDA to interest was 5.6. And on a rolling 4-quarters basis through the first quarter of 2011, this ratio improved to 6.0. Our current target is 6.4:6.6.
We expect to achieve or come very close to achieving these targets by the end of 2011. We believe that these targets are consistent with what would be necessary to achieve investment grade, although as you know, there are many other quantitative as well as qualitative factors that go into the rating decisions.
The first quarter was a great one, and we are so pleased that the momentum continues to build. Our organization is completely focused on keeping the sales growth trend going. We are all focusing on better serving our customers, both in-store and online, with great, locally tailored assortments, terrific value and MAGIC Selling.
As you saw in the press release, we increased our guidance for comp store sales growth for the remainder of the year to approximately 4%, which would translate to approximately 4.3% for the full year as compared to our original guidance of 3%.
For the second quarter, we are expecting comp store sales growth of around that 4%. Although I should add that we expect the highest sales growth in the quarter in the month of May, the next highest in the month of June and the lowest in July, given prior year's performance. For earnings per share, we're guiding to $2.40 to $2.45 or up $0.15 from the original guidance, and CapEx is still budgeted at $800 million. 
We are off to another strong start this year, and we have every expectation it will continue. There has been a lot of speculation about how the consumer will react to higher gas prices, price inflation, stagnant housing prices and a myriad of other macroeconomic factors. No one, of course, knows how this will all play out, but we do feel great about our company's ability to continue to outperform the competition no matter the environment.
We have a tremendous amount of ammunition in place. And as I have said repeatedly, the My Macy's culture and structure combined with the omnichannel strategy are making an enormous difference. We couldn't be happier with the progress we've made, and we are all feeling very positive about the potential in front of us.
And with that, I will take your questions."

We feel great about our performance in the first quarter. Our sales growth continued strong, producing a 5.4% comp store sales increase on top of last year's 5.5% increase. As we have said repeatedly, the momentum from our restructuring and the implementation of My Macy's is building and bodes very well for our future. And the profitability of the business increased dramatically in the quarter, with earnings per share more than tripling. 
We reported a earnings per share on a diluted basis of $0.30 versus last year's $0.09 when we exclude the expense related to the early extinguishment of debt. And with the continued confidence in our operating results and our balance sheet now in a stronger position, we've doubled the size of our annual dividend from $0.20 a share to $0.40. This is an important step in returning more value directly to our shareholders.
Let's first talk a bit about the quarter, and then I will discuss the outlook for the remainder of the year. Sales in the first quarter were $5,889,000,000, up 5.7% over last year. While ahead of our expectations across the country, our Southern regions, the Southeast, the Southwest and South Central, did best given the more favorable weather in that part of the country, and the Upper Midwest also had a strong quarter. This should bode well for the second quarter sales in the North as the weather warms up. 
Bloomingdale's had another terrific quarter and continues to do very well versus their peer group. Sales on the Internet were also very strong in the quarter with a 38% increase. We are very happy with how our army omnichannel strategy is evolving at both Macy’s and Bloomingdale's. We believe both the stores and the Internet sales are benefiting from these efforts and investments.
In the first quarter, sales of jewelry and watches, cosmetics, Men's and home were very strong, as were our private and exclusive brands, led by I.N.C. The weaker businesses included Women's traditional and casual apparel, Women's suits and intimate apparel. 
In the quarter, average unit retail was up approximately 1%. Our inventory continues to be in great shape, both in terms of quantity and quality. At the end of April, comp store inventory was up 2.8%, well below our expectation for comp sales in the second quarter. And even though we are controlling our inventory, we are making investments in new businesses like outdoor furniture, expanding successful businesses such as Impulse Beauty and designer fashion watches, as well as funding incremental merchandise receipts to support the fast-growing businesses.
Gross margin in the quarter was 39.1%. While still 30 basis points below last year, it is better than we had expected. As you recall, the key reason for the decline versus last year relates to the growth of Search and Send and overall free shipping on macys.com.
SG&A in the quarter was $1,973,000,000 or 33.5% of sales, which is down 1% in dollars and 230 basis points as a rate versus last year. This is much better than we had expected. Part of this favorability does relate to timing, and therefore, will come back in future quarters but most of the good news is permanent. 
The biggest upside surprise came from credit. The profitability of our Credit business improved by $25 million versus last year in the quarter, which was significantly better than we had expected. The portfolio experienced a big improvement in bad debt. And in addition, the penetration of our proprietary credit card was 46.7%, which is flat with last year and better than we had expected.
Also in the quarter, stock-based compensation expense was lower than expected and was $16 million this year versus $29 million last year. Depreciation and amortization was $19 million below last year as expected, and we benefited in the quarter from the $12 million gain from the sale of our shares in The Knot. 
Operating income in the quarter was $330 million, $127 million or 63% higher than last year, and 200 basis points higher as a percent of sales.  Interest expense was $116 million in the quarter, which is $19 million below last year, excluding the cost associated with the debt repurchase. This is obviously due to our reduction in debt over the last year.
Tax expense was $83 million, bringing net income to $131 million in the quarter compared to $23 million last year. Average diluted share count in the quarter was 430 million shares, and as I said earlier, earnings per share was $0.30 in the quarter as compared to $0.05 per share last year, or $0.09 per share excluding the expense associated with the early retirement of debt.
Cash flow was also very strong in the quarter. Cash provided by operating activities was $67 million versus the use last year of $149 million. Net cash used by investing activities was a $64 million, $20 million higher than last year due to the increase in our capital expenditure budget this year. So cash provided by operating activities, net of investing activities, was $196 million higher than last year. 
During the quarter, we've paid down $335 million of debt at maturity and contributed $225 million to the pension plan. We believe this puts our balance sheet in very good shape such that we are able to begin returning cash to the shareholders while still working toward our objective of becoming investment grade at Moody's and at S&P.
Given this crossroad, we thought it would be the right time to discuss the key credit metrics that we are now tracking and our targets for these metrics. As you know, S&P, Moody's and Fitch calculate credit ratios using different definitions. And we've attempted to combine the best of all three in setting our own definitions. 
The details of these calculations are all on our website under Financial Information. But essentially, we're using reported debt, EBITDA and interest expense and making adjustments for leases and for any underfunding of our post-retirement plans.
So we are tracking two key ratios: one, leverage for the adjusted debt to EBITDA; and the other, coverage, adjusted EBITDA to interest. So for 2010, our adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio was 3.0. And on a rolling 4-quarters basis through the first quarter of 2011, this ratio improved to 2.8. Our current target for this ratio is 2.4:2.7. For 2010, our adjusted EBITDA to interest was 5.6. And on a rolling 4-quarters basis through the first quarter of 2011, this ratio improved to 6.0. Our current target is 6.4:6.6.
We expect to achieve or come very close to achieving these targets by the end of 2011. We believe that these targets are consistent with what would be necessary to achieve investment grade, although as you know, there are many other quantitative as well as qualitative factors that go into the rating decisions.
The first quarter was a great one, and we are so pleased that the momentum continues to build. Our organization is completely focused on keeping the sales growth trend going. We are all focusing on better serving our customers, both in-store and online, with great, locally tailored assortments, terrific value and MAGIC Selling.
As you saw in the press release, we increased our guidance for comp store sales growth for the remainder of the year to approximately 4%, which would translate to approximately 4.3% for the full year as compared to our original guidance of 3%.
For the second quarter, we are expecting comp store sales growth of around that 4%. Although, I should add that we expect the highest sales growth in the quarter in the month of May, the next highest in the month of June and the lowest in July, given prior year's performance. For earnings per share, we're guiding to $2.40 to $2.45 or up $0.15 from the original guidance, and CapEx is still budgeted at $800 million. 
We are off to another strong start this year, and we have every expectation it will continue. There has been a lot of speculation about how the consumer will react to higher gas prices, price inflation, stagnant housing prices and a myriad of other macroeconomic factors. No one, of course, knows how this will all play out, but we do feel great about our company's ability to continue to outperform the competition no matter the environment.
We have a tremendous amount of ammunition in place. And as I have said repeatedly, the My Macy's culture and structure combined with the omnichannel strategy are making an enormous difference. We couldn't be happier with the progress we've made, and we are all feeling very positive about the potential in front of us.
And with that, I will take your questions."

Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.
We feel great about our performance in the first quarter. Our sales growth continued strong, producing a 5.4% comp store sales increase on top of last year's 5.5% increase. As we have said repeatedly, the momentum from our restructuring and the implementation of My Macy's is building and bodes very well for our future. And the profitability of the business increased dramatically in the quarter, with earnings per share more than tripling. 
We reported a earnings per share on a diluted basis of $0.30 versus last year's $0.09 when we exclude the expense related to the early extinguishment of debt. And with the continued confidence in our operating results and our balance sheet now in a stronger position, we've doubled the size of our annual dividend from $0.20 a share to $0.40. This is an important step in returning more value directly to our shareholders.
Let's first talk a bit about the quarter, and then I will discuss the outlook for the remainder of the year. Sales in the first quarter were $5,889,000,000, up 5.7% over last year. While ahead of our expectations across the country, our Southern regions, the Southeast, the Southwest and South Central, did best given the more favorable weather in that part of the country, and the Upper Midwest also had a strong quarter. This should bode well for the second quarter sales in the North as the weather warms up. 
Bloomingdale's had another terrific quarter and continues to do very well versus their peer group. Sales on the Internet were also very strong in the quarter with a 38% increase. We are very happy with how our army omnichannel strategy is evolving at both Macy’s and Bloomingdale's. We believe both the stores and the Internet sales are benefiting from these efforts and investments.
In the first quarter, sales of jewelry and watches, cosmetics, Men's and home were very strong, as were our private and exclusive brands, led by I.N.C. The weaker businesses included Women's traditional and casual apparel, Women's suits and intimate apparel. 
In the quarter, average unit retail was up approximately 1%. Our inventory continues to be in great shape, both in terms of quantity and quality. At the end of April, comp store inventory was up 2.8%, well below our expectation for comp sales in the second quarter. And even though we are controlling our inventory, we are making investments in new businesses like outdoor furniture, expanding successful businesses such as Impulse Beauty and designer fashion watches, as well as funding incremental merchandise receipts to support the fast-growing businesses.
Gross margin in the quarter was 39.1%. While still 30 basis points below last year, it is better than we had expected. As you recall, the key reason for the decline versus last year relates to the growth of Search and Send and overall free shipping on macys.com.
SG&A in the quarter was $1,973,000,000 or 33.5% of sales, which is down 1% in dollars and 230 basis points as a rate versus last year. This is much better than we had expected. Part of this favorability does relate to timing, and therefore, will come back in future quarters but most of the good news is permanent. 
The biggest upside surprise came from credit. The profitability of our Credit business improved by $25 million versus last year in the quarter, which was significantly better than we had expected. The portfolio experienced a big improvement in bad debt. And in addition, the penetration of our proprietary credit card was 46.7%, which is flat with last year and better than we had expected.
Also in the quarter, stock-based compensation expense was lower than expected and was $16 million this year versus $29 million last year. Depreciation and amortization was $19 million below last year as expected, and we benefited in the quarter from the $12 million gain from the sale of our shares in The Knot.  
Operating income in the quarter was $330 million, $127 million or 63% higher than last year, and 200 basis points higher as a percent of sales.  Interest expense was $116 million in the quarter, which is $19 million below last year, excluding the cost associated with the debt repurchase. This is obviously due to our reduction in debt over the last year.
Tax expense was $83 million, bringing net income to $131 million in the quarter compared to $23 million last year. Average diluted share count in the quarter was 430 million shares, and as I said earlier, earnings per share was $0.30 in the quarter as compared to $0.05 per share last year, or $0.09 per share excluding the expense associated with the early retirement of debt.
Cash flow was also very strong in the quarter. Cash provided by operating activities was $67 million versus the use last year of $149 million. Net cash used by investing activities was a $64 million, $20 million higher than last year due to the increase in our capital expenditure budget this year. So cash provided by operating activities, net of investing activities, was $196 million higher than last year. 
During the quarter, we've paid down $335 million of debt at maturity and contributed $225 million to the pension plan. We believe this puts our balance sheet in very good shape such that we are able to begin returning cash to the shareholders while still working toward our objective of becoming investment grade at Moody's and at S&P.
Given this crossroad, we thought it would be the right time to discuss the key credit metrics that we are now tracking and our targets for these metrics. As you know, S&P, Moody's and Fitch calculate credit ratios using different definitions. And we've attempted to combine the best of all three in setting our own definitions. 
The details of these calculations are all on our website under Financial Information. But essentially, we're using reported debt, EBITDA and interest expense and making adjustments for leases and for any underfunding of our post-retirement plans.
So we are tracking two key ratios: one, leverage for the adjusted debt to EBITDA; and the other, coverage, adjusted EBITDA to interest. So for 2010, our adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio was 3.0. And on a rolling 4-quarters basis through the first quarter of 2011, this ratio improved to 2.8. Our current target for this ratio is 2.4:2.7. For 2010, our adjusted EBITDA to interest was 5.6. And on a rolling 4-quarters basis through the first quarter of 2011, this ratio improved to 6.0. Our current target is 6.4:6.6.
We expect to achieve or come very close to achieving these targets by the end of 2011. We believe that these targets are consistent with what would be necessary to achieve investment grade, although as you know, there are many other quantitative as well as qualitative factors that go into the rating decisions.
The first quarter was a great one, and we are so pleased that the momentum continues to build. Our organization is completely focused on keeping the sales growth trend going. We are all focusing on better serving our customers, both in-store and online, with great, locally tailored assortments, terrific value and MAGIC Selling.
As you saw in the press release, we increased our guidance for comp store sales growth for the remainder of the year to approximately 4%, which would translate to approximately 4.3% for the full year as compared to our original guidance of 3%.
For the second quarter, we are expecting comp store sales growth of around that 4%. Although, I should add that we expect the highest sales growth in the quarter in the month of May, the next highest in the month of June and the lowest in July, given prior year's performance. For earnings per share, we're guiding to $2.40 to $2.45 or up $0.15 from the original guidance, and CapEx is still budgeted at $800 million. 
We are off to another strong start this year, and we have every expectation it will continue. There has been a lot of speculation about how the consumer will react to higher gas prices, price inflation, stagnant housing prices and a myriad of other macroeconomic factors. No one, of course, knows how this will all play out, but we do feel great about our company's ability to continue to outperform the competition no matter the environment.
We have a tremendous amount of ammunition in place. And as I have said repeatedly, the My Macy's culture and structure combined with the omnichannel strategy are making an enormous difference. We couldn't be happier with the progress we've made, and we are all feeling very positive about the potential in front of us.
And with that, I will take your questions."

I think that's probably still the right expectation for the year. Remember, as you think about it, first off, depreciation, we had said would be down by about $40 million for the year. So that increment will go down since we got so much of it in the first quarter. By the fourth quarter, depreciation is planned  about flat with the year ago. The stock compensation expense, we hope, becomes not a positive, meaning we're hoping the stock price is doing well because that will be factored into the expense increases. And as you think about things like credit improvement, which you think in terms of dollars, as the expense base growth after the first quarter, as a percentage factor, less significant because the base expenses are higher as you go through the year."

Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. 
You haven't been hearing much positive news about the economy so far this week but I think we, at Macy's, have a very good story to tell about the last 3 months. And our outlook for the remainder of the year reflects the optimism we feel about the direction of the business as well as realism about the macroeconomic environment. As you saw, we produced a 57% increase in earnings per share in the quarter, well ahead of our expectations. The 2 major factors driving the strong performance are first and foremost profitable sales growth and secondarily, the improvement in our credit performance. 
When we started the year, we had expected comp store sales growth of 3% for both the first half and the full year of 2011. Having achieved in excess of a 5% comp store increase in the first half of 2010 and with concerns about the economy, we thought 3% would represent good performance. However, we were able to exceed the 3% expectation by a wide margin and produced a comp store sales gain in the first half of the year of 5.9%. This result also compares very favorably to our peers. Our strategies are clearly working and we continue to believe that our My Macy’s structure and approach to localizing our offering are giving us a significant competitive advantage. 
In addition, our omnichannel strategy and M.A.G.I.C.  Selling program are also helping us to accelerate our sales trend. In the second quarter, we produced sales of $5,939,000,000 or a comp store increase of 6.4%. All Macy's regions exceeded last year and at least achieved plan in the second quarter. 
We are producing our strongest sales trends across the south and in the major tourist areas such as New York City, downtown San Francisco, Miami, Las Vegas, Orlando, Hawaii and Chicago. 
The Bloomingdale's business continues to be very strong as well and compares favorably to our upscale competition. The Internet with our omnichannel strategy is continuing to produce terrific results with a 40% sales increase in the second quarter. The interaction between our stores, the Internet and mobile devices is making it harder and harder to really distinguish between store sales transactions and Internet sales transactions. We are reporting the sales where the customers buy but we know that customers are sometimes shopping in the stores and then going home and ordering online. While other times, the reverse is done. Having multiple channels and focusing on an integrated strategy for all is really important for driving our sales growth and enhancing customer loyalty. 
Our strongest merchandise categories in the second quarter were jewelry, watches, fashion accessories, including handbags and hosiery, cosmetics, fragrances, men's and. Private brand also had a good quarter led by I.N.C. We had 2 very successful private brand launches this spring, Bar III for the millennial customer and Greg Norman for Taso Alba, a new exclusive golf line. We also continue to see strength in exclusive brands such as Tommy Hilfiger and Martha Stewart. The weak categories of merchandise continue to be within the casual traditional feminine apparel and intimate apparel. 
During the second quarter, the average unit retail, or AUR, increased by approximately 4%. Our customers began to feel the impact of increased prices in the second quarter but it is not until the August-September period when we expect the price increases to be more widely experienced. It is important to remember though that some of our AUR increases results from factors other than price inflation. AUR increases occur with mix changes resulting from the healthy sales in our status brands, new, higher price point initiatives like impulse and product initiatives that are geared to fashion versus commodity goods. Also more regular price selling can also result in AUR increases. Combining all of these factors, we are expecting AUR increases in the 5% to 7% range this fall. 
Gross margin in the quarter was 41.8%, down 10 basis points versus last year due to the stronger Internet sales and the free shipping. We ended the quarter with comp store inventory, up approximately 3%, which we feel positions us well for the back half of the year. 
SG&A in the second quarter was $1,976,000,000 or 33.3% of sales. This is up in dollars 1.2% over last year but down 190 basis points as a rate to sales versus a year ago. This is better than expected due primarily to the continued good news on the strength of our credit portfolio. 
In the quarter, credit produced approximately $57 million more income than last year. We had expected improvement but not this much. As in the first quarter, the portfolio experienced the big improvement in delinquencies and losses. Proprietary penetration or use of our proprietary card was essentially flat during the quarter versus last year at 46.8%, which is also better than we expected. Offsetting this benefit from credit as well as the $20 million reduction in depreciation and amortization was 3 main factors. One, an investment in selling expense to drive our sales growth; two, investment in our omnichannel strategy including the cost associated with our store-to-door strategy; and three, stock-based compensation, which increased $18 million over last year in the second quarter. 
Operating income in the quarter was $506 million, up 37% over last year. And as a percent of sales, operating income was 8.5%, up 180 basis points over a year ago. Interest expense was $111 million, down $19 million from last year. Tax expense was $154 million, leaving net income of $241 million. 
Average diluted share count was 434 million shares and earnings per share was $0.55 per share, up 57% over last year's $ 0.55 per share. Net cash provided by operations was $587 million, up just short of $300 million over a year ago. As you saw, net income was up $202 million explaining much of the variance. In addition, we made $100 million lower pension contribution this year as compared to last year. These were offset in part by inventory, which was $172 million unfavorable to a year ago, offset though by $109 million of higher payables. So the net additional use of cash for inventory was $63 million. 
You heard me refer to inventory net of payables. I did this because we executed the strategy this year to have new merchandise arrive in stores across the country closer to the same day than what happened previously. This was actually one of the changes we made in response to a My Macy's sales getting opportunity that the new team identified. The result of this though is a large increase in in-transit of inventory at the end of the month as our receipt flow during the course of the month becomes more concentrated in the first week. In-transit, as you know, is completely offset in payables so there's no impact on cash flow. 
And at the end of the second quarter, inventory was up 6.8%. But net of merchandise payables, it was up 3.5%, just slightly above the comp store inventory increase. The key here though is that factoring out variations and ship dates. We will continue to maintain comp store inventory growth at a level lower than comp store sales growth. 
Net cash used by investing activities was $222 million in the first half of the year, approximately $100 million more than last year due to the planned increase in CapEx, which includes purchase of property and equipment as well as capitalized software. We utilized less cash for financing activities this year largely due to the fact that we repaid to $247 million less debt this year. So we've ended up generating $31 million of cash in the first half of the year as compared to the use last year of $478 million. And because of our strong performance, we were able to achieve the target credit ratios that we laid out for you at the end of the first quarter. The calculations are detailed on the website. But as you recall, we had set targets for debt to EBITDA of 2.4:2.7 and for the rolling fourth quarters ending in July, we've achieved 2.7. And our adjusted EBITDA to interest is 6.4 for the rolling 4 quarters versus our target of 6.4:6.6. This is earlier than we had anticipated and now opens the door for us to consider the possibility of buying back stock this fall. However, there will not be any significant buyback until after the holiday season, which as you know, is when we generate significant cash flow. 
We remain very focused on keeping our ratios within the target range and being an investment-grade company. As we look to the fall season, we are cognizant of the less-than-ideal economic backdrop as well as the price increases coming in some parts of our business. Having said that, we have great momentum with so many merchandise categories performing well. And our initial experiences with price increases that have proven to be generally consistent with our expectations in terms of unit sales. 
We are assuming comp store sales for the fall season of 4% to 4.5% versus our original guidance of 3% and most recent guidance of 4%. This, combined with the spring actual results, would result in an annual increase of 4.8% to 5.1%. We are expecting annual earnings per share of approximately $2.60 to $2.65 for the full year or for the fall season, $1.74 to $1.79. This guidance excludes any benefit of any potential stock repurchase. But as I stated earlier, we would not expect the impact to be significant this fall. Also, as in prior years, we could close few stores at the end of the year and the costs associated with these which would be primarily noncash are also not included in this guidance. 
Let me make a few additional comments that I think will relate to the fall guidance to help you as you develop your expectations for us for the back half of the year. One, comp store sales are assumed to grow by about the same percent in each of the third and the fourth quarters. In the third quarter, we are expecting to generate our biggest sales increased during the month of August with lower growth expected in September and then in October. Two, we are expecting our gross margin rate to be down slightly in the fall season particularly in the third quarter. This is due primarily to the impact of free shipping on the Internet and the growth in that business. Because we offered free ship during so much of the fourth quarter last year, the impact on gross margin this year relative to last year will be less during the fourth quarter. Three, while the increase in the comp store inventory is expected to continue to be below that of our sales growth, at the end of October and the end of January, the reported inventory will show a bigger increase. As discussed before, this is because of the change in how we are writing our orders regarding the ship date. 
We also decided to accelerate some merchandise orders from the first week of November into the last week of October. We did this to ensure that the stores can absorb the merchandise received. This shift compounds the in-transit increase and leads to an even larger expected increase in inventory at the end of the third quarter. And we're still working on the shift and the estimate for inventory at the end of the third quarter. But at this point, we would estimate it that the reported inventory could be up as much as 10% to 12% at that one point in time. Obviously, at the end of January, where there won't be any receipt shift, the impact would be much less. Four, x the SG&A. We are assuming a continued improvement in SG&A as a percent of sales in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter as we leverage the sales growth. SG&A dollars are expected to increase versus last year by a higher percentage in the fall season than experienced in the second quarter and by an even higher percentage in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. We are expecting the improved credit income to continue into the fall season. However, this benefit is expected to be offset by many items, most of which though relate to driving the comp store sales growth. For example, the ongoing investment in the omnichannel strategy, including the store-to-door fulfillment strategy is adding costs. And we are making an investment in our stores for the holiday period to support our M.A.G.I.C. selling efforts. We are also funding resources during that very high traffic time of year to help our stores better recover after big days. Five, we are expecting depreciation and amortization to be approximately $565 million this fall and interest expense to be approximately $215 million. Six, our tax rate is still expected to be 37% for the full year even though it was approximately 39% during the first half of the year. We are expecting some state tax settlement for audits, which will result in a much lower tax rate in the quarter when they occur, which at this point, we think most likely will be in the third quarter. And seven and lastly, we are still expecting CapEx for the year to be approximately $800 million. 
We remain cautious but optimistic about this fall. We can't ignore all that is going on in the world this week but we also can't ignore the momentum we have nor the confidence we have in our strategies. We are staying focused on what we can control. Our team is working hard to maximize the opportunities from our 3 key strategies: one, My Macy's; two, omnichannel strategy; and three, M.A.G.I.C.  Selling. 
As we have said before, we continue to be in the early innings of the implementation of each of these strategies. And frankly, the more we learn and the more positive results we see from each, the more additional benefits we can envision. At a management meeting last week for our top 60 people or so, the mood was as optimistic as I've ever seen it. And while we are all very pleased with our results, we all know just how much more potential we have. The good news is that our success to date has been balanced between Macy's and Bloomingdale's, between the stores and online, across all regions of the country and across families of business. 
Even with the new discussion about the economy and the headwinds we all face, we have a broad range of assets to keep our business moving forward. And with that, I will take whatever questions you may have."

Around this time a year ago, we rolled out something that we call surgeon sent, which is if you are in a store and we don't have what you want in stock, the sales associate can very easily order it for the customers from the online inventory. During the fourth quarter last year, we tested in a couple of stores on the West Coast the ability through the same Search and Send but have inventory pulled not only from the central warehouses supporting the Internet business but also from these 2 store location. i.e. store to door. And we found that by doing that, we were more likely to be in-stock when the sales associates search for an item and therefore, satisfy more demand. And so we've now got that in 23 locations and it will be over 150 locations by this time a year from now. And we are -- so now, throughout the company, you're able to go to a Macy's store and have the associates search the inventory invisible to the sales associate but we'll pull is from stores in addition to the Internet warehouse. And this is all a part of trying to be able to better satisfy customer demand and also over time make our inventory investment far more productive. It's really quite exciting."

Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. 
You haven't been hearing much positive news about the economy so far this week, but I think we at Macy's have a very good story to tell about the last 3 months. And our outlook for the remainder of the year reflects the optimism we feel about the direction of the business as well as realism about the macroeconomic environment. As you saw, we produced a 57% increase in earnings per share in the quarter, well ahead of our expectations. The 2 major factors driving this strong performance are first and foremost profitable sales growth; and secondarily, the improvement in our credit performance. 
When we started the year, we had expected comp store sales growth of 3% for both the first half and the full year of 2011. Having achieved in excess of a 5% comp store increase in the first half of 2010 and with concerns about the economy, we thought 3% would represent good performance. However, we were able to exceed the 3% expectation by a wide margin and produced a comp store sales gain in the first half of the year of 5.9%. This result also compares very favorably to our peers. Our strategies are clearly working, and we continue to believe that our My Macy’s structure and approach to localizing our offering are giving us a significant competitive advantage. 
In addition, our omnichannel strategy and MAGIC  Selling program are also helping us to accelerate our sales trends. In the second quarter, we produced sales of $5,939,000,000 or a comp store increase of 6.4%. All Macy's regions exceeded last year and at least achieved plan in the second quarter. We are producing our strongest sales trends across the south and in the major tourist areas such as New York City, downtown San Francisco, Miami, Las Vegas, Orlando, Hawaii and Chicago. 
The Bloomingdale's business continues to be very strong as well and compares favorably to our upscale competition. The Internet with our omnichannel strategy is continuing to produce terrific results with a 40% sales increase in the second quarter. The interaction between our stores, the Internet and mobile devices is making it harder and harder to really distinguish between store sales transactions and Internet sales transactions. We are reporting the sales where the customers buy but we know that customers are sometimes shopping in the stores and then going home and ordering online, while other times, the reverse is done. Having multiple channels and focusing on an integrated strategy for all is really important for driving our sales growth and enhancing customer loyalty. 
Our strongest merchandise categories in the second quarter were jewelry; watches; fashion accessories, including handbags and hosiery; cosmetics, fragrances; men's; and home. Private brand also had a good quarter led by I.N.C. We had 2 very successful private brand launches this spring, Bar III for the millennial customer; and Greg Norman for Tasso Elba, a new exclusive golf line. We also continued to see strength in exclusive brands such as Tommy Hilfiger and Martha Stewart. The weak categories of merchandise continue to be within the casual traditional feminine apparel and intimate apparel. 
During the second quarter, the average unit retail, or AUR, increased by approximately 4%. Our customers began to feel the impact of increased prices in the second quarter, but it is not until the August-September period when we expect the price increases to be more widely experienced. It is important to remember though that some of our AUR increases result from factors other than price inflation. AUR increases occur with mix changes, resulting from the healthy sales in our status brands, new higher price point initiatives like impulse and product initiatives that are geared to fashion versus commodity goods. Also, more regular price selling can also result in AUR increases. Combining all of these factors, we are expecting AUR increases in the 5% to 7% range this fall. 
Gross margin in the quarter was 41.8%, down 10 basis points versus last year due to the stronger Internet sales and the free shipping. We ended the quarter with comp store inventory up approximately 3%, which we feel positions us well for the back half of the year. 
SG&A in the second quarter was $1,976,000,000 or 33.3% of sales. This is up in dollars 1.2% over last year but down 190 basis points as a rate to sales versus a year ago. This is better than expected due primarily to the continued good news on the strength of our credit portfolio. 
In the quarter, credit produced approximately $57 million more income than last year. We had expected improvement but not this much. As in the first quarter, the portfolio experienced the big improvement in delinquencies and losses. Proprietary penetration or use of our proprietary card was essentially flat during the quarter versus last year at 46.8%, which is also better than we expected. 
Offsetting this benefit from credit, as well as the $20 million reduction in depreciation and amortization, was 3 main factors: one, an investment in selling expense to drive our sales growth; two, investment in our omnichannel strategy, including the costs associated with our store-to-door strategy; and three, stock-based compensation, which increased $18 million over last year in the second quarter. 
Operating income in the quarter was $506 million, up 37% over last year. And as a percent of sales, operating income was 8.5%, up 180 basis points over a year ago. Interest expense was $111 million, down $19 million from last year. Tax expense was $154 million, leaving net income of $241 million. 
Average diluted share count was 434.6 million shares and earnings per share was $0.55 per share, up 57% over last year's $ 0.35 per share. Net cash provided by operations was $587 million, up just short of $300 million over a year ago. As you saw, net income was up $202 million explaining much of the variance. In addition, we made $100 million lower pension contribution this year as compared to last year. These were offset in part by inventory, which was $172 million unfavorable to a year ago, offset though by $109 million of higher payables. So the net additional use of cash for inventory was $63 million. 
You heard me refer to inventory net of payables. I did this because we executed the strategy this year to have new merchandise arrive in stores across the country closer to the same day than what happened previously. This was actually one of the changes we made in response to a My Macy's sales getting opportunity that the new team identified. The result of this though is a large increase in in-transit of inventory at the end of the month as our receipt flow during the course of a month becomes more concentrated in the first week. 
In-transit, as you know, is completely offset in payables so there's no impact on cash flow. And at the end of the second quarter, inventory was up 6.8% but net of merchandise payables, it was up 3.5%, just slightly above the comp store inventory increase. The key here though is that factoring out variations and ship dates, we will continue to maintain comp store inventory growth at a level lower than comp store sales growth. 
Net cash used by investing activities was $222 million in the first half of the year, approximately $100 million more than last year due to the planned increase in CapEx, which includes purchase of property and equipment as well as capitalized software. We utilized less cash for financing activities this year, largely due to the fact that we repaid $247 million less debt this year. So we've ended up generating $31 million of cash in the first half of the year as compared to the use last year of $478 million. And because of our strong performance, we were able to achieve the target credit ratios that we laid out for you at the end of the first quarter. 
The calculations are detailed on the website. But as you recall, we had set targets for debt to EBITDA of 2.4 to 2.7. And for the rolling 4 quarters ending in July, we've achieved 2.7. And our adjusted EBITDA to interest is 6.4 for the rolling 4 quarters versus our target of 6.4 to 6.6. This is earlier than we had anticipated and now opens the door for us to consider the possibility of buying back stock this fall. However, there will not be any significant buyback until after the holiday season, which, as you know, is when we generate significant cash flow. We remain very focused on keeping our ratios within the target range and being an investment-grade company. 
As we look to the fall season, we are cognizant of the less-than-ideal economic backdrop, as well as the price increases coming in some parts of our business. Having said that, we have great momentum with so many merchandise categories performing well. And our initial experiences with price increases have proven to be generally consistent with our expectations in terms of unit sales. 
We are assuming comp store sales for the fall season of 4% to 4.5% versus our original guidance of 3% and most recent guidance of 4%. This, combined with the spring actual results, would result in an annual increase of 4.8% to 5.1%. We are expecting annual earnings per share of approximately $2.60 to $2.65 for the full year or for the fall season, $1.74 to $1.79. This guidance excludes any benefit of any potential stock repurchased. But as I stated earlier, we would not expect the impact to be significant this fall. Also, as in prior years, we could close a few stores at the end of the year and the costs associated with these, which would be primarily noncash, are also not included in this guidance. 
Let me make a few additional comments that I think will relate to the fall guidance to help you as you develop your expectations for us for the back half of the year. One, comp store sales are assumed to grow by about the same percent in each of the third and the fourth quarters. In the third quarter, we are expecting to generate our biggest sales increased during the month of August, with lower growth expected in September and then in October. 
Two, we are expecting our gross margin rate to be down slightly in the fall season, particularly in the third quarter. This is due primarily to the impact of free shipping on the Internet and the growth in that business. Because we offered free ship during so much of the fourth quarter last year, the impact on gross margin this year relative to last year will be less during the fourth quarter. 
Three, while the increase in the comp store inventory is expected to continue to be below that of our sales growth, at the end of October and the end of January, the reported inventory will show a bigger increase. As discussed before, this is because of the change in how we're writing our orders regarding the ship date. We also decided to accelerate some merchandise orders from the first week of November into the last week of October. We did this to ensure that the stores can absorb the merchandise received. This shift compounds the in-transit increase and leads to an even larger expected increase in inventory at the end of the third quarter. And we're still working on the shift and the estimate for inventory at the end of the third quarter. But at this point, we would estimate it that the reported inventory could be up as much as 10% to 12% at that one point in time. Obviously, at the end of January, where there won't be any receipt shift, the impact would be much less. 
Four, S to SG&A. We are assuming a continued improvement in SG&A as a percent of sales in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter as we leverage the sales growth. SG&A dollars are expected to increase versus last year by a higher percentage in the fall season than experienced in the second quarter and by an even higher percentage in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. We are expecting the improved credit income to continue into the fall season. However, this benefit is expected to be offset by many items, most of which though relate to driving the comp store sales growth. For example, the ongoing investment in the omnichannel strategy, including the store-to-door fulfillment strategy, is adding costs. And we are making an investment in our stores for the holiday period to support our MAGIC selling efforts. We are also funding resources during that very high traffic time of year to help our stores better recover after big days. 
Five, we are expecting depreciation and amortization to be approximately $565 million this fall and interest expense to be approximately $215 million. 
Six, our tax rate is still expected to be 37% for the full year even though it was approximately 39% during the first half of the year. We are expecting some state tax settlement for audits, which will result in a much lower tax rate in the quarter when they occur, which, at this point, we think most likely will be in the third quarter. 
And seven and lastly, we are still expecting CapEx for the year to be approximately $800 million. 
We remain cautious but optimistic about this fall. We can't ignore all that is going on in the world this week, but we also can't ignore the momentum we have nor the confidence we have in our strategies. We are staying focused on what we can control. Our team is working hard to maximize the opportunities from our 3 key strategies: one, My Macy's; two, omnichannel strategy; and three, MAGIC Selling. 
As we have said before, we continue to be in the early innings of the implementation of each of these strategies. And frankly, the more we learn and the more positive results we see from each, the more additional benefits we can envision. At a management meeting last week for our top 60 people or so, the mood was as optimistic as I've ever seen it. And while we are all very pleased with our results, we all know just how much more potential we have. 
The good news is that our success to date has been balanced between Macy's and Bloomingdale's, between the stores and online, across all regions of the country and across families of business. Even with the new discussion about the economy and the headwinds we all face, we have a broad range of assets to keep our business moving forward. 
And with that, I will take whatever questions you may have."

Around this time a year ago, we rolled out something that we call Search and Send, which is if you're in a store and we don't have what you want in stock, the sales associate can very easily order it for the customers from the online inventory. During the fourth quarter last year, we tested in a couple of stores on the West Coast the ability through the same Search and Send but have inventory pulled not only from the central warehouses supporting the Internet business but also from these 2 store location, i.e. store-to-door. And we found that by doing that, we were more likely to be in-stock when the sales associate searched for an item and, therefore, satisfy more demand. And so we've now got that in 23 locations, and it will be over 150 locations by this time a year from now. And we are -- so now throughout the company, you're able to go to a Macy's store and have the associate search the inventory invisible to the sales associate but will pull it from stores in addition to the Internet warehouse. And this is all a part of trying to be able to better satisfy customer demand and also, over time, make our inventory investment far more productive. It's really quite exciting."

Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. 
You haven't been hearing much positive news about the economy so far this week, but I think we at Macy's have a very good story to tell about the last 3 months. And our outlook for the remainder of the year reflects the optimism we feel about the direction of the business as well as realism about the macroeconomic environment. As you saw, we produced a 57% increase in earnings per share in the quarter, well ahead of our expectations. The 2 major factors driving this strong performance are first and foremost profitable sales growth; and secondarily, the improvement in our credit performance. 
When we started the year, we had expected comp store sales growth of 3% for both the first half and the full year of 2011. Having achieved in excess of a 5% comp store increase in the first half of 2010 and with concerns about the economy, we thought 3% would represent good performance. However, we were able to exceed the 3% expectation by a wide margin and produced a comp store sales gain in the first half of the year of 5.9%. This result also compares very favorably to our peers. Our strategies are clearly working, and we continue to believe that our My Macy’s structure and approach to localizing our offering are giving us a significant competitive advantage. 
In addition, our omnichannel strategy and MAGIC  Selling program are also helping us to accelerate our sales trends. In the second quarter, we produced sales of $5,939,000,000 or a comp store increase of 6.4%. All Macy's regions exceeded last year and at least achieved plan in the second quarter. We are producing our strongest sales trends across the south and in the major tourist areas such as New York City, downtown San Francisco, Miami, Las Vegas, Orlando, Hawaii and Chicago. 
The Bloomingdale's business continues to be very strong as well and compares favorably to our upscale competition. The Internet with our omnichannel strategy is continuing to produce terrific results with a 40% sales increase in the second quarter. The interaction between our stores, the Internet and mobile devices is making it harder and harder to really distinguish between store sales transactions and Internet sales transactions. We are reporting the sales where the customers buy but we know that customers are sometimes shopping in the stores and then going home and ordering online, while other times, the reverse is done. Having multiple channels and focusing on an integrated strategy for all is really important for driving our sales growth and enhancing customer loyalty. 
Our strongest merchandise categories in the second quarter were jewelry; watches; fashion accessories, including handbags and hosiery; cosmetics, fragrances; men's; and home. Private brand also had a good quarter led by I.N.C. We had 2 very successful private brand launches this spring, Bar III for the millennial customer; and Greg Norman for Tasso Elba, a new exclusive golf line. We also continued to see strength in exclusive brands such as Tommy Hilfiger and Martha Stewart. The weak categories of merchandise continue to be within the casual traditional feminine apparel and intimate apparel. 
During the second quarter, the average unit retail, or AUR, increased by approximately 4%. Our customers began to feel the impact of increased prices in the second quarter, but it is not until the August-September period when we expect the price increases to be more widely experienced. It is important to remember though that some of our AUR increases result from factors other than price inflation. AUR increases occur with mix changes, resulting from the healthy sales in our status brands, new higher price point initiatives like Impulse and product initiatives that are geared to fashion versus commodity goods. Also, more regular price selling can also result in AUR increases. Combining all of these factors, we are expecting AUR increases in the 5% to 7% range this fall. 
Gross margin in the quarter was 41.8%, down 10 basis points versus last year due to the stronger Internet sales and the free shipping. We ended the quarter with comp store inventory up approximately 3%, which we feel positions us well for the back half of the year. 
SG&A in the second quarter was $1,976,000,000 or 33.3% of sales. This is up in dollars 1.2% over last year but down 190 basis points as a rate to sales versus a year ago. This is better than expected due primarily to the continued good news on the strength of our credit portfolio. 
In the quarter, credit produced approximately $57 million more income than last year. We had expected improvement but not this much. As in the first quarter, the portfolio experienced the big improvement in delinquencies and losses. Proprietary penetration or use of our proprietary card was essentially flat during the quarter versus last year at 46.8%, which is also better than we expected. 
Offsetting this benefit from credit, as well as the $20 million reduction in depreciation and amortization, was 3 main factors: one, an investment in selling expense to drive our sales growth; two, investment in our omnichannel strategy, including the costs associated with our store-to-door strategy; and three, stock-based compensation, which increased $18 million over last year in the second quarter. 
Operating income in the quarter was $506 million, up 37% over last year. And as a percent of sales, operating income was 8.5%, up 180 basis points over a year ago. Interest expense was $111 million, down $19 million from last year. Tax expense was $154 million, leaving net income of $241 million. 
Average diluted share count was 434.6 million shares and earnings per share was $0.55 per share, up 57% over last year's $0.35 per share. Net cash provided by operations was $587 million, up just short of $300 million over a year ago. As you saw, net income was up $202 million explaining much of the variance. In addition, we made $100 million lower pension contribution this year as compared to last year. These were offset in part by inventory, which was $172 million unfavorable to a year ago, offset though by $109 million of higher payables. So the net additional use of cash for inventory was $63 million. 
You heard me refer to inventory net of payables. I did this because we executed a strategy this year to have new merchandise arrive in stores across the country closer to the same day than what happened previously. This was actually one of the changes we made in response to a My Macy's sales getting opportunity that the new team identified. The result of this though is a large increase in in-transit inventory at the end of the month as our receipt flow during the course of a month becomes more concentrated in the first week. 
In-transit, as you know, is completely offset in payables so there's no impact on cash flow. And at the end of the second quarter, inventory was up 6.8% but net of merchandise payables, it was up 3.5%, just slightly above the comp store inventory increase. The key here though is that factoring out variations and ship dates, we will continue to maintain comp store inventory growth at a level lower than comp store sales growth. 
Net cash used by investing activities was $222 million in the first half of the year, approximately $100 million more than last year due to the planned increase in CapEx, which includes purchase of property and equipment as well as capitalized software. We utilized less cash for financing activities this year, largely due to the fact that we repaid $247 million less debt this year. So we've ended up generating $31 million of cash in the first half of the year as compared to the use last year of $478 million. And because of our strong performance, we were able to achieve the target credit ratios that we laid out for you at the end of the first quarter. 
The calculations are detailed on the website. But as you recall, we had set targets for debt to EBITDA of 2.4 to 2.7. And for the rolling 4 quarters ending in July, we've achieved 2.7. And our adjusted EBITDA to interest is 6.4 for the rolling 4 quarters versus our target of 6.4 to 6.6. This is earlier than we had anticipated and now opens the door for us to consider the possibility of buying back stock this fall. However, there will not be any significant buyback until after the holiday season, which, as you know, is when we generate significant cash flow. We remain very focused on keeping our ratios within the target range and being an investment-grade company. 
As we look to the fall season, we are cognizant of the less-than-ideal economic backdrop, as well as the price increases coming in some parts of our business. Having said that, we have great momentum with so many merchandise categories performing well. And our initial experiences with price increases have proven to be generally consistent with our expectations in terms of unit sales. 
We are assuming comp store sales for the fall season of 4% to 4.5% versus our original guidance of 3% and most recent guidance of 4%. This, combined with the spring actual results, would result in an annual increase of 4.8% to 5.1%. We are expecting annual earnings per share of approximately $2.60 to $2.65 for the full year or for the fall season, $1.74 to $1.79. This guidance excludes any benefit of any potential stock repurchased. But as I stated earlier, we would not expect the impact to be significant this fall. Also, as in prior years, we could close a few stores at the end of the year and the costs associated with these, which would be primarily noncash, are also not included in this guidance. 
Let me make a few additional comments that I think will relate to the fall guidance to help you as you develop your expectations for us for the back half of the year. One, comp store sales are assumed to grow by about the same percent in each of the third and the fourth quarters. In the third quarter, we are expecting to generate our biggest sales increased during the month of August, with lower growth expected in September and then in October. 
Two, we are expecting our gross margin rate to be down slightly in the fall season, particularly in the third quarter. This is due primarily to the impact of free shipping on the Internet and the growth in that business. Because we offered free ship during so much of the fourth quarter last year, the impact on gross margin this year relative to last year will be less during the fourth quarter. 
Three, while the increase in the comp store inventory is expected to continue to be below that of our sales growth, at the end of October and the end of January, the reported inventory will show a bigger increase. As discussed before, this is because of the change in how we're writing our orders regarding the ship date. We also decided to accelerate some merchandise orders from the first week of November into the last week of October. We did this to ensure that the stores can absorb the merchandise received. This shift compounds the in-transit increase and leads to an even larger expected increase in inventory at the end of the third quarter. And we're still working on the shift and the estimate for inventory at the end of the third quarter. But at this point, we would estimate it that the reported inventory could be up as much as 10% to 12% at that one point in time. Obviously, at the end of January, where there won't be any receipt shift, the impact would be much less. 
Four, S to SG&A. We are assuming a continued improvement in SG&A as a percent of sales in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter as we leverage the sales growth. SG&A dollars are expected to increase versus last year by a higher percentage in the fall season than experienced in the second quarter and by an even higher percentage in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. We are expecting the improved credit income to continue into the fall season. However, this benefit is expected to be offset by many items, most of which though relate to driving the comp store sales growth. For example, the ongoing investment in the omnichannel strategy, including the store-to-door fulfillment strategy, is adding costs. And we are making an investment in our stores for the holiday period to support our MAGIC selling efforts. We are also funding resources during that very high traffic time of year to help our stores better recover after big days. 
Five, we are expecting depreciation and amortization to be approximately $565 million this fall and interest expense to be approximately $215 million. 
Six, our tax rate is still expected to be 37% for the full year even though it was approximately 39% during the first half of the year. We are expecting some state tax settlements for audits, which will result in a much lower tax rate in the quarter when they occur, which, at this point, we think most likely will be in the third quarter. 
And seven and lastly, we are still expecting CapEx for the year to be approximately $800 million. 
We remain cautious but optimistic about this fall. We can't ignore all that is going on in the world this week, but we also can't ignore the momentum we have nor the confidence we have in our strategies. We are staying focused on what we can control. Our team is working hard to maximize the opportunities from our 3 key strategies: one, My Macy's; two, omnichannel strategy; and three, MAGIC Selling. 
As we have said before, we continue to be in the early innings of the implementation of each of these strategies. And frankly, the more we learn and the more positive results we see from each, the more additional benefits we can envision. At a management meeting last week for our top 60 people or so, the mood was as optimistic as I've ever seen it. And while we are all very pleased with our results, we all know just how much more potential we have. 
The good news is that our success to date has been balanced between Macy's and Bloomingdale's, between the stores and online, across all regions of the country and across families of business. Even with the new discussion about the economy and the headwinds we all face, we have a broad range of assets to keep our business moving forward. 
And with that, I will take whatever questions you may have."

Around this time a year ago, we rolled out something that we call Search and Send, which is if you're in a store and we don't have what you want in stock, the sales associate can very easily order it for the customers from the online inventory. During the fourth quarter last year, we tested in a couple of stores on the West Coast the ability through the same Search and Send but have inventory pulled not only from the central warehouses supporting the Internet business but also from these 2 store location, i.e. store-to-door. And we found that by doing that, we were more likely to be in-stock when the sales associate searched for an item and, therefore, satisfy more demand. And so we've now got that in 23 locations, and it will be over 150 locations by this time a year from now. And we are -- so now throughout the company, you're able to go to a Macy's store and have the associate search the inventory invisible to the sales associate but will pull it from stores in addition to the Internet warehouse. And this is all a part of trying to be able to better satisfy customer demand and also, over time, make our inventory investment far more productive. It's really quite exciting."

Good morning, and welcome to Macy's Calls scheduled to discuss our third quarter earnings with some of our key assumptions for the fourth quarter. I am Karen Hoguet, CFO of the company. 
Let me start by first apologizing for the confusion this morning over the brackets that have mysteriously appeared on our cash flow statement. A business wire is responsible for the problem and frankly, we still haven't figured out quite how it happened, note that a corrected release is now posted on the wire.

Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.
We are very pleased with our performance in the third quarter. We achieved a 4% comp store gain on top of our 3.9% increase last year. Not only does this represent continued strong absolute performance, but it also compares very favorably to our key competitors. 
We achieved a 64% increase in operating income in the quarter and a 190 basis point improvement in operating income as a percent of sales. Earnings per share were significantly above last year and cash flow generation continued strong. And we feel very prepared for the fourth quarter. 
So I will discuss some of the factors behind this performance, as well as our outlook for the fourth quarter and then as always, we'll open the call for your questions.
Sales in the third quarter were $5,853,000,000, up 4.1% over last year. On comp store basis, sales in the quarter were up 4%, the lower end of our 4% to 4.5% guidance. Our sales exceeded our expectations in August and September, but in October, as you know our sales fell a little short. This can largely be explained by weakness in cold weather merchandise by coates, sweaters and hats gloves and of course, the snow in the North East on that last Saturday of October, obviously hurt us as well. 
We saw the business improved when the weather got colder so we remain optimistic for the fourth quarter. Importantly, we continue to see sales growth at both Macy's and Bloomingdale's in both from stores and online. The fourth quarter merchandising and marketing strategies are terrific and should enable us to achieve our 4% to 4.5% comp store sales growth guidance.
During the third quarter, our Internet businesses continued to perform very well, up 40% over last year. The growth of our omnichannel business is one of the key initiatives driving our success. We believe that the Internet and mobile sites are not only generating great results on their own, but they're also helping us to drive sales into the stores. 
In the third quarter, our strongest geographic region was the Southeast, followed by the Southcentral and Southwest. In addition, poor stores in other regions like Herald Square in New York, State 3 in Water, Chicago, as well as San Francisco did very well. 
Bloomingdale's also had a great third quarter although they too were hurt in October by the warm weather and the snowstorm. 
Our family of business are stronger performances where in men's, cosmetics, handbags and watches. And our weakest sales trends continued in Junior's and casual traditional in Women's apparel. Our home store sales in total were good although not as strong as center core in men's. Within Home, our strongest businesses were textile, furniture and luggage.
In the third quarter, the average unit retail was up 5% with transactions up approximately 1% and units per transaction down approximately 2%, which means the units were down about 1%. 
As you recall, we had expected average unit retail to increase 5% to 7% this fall, with fewer units being sold and we still believe that to be the case. 
At the end of the quarter, inventory in the balance sheet was up 9.6% at the lower end of the 10% to 12% expected range that I had given you during the second quarter earnings call. Remember that we accelerated receipts into October from the 1st week of November, to facilitate the processing of this inventory at our stores. 
And we also accelerated receipts into the first week of all months as we discussed at the end of the second quarter, which increases in transit. That is why though when you look at inventory net of payables, which also adjusts includes the in transit, our inventory net of payables was up only 6%, and excluding both the accelerated receipts and the higher end transit, comp stores would have been up by approximately the same amount as the expected fourth quarter  sales. 
Our stores are more set than ever for the holiday selling and we hope that, that pays off. Remember though that the higher in transit will continue to be a factor at year end and at this point, we expect to end the year with balance sheet inventory up 6% to 7%, the comp store inventory up less than half of that amount.
Gross margin in the third quarter was 39.4%, 60 basis points below last year, which is about what we had expected. This reduction is due to the introduction of free shipping at macys.com and the enormous growth of that business as well as Search and Send from our stores. The merchandise margin was flattish in the third quarter.
SG&A in the quarter was $2,018,000,000 or 2.5% below last year. And as a percent of sales, SG&A was 34.4% or 250 basis points below last year. This is better than we had expected, primarily due to the improved performance of our credit portfolio and to approximately $15 million of timing shifts, primarily in marketing, visual and selling expense from the third quarter in to the fourth quarter. 
Our Credit business generated $108 million more income in the third quarter this year than last year. We had expected improvement as we discussed at the end of the second quarter, but not this much. This relates primarily to significantly lower write-offs. The portfolio has improved faster than we had expected and balances are remaining current are only moving into early ages and not going to write-offs. This is very good news. And we are estimating that the profitability of our credit business this year will actually be higher than that in 2007.
Penetration of our proprietary cards in the third quarter was 48.8%, down 50 basis points from last year. This is due in part to the strength of our 2 stores and in part to a reduction in new accounts. The approval rate of new accounts has declined as we expected because of more stringent ability to pay standards.
Our SG&A would've been pretty much as we expected in total without the great credit performance and the timing shift I just talked about. 
Operating income in the quarter was $291 million, 64% above last year, and 190 basis points as a percent of sales. Interest expense was $108 million in the quarter, down from last year's $164 million. 
Last year, however, did include $39 million related to the early retirement of debt. Without that, last year's interest expense would've been a $125 million. So on that basis, this year our interest expense was $17 million lower. 
Our tax rate in the quarter was 24%. As discussed during the second quarter earnings call, we expected favorable tax settlement in the back half of the year. We had discussed this in August and said at that time they were likely to book in the third quarter, which is in fact what happened. Unfortunately, tax settlements are very hard to predict on a quarterly basis. These settlements were assumed, however, in our guidance of the approximately 37% tax rate for the full year.
Net income in the third quarter was $139 million, average diluted share count was 431.8 million shares for the quarter. 
During the quarter, we bought back 8.2 million shares of stock for approximately $221 million. Earnings per share in the diluted basis in the third quarter was $0.32 versus $0.02 last year or $0.08 per share excluding the comps associated with the debt retirement. Cash flow was strong and net cash provided by operating activity was $627 million versus $346 million last year. And even after the higher CapEx this year, cash flow before financing activities was $94 million more than a year ago. 
We retired $639 million less debt than last year and even after the increase dividend and the buyback, our net cash used year-to-date was $367 million, approximately $600 million better than a year ago. And our credit ratio has also continued to improve with our debt to EBITDA of 2.6 on a rolling 4 quarter basis versus our target of 2.4 to 2.7 and EBITDA of interest of 6.8, which is actually above our target of 6.4 to 6.6. We remain focused on keeping our ratios within our target range in being an investment-grade company.
So with another good quarter, all around, sales, earnings and cash flow, we feel confident that the momentum we have heading into the fourth quarter combined with our holiday strategies bodes well for that quarter. As discussed earlier, we continue to assume comp store sales will be up 4% to 4.5%. The extra day in December before Christmas should not only help December sales relative to November, it should also help the November-December combined time frame overall. 
With that, as our sales assumption, we are assuming EPS of $2.70 to $2.75 for the full year. This is $0.10 better than our prior guidance due to the improved credit performance and a stock buyback. 
And remember, this is $0.45 better than our initial guidance at the beginning of the year of $2.25 to $2.30. This would represent significant growth also over last year's $2.11, excluding asset impairment charges, store closing related costs and the premium on the early retirement of debt. 
For the fourth quarter, this guidance calculates to $1.52 to $1.57.
Based on this assumed performance, our EBITDA as a percent of sales would be close to hitting the 13% mark in 2011. This would represent approximately 70 basis points of improvement over our 2010 EBITDA rate of 12.3%. That is great progress as we make our way to our objective of 14% to 15%. 
Here's a few other comments on our key planning assumptions. One, while we expect our merchandise margin to be flattish in the fourth quarter, our reported gross margin is expected to be down. The decline, however, is expected to be less than that in the third quarter because we will have just about year-round it on the free shipping to the Internet. However, because of the rapid growth in that business, we are expecting it to still negatively impact our gross margin rate.
Two, we are expensing and G&A excluding any asset impairments or store closing costs to be up by less than the comp store sales growth even after that timing shift to be approximately $15 million of marketing visual and selling expense discussed earlier. If we exceeded our sales guidance by the way, the expense increase could be a bit higher. We are investing in our stores to support our MAGIC Selling efforts and we are funding additional resources to help our stores better recover after big days during the holiday season. We also are investing in our omnichannel strategy. Offsetting these investments is an assumption of approximately $55 million to $60 million of improved credit profitability versus last year in the fourth quarter. 
Depreciation and amortization is estimated at approximately $282 million, flat with the third quarter and slightly below last year. Interest expense is assumed to be approximately $107 million in the fourth quarter. And the tax rate is estimated to be approximately 38% in the third quarter, which should result in annual rate of approximately 37% as anticipated all year long. 
Last year, remember they were favorable tax adjustments in the fourth quarter which led to a lower rate, approximately 35%. At last year's tax rate in the fourth quarter been 38%, the EPS would have been $0.07 lower. So keep that in mind as you're comparing our fourth quarter guidance for this year relative to last year.
Also our guidance for the fourth quarter assumes no additional stock buyback. We have said we would buy back some stock prior to the holiday season and not buyback a significant amount until the cash comes in from the holiday sales. 
Also our guidance assumes no cost associated with store closings or asset impairments at year end. Last year, you'll recall that number was approximately $25 million and it is impossible though to estimate what it might be this year since those decisions have not yet been made. And CapEx for the year is still expected to be $800 million.
I'll now related tot eh fourth quarter guidance, I wanted to make sure you also saw our separate release this morning announcing 2 new Macy's stores and one replacement Macy's store. So at this time, we're planning to open to new Macy's next year. Downtime Salt Lake City and Southbridge in Milwaukee. And then for in 2013 or early 2014, Bernie Mills outside of Chicago, Eight Plus in the Bronx, Victorville, California and a replacement store in Bayshore, New York. And for Bloomingdale's, we've announced a new store in Glendale out in Southern California. We are pleased that we're able to identify these great new store opportunities that will further improve our market position and continue to earn terrific returns on invested capital.
All in all, we are pleased to be maintaining the momentum over the past 2 years in sales growth, earnings and cash flow, as well as in gaining market share. The fourth quarter is when retailers like Macy's and Bloomingdale's really shine and take on special meaning to customers. We have great fashions, exceptional gifts, memorable experiences and well-trained associates in our stores and online for shoppers this holiday season. We are all very excited about what the next 3 months will bring. 
And with that, I'll open the call up for your questions."

Good morning, and welcome to the Macy's Call scheduled to discuss our third quarter earnings and some of our key assumptions for the fourth quarter. I am Karen Hoguet, CFO of the company. 
Let me start by first apologizing for the confusion this morning over the brackets that mysteriously appeared on our cash flow statement. Business Wire is responsible for the problem and frankly, still haven't figured out quite how it happened, but note that a corrected release is now posted on the Wire.
On any transcription or other reproduction of the statements made in this call without our consent is prohibited. A replay of the call will be available on our website, www.macysinc.com, beginning approximately 2 hours after the call concludes. Please refer to the Investor Relations section of our website for discussion and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures discussed this morning.
And keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.
We are very pleased with our performance in the third quarter. We achieved a 4% comp store gain on top of our 3.9% increase last year. Not only does this represent continued strong absolute performance, but it also compares very favorably to our key competitors. 
We achieved a 64% increase in operating income in the quarter and a 190 basis point improvement in operating income as a percent of sales. Earnings per share were significantly above last year and cash flow generation continued strong. And we feel very prepared for the fourth quarter. 
So I will discuss some of the factors behind this performance, as well as our outlook for the fourth quarter and then as always, we'll open the call for your questions.
Sales in the third quarter were $5,853,000,000, up 4.1% over last year. On comp store basis, sales in the quarter were up 4%, the lower end of our 4% to 4.5% guidance. Our sales exceeded our expectations in August and September, but in October, as you know, our sales fell a little short. This can largely be explained by weakness in cold weather merchandise by coats, sweaters and hats, scarves and gloves and of course, the snow in the North East on that last Saturday of October, obviously hurt us as well. 
We saw the business improve when the weather got colder, so we remain optimistic for the fourth quarter. Importantly, we continue to see sales growth at both Macy's and Bloomingdale's and both from stores and online. Our fourth quarter merchandising and marketing strategies are terrific, and should enable us to achieve our 4% to 4.5% comp store sales growth guidance.
During the third quarter, our Internet businesses continued to perform very well, up 40% over last year. The growth of our omnichannel business is one of the key initiatives driving our success. We believe that the Internet and mobile sites are not only generating great results on their own, but they're also helping us to drive sales into the stores. 
In the third quarter, our strongest geographic region was the Southeast, followed by the South Central and Southwest. In addition, tourist stores in other regions like Herald Square in New York, State Street and Water Tower in Chicago, as well as San Francisco did very well. 
Bloomingdale's also had a great third quarter, although they too were hurt in October by the warm weather and the snowstorm. 
By family of business, our stronger performances where in men's, cosmetics, handbags and watches. And our weakest sales trends continued in Junior's and casual traditional Women's apparel. Our home store sales in total were good, although not as strong as center core in men's. Within Home, our strongest businesses were textile, furniture and luggage.
In the third quarter, the average unit retail was up 5%, with transactions up approximately 1% and units per transaction down approximately 2%, which means that units were down about 1%. 
As you recall, we had expected average unit retail to increase 5% to 7% this fall, with fewer units being sold and we still believe that to be the case. 
At the end of the quarter, inventory in the balance sheet was up 9.6% at the lower end of the 10% to 12% expected range that I had given you during the second quarter earnings call. Remember that we accelerated receipts into October from the 1st week of November, to facilitate the processing of this inventory at our stores. 
And we also accelerated receipts into the first week of all months as we discussed at the end of the second quarter, which increases in transit. That is why though, when you look at inventory net of payables, which also adjusts -- includes the in transit, our inventory net of payables was up only 6%, and excluding both the accelerated receipts and the higher in transit, comp store stock would have been up by approximately the same amount as the expected fourth quarter  sales. 
Our stores are more set than ever for the holiday selling and we hope that, that pays off. Remember though that the higher in transit will continue to be a factor at year end and at this point we expect to end the year with balance sheet inventory up 6% to 7%, but comp store inventory up less than half of that amount.
Gross margin in the third quarter was 39.4%, 60 basis points below last year, which is about what we had expected. This reduction is due to the introduction of free shipping at macys.com and the enormous growth of that business as well as Search and Send from our stores. The merchandise margin was flattish in the third quarter.
SG&A in the quarter was $2,018,000,000 or 2.5% below last year. And as a percent of sales, SG&A was 34.4%, or 250 basis points below last year. This is better than we had expected, primarily due to the improved performance of our credit portfolio and to approximately $15 million of timing shifts, primarily in marketing, visual and selling expense from the third quarter in to the fourth quarter. 
Our Credit business generated $108 million more income in the third quarter this year than last year. We had expected improvement as we discussed at the end of the second quarter, but not this much. This relates primarily to significantly lower write-offs. The portfolio has improved faster than we had expected and balances are remaining current or are only moving into early ages and not going to write-off. This is very good news. And we are estimating that the profitability of our credit business this year will actually be higher than that in 2007.
Penetration of our proprietary cards in the third quarter was 48.8%, down 50 basis points from last year. This is due in part to the strength of our tourist stores, and in part to a reduction in new accounts. The approval rate of new accounts has declined, as we expected, because of more stringent ability to pay standards.
Our SG&A would've been pretty much as we expected in total without the great credit performance and that timing shift I just talked about. 
Operating income in the quarter was $291 million, 64% above last year, and 190 basis points as a percent of sales. Interest expense was $108 million in the quarter, down from last year's $164 million. 
Last year, however, did include $39 million related to the early retirement of debt. Without that, last year's interest expense would've been $125 million. So on that basis, this year our interest expense was $17 million lower. 
Our tax rate in the quarter was 24%. As discussed during the second quarter earnings call, we expected favorable tax settlements in the back half of the year. We had discussed this in August and said at that time they were likely to book in the third quarter, which is in fact what happened. Unfortunately, tax settlements are very hard to predict on a quarterly basis. These settlements were assumed, however, in our guidance of the approximately 37% tax rate for the full year.
Net income in the third quarter was $139 million, average diluted share count was 431.8 million shares for the quarter. 
And during the quarter, we bought back 8.2 million shares of stock for approximately $221 million. Earnings per share on a diluted basis in the third quarter was $0.32 versus $0.02 last year or $0.08 per share excluding the comps associated with the debt retirement. Cash flow was strong and net cash provided by operating activity was $627 million versus $346 million last year. And even after the higher CapEx this year, cash flow before financing activities was $94 million more than a year ago. 
We retired $639 million less debt than last year and even after the increased dividend and the buyback, our net cash used year-to-date was $367 million, approximately $600 million better than a year ago. And our credit ratio has also continued to improve with our debt to EBITDA of 2.6 on a rolling 4 quarter basis, versus our target of 2.4 to 2.7 and EBITDA of -- to interest of 6.8, which is actually above our target of 6.4 to 6.6. We remain focused on keeping our ratios within our target range and being an investment-grade company.
So with another good quarter all around, sales, earnings and cash flow, we feel confident that the momentum we have heading into the fourth quarter combined with our holiday strategies bode well for that quarter. As discussed earlier, we continue to assume comp store sales will be up 4% to 4.5%. The extra day in December before Christmas should not only help December sales relative to November, but should also help the November-December combined time frame overall. 
With that, as our sales assumption, we are assuming EPS of $2.70 to $2.75 for the full year. This is $0.10 better than our prior guidance due to the improved credit performance and the stock buyback. 
And remember, this is $0.45 better than our initial guidance at the beginning of the year of $2.25 to $2.30. This would represent significant growth also over last year's $2.11, excluding asset impairment charges, store closing related costs and the premium on the early retirement of debt. 
For the fourth quarter, this guidance calculates to $1.52 to $1.57.
And based on this assumed performance, our EBITDA as a percent of sales would be close to hitting the 13% mark in 2011. This would represent approximately 70 basis points of improvement over our 2010 EBITDA rate of 12.3%. That is great progress as we make our way to our objective of 14% to 15%. 
Here's a few other comments on our key planning assumptions. One, while we expect our merchandise margins to be flattish in the fourth quarter, our reported gross margin is expected to be down. The decline, however, is expected to be less than that in the third quarter because we will have just about year-rounded on the free shipping through the Internet. However, because of the rapid growth in that business, we are expecting it to still negatively impact our gross margin rate.
Two, we are expensing SG&A excluding any asset impairments or store closing cost to be up by less than the comp store sales growth even after the timing shift of the approximately $15 million of marketing visual and selling expense discussed earlier. If we exceeded our sales guidance, by the way, the expense increase could be a bit higher. We are investing in our stores to support our MAGIC Selling efforts, and we are funding additional resources to help our stores better recover after big days during the holiday season. We also are investing in our omnichannel strategy. Offsetting these investments is an assumption of approximately $55 million to $60 million of improved credit profitability versus last year in the fourth quarter. 
Depreciation and amortization is estimated at approximately $282 million, flat with the third quarter and slightly below last year. Interest expense is assumed to be approximately $107 million in the fourth quarter. And the tax rate is estimated to be approximately 38% in the quarter, which will result in annual rate of approximately 37% as anticipated all year long. 
Last year, remember, they were favorable tax adjustments in the fourth quarter which led to a lower rate, approximately 35%. Had last year's tax rate in the fourth quarter been 38%, the EPS would have been $0.07 lower. So keep that in mind as you're comparing our fourth quarter guidance for this year relative to last year.
Also our guidance for the fourth quarter assumes no additional stock buyback. We have said we would buy back some stock prior to the holiday season and not buy back a significant amount until the cash comes in from the holiday sales. 
Also our guidance assumes no cost associated with store closings or asset impairments at year end. Last year, you'll recall, that number was approximately $25 million and it is impossible though to estimate what it might be this year, since those decisions have not yet been made. And CapEx for the year is still expected to be $800 million.
While not related to the fourth quarter guidance, I wanted to make sure you also saw our separate release this morning announcing 2 new Macy's stores and 1 replacement Macy's store. So at this time, we're planning to open 2 new Macy's next year. Downtown Salt Lake City and Southbridge in Milwaukee. And then 4 in 2013 or early 2014, Gurnee Mills outside of Chicago, Bay Plaza in the Bronx, Victorville, California and a replacement store in Bay Shore, New York. And for Bloomingdale's, we've announced a new store in Glendale, out in Southern California. We are pleased that we're able to identify these great new store opportunities that will further improve our market position and continue to earn terrific returns on invested capital.
All in all, we are pleased to be maintaining the momentum built over the past 2 years, in sales growth, earnings and cash flow, as well as in gaining market share. The fourth quarter is when retailers like Macy's and Bloomingdale's really shine and take on special meaning to customers. We have great fashions, exceptional gifts, memorable experiences and well-trained associates in our stores and online for shoppers this holiday season. We are all very excited about what the next 3 months will bring. 
And with that, I'll open the call up for your questions."

Good morning, and welcome to the Macy's Call scheduled to discuss our third quarter earnings and some of our key assumptions for the fourth quarter. I am Karen Hoguet, CFO of the company. 
Let me start by first apologizing for the confusion this morning over the brackets that mysteriously appeared on our cash flow statement. Business Wire is responsible for the problem and frankly, still haven't figured out quite how it happened, but note that a corrected release is now posted on the Wire.
On any transcription or other reproduction of the statements made in this call without our consent is prohibited. A replay of the call will be available on our website, www.macysinc.com, beginning approximately 2 hours after the call concludes. Please refer to the Investor Relations section of our website for discussion and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures discussed this morning.
And keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.
We are very pleased with our performance in the third quarter. We achieved a 4% comp store gain on top of our 3.9% increase last year. Not only does this represent continued strong absolute performance, but it also compares very favorably to our key competitors. 
We achieved a 64% increase in operating income in the quarter and a 190 basis point improvement in operating income as a percent of sales. Earnings per share were significantly above last year and cash flow generation continued strong. And we feel very prepared for the fourth quarter. 
So I will discuss some of the factors behind this performance, as well as our outlook for the fourth quarter and then as always, we'll open the call for your questions.
Sales in the third quarter were $5,853,000,000, up 4.1% over last year. On a comp store basis, sales in the quarter were up 4%, the lower end of our 4% to 4.5% guidance. Our sales exceeded our expectations in August and September, but in October, as you know, our sales fell a little short. This can largely be explained by weakness in cold weather merchandise like coats, sweaters and hats, scarves and gloves and of course, the snow in the Northeast on that last Saturday of October, obviously hurt us as well. 
We saw the business improve when the weather got colder, so we remain optimistic for the fourth quarter. Importantly, we continue to see sales growth at both Macy's and Bloomingdale's and both from stores and online. Our fourth quarter merchandising and marketing strategies are terrific, and should enable us to achieve our 4% to 4.5% comp store sales growth guidance.
During the third quarter, our Internet businesses continued to perform very well, up 40% over last year. The growth of our omnichannel business is one of the key initiatives driving our success. We believe that the Internet and mobile sites are not only generating great results on their own, but they're also helping us to drive sales into the stores. 
In the third quarter, our strongest geographic region was the Southeast, followed by the South Central and Southwest. In addition, tourist stores in other regions like Herald Square in New York, State Street and Water Tower in Chicago, as well as San Francisco did very well. 
Bloomingdale's also had a great third quarter, although they too were hurt in October by the warm weather and the snowstorm. 
By family of business, our stronger performances where in Men's, cosmetics, handbags and watches. And our weakest sales trends continued in Junior's and casual traditional Women's apparel. Our home store sales in total were good, although not as strong as center core in Men's. Within Home, our strongest businesses were textiles, furniture and luggage.
In the third quarter, the average unit retail was up 5%, with transactions up approximately 1% and units per transaction down approximately 2%, which means that units were down about 1%. 
As you recall, we had expected average unit retail to increase 5% to 7% this fall, with fewer units being sold and we still believe that to be the case. 
At the end of the quarter, inventory in the balance sheet was up 9.6% at the lower end of the 10% to 12% expected range that I had given you during the second quarter earnings call. Remember that we accelerated receipts into October from the first week of November, to facilitate the processing of this inventory at our stores. 
And we also accelerated receipts into the first week of all months as we discussed at the end of the second quarter, which increases in transit. That is why though, when you look at inventory net of payables, which also adjusts -- includes the in transit, our inventory net of payables was up only 6%, and excluding both the accelerated receipts and the higher in transit, comp store stock would have been up by approximately the same amount as the expected fourth quarter  sales. 
Our stores are more set than ever for the holiday selling and we hope that, that pays off. Remember though that the higher in transit will continue to be a factor at year end and at this point we expect to end the year with balance sheet inventory up 6% to 7%, but comp store inventory up less than half of that amount.
Gross margin in the third quarter was 39.4%, 60 basis points below last year, which is about what we had expected. This reduction is due to the introduction of free shipping at macys.com and the enormous growth of that business as well as Search and Send from our stores. The merchandise margin was flattish in the third quarter.
SG&A in the quarter was $2,018,000,000 or 2.5% below last year. And as a percent of sales, SG&A was 34.4%, or 250 basis points below last year. This is better than we had expected, primarily due to the improved performance of our credit portfolio and to approximately $15 million of timing shifts, primarily in marketing, visual and selling expense from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. 
Our Credit business generated $108 million more income in the third quarter this year than last year. We had expected improvement as we discussed at the end of the second quarter, but not this much. This relates primarily to significantly lower write-offs. The portfolio has improved faster than we had expected and balances are remaining current or are only moving into early ages and not going to write-off. This is very good news. And we are estimating that the profitability of our credit business this year will actually be higher than that in 2007.
Penetration of our proprietary cards in the third quarter was 48.8%, down 50 basis points from last year. This is due in part to the strength of our tourist stores, and in part to a reduction in new accounts. The approval rate of new accounts has declined, as we expected, because of more stringent abilit-to-pay standards.
Our SG&A would've been pretty much as we expected in total without the great credit performance and that timing shift I had talked about. 
Operating income in the quarter was $291 million, 64% above last year, and 190 basis points as a percent of sales. Interest expense was $108 million in the quarter, down from last year's $164 million. 
Last year, however, did include $39 million related to the early retirement of debt. Without that, last year's interest expense would've been $125 million. So on that basis, this year our interest expense was $17 million lower. 
Our tax rate in the quarter was 24%. As discussed during the second quarter earnings call, we expected favorable tax settlements in the back half of the year. We had discussed this in August and said at that time they were likely to book in the third quarter, which is in fact what happened. Unfortunately, tax settlements are very hard to predict on a quarterly basis. These settlements were assumed, however, in our guidance of the approximately 37% tax rate for the full year.
Net income in the third quarter was $139 million, average diluted share count was 431.8 million shares for the quarter. 
And during the quarter, we bought back 8.2 million shares of stock for approximately $221 million. Earnings per share on a diluted basis in the third quarter was $0.32 versus $0.02 last year or $0.08 per share excluding the comps associated with the debt retirement. Cash flow was strong and net cash provided by operating activity was $627 million versus $346 million last year. And even after the higher CapEx this year, cash flow before financing activities was $94 million more than a year ago. 
We retired $639 million less debt than last year and even after the increased dividend and the buyback, our net cash used year-to-date was $367 million, approximately $600 million better than a year ago. And our credit ratio has also continued to improve with our debt to EBITDA of 2.6 on a rolling 4 quarter basis, versus our target of 2.4 to 2.7 and EBITDA of -- to interest of 6.8, which is actually above our target of 6.4 to 6.6. We remain focused on keeping our ratios within our target range and being an investment-grade company.
So it was another good quarter all around, sales, earnings and cash flow, we feel confident that the momentum we have heading into the fourth quarter combined with our holiday strategies bode well for that quarter. As discussed earlier, we continue to assume comp store sales will be up 4% to 4.5%. The extra day in December before Christmas should not only help December sales relative to November, but should also help the November-December combined time frame overall. 
With that, as our sales assumption, we are assuming EPS of $2.70 to $2.75 for the full year. This is $0.10 better than our prior guidance due to the improved credit performance and the stock buyback. 
And remember, this is $0.45 better than our initial guidance at the beginning of the year of $2.25 to $2.30. This would represent significant growth also over last year's $2.11, excluding asset impairment charges, store closing related costs and the premium on the early retirement of debt. 
For the fourth quarter, this guidance calculates to $1.52 to $1.57.
And based on this assumed performance, our EBITDA as a percent of sales would be close to hitting the 13% mark in 2011. This would represent approximately 70 basis points of improvement over our 2010 EBITDA rate of 12.3%. That is great progress as we make our way to our objective of 14% to 15%. 
Here's a few other comments on our key planning assumptions. One, while we expect our merchandise margins to be flattish in the fourth quarter, our reported gross margin is expected to be down. The decline, however, is expected to be less than that in the third quarter because we will have just about year-rounded on the free shipping through the Internet. However, because of the rapid growth in that business, we are expecting it to still negatively impact our gross margin rate.
Two, we are expecting SG&A excluding any asset impairments or store closing cost to be up by less than the comp store sales growth even after the timing shift of the approximately $15 million of marketing visual and selling expense discussed earlier. If we exceed our sales guidance, by the way, the expense increase could be a bit higher. We are investing in our stores to support our MAGIC Selling efforts, and we are funding additional resources to help our stores better recover after big days during the holiday season. We also are investing in our omnichannel strategy. Offsetting these investments is an assumption of approximately $55 million to $60 million of improved credit profitability versus last year in the fourth quarter. 
Depreciation and amortization is estimated at approximately $282 million, flat with the third quarter and slightly below last year. Interest expense is assumed to be approximately $107 million in the fourth quarter. And the tax rate is estimated to be approximately 38% in the quarter, which will result in the annual rate of approximately 37% as anticipated all year long. 
Last year, remember, there were favorable tax adjustments in the fourth quarter which led to a lower rate, approximately 35%. Had last year's tax rate in the fourth quarter been 38%, the EPS would have been $0.07 lower. So keep that in mind as you're comparing our fourth quarter guidance for this year relative to last year.
Also our guidance for the fourth quarter assumes no additional stock buyback. We have said we would buy back some stock prior to the holiday season and not buy back a significant amount until the cash comes in from the holiday sales. 
Also our guidance assumes no cost associated with store closings or asset impairments at year end. Last year, you'll recall, that number was approximately $25 million and it is impossible though to estimate what it might be this year, since those decisions have not yet been made. And CapEx for the year is still expected to be $800 million.
While not related to the fourth quarter guidance, I wanted to make sure you also saw our separate release this morning announcing 2 new Macy's stores and 1 replacement Macy's store. So at this time, we're planning to open 2 new Macy's next year. Downtown Salt Lake City and Southridge in Milwaukee. And then 4 in 2013 or early 2014, Gurnee Mills outside of Chicago, Bay Plaza in the Bronx, Victorville, California and a replacement store in Bay Shore, New York. And for Bloomingdale's, we've announced a new store in Glendale, out in Southern California. We are pleased that we're able to identify these great new store opportunities that will further improve our market position and continue to earn terrific returns on invested capital.
All in all, we are pleased to be maintaining the momentum built over the past 2 years, in sales growth, earnings and cash flow, as well as in gaining market share. The fourth quarter is when retailers like Macy's and Bloomingdale's really shine and take on special meaning to customers. We have great fashions, exceptional gifts, memorable experiences and well-trained associates in our stores and online for shoppers this holiday season. We are all very excited about what the next 3 months will bring. 
And with that, I'll open the call up for your questions."
