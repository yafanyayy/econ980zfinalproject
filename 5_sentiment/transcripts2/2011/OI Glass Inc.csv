You can see the impact of this strategic shift in our financial results. 
Segment operating profit increased more than 8% from the prior year. This increase reflected both our margin repair efforts as we completed our 2010 North American restructuring program as well as emerging market growth, particularly in South America.
Higher operating profit was offset by additional non-operating costs including pension and interest expense. As a result, O-I reported full-year 2010 adjusted net income of $2.60 per share compared to $2.61 in 2009.
Volumes improved in most of the markets that we serve in 2010 especially South America. Shipments also increased across nearly all end-use categories including wine, spirits and food. Here in the mature markets was the notable exception as consumption was down primarily due to continued high unemployment. In total, shipments from continuing operations were down about 1%. Our shipment trends reflect additional volume from acquisitions and volume loss sides to customer contract renegotiations that supported our margin restoration effort. Excluding these factors, our underlying shipments were up 2% from 2009, which was in line with gradually improving consumption trend.
Globally, lower manufacturing and delivery costs reflected the improved operating rates and savings from restructuring activities, which more than offset cost inflation.
The expropriation of our two plants in Venezuela was unexpected and unfortunate development. However, we are optimistic about the future contributions of our 10 newly acquired plants and the three new furnaces we build this year to serve fast-growing markets in South America and Asia.
Most of the developments I discussed regarding full year 2010 also apply to the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter 2010 adjusted earnings were $0.45 per share compared to $0.43 in 2009. Segment operating profit increased more than 25% over our fourth quarter 2009. This improvement was mostly due to higher capacity utilization as the inventory correction we conducted in late 2009 did not repeat given our positive growth outlook for this year.
Overall, our average fourth quarter selling price was consistent with prior year. Globally, our total shipments were flat with the fourth quarter 2009 while underlying shipments were up 2% similar to our full year trends.
In the fourth quarter, we completed the acquisition of three plants in China, including one in Guandong and two near Beijing. We also opened a newly constructed furnace in Oakland, New Zealand.
Looking to 2011, we expect higher shipment and production level. This reflects strong growth and expansion in emerging markets. Sales will benefit from organic growth as markets continue to recover. We are also investing in our own sales and marketing innovation capabilities. Part of the strong growth we experienced in our South American region this past year was attributable to a new robust sales and marketing program. We are now implementing this leading practice across all regions in 2011. Further, higher selling prices will partially offset additional cost inflation. 
Free cash flow should improve significantly in 2011. We expect lower restructuring charges and capital expenditures now that we have completed our recent footprint initiatives and invested in new capacity during 2010 for future growth.
Overall, 2011 free cash flow should approximate $300 million. Expansion in the high-growth markets will remain our top use of free cash flow.
Now, let's review our operating performance on Chart 3. Here we show segment operating profit and margins for the company as well as for each of our four regions. Full-year profits are on the left and fourth quarter results are on the right. Our full-year 2010 segment operating profit was $964 million, up $73 million from last year. Margins improved to 14.6% from around 13.5% in 2009. Favorable foreign currency translation represented $60 million of the year-over-year profit improvement.
Most currencies strengthened against the dollar, which help offset the impact of a weaker euro. Segment operating profit was comparable with the prior year for most regions with the exception of South America, which posted a significant improvement from 2009.
In Europe, segment profit was $324 million, a decline of $9 million from the prior year. While profits actually increased approximately $10 million in the currency neutral phases. While we did experience some pricing pressure, volumes were up low single-digit and operating rates improved.
Our North American operating profit of $275 million was just below prior year results, but just a significant achievement given all the restructuring activity during 2010.
The benefits from higher selling prices and footprint savings offset a 12% volume decline following customer contract renegotiations. Adjusted for these contracts, North American shipments were down slightly from 2009 reflecting a sluggish U.S. market.
Our South American segment profit was $224 million, up 55% from 2009, reflecting very strong growth in our business. Shipments improved more than 30% from last year. Most of this increase reflected the rebound in consumption and new product introductions. The balance of the improvement was attributable to new business from acquisitions, additional furnaces and footprint optimization efforts.
Asia Pacific's operating profit of $141 million increased $10 million on the prior year, added by favorable currency translation. Volume trends in the region varied by country. Shipments were down in Australia and New Zealand as strong currencies in those countries impacted wine exports. And beer consumption was also down in Australia.
In China on the other hand, our shipments were boosted by increased consumer demand. To support this growth, we expanded our base in China to several acquisitions, and we also entered into a joint venture into Southeast Asia.
Turning to the fourth quarter. Total operating profit was $221 million, up from $174 million last year, reflecting a strong performance in both North and South America. The impact of currency translation was negligible. Our European operating profit was $50 million, up $10 million from the fourth quarter of 2009.
Average selling prices declined modestly. However, shipment level improved by low single-digit from the prior year and higher productivity led to lower manufacturing costs. Market conditions continue to vary but we did see some improvement over the course of the quarter.
While beer remained weak, the end use categories like wine and food showed solid growth.
In North America, operating profit was $53 million, an improvement from $33 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Shipments were down about 10% from the prior year, reflecting the customer contract negotiations that I mentioned earlier. Excluding the impact of those contracts, North American shipments were flat for the prior year. Earnings benefited from improved selling prices as well as higher productivity now that our current restructuring program is complete.
Our South American operating profit was $82 million, a 70% improvement from the prior year, representing the best performance across our regions. Total shipments were up nearly 50%.
Organic growth represented more than half of the increase as a broad-based economic recovery benefited all end-use segments. Our recent acquisitions and new furnaces, which are performing very well, made up the balance of our higher shipments this quarter.
Our Asia Pacific operating profit was $36 million, a decline of $17 million as total shipments were down more than 10% from the prior year. This decline reflected challenging market conditions in Australia and New Zealand. Strong currencies in those countries impacted highly exports, higher interest rates and unfavorable weather conditions in Australia resulted in lower consumer spending, which impacted our customers sale. In fact, domestic beer consumption was down 10% from the prior year according to recent retail statistics. 
Volume growth in China was capacity constraint to enable future growth. As I mentioned, we acquired three plants in China near year end. We see many opportunities to better serve this expanding market as we drive productivity improvement in these locations.
Overall, we faced different challenges and opportunities in 2010 and our segment operating profit improved in both the full year and fourth quarter of 2010.
Going to Chart 4, more importantly, we really expect our operating results to improve further during 2011 as markets continue to recover, and our recent acquisitions drive additional profitable growth.
As illustrated on Chart 4, we made progress this past year as we completed four acquisitions, one joint venture and constructed three new furnaces. As a result, we have added 10 new plants and 24 new furnaces to our manufacturing footprint in high-growth markets including Brazil, Argentina, Peru, China, Vietnam and Malaysia.
Hawaii is now the largest glass container producer in Brazil and the second largest producer in China. Two very important markets for Hawaii as they both have excellent long-term growth opportunities.
Our strategy is focused on both on acquisition and integration efforts are off to a good start. Overall, we are seeing very promising productivity improvements at these facilities. In total, we expect our expansion investment will be accretive to 2011 earnings and will improve further in future years.
We have been reorienting our business to the growing, emerging markets. As illustrated on the right, we have added a significant number of furnaces in South America as well as China and Southeast Asia. Now more than 25% of our capacity is in these fast-growing markets. Overtime, we will continue to increase our commitments through these emerging markets will significantly improve the growth profile for O-I.
I will now turn the call over to Ed."

Let's begin our financial review with the fourth quarter reconciliations for sales, operating profit and EPS on Chart 5. Please note that these reconciliations reflect continuing operations only. 2009 amounts have been restated to exclude the impact of our Venezuelan business. The appendix includes more details on this reclassification, as well as our full year 2010 reconciliations.
Fourth quarter 2010 segment sales decreased slightly to $1.7 billion. As expected, price and product mix were essentially flat with the prior year. And as we have seen all year, cost through provisions in our North American customer contracts resulted in a small impact on sales and had a negligible effect on operating profit.
Moving to sales volume on the following line, glass shipments in ton were flat with the prior year on a global basis. Its sales dollars increased by $17 million, reflecting favorable retail sales mix especially from our acquisitions in South America. Finally, currency translation reduced our top line by $29 million in the fourth quarter. This impact was due to a weaker euro, partially offset by stronger currencies in other country.
Moving over to segment operating profit, the fourth quarter was $221 million, up $47 million from the same period in 2009. Since price and product mix were essentially flat, they had very little impact on operating profit. While volumes were also flat, operating profit benefited by $7 million from improved regional mix given the strong growth of higher margin business in South America. Manufacturing and delivery cost decreased $35 million due to the benefits from footprint saving and higher operating rate. However, this was partially offset by $20 million of cost inflation, mostly driven by higher energy prices.
Finishing with the EPS reconciliation, our adjusted net income was $0.45 per share in the quarter compared to $0.43 in the prior year. Operating profit was up $0.21 from the prior year. However, earnings were impacted $0.19 from unfavorable non-operating items. This included additional non-cash pension expense, which drove higher corporate cost. We incurred $0.08 of additional interest expense on incremental debt to fund our several accretive acquisitions. Finally, the effective tax rate was higher than last year, reflecting our current regional earnings benefit.
I have two comments on GAAP EPS. We reported approximately $160 million of note one charges in the fourth quarter, primarily related to our annual review and reserve adjustment. And as we discussed in our 8-K filing last month, we incurred a one-time charge of $329 million in the fourth quarter to write-off our Venezuelan net assets and the related cumulative currency translation adjustments recorded in prior years. The company continues to negotiate with the Venezuelan government with respect to certain aspects of the appropriation including compensation.
Let's move to Chart 6 for more detail on our balance sheet and asbestos. Keep in mind this information reflects Venezuela classified as a discontinued operation for both 2009 and 2010. On December 31, cash was $640 million and total debt was $4.3 billion. Net debt was $3.6 billion, an increase of $785 million from 2009 as we put our healthy balance sheet to work to fund several acquisitions. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was around 2.8x at year end 2010 and remained within our target leverage range of between 2x and 3x EBITDA. Our underfunded pension liability was $530 million at year end, compared to $540 million in the prior year.
We generated free cash flow from continuing operations of $100 million in 2010 and this was after prefunding approximately $35 million of 2011 tax payments and pension contributions in late December. 
As Al mentioned, 2010 was a year of transition. Capital expenditures peaked as we completed our restructuring activities and of the same time, we invested in new furnace expansions to support growing market. Working capital levels remained lean as we did not need to repeat the significant inventory correction conducted in late 2009. And we are now positioned for more growth this year.
Turning to asbestos. Nothing has changed in the basic pack pattern. During the fourth quarter, we conducted the annual review of our asbestos-related liabilities. As a result, the company recorded a non-cash charge of $170 million in the fourth quarter. This charge compares to $180 million for 2009. Likewise, asbestos payments dropped by $11 million from the prior year.
As illustrated in the Chart, about 3,200 new cases were filed in 2010 compared to 6,000 in 2009. The number of total pending cases at the end of 2010 was 5,900, which is 1,000 fewer pends than the prior year. Overall, asbestos remained a limited and declining liability.
On Chart 7, we present our business outlook for both the first quarter and full year 2011. We have provided the usual directional guidance and expanded disclosure for annual price, volume and cost trends, as well as a number of cash flow items. Of course, as with any estimates, they are subject to change throughout the year. Overall, we're looking forward to a good year as we profitably grow our business and significantly improve free cash flow generation. 
Let's review the first quarter trends. As you can see, we expect improved pricing, higher sale volume and lower manufacturing cost. These will more than offset additional cost inflation. But we do expect higher non-operating cost, which I will review further in a minute. In addition, I'd like to highlight a couple of first quarter events.
Sales volumes should be up across all of our regions including Asia Pacific. Unfortunately, flooding in Australia this month has affected our customers and our Brisbane plant, which was shut down for several weeks in January. As a result of the flooding and continued challenging market conditions, our first quarter Asia-Pacific segment operating profit could be down modestly from prior-year level. We greatly appreciate the efforts of our Australian team, which has been working night and day to serve our customers and get the Brisbane plant back into production.
Next, we deferred furnace maintenance in South America during the latter half of 2010, as very strong growth required high operating rate. Now taking advantage of a seasonally slower period, we will be conducting a number of furnace rebuilds across that region during the next 90 days. While total first quarter operating profit in South America will improve modestly from 2009, profit margins will temporarily dip below the prior year. These discrete items had impact in the first quarter. However, we expect the rate of our financial improvement to accelerate starting in the second quarter. We continue to see gradually improving market conditions and are encouraged about the contributions from our numerous recent acquisitions. In fact, our January month to date volumes are positive in every region and total shipments are up mid to high single digits over prior year. Let's review our key business factors for full year 2011.
Price and mix. Following slight cost inflation in 2010, we expect modestly higher selling prices this year, which will positively impact global sales by up to 1% in 2011. Broadly speaking, prices should improve across all regions.
Sales volume. We expect global shipments will increase between 5% and 10% from 2010 levels. Recent acquisition should boost volume between 3% and 5%, most notable in the first half of the year. Further, we anticipate organic sales growth will range between 2% and 5% lead by innovation and overall economic improvement in each regions. Please note, in North America and Europe, organic growth would yield EBIT contribution margins of between 40% and 60% depending on the plant. This is higher than normal due to the significant operating leverage to improving volumes that remained in those regions. Contribution margins in emerging markets from both organic and acquisition-related growth would be closer to the historic averages for those respective countries given their high operating rates. Keep in mind that during the first quarter, we will anniversary the contract changes that resulted in lower beer shipment in 2010. So future volume trends should compare more favorably to prior-year levels. And over the course of the year, volume trends should also improve on a year-over-year basis.
Cost inflation. While 2010 cost inflation totaled only $20 million, we anticipate 2011 inflation will range between $150 million and $180 million or about 3% of cost of goods sold. Most of the increase is due to higher raw material prices including soda, as well as generally higher energy and labor cost. Currently, we estimate that price improvement in 2011 would partially offset this additional cost inflation forecast. Having said that, we will continue to seek opportunities over the course of the year to better offset cost pressures with additional higher selling prices.
Other manufacturing and delivery cost. As shipment levels in North America and Europe increase, our operating profit should also improve resulting in operating rates should improve resulting in lower unabsorbed fixed cost. And we expect productivity and logistic initiative will provide additional benefit. Further, the completion of our footprint effort in North America will generate $30 million to $35 million of incremental savings across the first half of 2011.
Other costs. We anticipate approximately $70 million to $80 million of additional operating expense and corporate cost, including $20 million of higher non-cash pension expense. As Al mentioned, we expect to further enhance our sales, marketing and innovation capabilities to drive topline growth. This includes our global sales and marketing program and an SAP information system for the Americas. We see these investments as a meaningful way for O-I to advance its strategic priority to strengthen glass marketing.
Overall, the rate of spending will be managed throughout the year depending on our financial performance. Interest expense is expected to increase $35 million in 2011 as we use our balance sheet to finance our recent acquisition. As we mentioned, our acquisitions will be accretive this year, so improved operating profit from these transactions will more than offset the financing cost.
Our 2011 effective tax rate should approximate 27%. Tax expense and tax payments should be about the same.
Free cash flow. Our major restructuring program is now complete and we're well positioned for growth in the emerging markets. As a result, CapEx should decline from $500 million in 2010 to approximately $350 million in 2011. Restructuring payments will drop from $61 million in the prior year to approximately $20 million in 2011. Expected pension contribution and asbestos payments are also provided on Chart 7. While we target further working capital efficiency, working capital will most likely be a modest use of cash in 2011 as sales increase. Overall, free cash flow should approximate $300 million this year.
In summary, we expect both improved financial results and greater free cash flow generation in 2011.
Now, I'll turn it back to Al on Chart 8."

Number one, our inflation is a projection and it's really influenced significantly by what's happening in the last few months with regards to commodity prices and with regards to energy prices. W",433,"Yes, Rick, let me try to give you some perspective on that. Number one, our inflation is a projection and it's really influenced significantly by what's happening in the last few months with regards to commodity prices and with regards to energy prices. We have put a significant focus in the long-term contracts on making sure that we have totally past through provisions for energy. But still, if you have an escalating energy price development, you still run behind one quarter in each of the successive quarters. Now it may very well be that in the course of the year, there are going to be ups and downs from one quarter to the next. Then of course, this full file will change a little bit and we would not have this factor that we would be running behind. With regard to the more stable prices that we have seen in the past with regard to commodities and affects our raw materials, we generally have annual pass through provisions. And as we have gone into this year, of course, the evolution that we saw last year was pretty mild. So to the price adjustment has been fairly low. Now as we go through this escalation of commodity prices in this coming year, we will be running a bit behind but I think overall, of course, that would fix itself again than in the subsequent year. And I believe that the dynamics that we are seeing are predominantly related of course to the longer-term contract. And now you know that in Europe, which of course is a significant share of our business, we only do about 30% of our volume in longer-term contracts. So the contracts in Europe are more determined on a short-term annual basis and of course, it's very difficult at the beginning of the year as you negotiate these contracts to argue that at the end of the year, raw materials are going to be much higher and therefore, the price should be much higher. So I think what we'll see is in the course of the year is, hopefully, our competitors in Europe will also see these cost increases coming in, and that will hopefully allow us to do some additional price adjustments. So keep an eye on it and keep moving to make sure that we get recovery as quickly as we can. But coming into this year with especially the escalations happening so rapidly in the last three months it's very difficult to really fully include that in our models so we have to be a bit more careful."

The third part that I believe is important to consider is that we are also projecting a cost evolution in the course of the year. Now at the beginning of the year, as we said our annual contracts, of course, it will be very difficult to argue for higher prices in November, December or September, October, November, December that you expect as there is no proof that you can demonstrate to your customers. And of course, that also depends a little bit on how proactive your competitors stands to be in passing through those prospective increases in cost."

And even though we have strongly emerging middle class sections in Latin America as well as in Asia Pacific, the overall income level in relative to Europe or North America is of course still very low. So what we are seeing is continued use of refillable containers as the preferable packaging modality because it does really allow our customers to hit that emerging middle-class sooner in the curve because the packaging costs is so low on the transaction cost that it really allows them to access a broader base of the market but sooner. And that makes it very attractive packaging in the marketing strategy as well."

32583,115021923,96038,"Owens-Illinois, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2011",2011-01-27,"Earnings Calls","O-I Glass, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John, and good morning. 2010 was a year of transition for O-I as we completed our multiyear program to repair margins and shifted our focus to expansion in fast-growing emerging market. You can see the impact of this strategic shift in our fina",1568,"Thank you, John, and good morning. 2010 was a year of transition for O-I as we completed our multiyear program to repair margins and shifted our focus to expansion in fast-growing emerging market. You can see the impact of this strategic shift in our financial results. 
Segment operating profit increased more than 8% from the prior year. This increase reflected both our margin repair efforts as we completed our 2010 North American restructuring program as well as emerging market growth, particularly in South America.  Higher operating profit was offset by additional non-operating costs including pension and interest expense. As a result, O-I reported full-year 2010 adjusted net income of $2.60 per share compared to $2.61 in 2009.
Volumes improved in most of the markets that we serve in 2010, especially South America. Shipments also increased across nearly all end-use categories including wine, spirits and food. Here in the mature markets was the notable exception as consumption was down primarily due to continued high unemployment. In total, shipments from continuing operations were down about 1%. Our shipment trends reflect additional volume from acquisitions and volume loss tied to customer contract renegotiations that supported our margin restoration efforts. Excluding these factors, our underlying shipments were up 2% from 2009, which was in line with gradually improving consumption trend. Globally, lower manufacturing and delivery costs reflected the improved operating rate and footprint savings from restructuring activities, which more than offset cost inflation.
The expropriation of our two plants in Venezuela was unexpected and unfortunate development. However, we are optimistic about the future contributions of our 10 newly acquired plants and the three new furnaces we built this year to serve fast-growing markets in South America and Asia.
Most of the developments I discussed regarding full year 2010 also apply to the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter 2010 adjusted earnings were $0.45 per share compared to $0.43 in 2009. Segment operating profit increased more than 25% over fourth quarter 2009. This improvement was mostly due to higher capacity utilization as the inventory correction we conducted in late 2009 did not repeat, given our positive growth outlook for this year.
Overall, our average fourth quarter selling price was consistent with prior year. Globally, our total shipments were flat with the fourth quarter 2009, while underlying shipments were up 2%, similar to our full year trends.
In the fourth quarter, we completed the acquisition of three plants in China, including one in Guangdong and two near Beijing. We also opened a newly constructed furnace in Auckland, New Zealand.
Looking to 2011, we expect higher shipment and production level. This reflects strong growth and expansion in the emerging market. Sales will benefit from organic growth as markets continue to recover. We are also investing in our own sales and marketing innovation capabilities. Part of the strong growth we experienced in our South American region this past year was attributable to a new robust sales and marketing program. We are now implementing this leading practice across all regions in 2011. Further, higher selling prices will partially offset additional cost inflation. 
Free cash flow should improve significantly in 2011. We expect lower restructuring charges and capital expenditures now that we have completed our recent footprint initiatives and invested in new capacity during 2010 for future growth. Overall, 2011 free cash flow should approximate $300 million. Expansion in the high-growth markets will remain our top use of free cash flow.
Now let's review our operating performance on Chart 3. Here, we show segment operating profit and margins for the company, as well as for each of our four regions. Full year profits are on the left and fourth quarter results are on the right. Our full year 2010 segment operating profit was $964 million, up $73 million from last year. Margins improved to 14.6% from around 13.5% in 2009. Favorable foreign currency translation represented $60 million of the year-over-year profit improvement. Most currencies strengthened against the dollar, which helped offset the impact of a weaker euro. Segment operating profit was comparable with the prior year for most regions with the exception of South America, which posted a significant improvement from 2009.
In Europe, segment profit was $324 million, a decline of $9 million from the prior year, but profits actually increased approximately $10 million in the currency neutral basis. While we did experience some pricing pressure, volumes were up low single digits and operating rates improved. Our North American operating profit of $275 million was just below prior-year results, which is a significant achievement given all the restructuring activity during 2010.
The benefits from higher selling prices and footprint savings offset a 12% volume decline following customer contract renegotiations. Adjusted for these contracts, North American shipments were down slightly from 2009, reflecting a sluggish U.S. beer market.
Our South American segment profit was $224 million, up 55% from 2009, reflecting very strong growth in our business. Shipments improved more than 30% from last year. Most of this increase reflected the rebound in consumption and new product introductions. The balance of the improvement was attributable to new business from acquisitions, additional furnaces and footprint optimization efforts.
Asia-Pacific's operating profit of $141 million increased $10 million on the prior year, added by a favorable currency translation. Volume trends in the region varied by country. Shipments were down in Australia and New Zealand, as strong currencies in those countries impacted wine exports. And beer consumption was also down in Australia.
In China, on the other hand, our shipments were boosted by increased consumer demand. To support this growth, we expanded our base in China through several acquisitions, and we also entered into a joint venture in Southeast Asia.
Turning to the fourth quarter. Total operating profit was $221 million, up from $174 million last year, reflecting a strong performance in both North and South America. The impact of currency translation was negligible. Our European operating profit was $50 million, up $10 million from the fourth quarter of 2009.
Average selling prices declined modestly. However, shipment levels improved by low single digits from the prior year, and higher productivity led to lower manufacturing costs. Market conditions continue to vary, but we did see some improvement over the course of the quarter. While beer remained weak, the end-use categories like wine and food showed solid growth.
In North America, operating profit was $53 million, an improvement from $33 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Shipments were down about 10% from the prior year, reflecting the customer contract negotiations that I mentioned earlier. Excluding the impact of those contracts, North American shipments were flat with the prior year. Earnings benefited from improved selling prices, as well as higher productivity now that our current restructuring program is complete.
Our South American operating profit was $82 million, a 70% improvement from the prior year, representing the best performance across our regions. Total shipments were up nearly 50%. Organic growth represented more than half of the increase as a broad-based economic recovery benefited all end-use segments. Our recent acquisitions and new furnaces, which are performing very well, made up the balance of our higher shipments this quarter.
Our Asia-Pacific operating profit was $36 million, a decline of $17 million as total shipments were down more than 10% from the prior year. This decline reflected challenging market conditions in Australia and New Zealand. Strong currencies in those countries impacted wine exports, higher interest rates, and unfavorable weather conditions in Australia resulted in lower consumer spending, which impacted our customers' sale. In fact, domestic beer consumption was down 10% from the prior year according to recent retail statistics. 
Volume growth in China was capacity-constrained. To enable future growth, as I mentioned, we acquired three plants in China near year-end. We see many opportunities to better serve this expanding market as we drive productivity improvement in these locations. Overall, we faced different challenges and opportunities in 2010, and our segment operating profit improved in both the full year and fourth quarter of 2010.
Going to Chart 4, more importantly, we really expect our operating results to improve further during 2011 as markets continue to recover and our recent acquisitions drive additional profitable growth. As illustrated on Chart 4, we made progress this past year as we completed four acquisitions, one joint venture and constructed three new furnaces. As a result, we have added 10 new plants and 24 new furnaces to our manufacturing footprint in high-growth markets including Brazil, Argentina, Peru, China, Vietnam and Malaysia. O-I is now the largest glass container producer in Brazil and the second larger producer in China, two very important markets for O-I as they both have excellent long-term growth opportunities.  
Our strategy is focused on bolt-on acquisitions, and integration efforts are off to a good start. Overall, we are seeing very promising productivity improvements at these facilities. In total, we expect our expansion investment will be accretive to 2011 earnings and will improve further in future years.
We have been reorienting our business to the growing, emerging markets. As illustrated on the right, we have added a significant number of furnaces in South America, as well as China and Southeast Asia. Now more than 25% of our capacity is in these fast-growing markets. Over time, we will continue to increase our commitment to these emerging markets, and we'll significantly improve the growth profile for O-I.
I will now turn the call over to Ed."

Let's begin our financial review with the fourth quarter reconciliations for sales, operating profit and EPS on Chart 5. Please note that these reconciliations reflect continuing operations only. 2009 amounts have been restated to exclude the impact of our Venezuelan business. The appendix includes more details on this reclassification, as well as our full year 2010 reconciliations.
Fourth quarter 2010 segment sales decreased slightly to $1.7 billion. As expected, price and product mix were essentially flat with the prior year. And as we have seen all year, cost pass-through provisions in our North American customer contracts resulted in a small impact on sales and had a negligible effect on operating profit.
Moving to sales volume on the following line, glass shipments in tons were flat with the prior year on a global basis. Its sales dollars increased by $17 million, reflecting favorable regional sales mix, especially from our acquisitions in South America. Finally, currency translation reduced our top line by $29 million in the fourth quarter. This impact was due to a weaker euro, partially offset by stronger currencies in other country.
Moving over to segment operating profit, the fourth quarter was $221 million, up $47 million from the same period in 2009. Since price and product mix were essentially flat, they had very little impact on operating profit. While volumes were also flat, operating profit benefited by $7 million from improved regional mix, given the strong growth of higher margin business in South America. Manufacturing and delivery costs decreased $35 million due to the benefits from footprint savings and higher operating rate. However, this was partially offset by $20 million of cost inflation, mostly driven by higher energy prices.
Finishing with the EPS reconciliation, our adjusted net income was $0.45 per share in the quarter compared to $0.43 in the prior year. Operating profit was up $0.21 from the prior year. However, earnings were impacted $0.19 from unfavorable non-operating items. This included additional non-cash pension expense, which drove higher corporate cost. We incurred $0.08 of additional interest expense on incremental debt to fund our several accretive acquisitions. Finally, the effective tax rate was higher than last year, reflecting our current regional earnings mix.
I have two comments on GAAP EPS. We reported approximately $160 million of Note 1 charges in the fourth quarter, primarily related to our annual asbestos review and reserve adjustment. And as we discussed in our 8-K filing last month, we incurred a onetime charge of $329 million in the fourth quarter to write off our Venezuelan net assets and the related cumulative currency translation adjustments recorded in prior years. The company continues to negotiate with the Venezuelan government with respect to certain aspects of the expropriation including compensation.
Let's move to Chart 6 for a more detail on our balance sheet and on asbestos. Keep in mind this information reflects Venezuela classified as a discontinued operation for both 2009 and 2010. On December 31, cash was $640 million and total debt was $4.3 billion. Net debt was $3.6 billion, an increase of $785 million from 2009 as we put our healthy balance sheet to work to fund several acquisitions. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was around 2.8x at year-end 2010 and remained within our target leverage range of between 2x and 3x EBITDA. Our underfunded pension liability was $530 million at year-end compared to $540 million in the prior year. We generated free cash flow from continuing operations of $100 million in 2010, and this was after prefunding approximately $35 million of 2011 tax payments and pension contributions in late December. 
As Al mentioned, 2010 was a year of transition. Capital expenditures peaked as we completed our restructuring activities, and at the same time, we invested in new furnace expansions to support growing markets. Working capital levels remained lean as we did not need to repeat the significant inventory correction conducted in late 2009. And we are now positioned for more growth this year.
Turning to asbestos. Nothing has changed in the basic pack pattern. During the fourth quarter, we conducted the annual review of our asbestos-related liabilities. As a result, the company recorded a non-cash charge of $170 million in the fourth quarter. This charge compares to $180 million in 2009. Likewise, asbestos payments dropped by $11 million from the prior year.
As illustrated in the chart, about 3,200 new cases were filed in 2010 compared to 6,000 in 2009. The number of total pending cases at the end of 2010 was 5,900, which is 1,000 fewer pendings than the prior year. Overall, asbestos remained a limited and declining liability.
On Chart 7, we present our business outlook for both first quarter and full year 2011. We have provided the usual directional guidance and expanded disclosure for annual price, volume and cost trends, as well as a number of cash flow items. Of course, as with any estimates, they are subject to change throughout the year. Overall, we're looking forward to a good year as we profitably grow our business and significantly improve free cash flow generation. 
Let's review the first quarter trends. As you can see, we expect improved pricing, higher sales volume and lower manufacturing cost. These will more than offset additional cost inflation. But we do expect higher non-operating cost, which I will review further in a minute. In addition, I'd like to highlight a couple of first quarter events.
Sales volumes should be up across all of our regions, including Asia-Pacific. Unfortunately, flooding in Australia this month has affected our customers and our Brisbane plant, which was shut down for several weeks in January. As a result of the flooding and continued challenging market conditions, our first quarter Asia-Pacific segment operating profit could be down modestly from prior-year levels. We greatly appreciate the efforts of our Australian team, which has been working night and day to serve our customers and get the Brisbane plant back into production.
Next, we deferred furnace maintenance in South America during the latter half of 2010 as very strong growth required high operating rate. Now taking advantage of a seasonally slower period, we will be conducting a number of furnace rebuilds across that region during the next 90 days. While total first quarter operating profit in South America will improve modestly from 2009, profit margins will temporarily dip below the prior year. These discrete items had impacted the first quarter, however, we expect the rate of our financial improvement to accelerate starting in the second quarter. We continue to see gradually improving market conditions and are encouraged about the contributions from our numerous recent acquisitions. In fact, our January month-to-date volumes are positive in every region and total shipments are up mid to high single digits over prior year. 
Let's review our key business factors for full year 2011. Price and mix. Following slight cost inflation in 2010, we expect modestly higher selling prices this year, which should positively impact global sales by up to 1% in 2011. Broadly speaking, prices should improve across all regions.
Sales volume. We expect global shipments will increase between 5% and 10% from 2010 levels. Recent acquisitions should boost volume between 3% and 5%, most notable in the first half of the year. Further, we anticipate organic sales growth will range between 2% and 5%, lead by innovation and overall economic improvement in each region. Please note in North America and Europe, organic growth would yield EBIT contribution margins of between 40% and 60%, depending on the plant. This is higher than normal due to the significant operating leverage to improving volumes that remained in those regions. Contribution margins in emerging markets from both organic and acquisition-related growth would be closer to the historic averages for those respective countries given their high operating rates. Keep in mind that during the first quarter, we will anniversary the contract changes that resulted in lower beer shipments in 2010, so future volume trends should compare more favorably to prior-year levels. And over the course of the year, volume trends should also improve on a year-over-year basis.
Cost inflation. While 2010 cost inflation totaled only $20 million, we anticipate 2011 inflation will range between $150 million and $180 million or about 3% of cost of goods sold. Most of the increase is due to higher raw material prices including soda ash, as well as generally higher energy and labor cost. Currently, we estimate that price improvement in 2011 would partially offset this conditional cost inflation forecast. Having said that, we will continue to seek opportunities over the course of the year to better offset cost pressures with additional higher selling prices.
Other manufacturing and delivery costs. As shipment levels in North America and Europe increase, our operating rates should improve, resulting in lower unabsorbed fixed cost. And we expect productivity and logistic initiative will provide additional benefit. Further, the completion of our footprint efforts in North America will generate $30 million to $35 million of incremental savings across the first half of 2011.
Other costs. We anticipate approximately $70 million to $80 million of additional operating expense and corporate cost, including $20 million of higher non-cash pension expense. As Al mentioned, we expect to further enhance our sales, marketing and innovation capabilities to drive top line growth. This includes our global sales and marketing program and an SAP information system for the Americas. We see these investments as a meaningful way for O-I to advance its strategic priority to strengthen glass marketing.
Overall, the rate of spending will be managed throughout the year depending on our financial performance. Interest expense is expected to increase $35 million in 2011 as we used our balance sheet to finance our recent acquisitions. As we mentioned, our acquisitions will be accretive this year, so improved operating profit from these transactions will more than offset the financing cost.  Our 2011 effective tax rate should approximate 27%. Tax expense and tax payments should be about the same.
Free cash flow. Our major restructuring program is now complete, and we're well positioned for growth in the emerging markets. As a result, CapEx should decline from $500 million in 2010 to approximately $350 million in 2011. Restructuring payments would drop from $61 million in the prior year to approximately $20 million in 2011. Expected pension contribution and asbestos payments are also provided on Chart 7. While we target further working capital efficiency, working capital will most likely be a modest use of cash in 2011 as sales increase. Overall, free cash flow should approximate $300 million this year.
In summary, we expect both improved financial results and greater free cash flow generation in 2011. Now, I'll turn it back to Al on Chart 8."

We have secured our foundation by successfully concluding our three-year program to repair our margins and realign our footprint. Now we have shifted our focus to profitable growth.
In 2011, we will continue to expand our business in attractive emerging markets, including acquisitions. We will further develop our sales and marketing capabilities to profitably grow our business and create innovative packaging solutions for our customers and more differentiation for O-I in the marketplace. And of course, we will continue to drive further operational excellence and apply our know-how to reduce costs. We expect a stronger financial performance in 2011 as a result of these initiatives, and this includes significantly higher free cash flow in 2011 and beyond.

Number one, first of all, our inflation is a projection, and it's really influenced significantly by what could happen in the last few months with regards to commodity prices and with regards to energy prices. We have put a significant focus in the long-term contracts on making sure that we have quarterly pass-through provisions for energy. But still, if you have an escalating energy price development, you still run behind one quarter in each of the successive quarters. Now it may very well be that in the course of the year, there are going to be ups and downs from one quarter to the next. Then, of course, this profile would change a little bit, and we would not have this factor that we would be running behind. With regard to the more stable prices that we have seen in the past with regard to commodities in particular that affects our raw materials, we generally have annual pass-through provisions. And as we have gone into this year, of course, the evolution that we saw last year was pretty mild, so the price adjustment has been fairly low. Now as we go through this escalation of commodity prices in this coming year, we will be running a bit behind, but I think overall, of course, that would fix itself again and in the subsequent year. And I believe that the dynamics that we're seeing are predominantly related, of course, to the longer-term contracts. And now you know that in Europe, which, of course, is a significant share of our business, we only do about 30% of our volume in longer-term contracts. So the contracts in Europe are more determined on a short-term annual basis. And of course, it's very difficult at the beginning of the year, as you negotiate these contracts, to argue that at the end of the year, raw materials are going to be much higher and therefore, the price should be much higher. So I think what we'll see in the course of the year is, hopefully, our competitors in Europe will also see these cost increases coming in, and that will hopefully allow us to do some additional price adjustments. So we'll keep an eye on it, and we'll keep moving to make sure that we get recovery as quickly as we can. But coming into this year with especially the escalations happening so rapidly in the last three months, it's very difficult to really fully include that in our model, so we tended to be a bit more careful."

When I look at the year-over-year inflation, in North America, you're largely on quarterly mechanisms. Europe, I think you said 30%. Your other business is largely negotiated annually, so you'd be able to offset that. So as I look at that $150 million the $180 million that you've got as a rough estimate, would it be safe to assume as we look at that that your mechanisms in normal pricing would offset at least 75% of that or three quarters out of the one quarter you'd be behind of the year? Is that an appropriate way to kind of think about that?"

And as I said, in the energy area, we have pass-through provisions. And at this point in time, of course, it depends on how quickly will energy move in the course of the year because there still is going to be a quarterly lag, and that quarterly lag, if it is a continuous increase throughout the year, you have four quarterly lags that you're not recovering. And they, of course, over the course of the year, add up. The other part is with regard to basic raw materials like our soda ash and other products, those tend to have faster provisions on an annual basis. And there is, of course, when you have a dramatic change or a rapid change in the course of the year, you have to wait until the following year. The third part that I believe is important to consider is that we are also projecting a cost evolution in the course of the year. Now at the beginning of the year as we set our annual contracts, of course, it was very difficult to argue for higher prices in November, December or September, October, November, December that you expect as there is no proof that you can demonstrate to your customers. And of course, that also depends a little bit on how proactive your competitor stands to be in passing through those prospective increases in cost."

And so that strategy is working out very well. With regard to the mix between one-way and refillable, I think that's really an issue that's driven by the overall income levels in those countries. And even though we have strongly emerging middle-class sections in Latin America, as well as in Asia Pacific, the overall income level relative to, let's say, Europe or North America is, of course, still very low. So what we're seeing is continued use of refillable containers as the preferable packaging modality because it does really allow our customers to hit that emerging middle class sooner in the curve because the packaging cost is so low on a per transaction cost that it really allows them to access a broader base of the market but sooner.

You can see the impact of this strategic shift in our financial results. 
Segment operating profit increased more than 8% from the prior year. This increase reflected both our margin repair efforts as we completed our 2010 North American restructuring program as well as emerging market growth, particularly in South America.  Higher operating profit was offset by additional non-operating costs, including pension and interest expense. As a result, O-I reported full-year 2010 adjusted net income of $2.60 per share compared to $2.61 in 2009.
Volumes improved in most of the markets that we served in 2010, especially South America. Shipments also increased across nearly all end-use categories including wine, spirits and food. Here in the mature markets was the notable exception as consumption was down primarily due to continued high unemployment. In total, shipments from continuing operations were down about 1%. Our shipment trends reflect additional volume from acquisitions and volume loss tied to customer contract renegotiations that supported our margin restoration efforts. Excluding these factors, our underlying shipments were up 2% from 2009, which was in line with gradually improving consumption trend. Globally, lower manufacturing and delivery costs reflected the improved operating rate and footprint savings from restructuring activities, which more than offset cost inflation.
The expropriation of our two plants in Venezuela was an unexpected and unfortunate development. However, we are optimistic about the future contributions of our 10 newly acquired plants and the three new furnaces we built this year to serve fast-growing markets in South America and Asia.
Most of the developments I discussed regarding full year 2010 also apply to the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter 2010 adjusted earnings were $0.45 per share compared to $0.43 in 2009. Segment operating profit increased more than 25% over fourth quarter 2009. This improvement was mostly due to higher capacity utilization as the inventory correction we conducted in late 2009 did not repeat, given our positive growth outlook for this year.
Overall, our average fourth quarter selling price was consistent with prior year. Globally, our total shipments were flat with the fourth quarter 2009, while underlying shipments were up 2%, similar to our full year trends.
In the fourth quarter, we completed the acquisition of three plants in China, including one in Guangdong and two near Beijing. We also opened a newly constructed furnace in Auckland, New Zealand.
Looking to 2011, we expect higher shipment and production level. This reflects strong growth and expansion in emerging market. Sales will benefit from organic growth as markets continue to recover. We are also investing in our own sales and marketing innovation capabilities. Part of the strong growth we experienced in our South American region this past year was attributable to a new robust sales and marketing program. We are now implementing this leading practice across all regions in 2011. Further, higher selling prices will partially offset additional cost inflation. 
Free cash flow should improve significantly in 2011. We expect lower restructuring charges and capital expenditures now that we have completed our recent footprint initiatives and invested in new capacity during 2010 for future growth. Overall, 2011 free cash flow should approximate $300 million. Expansion in the high-growth markets will remain our top use of free cash flow.
Now let's review our operating performance on Chart 3. Here, we show segment operating profit and margins for the company, as well as for each of our four regions. Full year profits are on the left and fourth quarter results are on the right. Our full year 2010 segment operating profit was $964 million, up $73 million from last year. Margins improved to 14.6% from around 13.5% in 2009. Favorable foreign currency translation represented $60 million of the year-over-year profit improvement. Most currencies strengthened against the dollar, which helped offset the impact of a weaker euro. Segment operating profit was comparable with the prior year for most regions, with the exception of South America, which posted a significant improvement from 2009.
In Europe, segment profit was $324 million, a decline of $9 million from the prior year, but profits actually increased approximately $10 million in the currency neutral basis. While we did experience some pricing pressure, volumes were up low single digits and operating rates improved. Our North American operating profit of $275 million was just below prior-year results, which is a significant achievement given all the restructuring activity during 2010.
The benefits from higher selling prices and footprint savings offset a 12% volume decline following customer contract renegotiations. Adjusted for these contracts, North American shipments were down slightly from 2009, reflecting a sluggish U.S. beer market.
Our South American segment profit was $224 million, up 55% from 2009, reflecting very strong growth in our business. Shipments improved more than 30% from last year. Most of this increase reflected the rebound in consumption and new product introductions. The balance of the improvement was attributable to new business from acquisitions, additional furnaces and footprint optimization efforts.
Asia-Pacific's operating profit of $141 million increased $10 million on the prior year, added by favorable currency translation. Volume trends in the region varied by country. Shipments were down in Australia and New Zealand, as strong currencies in those countries impacted wine exports. And beer consumption was also down in Australia.
In China, on the other hand, our shipments were boosted by increased consumer demand. To support this growth, we expanded our base in China through several acquisitions, and we also entered into a joint venture in Southeast Asia.
Turning to the fourth quarter. Total operating profit was $221 million, up from $174 million last year, reflecting a strong performance in both North and South America. The impact of currency translation was negligible. Our European operating profit was $50 million, up $10 million from the fourth quarter of 2009.
Average selling prices declined modestly. However, shipment levels improved by low single digits from the prior year, and higher productivity led to lower manufacturing costs. Market conditions continue to vary, but we did see some improvement over the course of the quarter. While beer remained weak, the end-use categories like wine and food showed solid growth.
In North America, operating profit was $53 million, an improvement from $33 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Shipments were down about 10% from the prior year, reflecting the customer contract negotiations that I mentioned earlier. Excluding the impact of those contracts, North American shipments were flat with the prior year. Earnings benefited from improved selling prices, as well as higher productivity now that our current restructuring program is complete.
Our South American operating profit was $82 million, a 70% improvement from the prior year, representing the best performance across our regions. Total shipments were up nearly 50%. Organic growth represented more than half of the increase as a broad-based economic recovery benefited all end-use segments. Our recent acquisitions and new furnaces, which are performing very well, made up the balance of our higher shipments this quarter.
Our Asia-Pacific operating profit was $36 million, a decline of $17 million, as total shipments were down more than 10% from the prior year. This decline reflected challenging market conditions in Australia and New Zealand. Strong currencies in those countries impacted wine exports, higher interest rates, and unfavorable weather conditions in Australia resulted in lower consumer spending, which impacted our customers' sale. In fact, domestic beer consumption was down 10% from the prior year, according to recent retail statistics. 
Volume growth in China was capacity-constrained. To enable future growth, as I mentioned, we acquired three plants in China near year end. We see many opportunities to better serve this expanding market as we drive productivity improvement in these locations. Overall, we faced different challenges and opportunities in 2010, and our segment operating profit improved in both the full year and fourth quarter of 2010.
Going to Chart 4, more importantly, we really expect our operating results to improve further during 2011 as markets continue to recover and our recent acquisitions drive additional profitable growth. As illustrated on Chart 4, we made progress this past year as we completed four acquisitions, one joint venture and constructed three new furnaces. As a result, we have added 10 new plants and 24 new furnaces to our manufacturing footprint in high-growth markets including Brazil, Argentina, Peru, China, Vietnam and Malaysia. O-I is now the largest glass container producer in Brazil and the second larger producer in China, two very important markets for O-I as they both have excellent long-term growth opportunities.  
Our strategy is focused on bolt-on acquisitions, and integration efforts are off to a good start. Overall, we are seeing very promising productivity improvements at these facilities. In total, we expect our expansion investment will be accretive to 2011 earnings and will improve further in future years.
We have been reorienting our business to the growing, emerging markets. As illustrated on the right, we have added a significant number of furnaces in South America, as well as China and Southeast Asia. Now more than 25% of our capacity is in these fast-growing markets. Over time, we will continue to increase our commitment to these emerging markets, and we'll significantly improve the growth profile for O-I.
I will now turn the call over to Ed."

Let's begin our financial review with the fourth quarter reconciliations for sales, operating profit and EPS on Chart 5. Please note that these reconciliations reflect continuing operations only. 2009 amounts have been restated to exclude the impact of our Venezuelan business. The appendix includes more details on this reclassification, as well as our full year 2010 reconciliations.
Fourth quarter 2010 segment sales decreased slightly to $1.7 billion. As expected, price and product mix were essentially flat with the prior year. And, as we have seen all year, cost pass-through provisions in our North American customer contracts resulted in a small impact on sales and had a negligible effect on operating profit.
Moving to sales volume on the following line, glass shipments, in tons, were flat with the prior year on a global basis. Its sales dollars increased by $17 million, reflecting favorable regional sales mix, especially from our acquisitions in South America. Finally, currency translation reduced our top line by $29 million in the fourth quarter. This impact was due to a weaker euro, partially offset by stronger currencies in other countries.
Moving over to segment operating profit, the fourth quarter was $221 million, up $47 million from the same period in 2009. Since price and product mix were essentially flat, they had very little impact on operating profit. While volumes were also flat, operating profit benefited by $7 million from improved regional mix, given the strong growth of higher margin business in South America. Manufacturing and delivery costs decreased $35 million, due to the benefits from footprint savings and higher operating rate. However, this was partially offset by $20 million of cost inflation, mostly driven by higher energy prices.
Finishing with the EPS reconciliation, our adjusted net income was $0.45 per share in the quarter, compared to $0.43 in the prior year. Operating profit was up $0.21 from the prior year. However, earnings were impacted $0.19 from unfavorable non-operating items. These included additional non-cash pension expense, which drove higher corporate cost. We incurred $0.08 of additional interest expense on incremental debt to fund our several accretive acquisitions. Finally, the effective tax rate was higher than last year, reflecting our current regional earnings mix.
I have two comments on GAAP EPS. We reported approximately $160 million of Note 1 charges in the fourth quarter, primarily related to our annual asbestos review and reserve adjustment. And, as we discussed in our 8-K filing last month, we incurred a onetime charge of $329 million in the fourth quarter, to write off our Venezuelan net assets and the related cumulative currency translation adjustments recorded in prior years. The company continues to negotiate with the Venezuelan government with respect to certain aspects of the expropriation, including compensation.
Let's move to Chart 6 for more detail on our balance sheet and on asbestos. Keep in mind, this information reflects Venezuela classified as a discontinued operation for both 2009 and 2010. On December 31, cash was $640 million and total debt was $4.3 billion. Net debt was $3.6 billion, an increase of $785 million from 2009 as we put our healthy balance sheet to work to fund several acquisitions. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was around 2.8x at year-end 2010 and remained within our target leverage range of between 2x and 3x EBITDA. Our underfunded pension liability was $530 million at year-end, compared to $540 million in the prior year. We generated free cash flow from continuing operations of $100 million in 2010, and this was after prefunding approximately $35 million of 2011 tax payments and pension contributions in late December. 
As Al mentioned, 2010 was a year of transition. Capital expenditures peaked as we completed our restructuring activities and, at the same time, we invested in new furnace expansions to support growing markets. Working capital levels remained lean, as we did not need to repeat the significant inventory correction conducted in late 2009. And we are now positioned for more growth this year.
Turning to asbestos. Nothing has changed in the basic pack pattern. During the fourth quarter, we conducted the annual review of our asbestos-related liabilities. As a result, the company recorded a non-cash charge of $170 million in the fourth quarter. This charge compares to $180 million in 2009. Likewise, asbestos payments dropped by $11 million from the prior year.
As illustrated in the chart, about 3,200 new cases were filed in 2010, compared to 6,000 in 2009. The number of total pending cases at the end of 2010 was 5,900, which is 1,000 fewer pendings than the prior year. Overall, asbestos remained a limited and declining liability.
On Chart 7, we present our business outlook for both first quarter and full year 2011. We have provided the usual directional guidance and expanded disclosure for annual price, volume and cost trends, as well as a number of cash flow items. Of course, as with any estimates, they are subject to change throughout the year. Overall, we're looking forward to a good year as we profitably grow our business and significantly improve free cash flow generation. 
Let's review the first quarter trends. As you can see, we expect improved pricing, higher sales volume and lower manufacturing cost. These will more than offset additional cost inflation. But we do expect higher non-operating cost, which I will review further in a minute. In addition, I'd like to highlight a couple of first quarter events.
Sales volumes should be up across all of our regions, including Asia-Pacific. Unfortunately, flooding in Australia this month has affected our customers and our Brisbane plant, which was shut down for several weeks in January. As a result of the flooding and continued challenging market conditions, our first quarter Asia-Pacific segment operating profit could be down modestly from prior-year levels. We greatly appreciate the efforts of our Australian team, which has been working night and day to serve our customers and get the Brisbane plant back into production.
Next, we deferred furnace maintenance in South America during the latter half of 2010, as very strong growth required high operating rate. Now taking advantage of a seasonally slower period, we will be conducting a number of furnace rebuilds across that region during the next 90 days. While total first quarter operating profit in South America will improve modestly from 2009, profit margins will temporarily dip below the prior year. These discrete items had impacted the first quarter; however, we expect the rate of our financial improvement to accelerate starting in the second quarter. We continue to see gradually improving market conditions and are encouraged about the contributions from our numerous recent acquisitions. In fact, our January month-to-date volumes are positive in every region and total shipments are up mid to high single digits over prior year. 
Let's review our key business factors for full year 2011. Price and mix. Following slight cost inflation in 2010, we expect modestly higher selling prices this year, which should positively impact global sales by up to 1% in 2011. Broadly speaking, prices should improve across all regions.
Sales volume. We expect global shipments will increase between 5% and 10% from 2010 levels. Recent acquisitions should boost volume between 3% and 5%, most notable in the first half of the year. Further, we anticipate organic sales growth will range between 2% and 5%, lead by innovation and overall economic improvement in each region. Please note in North America and Europe, organic growth would yield EBIT contribution margins of between 40% and 60%, depending on the plant. This is higher than normal due to the significant operating leverage to improving volumes that remained in those regions. Contribution margins in emerging markets, from both organic and acquisition-related growth, would be closer to the historic averages for those respective countries given their high operating rates. Keep in mind that during the first quarter, we will anniversary the contract changes that resulted in lower beer shipments in 2010, so future volume trends should compare more favorably to prior-year levels. And, over the course of the year, volume trends should also improve on a year-over-year basis.
Cost inflation. While 2010 cost inflation totaled only $20 million, we anticipate 2011 inflation will range between $150 million and $180 million, or about 3% of cost of goods sold. Most of the increase is due to higher raw material prices including soda ash, as well as generally higher energy and labor cost. Currently, we estimate that price improvement in 2011 would partially offset this conditional cost inflation forecast. Having said that, we will continue to seek opportunities over the course of the year to better offset cost pressures with additional higher selling prices.
Other manufacturing and delivery costs. As shipment levels in North America and Europe increase, our operating rates should improve, resulting in lower unabsorbed fixed cost. And we expect productivity and logistic initiative will provide additional benefit. Further, the completion of our footprint efforts in North America will generate $30 million to $35 million of incremental savings across the first half of 2011.
Other costs. We anticipate approximately $70 million to $80 million of additional operating expense and corporate cost, including $20 million of higher non-cash pension expense. As Al mentioned, we expect to further enhance our sales, marketing and innovation capabilities to drive top line growth. This includes our global sales and marketing program and an SAP information system for the Americas. We see these investments as a meaningful way for O-I to advance its strategic priority to strengthen glass marketing.
Overall, the rate of spending will be managed throughout the year, depending on our financial performance. Interest expense is expected to increase $35 million in 2011, as we used our balance sheet to finance our recent acquisitions. As we mentioned, our acquisitions will be accretive this year, so improved operating profit from these transactions will more than offset the financing cost.  Our 2011 effective tax rate should approximate 27%. Tax expense and tax payments should be about the same.
Free cash flow. Our major restructuring program is now complete, and we're well positioned for growth in the emerging markets. As a result, CapEx should decline from $500 million in 2010 to approximately $350 million in 2011. Restructuring payments would drop from $61 million in the prior year to approximately $20 million in 2011. Expected pension contribution and asbestos payments are also provided on Chart 7. While we target further working capital efficiency, working capital will most likely be a modest use of cash in 2011 as sales increase. Overall, free cash flow should approximate $300 million this year.
In summary, we expect both improved financial results and greater free cash flow generation in 2011. Now, I'll turn it back to Al on Chart 8."

Number one, first of all, our inflation is a projection, and it's really influenced significantly by what could happen in the last few months, with regards to commodity prices and with regards to",435,"Yes, Rick, let me try to give you some perspective on that. Number one, first of all, our inflation is a projection, and it's really influenced significantly by what could happen in the last few months, with regards to commodity prices and with regards to energy prices. We have put a significant focus in the long-term contracts on making sure that we have quarterly pass-through provisions for energy. But still, if you have an escalating energy price development, you still run behind one quarter in each of the successive quarters. Now it may very well be that in the course of the year, there are going to be ups and downs from one quarter to the next. Then, of course, this profile would change a little bit, and we would not have this factor that we would be running behind. With regard to the more stable prices that we have seen in the past, with regard to commodities, in particular, that affects our raw materials, we generally have annual pass-through provisions. And as we have gone into this year, of course, the evolution that we saw last year was pretty mild, so the price adjustment has been fairly low. Now as we go through this escalation of commodity prices in this coming year, we will be running a bit behind, but I think overall, of course, that would fix itself again and in the subsequent year. And I believe that the dynamics that we're seeing are predominantly related, of course, to the longer-term contracts. And now you know that in Europe, which, of course, is a significant share of our business, we only do about 30% of our volume in longer-term contracts. So the contracts in Europe are more determined on a short-term annual basis. And of course, it's very difficult at the beginning of the year, as you negotiate these contracts, to argue that at the end of the year, raw materials are going to be much higher and, therefore, the price should be much higher. So I think what we'll see in the course of the year is, hopefully, our competitors in Europe will also see these cost increases coming in, and that will hopefully allow us to do some additional price adjustments. So we'll keep an eye on it, and we'll keep moving to make sure that we get recovery as quickly as we can. But coming into this year, with especially the escalations happening so rapidly in the last three months, it's very difficult to really fully include that in our model, so we tended to be a bit more careful."

And they, of course, over the course of the year, add up. The other part is with regard to basic raw materials like our soda ash and other products, those tend to have faster provisions on an annual basis. And there is, of course, when you have a dramatic change or a rapid change in the course of the year, you have to wait until the following year. The third part that I believe is important to consider is that we are also projecting a cost evolution in the course of the year. Now at the beginning of the year as we set our annual contracts, of course, it was very difficult to argue for higher prices in November, December or September, October, November, December that you expect as there is no proof that you can demonstrate to your customers.

And so that strategy is working out very well. With regard to the mix between one-way and refillable, I think that's really an issue that's driven by the overall income levels in those countries. And even though we have strongly emerging middle-class sections in Latin America, as well as in Asia Pacific, the overall income level relative to, let's say, Europe or North America is, of course, still very low. So what we're seeing is continued use of refillable containers as the preferable packaging modality, because it does really allow our customers to hit that emerging middle class sooner in the curve because the packaging cost is so low on a per transaction cost that it really allows them to access a broader base of the market, but sooner.

Our adjusted earnings were $0.47 per share in the first quarter of 2011, compared to $0.48 last year. Overall, higher shipments and production levels were offset by additional costs, including incremental cost inflation. 
Our total shipments in tons were up 7% over the first quarter of 2010. More than 5% of the increase was attributable to our recent acquisitions in South America and China. The rest came from organic growth, driven primarily by our global sales and marketing initiative, Glass Smart, which is successfully generating profitable business with new and existing customers. 
Sales volumes were up across all regions and end-use categories. Higher shipments increased production levels, and our machine operating rate improved to approximately 93% on a global basis during the first quarter. 
Significant flooding in Australia during January impacted sales and production at our Brisbane plant, which reduced our earnings by $0.04 per share in the first quarter. 
While our selling prices were up slightly, the combined effect of price and product mix was essentially flat with prior year. Overall, additional costs offset the benefit of higher volumes and production levels. We incurred incremental cost inflation due to a higher labor, raw material and energy prices. In particular, energy prices in some markets increased rapidly over the course of the quarter and I'll expand on that later. 
Operating expenses were up as we rolled out our new global Glass Smart sales and marketing program and begin the deployment of our SAP system in North America. Furthermore, additional debt to fund recent and future acquisitions led to a higher interest expense.
We expect to see similar business trends in the second quarter. Shipments will be up in all regions on a year-over-year basis. Our recent acquisitions and continued organic growth will drive stronger volumes as our markets continued to recover. Improved shipments will translate into increased production and higher operating rates. 
Yet we also anticipate higher costs. Cost inflation has accelerated again due to rapidly increasing energy prices. Operating expense and interest expense will also be up in the second quarter. However, a stronger demand profile, as well as terms in our key customer contracts, should support the pass-through of additional cost inflation over the course of 2011, and this should start supporting earnings in the second half of the year. 
Now let me review our operating performance, beginning with Chart 3. Here, we show first quarter segment operating profit for the company, as well for as for each of our 4 regions. Total operating profit was $199 million in the first quarter, up from $193 million last year, primarily driven by stronger performance in both Europe and South America. Our European operating profit was $71 million, up $15 million from the first quarter of 2010. Shipment levels improved by low-single-digits from the prior year, led by stronger growth in both wine and spirits. Demand was particularly strong in France and Spain. 
Despite additional cost inflation, higher production levels led to lower manufacturing costs on a per ton basis. 
In North America, operating profit was $59 million, down from $63 million in the prior year, due to increased investments in several initiatives, including Glass Smart and SAP, which I mentioned previously. 
Shipments in North America were up slightly in the first quarter of 2011, despite poor winter weather and the residual impact from prior year contract renegotiations. Volume trends improved over the quarter, indicating a more favorable run rate heading into the second quarter. In fact, we expect to restart 2 idled furnaces in the second quarter to meet increasing demand. This will improve capacity utilization and benefit segment profits in the second half of the year. 
Our North American team finalized our multi-planned union negotiations in the first quarter, and we believe both parties are satisfied with the terms of this agreement. Importantly, new employees will be eligible for a cash balance pension plan rather than the traditional defined benefit pension plan.
Our South American region generated operating profit of $45 million in the first quarter, a 22% improvement over the prior year. Total shipments were up approximately 50, 5-0 percent. The acquisitions in Brazil and Argentina accounted for 35 percentage points of the volume boost. Robust organic growth represented the rest of this improvement. 
To support rapid growth, we have been importing glass into Brazil. Leveraging our extensive footprint is one of our great strength at O-I, but this has led to increased transportation costs, which impacted our South American margins. Most of the markets that we serve in South America continue to experience robust improvement in their GDP, and our growth rates have exceeded general market trend. This performance underscores the clear appreciation of glass in these markets, as well as the efforts of our entire team in the region. 
Given strong growth, we continue to increase productivity and our current footprint. Also we are planning future capacity expansion in the region, which will help reduce higher transportation costs. 
Our Asia-Pacific operating profit was $24 million, down $13 million compared to the first quarter last year. $9 million of the decline pertained to the flooding in Queensland, Australia, which shut down our plant in Brisbane for several weeks. Our Australian team did a great job bringing the plant back into production safely and serving our customers during this very challenging situation. 
Total glass container shipments were down more than 10% in Australia and New Zealand. In addition to weather issues, the strong Australian and New Zealand dollars negatively impacted exports, particularly wine. Also higher interest rates have reduced disposable income and domestic consumption levels in those countries. 
Growth remains strong in China, and we have begun integrating the 3 plants we purchased in the fourth quarter. One of our recent acquisitions is just outside the city of Guangzhou, and we are in the process of expanding capacity at this new site and selling our property in the Guangzhou central business district that will be developed for other retail or commercial uses. We expect the proceeds from this sale will fund our future expansion in the area. And as a result, we will both increase our capacity and improve our overall cost position in one of China's most important glass markets. 
Globally, we are seeing market conditions improve, and our recent acquisitions are beginning to generate real value for O-I.  And I'll now turn the call over to Ed."

First quarter 2011 segment sales increased 10% to almost $1.7 billion. The combined effect of price and mix was essentially flat with last year. While average selling prices increased slightly compared to the prior year, this increase was offset by a shift in product mix as beer business began to improve. Normally, we break out the impact on price of North American monthly or quarterly cost pass-through provisions. However, the impact was immaterial in the first quarter as natural gas prices have not shifted much, and escalating freight costs should be passed through in future periods. 
7% higher sales volume increased the top line by $95 million, reflecting both additional organic sales and benefits from last year's acquisitions. Finally, currency translation increased our top line by $59 million in the first quarter. 
Moving over to segment operating profit. The first quarter was $199 million, up $6 million from the same period last year. Segment operating profit benefited slightly from price and mix. Higher volumes improved operating profit by $18 million, largely driven by strong growth of higher margin business in South America. Manufacturing and delivery costs increased $6 million. The combination of inflation of $49 million this quarter and the $9 million impact of the Brisbane plant flooding, offset the $52 million benefit from last year's footprint activities and from higher capacity utilization this year. 
As expected, operating expense increased $12 million, reflecting investments made in several initiatives that Al mentioned, including Glass Smart in our North American SAP deployment, and currency translation provided a small benefit this quarter. 
Overall in the first quarter, we saw about $40 million to $45 million of contribution from positive operating leverage, driven by organic growth. This is reflected in both the volume line and the benefit of the higher capacity utilization, which flows through manufacturing and delivery. 
Operating leverage was most pronounced in Europe and was the biggest factor that led to Europe's 27% year-over-year increase in segment profits this quarter. However, cost inflation offset operating leverage, and we will review this factor more in a minute. 
Finishing with the EPS reconciliation, our adjusted net income was $0.47 per share in the quarter compared to $0.48 in the prior year quarter. Operating profit was up $0.03 from the prior year and reflected the benefits of higher sales and production volumes this quarter. Earnings were impacted $0.04 from unfavorable nonoperating items, largely due to higher interest expense on incremental debt to fund future acquisitions as well as those completed during 2010. Corporate and retained costs were down slightly from the prior year, mostly due to the benefit of additional machine and equipment sales during the quarter. 
Furthermore, certain corporate initiatives, including our glass advertising campaign, as well as other supply chain and IT projects, were light in the first quarter but will ramp up as the year progresses. 
Finally, our only Note 1 item this quarter was a $6 million after-tax restructuring charge related to the closure of our plant in Guangzhou and the planned sale of this property that Al mentioned earlier. 
Let's move to Chart 5 for more detail on our balance sheet and free cash flow. On March 31, 2011, cash was $430 million, and total debt was nearly $4.4 billion. So net debt was $3.9 billion, an increase of over $900 million from the first quarter of last year as we put our balance sheet to work to fund several acquisitions in 2010. 
Our net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio was about 3 at the end of the first quarter, and that's at the upper end of our annual leverage target of between 2x and 3x EBITDA. 
Shifting to free cash flow. Please keep in mind that seasonality in our business usually results in the use of cash in the first half of the calendar year, followed by a strong source of cash in the back half of the year. The first quarter was a $158 million use of free cash flow compared to $80 million use of cash in the first quarter last year. This greater use of cash was due to a larger increase in working capital compared to the first quarter of 2010. The working capital increase this year reflected higher receivables due to sales growth and additional inventories to support seasonally stronger shipment. However, the working capital investment was partially offset by lower capital expenditures, restructuring payments and asbestos payments. 
Regarding asbestos, let me reiterate our position, given the recent unfavorable jury verdict in McLean County, Illinois. First, our basic fact pattern has not changed, and asbestos remains a limited and declining liability for the company. As far as the recent jury verdict, we continue to deny the conspiracy claim made in this case and will vigorously challenge this verdict if necessary in the appellate courts. O-I, as well as other defendants, have successfully challenged similar conspiracy jury verdicts in the past. Therefore, we have not made any changes to our asbestos-related liability, and we do not anticipate any changes to our 2011 financial outlook as a result of this case.
Now moving to the right side of Chart 5, you see our debt maturity schedule as of the end of the first quarter. Our most current bonds are not due until 2014, so that leaves only the bank debt due prior to that time. Given current attractive credit markets, we are in discussions with our bank group regarding refinancing options of our bank credit agreement in the second quarter.
On Chart 6, we present our business outlook for the second quarter. I will walk through the usual directional guidance on key business drivers that affect earnings and cash flow and will also provide an update on cost inflation. 
Let's review each of the key business factors, starting with price mix. Given modest cost inflation in 2010, we saw only minimal benefit from annual cost pass-through provision in the first quarter this year. Consistent with this, prices should be up only slightly in the second quarter, and we expect this benefit will be offset by a change in mix. However, we anticipate a more receptive marketplace for higher pricing over the course of this year, particularly in Europe. Al will expand on this shortly.
Sales volume, like the first quarter, we expect second quarter shipment trends will remain in line with our full year outlook for volume, which we anticipate will improve between 5% and 10% from 2010 levels. 
Cost inflation. On our last earnings call, we provided a 2011 inflation outlook that ranged between $150 million and $180 million. Since that time, we've seen a number of events impact the global energy market. Well I would like to update you on our energy exposure by region. In South America and Asia-Pacific, the clear majority of our energy is purchased under annual fixed agreements. 
In North America, more than 85% of our customer agreements include monthly or quarterly cost pass-through provisions. So we have limited exposure to further escalating energy prices in those regions during 2011. 
In Europe, a majority of our energy spend is fixed for 2011, but the remainder is subject to market pricing, especially natural gas. Given recent volatility in European energy prices, which is impacting our variable price position, we are providing more information on the right-hand side of this chart. If average first quarter energy prices in Europe persists for the full year, our global 2011 cost inflation should approximate $200 million. The annualized impact would, of course, be even higher than this projection if we didn't have the majority of energy already covered by fixed price contracts. 
We estimate that a 5% change in European energy prices, mostly natural gas from the first quarter average, impacts our energy costs in the region by $7 million to $10 million on an annual basis. While it is very difficult at this stage to accurately forecast energy inflation this year, this information should provide additional insights on our cost profile.
Now moving to other manufacturing and delivery costs. We expect to see footprint savings and higher operating rates benefit our manufacturing costs in the second quarter. 
Other costs. Regional operating expense should increase $10 million from the prior year due to the investments in Glass Smart and SAP. Corporate costs will increase about $8 million to $10 million from the prior year, mostly due to higher pension expense and various corporate initiatives. 
Finally, second quarter net interest expense should remain in line with first quarter levels. Now I will turn it back to Al."

I would like to comment on the market dynamics we have seen over the last few years and add some more recent observations, and I will focus on Europe, given our energy exposure there.

I would like to comment on the market dynamics we have seen over the last few years and add some more recent observations, and I will focus on Europe, given our energy exposure there. 
Since 2007, we have increased our selling prices to successfully repair our margins even during the recession. Yet in 2010, our prices in Europe declined slightly, given the combination of cost deflation and soft market conditions in the region. While we maintained our focus on price, some of our European competitors took a different route, reporting price deterioration of more than 6% while at full capacity utilization. 
We were still seeing pockets of pricing pressure this last fall when we negotiated our 2011 annual European customer contracts. Since then, several things have changed in Europe. Demand for glass containers has strengthened, and energy prices have rapidly increased. Our long-term European customer contracts contain pass-through provisions that allow us to recover inflation albeit with some time delay. But most of our business in Europe is covered by annual contracts based on pricing that was set last fall. Nevertheless, because market conditions have changed so significantly, we have notified these customers that we are instituting an energy surcharge to recover rapidly escalating fuel costs. 
As we look through the balance of 2011, demand should improve further, especially as we enter the summer season in Europe. Supply is tightening, in part due to the permanent capacity closures over the last 2 years. 
Strong demand, tightening supply and cost inflation are clear signals that the tide is turning, and this sets the stage for a more robust 2012 pricing negotiation, which will commence later this year. Also, our annual cost pass-through provisions on long-term contracts will result in higher 2012 pricing. 
Globally, we are also seeing stronger demand and tightening supply, in particular as markets improve in Europe and North America, there is less capacity or less excess capacity, I should say, available to supply the fast-growing emerging regions. As a result, we are restarting the 2 furnaces in North America and plan to add capacity in Latin America and China. This should support continued improvement in free cash flow generation. 
Of course, we will remain flexible and respond to changing market conditions. Over the long term, we do, of course, remain committed to our business strategy. That means we will continue to expand in attractive emerging markets, both through acquisitions and organic growth initiatives. We are investing in innovation and technology, and we are strengthening our ability to offer our customers innovative and brand differentiating glass packaging solutions. Through our execution of these strategies, we expect to create additional shareholder value and to increase free cash flow to approximately $300 million in 2011.

One thing that perhaps rounds out this picture, because it's not just a North American situation where markets are tight, it's really across-the-board with the exception of Australia and New Zealand. One of our competitors in the Americas has notified their customers in the wine business, I believe, it was that they need 100 days lead time for orders. And then Europe, while we've seen one competitor going out and asking for 6 months lead time on orders.

You know from past discussions that about 70% of our volume in Europe is subject to these annual contracts, and I think if you look around at our competitors, they have very similar approaches and percentages. Now clearly, we have to go out with this surcharge, and it's a modification of an agreement that we made a couple of months ago so it will require some give and take in that process. It will depend very largely, of course, on whether there is supporting move by others that are seeing the same inflation rate. If we have, I don't think that's the case but if we should have competitors that don't see inflation, then of course, that will make that a little bit more difficult. However, one other aspect that we have to take into consideration is that those competitors that last year filled their capacity with more aggressive pricing, of course, have very little room now to get productivity improvements in the course of this year to absorb some of the brunt. So I would assume that the inflation pressure on quite a few of our competitors is in fact much more substantially greater than in our case, so I'm generally very positive about our ability to get a decent recovery of some of the inflation that we're seeing in the energy sector."

And if you look at the brewers that have reported from that region, it's quite obvious that they're all suffering quite significantly, and nobody at this point in time is yet making a big prediction of a recovery. That maybe due to the fact, of course, that we're running into the winter season now in Australia and New Zealand so it's very difficult to see any strong demand anyway. So everybody is really waiting for the end of this year, which is moving in through the spring and summer period for them to see whether that's going to recover. Our activities, however, in the last 8 or 9 months have been to fairly heavily go into other sectors of the market as well. We've been trying to get greater position with our light weighted bottles for the wine industry, even though that overall wine export is declining but still, our share of that business is improving. So it's going to be a while I think before they recover. I would say, and I tell the people in Australia that it's almost like they went into the recession with a 2-year time delay."

However, the secondary aspect that we looked at as well is competitive positioning with regard to what's happening with plastics, what's happening with aluminum. And there we see the same push as well. So I would say, if we will see an impact, it's most will be an impact that will be reflected on a broad basis in the economy rather than specifically to the markets that we serve."

Our adjusted earnings were $0.47 per share in the first quarter of 2011, compared to $0.48 last year. Overall, higher shipments and production levels were offset by additional costs, including incremental cost inflation.",1071,"Thank you, John, and good morning. Our adjusted earnings were $0.47 per share in the first quarter of 2011, compared to $0.48 last year. Overall, higher shipments and production levels were offset by additional costs, including incremental cost inflation. 
Our total shipments in tonnes were up 7% over the first quarter of 2010. More than 5% of the increase was attributable to our recent acquisitions in South America and China. The rest came from organic growth, driven primarily by our global sales and marketing initiative, Glass Smart, which is successfully generating profitable business with new and existing customers. 
Sales volumes were up across all regions and end-use categories. Higher shipments increased production levels, and our machine operating rate improved to approximately 93% on a global basis during the first quarter. 
Significant flooding in Australia during January impacted sales and production at our Brisbane plant, which reduced our earnings by $0.04 per share in the first quarter. 
While our selling prices were up slightly, the combined effect of price and product mix was essentially flat with prior year. Overall, additional costs offset the benefit of higher volumes and production levels. We incurred incremental cost inflation due to a higher labor, raw material and energy prices. In particular, energy prices in some markets increased rapidly over the course of the quarter and I'll expand on that later. 
Operating expenses were up as we roll out our new global Glass Smart sales and marketing program and begin the deployment of our SAP system in North America. Furthermore, additional debt to fund the recent and future acquisitions led to a higher interest expense.
We expect to see similar business trends in the second quarter. Shipments will be up in all regions on a year-over-year basis. Our recent acquisitions and continued organic growth will drive stronger volumes as our markets continue to recover. Improved shipments will translate into increased production and higher operating rates. 
Yet we also anticipate higher costs. Cost inflation has accelerated again due to rapidly increasing energy prices. Operating expense and interest expense will also be up in the second quarter. However, a stronger demand profile, as well as terms in our key customer contracts, should support the pass-through of additional cost inflation over the course of 2011, and this should start supporting earnings in the second half of the year. 
Now let me review our operating performance, beginning with Chart 3. Here, we show first quarter segment operating profits for the company, as well as for each of our 4 regions. Total operating profit was $199 million in the first quarter, up from $193 million last year, primarily driven by stronger performance in both Europe and South America. Our European operating profit was $71 million, up $15 million from the first quarter of 2010. Shipment levels improved by low-single-digits from the prior year, led by stronger growth in both wine and spirits. Demand was particularly strong in France and Spain. 
Despite additional cost inflation, higher production levels led to lower manufacturing costs on a per tonne basis. 
In North America, operating profit was $59 million, down from $63 million in the prior year, due to the increased investments and several initiatives, including Glass Smart and SAP, which I mentioned previously. 
Shipments in North America were up slightly in the first quarter of 2011, despite poor winter weather and the residual impact from prior year contract renegotiations. Volume trends improved over the quarter, indicating a more favorable run rate heading into the second quarter. In fact, we expect to restart 2 idled furnaces in the second quarter to meet increasing demand. This will improve capacity utilization and benefit segment profits in the second half of the year. 
Our North American team finalized our multi-planned union negotiations in the first quarter, and we believe both parties are satisfied with the terms of this agreement. Importantly, new hourly employees will be eligible for a cash balance pension plan rather than the traditional defined benefit pension plan.
Our South American region generated operating profit of $45 million in the first quarter, a 22% improvement over the prior year. Total shipments were up approximately 50%, 5-0 percent. The acquisitions in Brazil and Argentina accounted for 35 percentage points of the volume boost. Robust organic growth represented the rest of this improvement. 
To support rapid growth, we have been importing glass into Brazil. Leveraging our extensive footprint is one of our great strength at O-I, but this has led to increased transportation costs, which impacted our South American margins. Most of the markets that we serve in South America continue to experience robust improvement in their GDP, and our growth rates have exceeded general market trend. This performance underscores the clear appreciation of glass in these markets, as well as the efforts of our entire team in the region. 
Given strong growth, we continue to increase productivity in our current footprint. Also we are planning future capacity expansion in the region, which will help reduce higher transportation costs. 
Our Asia Pacific operating profit was $24 million, down $13 million compared to the first quarter last year. $9 million of the decline pertained to the flooding in Queensland, Australia, which shut down our plant in Brisbane for several weeks. Our Australian team did a great job bringing the plant back into production safely and serving our customers during this very challenging situation. 
Total glass container shipments were down more than 10% in Australia and New Zealand. In addition to weather issues, the strong Australian and New Zealand dollars negatively impacted exports, particularly wine. Also higher interest rates have reduced disposable income and domestic consumption levels in those countries. 
Growth remains strong in China, and we have begun integrating the 3 plants we purchased in the fourth quarter. One of our recent acquisitions is just outside the city of Guangzhou, and we are in the process of expanding capacity at this new site and selling our property in the Guangzhou central business district that will be developed for other retail or commercial uses. We expect the proceeds from this sale will fund our future expansion in the area. And as a result, we will both increase our capacity and improve our overall cost position in one of China's most important glass markets. 
Globally, we are seeing market conditions improve, and our recent acquisitions are beginning to generate real value for O-I.  And I'll now turn the call over to Ed."

The combined effect of price and mix was essentiall",1440,"Thanks, Al. Let's begin our financial review, with the first quarter reconciliations for sales, operating profit and EPS on Chart 4. First quarter 2011 segment sales increased 10% to almost $1.7 billion. The combined effect of price and mix was essentially flat with last year. While average selling prices increased slightly compared to the prior year, this increase was offset by a shift in product mix as beer business began to improve. Normally, we break out the impact on price of North American monthly or quarterly cost pass-through provisions. However, the impact was immaterial in the first quarter as natural gas prices have not shifted much, and escalating freight costs should be passed through in future periods. 
7% higher sales volume increased the top line by $95 million, reflecting both additional organic sales and benefits from last year's acquisitions. Finally, currency translation increased our top line by $59 million in the first quarter. 
Moving over to segment operating profit. The first quarter was $199 million, up $6 million from the same period last year. Segment operating profit benefited slightly from price and mix. Higher volumes improved operating profit by $18 million, largely driven by strong growth of higher margin business in South America. Manufacturing and delivery costs increased $6 million. The combination of inflation of $49 million this quarter and the $9 million impact of the Brisbane plant flooding, offset the $52 million benefit from last year's footprint activities and from higher capacity utilization this year. 
As expected, operating expense increased $12 million, reflecting investments made in several initiatives that Al mentioned, including Glass Smart in our North American SAP deployment. And currency translation provided a small benefit this quarter. 
Overall in the first quarter, we saw about $40 million to $45 million of contribution from positive operating leverage, driven by organic growth. This is reflected in both the volume line and the benefit of the higher capacity utilization, which flows through manufacturing and delivery. 
Operating leverage was most pronounced in Europe and was the biggest factor that led to Europe's 27% year-over-year increase in segment profits this quarter. However, cost inflation offset operating leverage, and we will review this factor more in a minute. 
Finishing with the EPS reconciliation, our adjusted net income was $0.47 per share in the quarter compared to $0.48 in the prior year quarter. Operating profit was up $0.03 from the prior year and reflected the benefits of higher sales and production volumes this quarter. Earnings were impacted $0.04 from unfavorable nonoperating items, largely due to higher interest expense on incremental debt to fund future acquisitions as well as those completed during 2010. Corporate and retained costs were down slightly from the prior year, mostly due to the benefit of additional machine and equipment sales during the quarter. 
Furthermore, certain corporate initiatives, including our glass advertising campaign, as well as other supply chain and IT projects, were light in the first quarter but will ramp up as the year progresses. 
Finally, our only Note 1 item this quarter was a $6 million after-tax restructuring charge related to the closure of our plant in Guangzhou and the planned sale of its property that Al mentioned earlier. 
Let's move to Chart 5 for more detail on our balance sheet and free cash flow. On March 31, 2011, cash was $430 million, and total debt was nearly $4.4 billion. So net debt was $3.9 billion, an increase of over $900 million from the first quarter of last year as we put our balance sheet to work to fund several acquisitions in 2010. 
Our net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio was about 3 at the end of the first quarter, and that's at the upper end of our annual leverage target of between 2x and 3x EBITDA. 
Shifting to free cash flow. Please keep in mind that seasonality in our business usually results in the use of cash in the first half of the calendar year, followed by a strong source of cash in the back half of the year. The first quarter was a $158 million use of free cash flow compared to $80 million use of cash in the first quarter last year. This greater use of cash was due to a larger increase in working capital compared to the first quarter of 2010. The working capital increase this year reflected higher receivables due to sales growth and additional inventories to support seasonally stronger shipment. However, the working capital investment was partially offset by lower capital expenditures, restructuring payments and asbestos payments. 
Regarding asbestos, let me reiterate our position, given the recent unfavorable jury verdict in McLean County, Illinois. First, our basic fact pattern has not changed, and asbestos remains a limited and declining liability for the company. As far as the recent jury verdict, we continue to deny the conspiracy claim made in this case and will vigorously challenge this verdict if necessary in the appellate courts. O-I, as well as other defendants, have successfully challenged similar conspiracy jury verdicts in the past. Therefore, we have not made any changes to our asbestos-related liability, and we do not anticipate any changes to our 2011 financial outlook as a result of this case.
Now moving to the right side of Chart 5, you see our debt maturity schedule as of the end of the first quarter. Our most current bonds are not due until 2014, so that leaves only the bank debt due prior to that time. Given current attractive credit markets, we are in discussions with our bank group regarding refinancing options of our bank credit agreement in the second quarter.
On Chart 6, we present our business outlook for the second quarter. I will walk through the usual directional guidance on key business drivers that affect earnings and cash flow and will also provide an update on cost inflation. 
Let's review each of the key business factors, starting with price mix. Given modest cost inflation in 2010, we saw only minimal benefit from annual cost pass-through provisions in the first quarter this year. Consistent with this, prices should be up only slightly in the second quarter, and we expect this benefit will be offset by a change in mix. However, we anticipate a more receptive marketplace for higher pricing over the course of this year, particularly in Europe. Al will expand on this shortly.
Sales volume, like the first quarter, we expect second quarter shipment trends will remain in line with our full year outlook for volume, which we anticipate will improve between 5% and 10% from 2010 levels. 
Cost inflation. On our last earnings call, we provided a 2011 inflation outlook that ranged between $150 million and $180 million. Since that time, we've seen a number of events impact the global energy markets. Well I would like to update you on our energy exposure by region. In South America and Asia Pacific, the clear majority of our energy is purchased under annual fixed agreements. 
In North America, more than 85% of our customer agreements include monthly or quarterly cost pass-through provisions. So we have limited exposure to further escalating energy prices in those regions during 2011. 
In Europe, a majority of our energy spend is fixed for 2011, but the remainder is subject to market pricing, especially natural gas. Given the recent volatility in European energy prices, which is impacting our variable price position, we are providing more information on the right-hand side of this chart. If average first quarter energy prices in Europe persists for the full year, our global 2011 cost inflation should approximate $200 million. The annualized impact would, of course, be even higher than this projection if we didn't have the majority of energy already covered by fixed price contracts. 
We estimate that a 5% change in European energy prices, mostly natural gas from the first quarter average, impacts our energy costs in the region by $7 million to $10 million on an annual basis. While it is very difficult at this stage to accurately forecast energy inflation this year, this information should provide additional insights on our cost profile.
Now moving to other manufacturing and delivery costs. We expect to see footprint savings and higher operating rates benefit our manufacturing costs in the second quarter. 
Other costs. Regional operating expense should increase $10 million from the prior year due to the investments in Glass Smart and SAP. Corporate costs will increase about $8 million to $10 million from the prior year, mostly due to higher pension expense and various corporate initiatives. 
Finally, second quarter net interest expense should remain in line with first quarter levels. Now I will turn it back to Al."

I would like to comment on the market dynamics we have seen over the last few years and add some more recent observations, and I will focus on Europe, given our energy exposure there. 
Since 2007, we have increased our selling prices to successfully repair our margins even during the recession. Yet in 2010, our prices in Europe declined slightly, given the combination of cost deflation and soft market conditions in the region. While we maintained our focus on price, some of our European competitors took a different route, reporting price deterioration of more than 6% while at full capacity utilization. 
We were still seeing pockets of pricing pressure this last fall when we negotiated our 2011 annual European customer contracts. Since then, several things have changed in Europe. Demand for our glass containers has strengthened, and energy prices have rapidly increased. Our long-term European customer contracts contain pass-through provisions that allow us to recover inflation albeit with some time delay. But most of our business in Europe is covered by annual contracts based on pricing that was set last fall. Nevertheless, because market conditions have changed so significantly, we have notified these customers that we are instituting an energy surcharge to recover rapidly escalating fuel costs. 
As we look through the balance of 2011, demand should improve further, especially as we enter the summer season in Europe. Supply is tightening, in part due to the permanent capacity closures over the last 2 years. 
Strong demand, tightening supply and cost inflation are clear signals that the tide is turning, and this sets the stage for a more robust 2012 pricing negotiation, which will commence later this year. Also, our annual cost pass-through provisions on long-term contracts will result in higher 2012 pricing. 
Globally, we are also seeing stronger demand and tightening supply. In particular as markets improve in Europe and North America, there is less capacity or less excess capacity, I should say, available to supply the fast-growing emerging regions. As a result, we are restarting the 2 furnaces in North America and plan to add capacity in Latin America and China. This should support continued improvement in free cash flow generation. 
Of course, we will remain flexible and respond to changing market conditions. Over the long term, we do, of course, remain committed to our business strategy. That means we will continue to expand in attractive emerging markets, both through acquisitions and organic growth initiatives. We are investing in innovation and technology, and we are strengthening our ability to offer our customers innovative and brand differentiating glass packaging solutions. Through our execution of these strategies, we expect to create additional shareholder value and to increase free cash flow to approximately $300 million in 2011. Thank you, and now, I will ask Angela to open up the lines for your questions."

With the demand profiles and projections that we're seeing at this point in time, we just don't think we can let our customers run that risk to be unsupplied for their demand. So as we sell this inventory then, of course, that is automatically then going to generate the cash, and that's why our confidence level of the $300 million is still in place."

You know from past discussions that about 70% of our volume in Europe is subject to these annual contracts, and I think if you look around at our competitors, they have a very similar approaches and percentages. Now clearly, we have to go out with this surcharge, and it's a modification of an agreement that we made a couple of months ago so it will require some give and take in that process. It will depend very largely, of course, on whether there is supporting move by others that are seeing the same inflation rate. If we have, I don't think that's the case but if we should have competitors that don't see inflation, then of course, that will make that a little bit more difficult. However, one other aspect that we have to take into consideration is that those competitors that last year filled their capacity with more aggressive pricing, of course, have very little room now to get productivity improvements in the course of this year to absorb some of the brunt. So I would assume that the inflation pressure on quite a few of our competitors is in fact much more substantially greater than in our case, so I'm generally very positive about our ability to get a decent recovery of some of the inflation that we're seeing in the energy sector."

There was a combination, of course, you all have heard about the floods and the wet summer that Australia had so that may have had an impact. But what we're really seeing is that the policy of the central bank in Australia, which is driven really by the raw material boom that Australia is experiencing, is raising the interest rates, and most of the mortgages in Australia are variable mortgages and pulling a lot of purchasing power out of the population.  And that has had quite a bit of impact on beer sales. And if you look at the brewers that have reported from that region, it's quite obvious that they're all suffering quite significantly, and nobody at this point in time is yet making a big prediction of a recovery. That maybe due to the fact, of course, that we're running into the winter season now in Australia and New Zealand. So it's very difficult to see any strong demand anyway. So everybody is really waiting for the end of this year, which is moving in through the spring and summer period for them to see whether that's going to recover. Our activities, however, in the last 8 or 9 months have been to fairly heavily go into other sectors of the market as well. We've been trying to get greater position with our light weighted bottles for the wine industry, even though that overall wine export is declining but still, our share of that segment is improving. So it's going to be a while I think before they recover. I would say, and I tell the people in Australia that it's almost like they went into the recession with a 2-year time delay."

One is with regard to the overall purchasing power of the population and of the consumers, so transportation if costs become very high, if many other factors that have an energy component get passed through to the consumer, eventually there's, of course, going to impact their overall purchasing power and that may then potentially also impact consumables. However, the secondary aspect that we looked at as well is competitive positioning with regard to what's happening with plastics, what's happening with aluminum.

Today, we will discuss key business developments, review our financial results for the first quarter and discuss future trends affecting our business in 2011. Following our prepared remarks, we'll host a question-and-answer session. Presentation materials for this earnings call are also being simulcast on the company's website at o-i.com. Please review the Safe Harbor comments and disclosure of our use of non-GAAP financial measures included in those materials. 
Unless otherwise noted, the financial results we are presenting today relate to adjusted net earnings, which exclude certain items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings can be found in our earnings press release and in the appendix to this presentation.
I'll now turn the call over to Al, who will start on Chart 2."

Our adjusted earnings were $0.47 per share in the first quarter of 2011, compared to $0.48 last year. Overall, higher shipments and production levels were offset by additional costs, including incremental cost inflation. 
Our total shipments in tonnes were up 7% over the first quarter of 2010. More than 5% of the increase was attributable to our recent acquisitions in South America and China. The rest came from organic growth, driven primarily by our global sales and marketing initiative, Glass Smart, which is successfully generating profitable business with new and existing customers. 
Sales volumes were up across all regions and end-use categories. Higher shipments increased production levels, and our machine operating rate improved to approximately 93% on a global basis during the first quarter. 
Significant flooding in Australia during January impacted sales and production at our Brisbane plant, which reduced our earnings by $0.04 per share in the first quarter. 
While our selling prices were up slightly, the combined effect of price and product mix was essentially flat with prior year. Overall, additional costs offset the benefit of higher volumes and production levels. We incurred incremental cost inflation due to a higher labor, raw material and energy prices. In particular, energy prices in some markets increased rapidly over the course of the quarter and I'll expand on that later. 
Operating expenses were up as we roll out our new global Glass Smart sales and marketing program and begin the deployment of our SAP system in North America. Furthermore, additional debt to fund the recent and future acquisitions led to a higher interest expense.
We expect to see similar business trends in the second quarter. Shipments will be up in all regions on a year-over-year basis. Our recent acquisitions and continued organic growth will drive stronger volumes as our markets continue to recover. Improved shipments will translate into increased production and higher operating rates. 
Yet we also anticipate higher costs. Cost inflation has accelerated again due to rapidly increasing energy prices. Operating expense and interest expense will also be up in the second quarter. However, a stronger demand profile, as well as terms in our key customer contracts, should support the pass-through of additional cost inflation over the course of 2011, and this should start supporting earnings in the second half of the year. 
Now let me review our operating performance, beginning with Chart 3. Here, we show first quarter segment operating profits for the company, as well as for each of our 4 regions. Total operating profit was $199 million in the first quarter, up from $193 million last year, primarily driven by stronger performance in both Europe and South America. Our European operating profit was $71 million, up $15 million from the first quarter of 2010. Shipment levels improved by low-single-digits from the prior year, led by stronger growth in both wine and spirits. Demand was particularly strong in France and Spain. 
Despite additional cost inflation, higher production levels led to lower manufacturing costs on a per tonne basis. 
In North America, operating profit was $59 million, down from $63 million in the prior year, due to the increased investments and several initiatives, including Glass Smart and SAP, which I mentioned previously. 
Shipments in North America were up slightly in the first quarter of 2011, despite poor winter weather and the residual impact from prior year contract renegotiations. Volume trends improved over the quarter, indicating a more favorable run rate heading into the second quarter. In fact, we expect to restart 2 idled furnaces in the second quarter to meet increasing demand. This will improve capacity utilization and benefit segment profits in the second half of the year. 
Our North American team finalized our multi-planned union negotiations in the first quarter, and we believe both parties are satisfied with the terms of this agreement. Importantly, new hourly employees will be eligible for a cash balance pension plan rather than the traditional defined benefit pension plan.
Our South American region generated operating profit of $45 million in the first quarter, a 22% improvement over the prior year. Total shipments were up approximately 50%, 5-0 percent. The acquisitions in Brazil and Argentina accounted for 35 percentage points of the volume boost. Robust organic growth represented the rest of this improvement. 
To support rapid growth, we have been importing glass into Brazil. Leveraging our extensive footprint is one of our great strength at O-I, but this has led to increased transportation costs, which impacted our South American margins. Most of the markets that we serve in South America continue to experience robust improvement in their GDP, and our growth rates have exceeded general market trend. This performance underscores the clear appreciation of glass in these markets, as well as the efforts of our entire team in the region. 
Given strong growth, we continue to increase productivity in our current footprint. Also we are planning future capacity expansion in the region, which will help reduce higher transportation costs. 
Our Asia Pacific operating profit was $24 million, down $13 million compared to the first quarter last year. $9 million of the decline pertained to the flooding in Queensland, Australia, which shut down our plant in Brisbane for several weeks. Our Australian team did a great job bringing the plant back into production safely and serving our customers during this very challenging situation. 
Total glass container shipments were down more than 10% in Australia and New Zealand. In addition to weather issues, the strong Australian and New Zealand dollars negatively impacted exports, particularly wine. Also higher interest rates have reduced disposable income and domestic consumption levels in those countries. 
Growth remains strong in China, and we have begun integrating the 3 plants we purchased in the fourth quarter. One of our recent acquisitions is just outside the city of Guangzhou, and we are in the process of expanding capacity at this new site and selling our property in the Guangzhou central business district that will be developed for other retail or commercial uses. We expect the proceeds from this sale will fund our future expansion in the area. And as a result, we will both increase our capacity and improve our overall cost position in one of China's most important glass markets. 
Globally, we are seeing market conditions improve, and our recent acquisitions are beginning to generate real value for O-I.  And I'll now turn the call over to Ed."

First quarter 2011 segment sales increased 10% to almost $1.7 billion. The combined effect of price and mix was essentially flat with last year. While average selling prices increased slightly compared to the prior year, this increase was offset by a shift in product mix as beer business began to improve. Normally, we break out the impact on price of North American monthly or quarterly cost pass-through provisions. However, the impact was immaterial in the first quarter as natural gas prices have not shifted much, and escalating freight costs should be passed through in future periods. 
7% higher sales volume increased the top line by $95 million, reflecting both additional organic sales and benefits from last year's acquisitions. Finally, currency translation increased our top line by $59 million in the first quarter. 
Moving over to segment operating profit. The first quarter was $199 million, up $6 million from the same period last year. Segment operating profit benefited slightly from price and mix. Higher volumes improved operating profit by $18 million, largely driven by strong growth of higher margin business in South America. Manufacturing and delivery costs increased $6 million. The combination of inflation of $49 million this quarter and the $9 million impact of the Brisbane plant flooding, offset the $52 million benefit from last year's footprint activities and from higher capacity utilization this year. 
As expected, operating expense increased $12 million, reflecting investments made in several initiatives that Al mentioned, including Glass Smart and our North American SAP deployment. And currency translation provided a small benefit this quarter. 
Overall in the first quarter, we saw about $40 million to $45 million of contribution from positive operating leverage, driven by organic growth. This is reflected in both the volume line and the benefit of the higher capacity utilization, which flows through manufacturing and delivery. 
Operating leverage was most pronounced in Europe and was the biggest factor that led to Europe's 27% year-over-year increase in segment profits this quarter. However, cost inflation offset operating leverage, and we will review this factor more in a minute. 
Finishing with the EPS reconciliation, our adjusted net income was $0.47 per share in the quarter compared to $0.48 in the prior year quarter. Operating profit was up $0.03 from the prior year and reflected the benefits of higher sales and production volumes this quarter. Earnings were impacted $0.04 from unfavorable nonoperating items, largely due to higher interest expense on incremental debt to fund future acquisitions as well as those completed during 2010. Corporate and retained costs were down slightly from the prior year, mostly due to the benefit of additional machine and equipment sales during the quarter. 
Furthermore, certain corporate initiatives, including our glass advertising campaign, as well as other supply chain and IT projects, were light in the first quarter but will ramp up as the year progresses. 
Finally, our only Note 1 item this quarter was a $6 million after-tax restructuring charge related to the closure of our plant in Guangzhou and the planned sale of its property that Al mentioned earlier. 
Let's move to Chart 5 for more detail on our balance sheet and free cash flow. On March 31, 2011, cash was $430 million, and total debt was nearly $4.4 billion. So net debt was $3.9 billion, an increase of over $900 million from the first quarter of last year as we put our balance sheet to work to fund several acquisitions in 2010. 
Our net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio was about 3 at the end of the first quarter, and that's at the upper end of our annual leverage target of between 2x and 3x EBITDA. 
Shifting to free cash flow. Please keep in mind that seasonality in our business usually results in the use of cash in the first half of the calendar year, followed by a strong source of cash in the back half of the year. The first quarter was a $158 million use of free cash flow compared to $80 million use of cash in the first quarter last year. This greater use of cash was due to a larger increase in working capital compared to the first quarter of 2010. The working capital increase this year reflected higher receivables due to sales growth and additional inventories to support seasonally stronger shipment. However, the working capital investment was partially offset by lower capital expenditures, restructuring payments and asbestos payments. 
Regarding asbestos, let me reiterate our position, given the recent unfavorable jury verdict in McLean County, Illinois. First, our basic fact pattern has not changed, and asbestos remains a limited and declining liability for the company. As far as the recent jury verdict, we continue to deny the conspiracy claim made in this case and will vigorously challenge this verdict if necessary in the appellate courts. O-I, as well as other defendants, have successfully challenged similar conspiracy jury verdicts in the past. Therefore, we have not made any changes to our asbestos-related liability, and we do not anticipate any changes to our 2011 financial outlook as a result of this case.
Now moving to the right side of Chart 5, you see our debt maturity schedule as of the end of the first quarter. Our most current bonds are not due until 2014, that leaves only the bank debt due prior to that time. Given current attractive credit markets, we are in discussions with our bank group regarding refinancing options of our bank credit agreement in the second quarter.
On Chart 6, we present our business outlook for the second quarter. I will walk through the usual directional guidance on key business drivers that affect earnings and cash flow and will also provide an update on cost inflation. 
Let's review each of the key business factors, starting with price mix. Given modest cost inflation in 2010, we saw only minimal benefit from annual cost pass-through provisions in the first quarter this year. Consistent with this, prices should be up only slightly in the second quarter, and we expect this benefit will be offset by a change in mix. However, we anticipate a more receptive marketplace for higher pricing over the course of this year, particularly in Europe. Al will expand on this shortly.
Sales volume, like the first quarter, we expect second quarter shipment trends will remain in line with our full year outlook for volume, which we anticipate will improve between 5% and 10% from 2010 levels. 
Cost inflation. On our last earnings call, we provided a 2011 inflation outlook that ranged between $150 million and $180 million. Since that time, we've seen a number of events impact the global energy markets. Well I would like to update you on our energy exposure by region. In South America and Asia Pacific, the clear majority of our energy is purchased under annual fixed agreements. 
In North America, more than 85% of our customer agreements include monthly or quarterly cost pass-through provisions. So we have limited exposure to further escalating energy prices in those regions during 2011. 
In Europe, a majority of our energy spend is fixed for 2011, but the remainder is subject to market pricing, especially natural gas. Given recent volatility in European energy prices, which is impacting our variable price position, we are providing more information on the right-hand side of this chart. If average first quarter energy prices in Europe persists for the full year, our global 2011 cost inflation should approximate $200 million. The annualized impact would, of course, be even higher than this projection if we didn't have the majority of energy already covered by fixed price contracts. 
We estimate that a 5% change in European energy prices, mostly natural gas from the first quarter average, impacts our energy costs in the region by $7 million to $10 million on an annual basis. While it is very difficult at this stage to accurately forecast energy inflation this year, this information should provide additional insights on our cost profile.
Now moving to other manufacturing and delivery costs. We expect to see footprint savings and higher operating rates benefit our manufacturing costs in the second quarter. 
Other costs. Regional operating expense should increase $10 million from the prior year due to the investments in Glass Smart and SAP. Corporate costs will increase about $8 million to $10 million from the prior year, mostly due to higher pension expense and various corporate initiatives. 
Finally, second quarter net interest expense should remain in line with first quarter levels. Now I will turn it back to Al."

I would like to comment on the market dynamics we have seen over the last few years and add some more recent observations, and I will focus on Europe, given our energy exposure there. 
Since 2007, we have increased our selling prices to successfully repair our margins even during the recession. Yet in 2010, our prices in Europe declined slightly, given the combination of cost deflation and soft market conditions in the region. While we maintained our focus on price, some of our European competitors took a different route, reporting price deterioration of more than 6% while at full capacity utilization. 
We were still seeing pockets of pricing pressure this last fall when we negotiated our 2011 annual European customer contracts. Since then, several things have changed in Europe. Demand for our glass containers has strengthened, and energy prices have rapidly increased. Our long-term European customer contracts contain pass-through provisions that allow us to recover inflation albeit with some time delay. But most of our business in Europe is covered by annual contracts based on pricing that was set last fall. Nevertheless, because market conditions have changed so significantly, we have notified these customers that we are instituting an energy surcharge to recover rapidly escalating fuel costs. 
As we look through the balance of 2011, demand should improve further, especially as we enter the summer season in Europe. Supply is tightening, in part due to the permanent capacity closures over the last 2 years. 
Strong demand, tightening supply and cost inflation are clear signals that the tide is turning, and this sets the stage for a more robust 2012 pricing negotiation, which will commence later this year. Also, our annual cost pass-through provisions on long-term contracts will result in higher 2012 pricing. 
Globally, we are also seeing stronger demand and tightening supply. In particular as markets improve in Europe and North America, there is less capacity or less excess capacity, I should say, available to supply the fast-growing emerging regions. As a result, we are restarting the 2 furnaces in North America and plan to add capacity in Latin America and China. This should support continued improvement in free cash flow generation. 
Of course, we will remain flexible and respond to changing market conditions. Over the long term, we do, of course, remain committed to our business strategy. That means we will continue to expand in attractive emerging markets, both through acquisitions and organic growth initiatives. We are investing in innovation and technology, and we are strengthening our ability to offer our customers innovative and brand differentiating glass packaging solutions. Through our execution of these strategies, we expect to create additional shareholder value and to increase free cash flow to approximately $300 million in 2011. Thank you, and now, I will ask Angela to open up the lines for your questions."

And in Europe, well we've seen one competitor going out and asking for 6 months lead time on orders. So what we're seeing is that demand has clearly strengthened and especially with this quite a bit of the volume that has been taken out of the capacity over the last couple of years, most probably, the supply-demand balance point is at a lower point than it used to be in the past."

Now with regards to transportation, of course, we have seen diesel prices going up significantly, and those pass-through provisions have a 3-month delay.

And since we have limitations into our flaks with regard to expanding our capacity during the high demand period, we have to build up the inventory to be able to serve our customers. The difference between last year and this year is particularly pronounced in Europe. Where last year, we were still under an inventory control regimen in the first quarter, and then as a result, even demand was not very high but we still missed some shipments in the second quarter of last year. With the demand profiles and projections that we're seeing at this point in time, we just don't think we can let our customers run that risk to be unsupplied for their demand. So as we sell this inventory then, of course, that is automatically then going to generate the cash, and that's why our confidence level of the $300 million is still in place."

You know from past discussions that about 70% of our volume in Europe is subject to these annual contracts, and I think if you look around at our competitors, they have a very similar approaches and percentages. Now clearly, we have to go out with this surcharge, and it's a modification of an agreement that we made a couple of months ago so it will require some give and take in that process. It will depend very largely, of course, on whether there is supporting move by others that are seeing the same inflation rate. If we have -- I don't think that's the case but if we should have competitors that don't see inflation, then of course, that will make that a little bit more difficult. However, one other aspect that we have to take into consideration is that those competitors that last year filled their capacity with more aggressive pricing, of course, have very little room now to get productivity improvements in the course of this year to absorb some of the brunt. So I would assume that the inflation pressure on quite a few of our competitors is in fact much more substantially greater than in our case, so I'm generally very positive about our ability to get a decent recovery of some of the inflation that we're seeing in the energy sector."

There was a combination, of course, you all have heard about the floods and the wet summer that Australia had, so that may have had an impact. But what we're really seeing is that the policy of the central bank in Australia, which is driven really by the raw material boom that Australia is experiencing, is raising the interest rates, and most of the mortgages in Australia are variable mortgages and pulling a lot of purchasing power out of the population. And that has had quite a bit of impact on beer sales. And if you look at the brewers that have reported from that region, it's quite obvious that they're all suffering quite significantly, and nobody at this point in time is yet making a big prediction of a recovery. That may be due to the fact, of course, that we're running into the winter season now in Australia and New Zealand. So it's very difficult to see any strong demand anyway. So everybody is really waiting for the end of this year, which is moving in through the spring and summer period for them to see whether that's going to recover. Our activities, however, in the last 8 or 9 months have been to fairly heavily go into other sectors of the market as well. We've been trying to get greater position with our light weighted bottles for the wine industry, even though that overall wine export is declining but still, our share of that segment is improving. So it's going to be a while I think before they recover. I would say, and I tell the people in Australia that it's almost like they went into the recession with a 2-year time delay."

However, the secondary aspect that we look at as well is competitive positioning with regard to what's happening with plastics, what's happening with aluminum. And there we see the same push as well.

Our adjusted earnings were $0.47 per share in the first quarter of 2011, compared to $0.48 last year. Overall, higher shipments and production levels were offset by additional costs, including incremental cost inflation.",1071,"Thank you, John, and good morning. Our adjusted earnings were $0.47 per share in the first quarter of 2011, compared to $0.48 last year. Overall, higher shipments and production levels were offset by additional costs, including incremental cost inflation. 
Our total shipments in tonnes were up 7% over the first quarter of 2010. More than 5% of the increase was attributable to our recent acquisitions in South America and China. The rest came from organic growth, driven primarily by our global sales and marketing initiative, Glass Smart, which is successfully generating profitable business with new and existing customers. 
Sales volumes were up across all regions and end-use categories. Higher shipments increased production levels, and our machine operating rate improved to approximately 93% on a global basis during the first quarter. 
Significant flooding in Australia during January impacted sales and production at our Brisbane plant, which reduced our earnings by $0.04 per share in the first quarter. 
While our selling prices were up slightly, the combined effect of price and product mix was essentially flat with prior year. Overall, additional costs offset the benefit of higher volumes and production levels. We incurred incremental cost inflation due to a higher labor, raw material and energy prices. In particular, energy prices in some markets increased rapidly over the course of the quarter and I'll expand on that later. 
Operating expenses were up as we roll out our new global Glass Smart sales and marketing program and begin the deployment of our SAP system in North America. Furthermore, additional debt to fund the recent and future acquisitions led to a higher interest expense.
We expect to see similar business trends in the second quarter. Shipments will be up in all regions on a year-over-year basis. Our recent acquisitions and continued organic growth will drive stronger volumes as our markets continue to recover. Improved shipments will translate into increased production and higher operating rates. 
Yet we also anticipate higher costs. Cost inflation has accelerated again due to rapidly increasing energy prices. Operating expense and interest expense will also be up in the second quarter. However, a stronger demand profile, as well as terms in our key customer contracts, should support the pass-through of additional cost inflation over the course of 2011, and this should start supporting earnings in the second half of the year. 
Now let me review our operating performance, beginning with Chart 3. Here, we show first quarter segment operating profits for the company, as well as for each of our 4 regions. Total operating profit was $199 million in the first quarter, up from $193 million last year, primarily driven by stronger performance in both Europe and South America. Our European operating profit was $71 million, up $15 million from the first quarter of 2010. Shipment levels improved by low-single-digits from the prior year, led by stronger growth in both wine and spirits. Demand was particularly strong in France and Spain. 
Despite additional cost inflation, higher production levels led to lower manufacturing costs on a per tonne basis. 
In North America, operating profit was $59 million, down from $63 million in the prior year, due to the increased investments and several initiatives, including Glass Smart and SAP, which I mentioned previously. 
Shipments in North America were up slightly in the first quarter of 2011, despite poor winter weather and the residual impact from prior year contract renegotiations. Volume trends improved over the quarter, indicating a more favorable run rate heading into the second quarter. In fact, we expect to restart 2 idled furnaces in the second quarter to meet increasing demand. This will improve capacity utilization and benefit segment profits in the second half of the year. 
Our North American team finalized our multi-planned union negotiations in the first quarter, and we believe both parties are satisfied with the terms of this agreement. Importantly, new hourly employees will be eligible for a cash balance pension plan rather than the traditional defined benefit pension plan.
Our South American region generated operating profit of $45 million in the first quarter, a 22% improvement over the prior year. Total shipments were up approximately 50%, 5-0 percent. The acquisitions in Brazil and Argentina accounted for 35 percentage points of the volume boost. Robust organic growth represented the rest of this improvement. 
To support rapid growth, we have been importing glass into Brazil. Leveraging our extensive footprint is one of our great strength at O-I, but this has led to increased transportation costs, which impacted our South American margins. Most of the markets that we serve in South America continue to experience robust improvement in their GDP, and our growth rates have exceeded general market trend. This performance underscores the clear appreciation of glass in these markets, as well as the efforts of our entire team in the region. 
Given strong growth, we continue to increase productivity in our current footprint. Also we are planning future capacity expansion in the region, which will help reduce higher transportation costs. 
Our Asia Pacific operating profit was $24 million, down $13 million compared to the first quarter last year. $9 million of the decline pertained to the flooding in Queensland, Australia, which shut down our plant in Brisbane for several weeks. Our Australian team did a great job bringing the plant back into production safely and serving our customers during this very challenging situation. 
Total glass container shipments were down more than 10% in Australia and New Zealand. In addition to weather issues, the strong Australian and New Zealand dollars negatively impacted exports, particularly wine. Also higher interest rates have reduced disposable income and domestic consumption levels in those countries. 
Growth remains strong in China, and we have begun integrating the 3 plants we purchased in the fourth quarter. One of our recent acquisitions is just outside the city of Guangzhou, and we are in the process of expanding capacity at this new site and selling our property in the Guangzhou central business district that will be developed for other retail or commercial uses. We expect the proceeds from this sale will fund our future expansion in the area. And as a result, we will both increase our capacity and improve our overall cost position in one of China's most important glass markets. 
Globally, we are seeing market conditions improve, and our recent acquisitions are beginning to generate real value for O-I.  And I'll now turn the call over to Ed."

The combined effect of price and mix was essentiall",1438,"Thanks, Al. Let's begin our financial review, with the first quarter reconciliations for sales, operating profit and EPS on Chart 4. First quarter 2011 segment sales increased 10% to almost $1.7 billion. The combined effect of price and mix was essentially flat with last year. While average selling prices increased slightly compared to the prior year, this increase was offset by a shift in product mix as beer business began to improve. Normally, we break out the impact on price of North American monthly or quarterly cost pass-through provisions. However, the impact was immaterial in the first quarter as natural gas prices have not shifted much, and escalating freight costs should be passed through in future periods. 
7% higher sales volume increased the top line by $95 million, reflecting both additional organic sales and benefits from last year's acquisitions. Finally, currency translation increased our top line by $59 million in the first quarter. 
Moving over to segment operating profit. The first quarter was $199 million, up $6 million from the same period last year. Segment operating profit benefited slightly from price and mix. Higher volumes improved operating profit by $18 million, largely driven by strong growth of higher margin business in South America. Manufacturing and delivery costs increased $6 million. The combination of inflation of $49 million this quarter and the $9 million impact of the Brisbane plant flooding, offset the $52 million benefit from last year's footprint activities and from higher capacity utilization this year. 
As expected, operating expense increased $12 million, reflecting investments made in several initiatives that Al mentioned, including Glass Smart and our North American SAP deployment. And currency translation provided a small benefit this quarter. 
Overall in the first quarter, we saw about $40 million to $45 million of contribution from positive operating leverage, driven by organic growth. This is reflected in both the volume line and the benefit of the higher capacity utilization, which flows through manufacturing and delivery. 
Operating leverage was most pronounced in Europe and was the biggest factor that led to Europe's 27% year-over-year increase in segment profits this quarter. However, cost inflation offset operating leverage, and we will review this factor more in a minute. 
Finishing with the EPS reconciliation, our adjusted net income was $0.47 per share in the quarter compared to $0.48 in the prior year quarter. Operating profit was up $0.03 from the prior year and reflected the benefits of higher sales and production volumes this quarter. Earnings were impacted $0.04 from unfavorable nonoperating items, largely due to higher interest expense on incremental debt to fund future acquisitions as well as those completed during 2010. Corporate and retained costs were down slightly from the prior year, mostly due to the benefit of additional machine and equipment sales during the quarter. 
Furthermore, certain corporate initiatives, including our glass advertising campaign, as well as other supply chain and IT projects, were light in the first quarter but will ramp up as the year progresses. 
Finally, our only Note 1 item this quarter was a $6 million after-tax restructuring charge related to the closure of our plant in Guangzhou and the planned sale of its property that Al mentioned earlier. 
Let's move to Chart 5 for more detail on our balance sheet and free cash flow. On March 31, 2011, cash was $430 million, and total debt was nearly $4.4 billion. So net debt was $3.9 billion, an increase of over $900 million from the first quarter of last year as we put our balance sheet to work to fund several acquisitions in 2010. 
Our net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio was about 3 at the end of the first quarter, and that's at the upper end of our annual leverage target of between 2x and 3x EBITDA. 
Shifting to free cash flow. Please keep in mind that seasonality in our business usually results in the use of cash in the first half of the calendar year, followed by a strong source of cash in the back half of the year. The first quarter was a $158 million use of free cash flow compared to $80 million use of cash in the first quarter last year. This greater use of cash was due to a larger increase in working capital compared to the first quarter of 2010. The working capital increase this year reflected higher receivables due to sales growth and additional inventories to support seasonally stronger shipment. However, the working capital investment was partially offset by lower capital expenditures, restructuring payments and asbestos payments. 
Regarding asbestos, let me reiterate our position, given the recent unfavorable jury verdict in McLean County, Illinois. First, our basic fact pattern has not changed, and asbestos remains a limited and declining liability for the company. As far as the recent jury verdict, we continue to deny the conspiracy claim made in this case and will vigorously challenge this verdict if necessary in the appellate courts. O-I, as well as other defendants, have successfully challenged similar conspiracy jury verdicts in the past. Therefore, we have not made any changes to our asbestos-related liability, and we do not anticipate any changes to our 2011 financial outlook as a result of this case.
Now moving to the right side of Chart 5, you see our debt maturity schedule as of the end of the first quarter. Our most current bonds are not due until 2014, that leaves only the bank debt due prior to that time. Given current attractive credit markets, we are in discussions with our bank group regarding refinancing options of our bank credit agreement in the second quarter.
On Chart 6, we present our business outlook for the second quarter. I will walk through the usual directional guidance on key business drivers that affect earnings and cash flow and will also provide an update on cost inflation. 
Let's review each of the key business factors, starting with price mix. Given modest cost inflation in 2010, we saw only minimal benefit from annual cost pass-through provisions in the first quarter this year. Consistent with this, prices should be up only slightly in the second quarter, and we expect this benefit will be offset by a change in mix. However, we anticipate a more receptive marketplace for higher pricing over the course of this year, particularly in Europe. Al will expand on this shortly.
Sales volume, like the first quarter, we expect second quarter shipment trends will remain in line with our full year outlook for volume, which we anticipate will improve between 5% and 10% from 2010 levels. 
Cost inflation. On our last earnings call, we provided a 2011 inflation outlook that ranged between $150 million and $180 million. Since that time, we've seen a number of events impact the global energy markets. Well I would like to update you on our energy exposure by region. In South America and Asia Pacific, the clear majority of our energy is purchased under annual fixed agreements. 
In North America, more than 85% of our customer agreements include monthly or quarterly cost pass-through provisions. So we have limited exposure to further escalating energy prices in those regions during 2011. 
In Europe, a majority of our energy spend is fixed for 2011, but the remainder is subject to market pricing, especially natural gas. Given recent volatility in European energy prices, which is impacting our variable price position, we are providing more information on the right-hand side of this chart. If average first quarter energy prices in Europe persists for the full year, our global 2011 cost inflation should approximate $200 million. The annualized impact would, of course, be even higher than this projection if we didn't have the majority of energy already covered by fixed price contracts. 
We estimate that a 5% change in European energy prices, mostly natural gas from the first quarter average, impacts our energy costs in the region by $7 million to $10 million on an annual basis. While it is very difficult at this stage to accurately forecast energy inflation this year, this information should provide additional insights on our cost profile.
Now moving to other manufacturing and delivery costs. We expect to see footprint savings and higher operating rates benefit our manufacturing costs in the second quarter. 
Other costs. Regional operating expense should increase $10 million from the prior year due to the investments in Glass Smart and SAP. Corporate costs will increase about $8 million to $10 million from the prior year, mostly due to higher pension expense and various corporate initiatives. 
Finally, second quarter net interest expense should remain in line with first quarter levels. Now I will turn it back to Al."
32583,118742765,119782,"Owens-Illinois, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2011",2011-04-28,"Earnings Calls","O-I Glass, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ed. I would like to comment on the market dynamics we have seen over the last few years and add some more recent observations, and I will focus on Europe, given our energy exposure there.

I would like to comment on the market dynamics we have seen over the last few years and add some more recent observations, and I will focus on Europe, given our energy exposure there. 
Since 2007, we have increased our selling prices to successfully repair our margins even during the recession. Yet in 2010, our prices in Europe declined slightly, given the combination of cost deflation and soft market conditions in the region. While we maintained our focus on price, some of our European competitors took a different route, reporting price deterioration of more than 6% while at full capacity utilization. 
We were still seeing pockets of pricing pressure this last fall when we negotiated our 2011 annual European customer contracts. Since then, several things have changed in Europe. Demand for our glass containers has strengthened, and energy prices have rapidly increased. Our long-term European customer contracts contain pass-through provisions that allow us to recover inflation albeit with some time delay. But most of our business in Europe is covered by annual contracts based on pricing that was set last fall. Nevertheless, because market conditions have changed so significantly, we have notified these customers that we are instituting an energy surcharge to recover rapidly escalating fuel costs. 
As we look through the balance of 2011, demand should improve further, especially as we enter the summer season in Europe. Supply is tightening, in part due to the permanent capacity closures over the last 2 years. 
Strong demand, tightening supply and cost inflation are clear signals that the tide is turning, and this sets the stage for a more robust 2012 pricing negotiation, which will commence later this year. Also, our annual cost pass-through provisions on long-term contracts will result in higher 2012 pricing. 
Globally, we are also seeing stronger demand and tightening supply. In particular as markets improve in Europe and North America, there is less capacity or less excess capacity, I should say, available to supply the fast-growing emerging regions. As a result, we are restarting the 2 furnaces in North America and plan to add capacity in Latin America and China. This should support continued improvement in free cash flow generation. 
Of course, we will remain flexible and respond to changing market conditions. Over the long term, we do, of course, remain committed to our business strategy. That means we will continue to expand in attractive emerging markets, both through acquisitions and organic growth initiatives. We are investing in innovation and technology, and we are strengthening our ability to offer our customers innovative and brand differentiating glass packaging solutions. Through our execution of these strategies, we expect to create additional shareholder value and to increase free cash flow to approximately $300 million in 2011.

You know from past discussions that about 70% of our volume in Europe is subject to these annual contracts, and I think if you look around at our competitors, they have a very similar approaches and percentages. Now clearly, we have to go out with this surcharge, and it's a modification of an agreement that we made a couple of months ago so it will require some give and take in that process. It will depend very largely, of course, on whether there is supporting move by others that are seeing the same inflation rate. If we have -- I don't think that's the case but if we should have competitors that don't see inflation, then of course, that will make that a little bit more difficult. However, one other aspect that we have to take into consideration is that those competitors that last year filled their capacity with more aggressive pricing, of course, have very little room now to get productivity improvements in the course of this year to absorb some of the brunt. So I would assume that the inflation pressure on quite a few of our competitors is in fact much more substantially greater than in our case, so I'm generally very positive about our ability to get a decent recovery of some of the inflation that we're seeing in the energy sector."

There was a combination, of course, you all have heard about the floods",319,"Well, I would say one data point doesn't make a trend yet but certainly, what we saw towards the end of the quarter was that beer was recovering somewhat, in Australia in particular. There was a combination, of course, you all have heard about the floods and the wet summer that Australia had, so that may have had an impact. But what we're really seeing is that the policy of the central bank in Australia, which is driven really by the raw material boom that Australia is experiencing, is raising the interest rates, and most of the mortgages in Australia are variable mortgages and pulling a lot of purchasing power out of the population. And that has had quite a bit of impact on beer sales. And if you look at the brewers that have reported from that region, it's quite obvious that they're all suffering quite significantly, and nobody at this point in time is yet making a big prediction of a recovery. That may be due to the fact, of course, that we're running into the winter season now in Australia and New Zealand. So it's very difficult to see any strong demand anyway. So everybody is really waiting for the end of this year, which is moving in through the spring and summer period for them to see whether that's going to recover. Our activities, however, in the last 8 or 9 months have been to fairly heavily go into other sectors of the market as well. We've been trying to get greater position with our light weighted bottles for the wine industry, even though that overall wine export is declining but still, our share of that segment is improving. So it's going to be a while I think before they recover. I would say, and I tell the people in Australia that it's almost like they went into the recession with a 2-year time delay."

However, the secondary aspect that we look at as well is competitive positioning with regard to what's happening with plastics, what's happening with aluminum. And there we see the same push as well.

Our second quarter 2011 adjusted earnings were $0.59 per share, down considerably from $0.84 last year. Clearly, we are disappointed with these results and our performance was unacceptable. Adding into the second quarter",2863,"Thank you, John, and good morning. Our second quarter 2011 adjusted earnings were $0.59 per share, down considerably from $0.84 last year. Clearly, we are disappointed with these results and our performance was unacceptable. Adding into the second quarter, we expected our earnings would be in line with the prior year despite elevated cost inflation. However, we incurred significantly higher manufacturing costs, which more than offset the benefit of higher shipments on a global basis.
Market demand has started to rebound after several years of unfavorable trends in our business. Shipments from were up more than 6% in the second quarter, driven by recent acquisitions as well as organic growth. In fact, demand was up across all key and end user categories on a global basis. This should have been a very favorable environment for O-I given our work in the past to create significant operating leverage from improving demand. However, we incurred much higher manufacturing costs due to elevated cost inflation, production issues in North America and market challenges in Australia and New Zealand. Cost inflation accounted for most of the additional manufacturing costs while inflation was not a surprise, energy rises in Europe have increased faster and to a greater extent than we expected adding into the year. And we have discussed this trend in detail during previous earnings call. 
We have implemented an energy surcharge in Europe to help offset the impact of the most recent spike in energy pricing. The combination of our surcharge this year and expected higher selling prices next year should fully offset the impact of 2011 cost inflation on a global basis.
In North America, core operating performance resulted in manufacturing inefficiencies and supply chain issues. As a result, we incurred higher production and logistics costs as well as additional expenses for product loss. Challenging market conditions in Australia and New Zealand resulted in choppy, lower demand in those countries. And in response, we reduced our production to match supply with demand, which led to higher unabsorbed fixed cost in Asia-Pacific.
As we responded with urgency with these issues, my leadership team and I are focusing on our core operations to restore higher product productivity level. We also need to significantly improve our ability to you generate a more accurate business forecast. Serving our customers and maximizing our long-term earnings are our highest priorities. Despite our disappointing operating performance, we confirm a number of positive developments this quarter. Organic growth was 3%, excluding the impact of the much lower demand in Australia and New Zealand. We generated $97 million of free cash flow and we acquired the remaining interest in our 7 Brazil operations from our minority partner. O-I will fully benefit from future growth and productivity improvement in the attractive Brazilian market. And finally, we refinanced debt to extend maturities and increase financial flexibility. 
Looking to the third quarter, we expect shipments will be up in all regions and end-users in year-over-year basis. As we focus on fully resorting our operating performance, we will still incur higher manufacturing costs during this transition period. And as a result, we expect third quarter adjusted earnings will improve from our second quarter results but likely lag the prior year. Looking to the full year, we have revised our 2011 free cash flow target for a number of reasons. In Australia, we are restructuring our footprint in response to changes in demand. This will result in additional capital spending and severance costs. In North America, we will rebuild inventory levels to avoid repeating significant supply change disruptions and improve boost. And in Europe we expect some restructuring costs as part of the purchase price of our recent DDL acquisition. And finally, we will invest in capacity expansion in South America to improve margins and support growth.  As a result, our 2011 free cash flow target has been reduced from $300 million to between $200 million and $250 million. 
Now I will review each of our segments and I'll start with Europe, our largest regional chart #3.  Europe performed as expected. Operating profit was $107 million compared to $104 million in the second quarter of 2010. The benefit of favorable currency translation and higher shipments offset elevated cost inflation. Shipments were up mid-single digits in Europe as demand grew across all key end-use segments. Selling prices were flat with the prior year, reflecting the annual contracts negotiated last year when supply demand conditions and inflation levels we're much softer and those we are experiencing today. In response to the higher cost inflation, we have successfully negotiated energy surcharges of approximately $50 million to $20 million in the second half of the year. Overall, we expect to fully pass on the impact of 2011 cost inflation on Europe to our surcharge this year and higher prices next year. And in the future, we plan to include prospective inflation provisions into our annual customer agreements there. 
Several days ago, we announced the acquisition of BBL, which operate the single-glass plant in France, located near the Nestle Water facility. We have strengthened our strategic relationship with Wesley and are now the leading glass container provider for both their that Central Belgrade in France and Italy, respectively. 
Moving to Chart 4. Our South American operations also performed as expected and generated operating profit of $53 million in the second quarter, up from $49 million last year. Volumes were up more than 35% year-over-year. Our strategic acquisitions last year accounted for most of this growth. But the region also posted double-digit organic growth driven by Brazil, Argentina and Peru. But the benefit of higher shipments was mostly offset by higher costs. So segment operating -- sorry, segment profit margin was about 18%, which was lower than we typically see in this region for a few reasons. First, we incurred additional cost inflation. Our second quarter prices were flat with the prior year, we expect to recapture cost inflation through higher prices beginning in the third quarter.
Second, our Brazilian operations were sold out and we shipped glass from other countries in the region to meet growing Brazilian demand. These shipments had associated freight and infiltration penalties that to meet the growing demand before we commit more capital for expansion in the region. Throughout the glass situation, we incurred some cost to realign machinery and increased capacity Brazil. And to support continued growth, we will further bottleneck our operations there. We are also planning a Greenfield plan in South America to support our customers long-term growth needs. And finally, as I mentioned already, we bought out our minority partner in our Southern Brazil operations and we expect this transaction to be accretive in 2011. 
Moving to North America on Chart #5. Adding into the second quarter, we had expected higher earnings compared to the prior year. We anticipated stronger shipments combined with footprint initiative segments. However, North American operating profit was $56 million, down from $87 million in the prior year. Most of the decline was due to $26 million from production inefficiency, higher freight cost and product loss. Due to a number of operating issues, we were not able to meet all of our customers' needs. And as a result, shipments in North America were down slightly despite some amount of strength in all key end-use markets other than the. 
We have always prided ourselves on our operational excellence and our ability to meet or exceed our customers expectations. We failed to meet those standards in the second quarter but we expect to significantly improve our service level in the back half of the year. The graph from Chart 5 depicts the chain of events that led to our issues in the region this quarter. And keep in mind that the last resort from those represent specific data. The blue line represents our effective manufacturing capacity while the yellow line illustrates seasonal demand pattern. We permanently closed 2 plants in North America and mid-2010 to realign capacity with lower demand following the conclusions of contract negotiations with key customers. Given soft demand last year, we were focused on efficient working capital levels and we maintain tight inventories as we entered 2011. On the green line represents inventory levels to show relative trend. But again, it's illustrative. Then as 2011 progressed, several things happened. First, demand started pick up in North America but the growth was in wine, spirits and craft beer and up in. This mix created additional complexities that we underestimated. For example, more SKUs result in shorter production runs, which require greater flexibility in our platform. 
We struggled with a greater number of in several pants and did not achieve the same production efficiency that we typically see with the Mega Beer brands. Second, we add a number of production introductions that require downtime for repairs. As you can see, this downtime coincided with seasonally stronger demand. As a result, we did not achieve the productivity improvements that we expected in the second quarter.
And third, longer lead times on repair parts delayed the anticipated restart of 2 previously idle, so we did not get the much-needed additional capacity of staff as we had expected. As a result of these issues, tight inventory became short inventory at several locations. And to serve our customers, we had to reallocate production to other facilities in North America. And this in turn disrupted those plans, normal manufacturing patterns, which led to incremental costs. Since production sometimes occur at plants hundreds of miles away from the customer, we also incurred significant higher freight cost, all of which unfortunately coincided with spiking diesel costs. You can see the domino affect that started with production issues earlier in the quarter. Now to address these issues, we have initiated a plan to both restore our inventories to sustainable levels and improve production efficiency over the course of the second half of the year.
First, we're taking immediate action to rebuild inventory. We have restarted over 2 previously furnaces and they are up and running by early July. This added approximately 5% more production capacity to the region. We are also leveraging our global footprint by shifting glass from other regions to increase North American inventories by about 5%. And finally, our North American plants will of course run at high operating rates through the end of the year.
As a result of these actions, we expect to rebuild North American inventories and reduce the risk of significant future supply-chain competitions. Over that six-month, we are focusing on returning to operational excellence in North America. Most of our inefficiencies during the second quarter was tied to discrete production issues, which we do not expect to recur. Nevertheless, we are conducting thorough manufacturing audits of our 19 North American facilities to determine if there are any unidentified production risks. Of course we will take necessary actions to remove the if anything is found. Finally, we are actively collaborating with our customers to improve the SKU accuracy of their demand forecast, as well as our production forecast. This will help avoid the many unplanned changes and changeovers that compromise productivity. A more effective supply chain will benefit both O-I and our customers. And for future customer contracts, we look to include provisions and forecast accuracy to create clarity about supply commitments and ownership of cost variances.
To avoid additional disruption in those difficult period, we have delayed our SAP implementation in North America until early 2012. Let me reiterate. Our second quarter performance in North America was unacceptable and full remediation of these issues is priority number one. 
Now moving to our North America to Asia Pacific on Chart 6. Adding into the second quarter, we expected that our Asia-Pacific profits will be down from the prior year as a result of lower demand in Australia and New Zealand. We've been discussing this trend over the past 2 quarters. However, actual results were significantly lower than anticipated. Asia-Pacific earned $9 million, down $22 million from the prior year. Of the total regional shipments we're up slightly from the prior year, all growth was attributable to our 2010 acquisitions in China. Our shipments of wine and beer bottles in Australia and New Zealand were down nearly 20% from the prior year. This resulted in $7 million of lower profit contribution from sales. In macroeconomic headwinds drove the specific drop in shipments from these 2 countries. Stronger currencies negatively impacted the wine exports and lead to some fundamentally different approaches by our wine customers to their future business models. Domestically, function was down considerably as high interest and savings rate have lowered consumers' disposable income, and this has cost a severe cutback in consumer spending.
While we anticipated lower shipments, demand trends in the wine and beer markets deteriorated faster than expected in the second quarter. In particular, Australia wine producers reduced bottling given the dramatic increase in the value of Australian dollar. In response, we reduced production to balance supply with lower demand, resulting in $10 million of unabsorbed manufacturing cost on top of the contribution from lower cost. Given these developments, we are taking the following actions. First, we recently named Steve Brandich the new President of the Asia-Pacific region and replaced Brad who is leaving the company. Brad will report to me and serve the number of the global leadership team. He previously served as the Treasurer and Vice President of Finance for O-I, and more recently as the General Manager of our New Zealand operations. We believe Steve will provide a fresh perspective to address the market challenges in the region.
Second, some of the issues that we face in Australia are longer term in nature, and as a result, we will need to properly align our capacity with changing long-term demand. We will restructure our Australia operations in several days. In July, we implemented the first phase by permanently closing one machine wine in Australia and toward the immediate future, other supply and demand imbalances will be managed through continued temporary bounce off. 
The next phase of our restructuring plan will likely require additional permanent capacity adjustment in Australia. This plan must ensure that we retain the right capabilities and invest in the necessary technologies for our customers. Also, we need to maintain flexibility to meet future demand levels in the event of an upstream in the market. Australia is now answering its seasonally strongest periods so it's prudent to delay restructuring activities until later this year. And we expect that restructuring will conclude by the mid-2012. This restructuring in this region may result in up to $50 million of capital expenditures and severance costs. Up to half of this cost will be incurred in 2011 and the balance would fall into 2012. Overall, these actions should improve our cost profile in Australia and I will keep you updated on our decisions regarding this quote on implementation of restructuring activities in future earnings calls. 
Now moving to Chart 7. We remain committed to our long-term strategy, which continues to deliver value for O-I. For example, our focus on operational excellence have generated $245 million of savings between 2007 and 2010, driven by our footprint alignment initiative. As we refocus on our core operations, we have been redesigning our organizational structure in each region. We are bringing manufacturing and supply chain functions under one regionally integrated operations. This structure will remove the functions in our operations and provide a more holistic approach to optimize the entire process. And this will allow maximize operational efficiency and provide better visibility and control over production costs. 
Regarding strategic and profitable growth, in 2010, we acquired 10 plants located in fast-growing emerging markets that are generating an average operating profit margin of approximately 20% and creating significant growth momentum. Last March, our new market approach has enhanced the effectiveness of our organic marketing efforts and has boosted our growth in South America 5 to 7 percentage points above average market growth. And while we're already seeing success in our other regions as we replicate this initiative globally. New capabilities like Vortex or Lean+Green line bottles and break glass are driving additional sales in all regions. While the strategies are driving value, a number of other factors have undermined our ability to generate the improved financial performance that we expected when we set our longer-term targets back in 2010. And these factors include, first, the economic downturn impacted the markets that we serve longer than we expected at that time, especially with continued high unemployment in the developed market. And also the Vega beer brand have not recovered as we anticipated when we were exiting the recession. 
Second, the of our highly profitable Venezuelan operations and of course throughout the challenge with our operating performance that I discussed in detail with you. And finally, I believe that at present, our current earnings profile does not support acquisitions of the magnitude, speed and impact that we discussed at the last investor day. Given these developments, it is unlikely that we will achieve the longer-term targets that we discussed earlier last year, and we're currently revisiting these targets. I will now turn the call over to Ed."

We included much of this information in our press release and in-house comments so I will only touch on the highlights. Second quarter 2011 segment sales increased nearly 17%, the more than $1.9 billion. Recent acquisitions and improving market conditions improved more than 6% increase in tons shipped. This boosted the top line by $97 million. You can also see that currency translation substantially increased the top line especially in Europe. Moving over to segment operating profit. The second quarter was $225 million compared to $271 million last year. Higher volumes contributed $26 million but manufacturing and delivery costs increased by $78 million. Higher costs were largely driven by $61 million of cost inflation as expected but an additional $26 million of North American production issues and another $10 million unabsorbed fixed cost in Australia and New Zealand were not foreseen. Finishing with the EPS reconciliation.
Our adjusted net income was $0.59 per share in the quarter compared $0.84 in the prior year. Lower operating profit reduced earnings $0.21 in the prior year. Earnings were impacted $0.04 from unfavorable nonoperating item, largely due to higher interest expense on incremental debt to fund 2010 acquisitions. Retain corporate costs were about flat from the prior year. Higher marketing spending and non-cash pension expenses were offset by $10 million of lower management compensation, which reflects adjustments to both the incentive plans and the impacted lower 2011 earnings. Also, the merger of businesses in Brazil resulted in a tax benefit. Finally, we had 2 note  one expenses this quarter as outlined in our earnings release. 
Let's move to Chart 9 for more detail on our balance sheet, cash flow and capital structure. On June 30, 2011, cash was $260 million in total debt was approximately $4.3 billion. The net debt was $4.1 billion, an increase of more than $1.2 billion from the prior year's second quarter, reflecting financing for acquisitions made last year and the impact of foreign currency translation on our debt. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was at 3.2, just like at the end of the second quarter, well below the bank covenants limit of 4x. However, our ratio now exceeds our leverage target of between 2x and 3x EBITDA. So future debt reduction will be a priority. We believe this range represents an efficient capital structure for O-I and provides the financial facility needed to execute our strategy.
Free cash flow was $97 million in the second quarter compared to a $6 million use of cash last year. Lower working capital levels and capital spending more than offset a decline in earnings. Let me shift now to our capital allocation priorities and repeat what Al has said. We are clearly disappointed with our results this quarter and we impact that this has had on the O-I share price and on our shareholders. At our current stock price, we understand that the share buyback maybe viewed as a compelling use of cash. However, we need to focus on debt reduction to lower our leverage to below 3x EBITDA by year end 2011. Further, it is essential that we dedicate some of our current year cash flow to restructure our Australia, to rebuild inventories in North America and to begin to expand capacity in South America. 
Turning to capital expenditures. Our 2011 estimate has been reset. We now expect up to $375 million of CapEx given the restructuring and capacity expansion I just mentioned. Finally, we're very pleased with the successful completion of our $2 billion bank credit agreement earlier in the second quarter. We also redeemed in the second quarter higher cost senior notes using attractively priced term debt. On Chart 10, we presented business outlook for the third quarter. There are clearly many moving parts in our business especially as we are taking actions to address our operating performance. As a result, we're providing the actual outlook on operating profit on this segment for an operational cost and overall adjusted earnings.
Our European third quarter profit should be in line with the prior year. We expect earnings will benefit from higher volumes and energy surcharges. Yet cost inflation will remain elevated during the third quarter. As on the right, global cost inflation in excess of price will likely impact O-I's 2011 margins by more than $130 million, which we expect to recapture with the highest pricing mostly in 2012. In North America, we expect segment operating profit will lag the prior year. However, the manufacturing cost penalties we incurred in the second quarter should moderate as we increase capacity one full and improve operational and supply chain efficiencies over the course of the quarter. 
Our segment for Asia Pacific operating performance will remain below prior-year earnings, given continued temporary production curtailment in Australia and New Zealand. However, earnings should benefit on a sequential basis from seasonally stronger demand. In South America, segment operating profit should improve from the prior year. We anticipate shipments will remain very strong and we also expect higher selling prices as we pass through inflation incurred in the first half of 2011. Turning demand operational items. We expect higher year-over-year corporate cost with the continued sales and marketing initiatives and the higher pension expenses we've seen all year. Further details are provided on the chart. 
Overall, we expect the operating performance to improve over the close of the third quarter, but we will still incur high manufacturing costs during the transition. Before we expect the third quarter adjusted earnings to improve in the second quarter, it will likely lag the prior-year third quarter results. Now I will turn the call back to Al for closing remarks on Chart 11."

However, what we have seen in the past as well, Europe is also a market where normal passthrough provisions have an actual or have an additional dependency and that is the supply-demand picture. So if supply is long and demand is weak, you have a very difficult to pass through inflation. One is supply and demand is balanced as we are seeing this year and in fact in the peak season, we see supply is outstripped by demand. You really then get pricing power. And one of the indications that this gives me the confidence for next year, the fact that we went into the market with a surcharge, that we were able to negotiate with our customers in quite a few countries, finished successfully and that I believe gives me the confidence that we are seeing some good opportunity for price improvement. Equally, we have been negotiating certain longer-term contracts that were reset in the course of this year because we do not what will come by the end of the year and in some of those cases, in most of those cases that I'm aware of, we have been able to raise our prices mid to high-single digits.

There is not a lot of exports of Brazilian brands into the rest of the world.

In Latin America and in Europe, where we have for many years, have this flexibility because many of these plants serve quite a variety of uses and of applications. And clearly also have a great number of customers. Whereas in the United States, the entire customer environment spend more and we've been being focusing on large deals as our main focus areas in the past. And we just felt at the time when we entered into a more proactive pursuit of these smaller SKUs and higher pricing points, because we have the capability in the company that we would have the capability in North America as well. And I think that's really where we perhaps misunderstood the complexity of absolutely plan-per-floor and top floor and that's where we are taking corrective actions at this point in time. But that certainly doesn't stand in the way of higher margins."

Because I may need that additional volume and then if I have to order in short notice I might not get it. So we have to balance a little bit as we're coming out of the high season, all of the demand we're seeing was really actual shipments on the part of the customers. But a good sign -- despite the fact that we were the first ones out with an energy surcharge in the marketplace, we were reasonably successful and where we are in the market leader in the country.

But I believe they were hoping throughout the entire year last year that eventually currency would weaken, and they would be able to reoccupy the shelf space for their wine. And typically, you go into the stores, you find Australia and New Zealand line has a particular price range, generally at its around $10 price level. And with -- right now, the Australian dollar at $1.10 to the U.S. dollar versus $0.70 or so a year, 1.5 year ago, of course the entire margin have disappeared in that business. And to try to reprice the product would require rebranding because people are not going to buy the same brand they used to buy for $10 for $20. So that's a very long-term proposition. I believe that fundamentally, we've been come to the conclusion that long-term, given the continued demand for basic raw materials in Australia, most probably the currency will continue to be at a high-level and therefore, that situation is not likely to change. So you see why the dramatic and significant change over from packets to shipments, packets product shipments to bulk shipments. They're not giving up on the market but they're approaching the market in a different model and that of course does not affect the overall consumption of glass on a global scale because what we're losing and Australia and New Zealand, we may be picking up, and picking up in North America and that's why we're seeing in North America for instance a fairly strong trend for wine bottles at this point in time. So it's a fairly complex equation but I don't think that we can expect that the Australian dollar is going to weaken so significantly that we can we reoccupy the price."

We have tried to cover up some of that in the past by making sure that in the long-term agreements and contracts we have quarterly or monthly passer provisions for the most volatile cost component. But if you have considerable increases in raw material, if you have considerable increases in labor cost, or if you have considerable increases in energy prices in those markets where you don't have long-term contracts as the provisions, you will automatically get a contraction or compaction of your margin. What we then also typically find is that when we go down in the following year, where most of that inflation is one of stores, we typically see margin expansion. Because that's when these inflationary forces will be best in the pricing and pricing arrangements we have with our customers. So I would say what we're seeing today is not necessarily indicative of a because in our overall objective as far as margin contribution from the glass industry is concerned. It is just that because of the way contracts are set up, it really has quite a bit of variability from year-to-year depending on when inflation and what please inflation rose."

Adding into the second quarte",2908,"Thank you, John, and good morning. Our second quarter 2011 adjusted earnings were $0.59 per share, down considerably from $0.84 last year. Clearly, we are disappointed with these results, and our performance was unacceptable. Adding into the second quarter, we expected our earnings would be in line with the prior year despite elevated cost inflation. However, we incurred significantly higher manufacturing costs, which more than offset the benefit of higher shipments on a global basis.
Market demand has started to rebound after several years of unfavorable trends in our business. Shipments in tonnes were up more than 6% in the second quarter, driven by recent acquisitions as well as organic growth. In fact, demand was up across all key end-use categories on a global basis. This should have been a very favorable environment for O-I, given our work in the past to create significant operating leverage from improving demand. However, we incurred much higher manufacturing costs due to elevated cost inflation, production issues in North America and market challenges in Australia and New Zealand. Cost inflation accounted for most of the additional manufacturing costs. While inflation was not a surprise, energy prices in Europe have increased faster and to a greater extent than we expected adding into the year. And we have discussed this trend in detail during previous earnings calls. 
We have implemented an energy surcharge in Europe to help offset the impact of the most recent spike in energy pricing. The combination of our surcharge this year and expected higher selling prices next year should fully offset the impact of 2011 cost inflation on a global basis.
In North America, poor operating performance resulted in manufacturing inefficiencies and supply chain issues. As a result, we incurred higher production and logistics costs as well as additional expenses for product loss. Challenging market conditions in Australia and New Zealand resulted in choppy, lower demand in those countries. And in response, we reduced our production to match supply with demand, which led to a higher unabsorbed fixed cost in Asia-Pacific.
As we respond with urgency to these issues, my leadership team and I are focusing on our core operations to restore high productivity level. We also need to significantly improve our ability to generate a more accurate business forecast. Serving our customers and maximizing our long-term earnings are our highest priority. Despite our disappointing operating performance, we can point to a number of positive developments this past quarter. Organic growth was 3%, excluding the impact of a much lower demand in Australia and New Zealand. We generated $97 million of free cash flow, and we acquired the remaining interest in our 7 Brazil operations from our minority partner. O-I will now fully benefit from future growth and profit improvement in the attractive Brazilian market. And finally, we refinanced debt to extend maturities and increase financial flexibility. 
Looking to the third quarter, we expect shipments will be up in all regions and end uses on a year-over-year basis. As we focus on fully restoring our operating performance, we will still incur higher manufacturing costs during this transition period. And as a result, we expect third quarter adjusted earnings will improve from our second quarter results but likely lag the prior year. Looking to the full year, we have revised our 2011 free cash flow target for a number of reasons. In Australia, we are restructuring our footprint in response to changes in demand. This will result in additional capital spending and severance costs. In North America, we will rebuild inventory levels to avoid repeating significant supply chain disruptions as demand improves. And in Europe, we expect some restructuring costs as part of the purchase price for our recent VDL acquisition. And finally, we will invest in capacity expansion in South America to improve margins and support growth. As a result, our 2011 free cash flow target has been reduced from $300 million to between $200 million and $250 million. 
Now I will review each of our segments, and I'll start with Europe, our largest region, on Chart #3.  Europe performed as expected. Operating profit was $107 million compared with $104 million in the second quarter of 2010. The benefit of favorable currency translation and higher shipments offset elevated cost inflation. Shipments were up mid-single digits in Europe as demand grew across all key end-use segments. Selling prices were flat with the prior year, reflecting the annual contracts negotiated last year when supply demand conditions and inflation levels were much softer and those we are experiencing today. In response to the higher cost inflation, we have successfully negotiated energy surcharges of approximately $15 million to $20 million in the second half of the year. Overall, we expect to fully pass on the impact of 2011 cost inflation on Europe to our surcharge this year and higher prices next year. And in the future, we plan to include prospective inflation provisions into our annual customer agreements there. 
Seven days ago, we announced the acquisition of VDL, which operates a single glass plant in Vergeze, France, located near the Nestlé Waters' Perrier bottling facility. We have strengthened our strategic relationship with Nestlé and are now the leading glass container provider for both their Perrier and San Pellegrino brands in France and Italy, respectively. 
Moving to Chart 4. Our South American operations also performed as expected and generated operating profit of $53 million in the second quarter, up from $49 million last year. Volumes were up more than 35% year-over-year. Our strategic acquisitions last year accounted for most of this growth. But the region also posted double-digit organic growth driven by Brazil, Argentina and Peru. But the benefit of higher shipments was mostly offset by higher costs. So segment operating -- sorry -- segment profit margin was about 18%, which was lower than we typically see in this region for a few reasons. First, we incurred additional cost inflation. While our second quarter prices were flat with the prior year, we expect to recapture cost inflation through higher prices beginning in the third quarter.
Second, our Brazilian operations were sold out, and we shipped glass from other countries in the region to meet growing Brazilian demand. These shipments had associated freight and importation penalties, that allowed us to meet growing demand before we commit more capital for expansion in the region. Throughout the glass, this situation we incurred some costs to realign machinery and increase capacity in Brazil. And to support continued growth, we will further debottleneck our operations there. We are also planning a Greenfield plant in South America to support our customers' long-term growth needs. And finally, as I mentioned already, we bought out our minority partner in our Southern Brazil operations, and we expect this transaction to be accretive in 2011. 
Moving to North America on Chart #5. Adding into the second quarter, we had expected higher earnings compared to the prior year. We anticipated stronger shipments combined with footprint initiative sales. However, North American operating profit was $56 million, down from $87 million in the prior year. Most of the decline was due to $26 million from production inefficiency, higher freight costs and product loss. Due to a number of operating issues, we were not able to meet all of our customers' needs. And as a result, shipments in North America were down slightly despite fundamental strength in all key end-use markets other than the mega beer brand. 
We have always prided ourselves on our operational excellence and our ability to meet or exceed our customers' expectations. We failed to meet those standards in the second quarter, but we expect to significantly improve our service level in the back half of the year. The graph on Chart 5 depicts the chain of events that led to our issues in the region this quarter, and keep in mind of the last result [ph] and does not represent specific data. The blue line represents our effective manufacturing capacity, while the yellow line illustrates seasonal demand pattern. We permanently closed 2 plants in North America in mid-2010 to realign capacity with lower demand, following the conclusions of contract renegotiations with key customers. Given soft demand last year, we were focused on efficient working capital levels, and we maintained tight inventories as we entered 2011. And the green dotted line represents inventory levels to show relative trend. But again, it's illustrative. Then as 2011 progressed, several things happened. First, demand started to pick up in North America, but the growth was in wine, spirits and craft beer and not in mega beer brand. This mix created additional complexities that we underestimated. For example, more SKUs result in shorter production runs, which require greater flexibility in our platform. 
We struggled with a greater number of job changes at several plants and did not achieve the same production efficiency that we typically see with the mega beer brands. Second, we had a number of production interruptions that required downtime for repairs. As you can see, this downtime coincided with seasonally stronger demand. As a result, we did not achieve the productivity improvements that we expected in the second quarter.
And third, longer lead times on repair parts delayed the anticipated restart of 2 previously idle furnaces, so we did not get the much needed additional capacity as fast as we had expected. As a result of these issues, tight inventory became short inventory at several locations. And to serve our customers, we had to reallocate production to other facilities in North America. Now this in turn disrupted those plants' normal manufacturing patterns, which led to incremental costs. Since production sometimes occurred to plants hundreds of miles away from the customer, we also incurred significant higher freight cost, all of which unfortunately coincided with spiking diesel costs. You can see the domino affect that started with production issues earlier in the quarter. Now to address these issues, we have initiated a plan to both restore our inventories to sustainable levels and improve production efficiency over the course of the second half of the year.
First, we're taking immediate action to rebuild inventory. We restarted our 2 previously idle furnaces, and they were up and running by early July. This added approximately 5% more production capacity to the region. We are also leveraging our global footprint by shifting glass from other regions to increase North American inventories by about 5%. And finally, our North American plants will, of course, run at high operating rates through the end of the year.
As a result of these actions, we expect to rebuild North American inventories and reduce the risk of significant future supply chain complication. Over the next 6 months, we are focusing on returning to operational excellence in North America. Most of our inefficiencies during the second quarter was tied to discrete production issues, which we do not expect to recur. Nevertheless, we are conducting thorough manufacturing audits of our 19 North American facilities to determine if there are any unidentified production risks. Of course, we will take the necessary actions to remediate if anything is found. Finally, we are actively collaborating with our customers to improve the SKU accuracy of their demand forecast, as well as our production forecast. This will then help avoid the many unplanned changes and changeovers that compromise productivity. A more effective supply chain will benefit both O-I and our customers. And for future customer contracts, we will look to include provision in forecast accuracy to create clarity about supply commitments and ownership of cost variances.
To avoid additional disruption in this difficult period, we have delayed our SAP implementation in North America until early 2012. Let me reiterate, our second quarter performance in North America was unacceptable and full remediation of these issues is priority number one. 
Now moving to our North America to Asia-Pacific on Chart 6. Adding into the second quarter, we expected our Asia-Pacific profits would be down from the prior year as a result of lower demand in Australia and New Zealand. And we've been discussing this trend over the past few quarters. However, actual results were significantly lower than anticipated. Asia-Pacific earned $9 million, down $22 million from the prior year. Although total regional shipments were up slightly from the prior year, all growth was attributable to our 2010 acquisitions in China. Our shipments of wine and beer bottles in Australia and New Zealand were down nearly 20% from the prior year. This resulted in $7 million of lower profit contribution from sales. Two macroeconomic headwinds drove the precipitous drop in shipments in these 2 countries. Stronger currencies have negatively impacted wine exports and led to some fundamentally different approaches by our wine customers to their future business models. Domestically, beer consumption was down considerably as high interests and savings rates have lowered consumers' disposable income, and this has cost a severe cutback in consumer spending.
While we anticipated lower shipments, demand trends in the wine and beer markets deteriorated faster than expected in the second quarter. In particular, Australia wine producers reduced in-country bottling given the dramatic increase in the value of the Australian dollar. In response, we reduced production to balance supply with lower demand, resulting in $10 million of unabsorbed manufacturing costs on top of the loss sales contribution from lower costs. Given these developments, we are taking the following actions. First, we recently named Steve Bramlage as the new President of the Asia-Pacific region, who replaced Greg Ridder who is leaving the company. Greg will report to me and serve as a member of the global leadership team. He previously served as the Treasurer and Vice President of Finance for O-I, and more recently as the General Manager of our New Zealand operations. We believe Steve will provide a fresh perspective to address the market challenges in the region.
Second, some of the issues that we face in Australia are longer term in nature. And as a result, we will need to properly align our capacity with changing long-term demand. We will restructure our Australian operations in several phases. In July, we implemented the first phase by permanently closing one machine line in Australia. And for the immediate future, other supply and demand imbalances will be managed through continued temporary downtime. 
The next phase of our restructuring plan will likely require additional permanent capacity adjustment in Australia. This plan must ensure that we retain the right capabilities and invest in the necessary technologies for our customers. Also we need to maintain flexibility to meet future demand levels in the event of an upswing in the market. Australia is now answering its seasonally strongest period, so it's prudent to delay restructuring activities until later this year. And we expect debt restructuring will conclude by the mid-2012. This restructuring in this region may result in up to $50 million of capital expenditures and severance costs. Up to half of this cost will be incurred in 2011, and the balance would fall into 2012. Overall, these actions should improve our cost profile in Australia. And I will keep you updated on our decisions regarding this quote on implementation of restructuring activities in future earnings calls. 
Now moving to Chart 7. We remain committed to our long-term strategy, which continues to deliver value for O-I. For example, our focus on operational excellence have generated $245 million of savings between 2007 and 2010, driven by our footprint realignment initiative. As we refocus on our core operations, we have been redesigning our organizational structure in each region. We are bringing manufacturing and supply chain functions under one regionally integrated operations list. This structure will remove the functional clutters in our operations and provide a more holistic approach to optimize the entire process flow. And this will help maximize operational efficiency and provide better visibility and control over production costs. 
Regarding strategic and profitable growth, in 2010, we acquired 10 plants located in fast-growing emerging markets that are generating an average operating profit margin of approximately 20% and creating a significant growth momentum. Last March, our new go-to-market approach has enhanced the effectiveness of our organic marketing efforts and has boosted our growth in South America 5 to 7 percentage points above average market growth. We are already seeing success in our other regions as we replicate this initiative globally. New capabilities like Vortex or Lean+Green wine bottles and Black Glass are driving additional sales in all regions. While our strategies are driving value, a number of other factors have undermined our ability to generate the improved financial performance that we expected when we set our longer-term targets back in 2010. And these factors include, first, the economic downturn impacted the markets that we serve longer than we expected at that time, especially with continued high unemployment in the developed market. And also the mega beer brands have not recovered as we anticipated when we were exiting the recession. Second, the expatriation of our highly profitable Venezuelan operations and of course, through a recent challenge with our operating performance that I discussed in detail with you. And finally, I believe that at present, our current earnings profile does not support acquisitions of the magnitude, speed and impact that we discussed at the last Investor Day. And given these developments, it is unlikely that we will achieve the longer-term targets that we discussed early last year, and we are currently revisiting these targets. I will now turn the call over to Ed."

We included much of this information in our press release and in Al's comments, so I will only touch on the highlights. Second quarter 2011 segment sales increased nearly 17% to more than $1.9 billion. Recent acquisitions and improving market conditions drove more than a 6% increase in tonnes shipped. This boosted the top line by $97 million. You can also see that currency translation substantially increased the top line, especially in Europe. Moving over to segment operating profit. The second quarter was $225 million compared to $271 million last year. Higher volumes contributed $26 million, but manufacturing and delivery costs increased by $78 million. Higher costs were largely driven by $61 million of cost inflation as expected. But an additional $26 million of North American production issues and another $10 million of unabsorbed fixed costs in Australia and New Zealand were not foreseen. 
Finishing with the EPS reconciliation. Our adjusted net income was $0.59 per share in the quarter compared to $0.84 in the prior year. Lower operating profit reduced earnings $0.21 from the prior year. Earnings were impacted $0.04 from unfavorable non-operating item, largely due to higher interest expense on incremental debt to fund 2010 acquisitions. Retained corporate costs were about flat with the prior year. Higher marketing spending and non-cash pension expenses were offset by $10 million of lower management compensation, which reflects adjustments to multiyear incentive plans and the impact of lower 2011 earnings. Also the merger of businesses in Brazil resulted in a tax benefit. Finally, we had 2 Note 1 expenses this quarter as outlined in our earnings release. 
Let's move to Chart 9 for more detail on our balance sheet, cash flow and capital structure. On June 30, 2011, cash was $260 million, and total debt was approximately $4.3 billion. The net debt was $4.1 billion, an increase of more than $1.2 billion from the prior year's second quarter, reflecting financing for acquisitions made last year and the impact of foreign currency translation on our debt. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 3.2x as with the end of the second quarter, well below the bank covenant limit of 4x. However, our ratio now exceeds our leverage target of between 2 and 3x EBITDA, so future debt reduction will be a priority. We believe this range represents an efficient capital structure for O-I and provides the financial flexibility needed to execute our strategy.
Free cash flow was $97 million in the second quarter, compared to a $6 million use of cash last year. Lower working capital levels and capital spending more than offset a decline in earnings. Let me shift now to our capital allocation priorities, and repeat what Al has said. We are clearly disappointed with our results this quarter, and we regret the impact that this has had on the O-I share price and on our shareholders. At our current stock price, we understand that a share buyback may be viewed as a compelling use of cash. However, we need to focus on debt reduction to lower our leverage to below 3x EBITDA by year end 2011. Further, it is essential that we dedicate some of our current year cash flow to restructure Australia, to rebuild inventories in North America and to begin to expand capacity in South America. 
Turning to capital expenditures. Our 2011 estimate has been reset. We now expect up to $375 million of CapEx, given the restructuring and capacity expansion I just mentioned. Finally, we're very pleased with the successful completion of our $2 billion bank credit agreement earlier in the second quarter. We also redeemed in the second quarter higher cost senior notes using attractively priced term debt. On Chart 10, we presented our business outlook for the third quarter. There are clearly many moving parts in our business, especially as we are taking actions to address our operating performance. As a result, we're providing the actual outlook on operating profit by segment for non-operational costs and overall adjusted earnings.
Our European third quarter profit should be in line with the prior year. We expect earnings will benefit from higher volumes and energy surcharges, yet cost inflation will remain elevated during the third quarter. As noted on the right, global cost inflation in excess of price will likely impact O-I's 2011 margins by more than $130 million, which we expect to recapture with a higher pricing mostly in 2012. In North America, we expect segment operating profit will lag the prior year. However, the manufacturing cost penalties we incurred in the second quarter should moderate as we increase capacity one full and improve operational and supply chain efficiencies over the course of the quarter. 
Our segment for Asia-Pacific operating performance will remain below prior-year earnings, given continued temporary production curtailment in Australia and New Zealand. However, earnings should benefit on a sequential basis from a seasonally stronger demand. In South America, segment operating profit should improve from the prior year. We anticipate shipments will remain very strong, and we also expect higher selling prices as we pass through the inflation incurred in the first half of 2011. Turning to non-operational items. We expect higher year-over-year corporate costs due continued sales and marketing initiatives and the higher pension expense we've seen all year. Further details are provided on the chart. 
Overall, we expect the operating performance to improve over the close of the third quarter, but we will still incur high manufacturing costs during the transition. Therefore, we expect third quarter adjusted earnings to have improved in the second quarter but will likely lag the prior year third quarter results. Now I will turn the call back to Al for closing remarks on Chart 11."

However, what we have seen in the past as well, Europe is also a market where normal pass-through provisions have an actual -- or have an additional dependency, and that is the supply-demand picture. So if the supply is long and demand is weak, it's very difficult to pass through inflation. But once supply and demand is balanced as we are seeing this year, and in fact in the peak season, we see supply is outstripped by demand, you really then get pricing power. And one of the indications that gives me the confidence for next year is the fact that we went into the market with an energy surcharge, that we were able to negotiate with our customers in quite a few countries fairly successfully, and that I believe gives me the confidence that we are seeing some good opportunity for price improvement. Equally, we have been negotiating certain longer-term contracts that were reset in the course of this year, because we don't if we can do that at the end of the year. And in some of those cases -- or in most of those cases that I'm aware of, we have been able to raise our prices mid to high-single digits.

So whatever we're putting in place as far as additional capacity, it's not for future demands that has not yet materialized. It's basically to serve already existing demand that we're serving from a higher cost base. With regard to the currency impact, comparing it to Australia, really, the issue in Australia is one of having such a significant export component and each consumer of glass, which the wine industry represents. When I look at our demand profile in Brazil, virtually -- almost all with very few exceptions, less than 1% I would say, is consumed domestically. There is not a lot of exports of Brazilian brands into the rest of the world. So I would say that based on the information that we have at this point in time and also the growth that we saw continuing in the second quarter, Brazil still continues to be on a very positive path for us going forward, and we have to be ready to serve the demand. Now I know you have heard, and you have seen that a lot of new capacity is added in the aluminum industry as well, looking forward to a  continued growth in Brazil. And I think that there too, there is a level of confidence that certainly in the long-term, Brazil will continue to be significant contributor to the growth profile of their business."

So it would be a couple of hundred miles away, which of course added significantly to the logistics cost. The other part that really contributed to the cost as well is that due to the changeovers -- during the changeover periods, we create quite a bit of material that we cannot really sell, that we have to reuse in our operations and then of course contribute significantly to the product loss. But fundamentally, from an infrastructure perspective, we are basically placed very well. I believe one thing that we perhaps misinterpreted and misunderstood was that facilities that typically were used to run wine and beer brands for a particular brand, and suddenly had to have a lot more changeovers had difficulty spiking with that additional complexity."

Whereas in the United States, the entire customer environment has been more monolithic, and we have been focusing on large beer runs as our main focus areas in the past. And we just felt at the time when we entered into a more proactive pursuit of these smaller SKUs and higher pricing points, that because we have the capability in the company that we would have the capability in North America as well.

But I believe they were hoping throughout the entire year last year that eventually currency would weaken, and they would be able to reoccupy the shelf space for their wine. And typically, you go into the stores, you find Australian or New Zealand line at a particular price range, generally it's around the $10 price level. And with, right now, the Australian dollar at $1.10 to the U.S. dollar versus $0.70 or so 1 year, 1.5 year ago, of course, the entire margin has disappeared out of that business. And to try to reprice the product would require rebranding because people are not going to buy the same brand they used to buy for $10 suddenly for $20. So that's a very long-term proposition. I believe that fundamentally, the vintners have come to the conclusion that long-term, given the continued demand for basic raw materials in Australia, most probably the currency will continue to be at a high-level and therefore, that situation is not likely to change. So you see why the dramatic and significant changeover from packets, shipments, packets, products, shipments to bulk shipments. They're not giving up on the market, but they're approaching the market in a different model, and that of course does not affect the overall consumption of glass on a global scale. Because what we're losing in Australia and New Zealand, we may be picking up in the U.K. or may be picking up in North America, and that's why we're seeing in North America, for instance, a fairly strong trend for wine bottles at this point in time. So it's a fairly complex equation, but I don't think that we can expect that the Australian dollar is going to weaken so significantly that we can reoccupy the price tag in the shelf.[ph]"

We have tried to counteract some of that in the past by making sure that in our long-term agreements and contracts, we have quarterly or monthly pass-through provisions for the most volatile cost component. But if you have considerable increases in raw material, if you have considerable increases in labor cost, or if you have considerable increases in energy prices in those markets where you don't have long-term contracts and pass-through provisions, you automatically get a contraction or compaction of your margin. What we then also typically find is that when we go down in the following year, where most of that inflation has run its course, we typically see margin expansion. Because that's when these inflationary forces will be passed through in the pricing and pricing arrangements we have with our customers. So I would say what we're seeing today is not necessarily indicative of a weakness in our overall objectives and targets as far as margin contribution from the glass industry is concerned. It is just that because of the way contracts are set up, it really has quite a bit of variability from year-to-year depending on when inflation occurs and at what place inflation occurs."

Even the market of destination, labor costs are high or comparable with Australia, at least they have saved the freight. Even the destination markets, labor costs are low, they have the added benefit of low labor cost as well as reduced rate. And that is allowing them to at least occupy the shelf space at a margin that is better than the margin they're getting at this point in time.

Our second quarter 2011 adjusted earnings were $0.59 per share, down considerably from $0.84 last year. Clearly, we are disappointed with these results, and our performance was unacceptable. Heading into the second quart",2906,"Thank you, John, and good morning. Our second quarter 2011 adjusted earnings were $0.59 per share, down considerably from $0.84 last year. Clearly, we are disappointed with these results, and our performance was unacceptable. Heading into the second quarter, we expected our earnings would be in line with the prior year despite elevated cost inflation. However, we incurred significantly higher manufacturing costs, which more than offset the benefit of higher shipments on a global basis.
Market demand has started to rebound after several years of unfavorable trends in our business. Shipments in tonnes were up more than 6% in the second quarter, driven by recent acquisitions as well as organic growth. In fact, demand was up across all key end-use categories on a global basis. This should have been a very favorable environment for O-I, given our work in the past to create significant operating leverage from improving demand. However, we incurred much higher manufacturing costs due to elevated cost inflation, production issues in North America and market challenges in Australia and New Zealand. Cost inflation accounted for most of the additional manufacturing costs. While inflation was not a surprise, energy prices in Europe have increased faster and to a greater extent than we expected heading into the year. And we have discussed this trend in detail during previous earnings calls. 
We have implemented an energy surcharge in Europe to help offset the impact of the most recent spike in energy pricing. The combination of our surcharge this year and expected higher selling prices next year should fully offset the impact of 2011 cost inflation on a global basis.
In North America, poor operating performance resulted in manufacturing inefficiencies and supply chain issues. As a result, we incurred higher production and logistics costs as well as additional expenses for product loss. Challenging market conditions in Australia and New Zealand resulted in sharply lower demand in those countries. And in response, we reduced our production to match supply with demand, which led to a higher unabsorbed fixed cost in Asia-Pacific.
As we respond with urgency to these issues, my leadership team and I are focusing on our core operations to restore high productivity level. We also need to significantly improve our ability to generate a more accurate business forecast. Serving our customers and maximizing our long-term earnings are our highest priority. Despite our disappointing operating performance, we can point to a number of positive developments this past quarter. Organic growth was 3%, excluding the impact of a much lower demand in Australia and New Zealand. We generated $97 million of free cash flow, and we acquired the remaining interest in our 7 Brazil operations from our minority partner. O-I will now fully benefit from future growth and profit improvement in the attractive Brazilian market. And finally, we refinanced debt to extend maturities and increase financial flexibility. 
Looking to the third quarter, we expect shipments will be up in all regions and end uses on a year-over-year basis. As we focus on fully restoring our operating performance, we will still incur higher manufacturing costs during this transition period. And as a result, we expect third quarter adjusted earnings will improve from our second quarter results but likely lag the prior year. Looking to the full year, we have revised our 2011 free cash flow target for a number of reasons. In Australia, we are restructuring our footprint in response to changes in demand. This will result in additional capital spending and severance costs. In North America, we will rebuild inventory levels to avoid repeating significant supply chain disruptions as demand improves. And in Europe, we expect some restructuring costs as part of the purchase price for our recent VDL acquisition. And finally, we will invest in capacity expansion in South America to improve margins and support growth. As a result, our 2011 free cash flow target has been reduced from $300 million to between $200 million and $250 million. 
Now I will review each of our segments, and I'll start with Europe, our largest region, on Chart #3.  Europe performed as expected. Operating profit was $107 million compared with $104 million in the second quarter of 2010. The benefit of favorable currency translation and higher shipments offset elevated cost inflation. Shipments were up mid-single digits in Europe as demand grew across all key end-use segments. Selling prices were flat with the prior year, reflecting the annual contracts negotiated last year when supply demand conditions and inflation levels were much softer and those we are experiencing today. In response to the higher cost inflation, we have successfully negotiated energy surcharges of approximately $15 million to $20 million in the second half of the year. Overall, we expect to fully pass on the impact of 2011 cost inflation on Europe to our surcharge this year and higher prices next year. And in the future, we plan to include prospective inflation provisions into our annual customer agreements there. 
Several days ago, we announced the acquisition of VDL, which operates a single glass plant in Vergeze, France, located near the Nestlé Waters' Perrier bottling facility. We have strengthened our strategic relationship with Nestlé and are now the leading glass container provider for both their Perrier and San Pellegrino brands in France and Italy, respectively. 
Moving to Chart 4. Our South American operations also performed as expected and generated operating profit of $53 million in the second quarter, up from $49 million last year. Volumes were up more than 35% year-over-year. Our strategic acquisitions last year accounted for most of this growth. But the region also posted double-digit organic growth driven by Brazil, Argentina and Peru. But the benefit of higher shipments was mostly offset by higher costs. So segment operating -- sorry -- segment profit margin was about 18%, which was lower than we typically see in this region for a few reasons. First, we incurred additional cost inflation. While our second quarter prices were flat with the prior year, we expect to recapture cost inflation through higher prices beginning in the third quarter.
Second, our Brazilian operations were sold out, and we shipped glass from other countries in the region to meet growing Brazilian demand. These shipments had associated freight and importation penalties, that allowed us to meet growing demand before we commit more capital for expansion in the region. Throughout the glass [indiscernible] situation, we incurred some costs to realign machinery and increase capacity in Brazil. And to support continued growth, we will further debottleneck our operations there. We are also planning a Greenfield plant in South America to support our customers' long-term growth needs. And finally, as I mentioned already, we bought out our minority partner in our Southern Brazil operations, and we expect this transaction to be accretive in 2011. 
Moving to North America on Chart #5. Heading into the second quarter, we had expected higher earnings compared to the prior year. We anticipated stronger shipments combined with footprint initiative sales. However, North American's operating profit was $56 million, down from $87 million in the prior year. Most of the decline was due to $26 million from production inefficiency, higher freight costs and product loss. Due to a number of operating issues, we were not able to meet all of our customers' needs. And as a result, shipments in North America were down slightly despite fundamental strength in all key end-use markets other than the mega beer brand. 
We have always prided ourselves on our operational excellence and our ability to meet or exceed our customers' expectations. We failed to meet those standards in the second quarter, but we expect to significantly improve our service level in the back half of the year. The graph on Chart 5 depicts the chain of events that led to our issues in the region this quarter, and keep in mind that the last result [ph] does not represent specific data. The blue line represents our effective manufacturing capacity, while the yellow line illustrates seasonal demand pattern. We permanently closed 2 plants in North America in mid-2010 to realign capacity with lower demand, following the conclusions of contract renegotiations with key customers. Given soft demand last year, we were focused on efficient working capital levels, and we maintained tight inventories as we entered 2011. And the green dotted line represents inventory levels to show relative trend. But again, it's illustrative. Then as 2011 progressed, several things happened. First, demand started to pick up in North America, but the growth was in wine, spirits and craft beer and not in mega beer brand. This mix created additional complexities that we underestimated. For example, more SKUs result in shorter production runs, which require greater flexibility in our plant.
We struggled with a greater number of job changes at several plants and did not achieve the same production efficiency that we typically see with the mega beer brands. Second, we had a number of production interruptions that required downtime for repairs. As you can see, this downtime coincided with seasonally stronger demand. As a result, we did not achieve the productivity improvements that we expected in the second quarter.
And third, longer lead times on repair parts delayed the anticipated restart of 2 previously idle furnaces, so we did not get the much needed additional capacity as fast as we had expected. As a result of these issues, tight inventory became short inventory at several locations. And to serve our customers, we had to reallocate production to other facilities in North America. Now this in turn disrupted those plants' normal manufacturing patterns, which led to incremental costs. Since production sometimes occurred to plants hundreds of miles away from the customer, we also incurred significant higher freight cost, all of which unfortunately coincided with spiking diesel costs. You can see the domino affect that started with production issues early in the quarter. Now to address these issues, we have initiated a plan to both restore our inventories to sustainable levels and improve production efficiency over the course of the second half of the year.
First, we're taking immediate action to rebuild inventory. We restarted our 2 previously idle furnaces, and they were up and running by early July. This added approximately 5% more production capacity to the region. We are also leveraging our global footprint by shifting glass from other regions to increase North American inventories by about 5%. And finally, our North American plants will, of course, run at high operating rates through the end of the year.
As a result of these actions, we expect to rebuild North American inventories and reduce the risk of significant future supply chain complication. Over the next 6 months, we are focusing on returning to operational excellence in North America. Most of our inefficiencies during the second quarter was tied to discrete production issues, which we do not expect to recur. Nevertheless, we are conducting thorough manufacturing audits of our 19 North American facilities to determine if there are any unidentified production risks. Of course, we will take the necessary actions to remediate if anything is found. Finally, we are actively collaborating with our customers to improve the SKU accuracy of their demand forecast, as well as our production forecast. This will then help avoid the many unplanned changes and changeovers that compromise productivity. A more effective supply chain will benefit both O-I and our customers. And for future customer contracts, we will look to include provision from forecast accuracy to create clarity about supply commitments and ownership of cost variances.
To avoid additional disruption in this difficult period, we have delayed our SAP implementation in North America until early 2012. Let me reiterate, our second quarter performance in North America was unacceptable and full remediation of these issues is priority number one. 
Now moving from North America to Asia-Pacific on Chart 6. Heading into the second quarter, we expected our Asia-Pacific profits would be down from the prior year as a result of lower demand in Australia and New Zealand. And we've been discussing this trend over the past few quarters. However, actual results were significantly lower than anticipated. Asia-Pacific earned $9 million, down $22 million from the prior year. Although total regional shipments were up slightly from the prior year, all growth was attributable to our 2010 acquisitions in China. Our shipments of wine and beer bottles in Australia and New Zealand were down nearly 20% from the prior year. This resulted in $7 million of lower profit contribution from sales. Two macroeconomic headwinds drove the precipitous drop in shipments in these 2 countries. Stronger currencies have negatively impacted wine exports and led to some fundamentally different approaches by our wine customers to their future business models. Domestically, beer consumption was down considerably as high interests and savings rates have lowered consumers' disposable income, and this has cost a severe cutback in consumer spending.
While we anticipated lower shipments, demand trends in the wine and beer markets deteriorated faster than expected in the second quarter. In particular, Australia wine producers reduced in-country bottling given the dramatic increase in the value of the Australian dollar. In response, we reduced production to balance supply with lower demand, resulting in $10 million of unabsorbed manufacturing costs on top of the loss sales contribution from lower costs. Given these developments, we are taking the following actions. First, we recently named Steve Bramlage as the new President of the Asia-Pacific region, who replaced Greg Ridder who is leaving the company. Greg will report to me and serve as a member of the global leadership team. He previously served as the Treasurer and Vice President of Finance for O-I, and more recently as the General Manager of our New Zealand operations. We believe Steve will provide a fresh perspective to address the market challenges in the region.
Second, some of the issues that we face in Australia are longer term in nature. And as a result, we will need to properly align our capacity with changing long-term demand. We will restructure our Australian operations in several phases. In July, we implemented the first phase by permanently closing one machine line in Australia. And for the immediate future, other supply and demand imbalances will be managed through continued temporary downtime. 
The next phase of our restructuring plan will likely require additional permanent capacity adjustment in Australia. This plan must ensure that we retain the right capabilities and invest in the necessary technologies for our customers. Also we need to maintain flexibility to meet future demand levels in the event of an upswing in the market. Australia is now entering its seasonally strongest period, so it's prudent to delay restructuring activities until later this year. And we expect that restructuring will conclude by the mid-2012. This restructuring in this region may result in up to $50 million of capital expenditures and severance costs. Up to half of this cost will be incurred in 2011, and the balance would fall into 2012. Overall, these actions should improve our cost profile in Australia. And I will keep you updated on our decisions regarding the scope and implementation of restructuring activities in future earnings calls. 
Now moving to Chart 7. We remain committed to our long-term strategy, which continues to deliver value for O-I. For example, our focus on operational excellence has generated $245 million of savings between 2007 and 2010, driven by our footprint realignment initiative. As we refocus on our core operations, we have been redesigning our organizational structure in each region. We are bringing manufacturing and supply chain functions under one regionally integrated operations list. This structure will remove the functional clutters in our operations and provide a more holistic approach to optimize the entire process flow. And this will help maximize operational efficiency and provide better visibility and control over production costs. 
Regarding strategic and profitable growth, in 2010, we acquired 10 plants located in fast-growing emerging markets that are generating an average operating profit margin of approximately 20% and creating a significant growth momentum. Last March, our new go-to-market approach has enhanced the effectiveness of our organic marketing efforts and has boosted our growth in South America 5 to 7 percentage points above average market growth. We are already seeing success in our other regions as we replicate this initiative globally. New capabilities like Vortex or Lean+Green wine bottles and Black Glass are driving additional sales in all regions. While our strategies are driving value, a number of other factors have undermined our ability to generate the improved financial performance that we expected when we set our longer-term targets back in 2010. And these factors include, first, the economic downturn impacted the markets that we serve longer than we expected at that time, especially with continued high unemployment in the developed market. And also the mega beer brands have not recovered as we anticipated when we were exiting the recession. Second, the expropriation of our highly profitable Venezuelan operations and of course, throughout the recent challenge with our operating performance that I discussed in detail with you. And finally, I believe that at present, our current earnings profile does not support acquisitions of the magnitude, speed and impact that we discussed at the last Investor Day. And given these developments, it is unlikely that we will achieve the longer-term targets that we discussed early last year, and we are currently revisiting these targets. I will now turn the call over to Ed."

Second quarter 2011 segment sales increased nearly 17% to more than $1.9 billion. Recent acquisit",954,"Thank you, Al. Let's move to Chart 8. We included much of this information in our press release and in Al's comments, so I will only touch on the highlights. Second quarter 2011 segment sales increased nearly 17% to more than $1.9 billion. Recent acquisitions and improving market conditions drove more than a 6% increase in tonnes shipped. This boosted the top line by $97 million. You can also see that currency translation substantially increased the top line, especially in Europe. Moving over to segment operating profit. The second quarter was $225 million compared to $271 million last year. Higher volumes contributed $26 million, but manufacturing and delivery costs increased by $78 million. Higher costs were largely driven by $61 million of cost inflation as expected. But an additional $26 million of North American production issues and another $10 million of unabsorbed fixed costs in Australia and New Zealand were not foreseen. 
Finishing with the EPS reconciliation. Our adjusted net income was $0.59 per share in the quarter compared to $0.84 in the prior year. Lower operating profit reduced earnings $0.21 from the prior year. Earnings were impacted $0.04 from unfavorable non-operating item, largely due to higher interest expense on incremental debt to fund 2010 acquisitions. Retained corporate costs were about flat with the prior year. Higher marketing spending and non-cash pension expenses were offset by $10 million of lower management compensation, which reflects adjustments to multiyear incentive plans and the impact of lower 2011 earnings. Also the merger of businesses in Brazil resulted in a tax benefit. Finally, we had 2 Note 1 expenses this quarter as outlined in our earnings release. 
Let's move to Chart 9 for more detail on our balance sheet, cash flow and capital structure. On June 30, 2011, cash was $260 million, and total debt was approximately $4.3 billion. The net debt was $4.1 billion, an increase of more than $1.2 billion from the prior year's second quarter, reflecting financing for acquisitions made last year and the impact of foreign currency translation on our debt. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 3.2x as with the end of the second quarter, well below the bank covenant limit of 4x. However, our ratio now exceeds our leverage target of between 2 and 3x EBITDA, so future debt reduction will be a priority. We believe this range represents an efficient capital structure for O-I and provides the financial flexibility needed to execute our strategy.
Free cash flow was $97 million in the second quarter, compared to a $6 million use of cash last year. Lower working capital levels and capital spending more than offset a decline in earnings. Let me shift now to our capital allocation priorities, and repeat what Al has said. We are clearly disappointed with our results this quarter, and we regret the impact that this has had on the O-I share price and on our shareholders. At our current stock price, we understand that a share buyback may be viewed as a compelling use of cash. However, we need to focus on debt reduction to lower our leverage to below 3x EBITDA by year end 2011. Further, it is essential that we dedicate some of our current year cash flow to restructure Australia, to rebuild inventories in North America and to begin to expand capacity in South America. 
Turning to capital expenditures. Our 2011 estimate has been reset. We now expect up to $375 million of CapEx, given the restructuring and capacity expansion I just mentioned. Finally, we're very pleased with the successful completion of our $2 billion bank credit agreement earlier in the second quarter. We also redeemed in the second quarter higher cost senior notes using attractively priced term debt. On Chart 10, we present our business outlook for the third quarter. There are clearly many moving parts in our business, especially as we are taking actions to address our operating performance. As a result, we're providing directional outlook on operating profit by segment, for non-operational costs and overall adjusted earnings.
Our European third quarter profit should be in line with the prior year. We expect earnings will benefit from higher volumes and energy surcharges, yet cost inflation will remain elevated during the third quarter. As noted on the right, global cost inflation in excess of price will likely impact O-I's 2011 margins by more than $130 million, which we expect to recapture through the higher pricing mostly in 2012. In North America, we expect segment operating profit will lag the prior year. However, the manufacturing cost penalties we incurred in the second quarter should moderate as we increase capacity, run full and improve operational and supply chain efficiencies over the course of the quarter. 
Our segment for Asia-Pacific operating performance will remain below prior-year earnings, given continued temporary production curtailment in Australia and New Zealand. However, earnings should benefit on a sequential basis from seasonally stronger demand. In South America, segment operating profit should improve from the prior year. We anticipate shipments will remain very strong, and we also expect higher selling prices as we pass through the inflation incurred in the first half of 2011. Turning to non-operational items. We expect higher year-over-year corporate costs due continued sales and marketing initiatives and the higher pension expense we've seen all year. Further details are provided on the chart. 
Overall, we expect the operating performance to improve over the close of the third quarter, but we will still incur high manufacturing costs during the transition. Therefore, we expect third quarter adjusted earnings to have improved on the second quarter but will likely lag the prior year third quarter results. Now I will turn the call back to Al for closing remarks on Chart 11."

While this has been a sobering quarter for O-I, we should not lose sight that our business fundamentals remain strong. Many glass markets are strengthening, and we have the tools and capabilities that we need to refocus our operation. We have a very good understanding of what went wrong over the last few months, and we have taken this situation very seriously and realize that we disappointed our investors as well as some customers. We're implementing corrective action plans in North America and Asia-Pacific as described, and we expect to bring the operating performance of both regions up to the high standard we have demonstrated in the past. 
We now expect free cash flow for 2011 to be in the range of $200 million to $250 million, and we're focusing our capital allocation on remediation plans, expansion in South America and debt reduction. Further, we do not foresee any significant acquisitions at this time in the second half of 2011. And as you can see, our priorities are focused on operational excellence in the near term, which ultimately is the foundation of our long-term strategy.

However, what we have seen in the past as well, Europe is also a market where normal pass-through provisions have an actual -- or have an additional dependency, and that is the new supply-demand picture. So if supply is long and demand is weak, it's very difficult to pass through inflation. But once supply and demand is balanced as we are seeing this year, and in fact in the peak season, we see supply is outstripped by demand, you really then get pricing power. And one of the indications that gives me the confidence for next year is the fact that we went into the market with an energy surcharge, that we were able to negotiate with our customers in quite a few countries fairly successfully, and that I believe gives me the confidence that we are seeing some good opportunity for price improvement. Equally, we have been negotiating certain longer-term contracts that were reset in the course of this year, because they don't all come due at the end of the year. And in some of those cases -- or in most of those cases that I'm aware of, we have been able to raise our prices mid to high-single digits.

So whatever we're putting in place as far as additional capacity is not for future demands that has not yet materialized. It's basically to serve already existing demand that we're serving from a higher cost basis. With regard to the currency impact, comparing it to Australia, really, the issue in Australia is one of having such a significant export component and a huge consumer of glass, which the wine industry represents. When I look at our demand profile in Brazil, virtually -- almost all with very few exceptions, less than 1% I would say, is consumed domestically. There is not a lot of export of Brazilian brands into the rest of the world. So I would say that based on the information that we have at this point in time and also the growth that we saw continuing in the second quarter, Brazil still continues to be on a very positive path for us going forward, and we have to be ready to serve the demand. Now I know you have heard, and you have seen that a lot of new capacity is added in the aluminum industry as well, looking forward to a  continued growth in Brazil.

So it would be a couple of hundred miles away, which of course added significantly to the logistics cost. The other part that really contributed to the cost as well is that due to the changeovers -- during the changeover periods, we create quite a bit of material that we cannot really sell, that we have to reuse in our operations and that of course contribute significantly to the product loss. But fundamentally, from an infrastructure perspective, we are basically placed very well.

32583,130884371,148134,"Owens-Illinois, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2011",2011-07-28,"Earnings Calls","O-I Glass, Inc.","Executives","Well, Alton, I believe that's, of course, the 64-million-dollar question for the customers as well. But I believe they were hoping throughout the entire year last year that eventually currency would weaken, and they would be able to reoccupy the shelf spa",313,"Well, Alton, I believe that's, of course, the 64-million-dollar question for the customers as well. But I believe they were hoping throughout the entire year last year that eventually currency would weaken, and they would be able to reoccupy the shelf space for their wine. And typically, you go into the stores, you find Australian or New Zealand wine at a particular price range, generally it's around the $10 price level. And with, right now, the Australian dollar at $1.10 to the U.S. dollar versus $0.70 or so 1 year, 1.5 year ago, of course, the entire margin has disappeared out of that business. And to try to reprice the product would require rebranding because people are not going to buy the same brand they used to buy for $10 suddenly for $20. So that's a very long-term proposition. I believe that fundamentally, the vintners have come to the conclusion that long-term, given the continued demand for basic raw materials in Australia, most probably the currency will continue to be at a high-level and therefore, that situation is not likely to change. So you see why the dramatic and significant changeover from packaged shipments, packaged product shipments to bulk shipments. They're not giving up on the market, but they're approaching the market in a different model, and that of course does not affect the overall consumption of glass on a global scale. Because what we're losing in Australia and New Zealand, we may be picking up in the U.K. or may be picking up in North America, and that's why we're seeing in North America, for instance, a fairly strong trend for wine bottles at this point in time. So it's a fairly complex equation, but I don't think that we can expect that the Australian dollar is going to weaken so significantly that we can reoccupy the price spot in the shelf."

We have tried to counteract some of that in the past by making sure that in our long-term agreements and contracts, we have quarterly or monthly pass-through provisions for the most volatile cost component. But if you have considerable increases in raw material, if you have considerable increases in labor cost, or if you have considerable increases in energy prices in those markets where you don't have long-term contracts with pass-through provisions, you automatically get a contraction or compaction of your margin. What we then also typically find is that when we go down in the following year, where most of that inflation has run its course, we typically see margin expansion. Because that's when these inflationary forces will be passed through in the pricing and pricing arrangements we have with our customers. So I would say what we're seeing today is not necessarily indicative of a weakness in our overall objectives and targets as far as margin contribution from the glass industry is concerned. It is just that because of the way contracts are set up, it really has quite a bit of variability from year-to-year depending on when inflation occurs and at what place inflation occurs."

Given the pricing points that they need to achieve on the shelves in the markets where they have positioned themselves, they are trying to reduce the freight cost.

If in the market of destination, labor costs are high or comparable with Australia, at least they have saved the freight. If in the destination markets, labor costs are low, they have the added benefit of low labor cost as well as reduced freight. And that is allowing them to at least occupy the shelf space at a margin that is better than the margin they're getting at this point in time.

Overall, we've made good progress during the third quarter especially following a challenging second quarter as operating performance improved in North America and Asia-Pacific. Our third quarter 2011 adjusted earnings we",1878,"Thank you, John and good morning. Overall, we've made good progress during the third quarter especially following a challenging second quarter as operating performance improved in North America and Asia-Pacific. Our third quarter 2011 adjusted earnings were $0.84 per share, up considerably from $0.59 in the second quarter and in line with the $0.83 recorded in the prior year.
On a year-over-year basis, earnings benefited from higher glass volumes, selling prices and production levels, as well as lower protective tax rate yet undercovered inflation, remained a significant headwind and essentially offsets these favorable trends.
Shipments in the third quarter were up 4% compared to the same quarter last year. This increase was driven primarily by our 2010 acquisitions of a global organic growth around 2% after excluding the impact of unfavorable volume trends. 
Selling prices were up about 1.5 percentage and included the additional energy surcharges that we successfully implemented in Europe. All regions reported higher production levels. Importantly, North America ran at high operator rates for the quarter and the region further benefited from the restart of 2 previously idled premises.
In Australia, market conditions stabilized at lower levels. To address the challenges in this country, we closed the furnace at the end of the third quarter. Additional restructuring actions will be required in Australia and one additional furnace closure is planned by mid-2012. As I said before, the benefits of unfavorable volumes, price and production transferred a global basis were offset again this quarter by as yet, recovered cost inflation. Higher selling prices will be required in 2-12 to recover inflation for this year, as well as additional inflation expected next year.
We generated $100 million of free cash flow in the third quarter and allocated nearly all of it to pay down debt. Our leverage ratio is now just within our target range though we will continue to focus in murder debt reduction to enhance our financial facility.
Reflecting uncertain macroeconomic conditions, we expect our fourth global shipment levels will be flat to slightly up compared to prior year. At the same time, high cost inflation will persist and exceed the benefit of higher prices. Currency exchange rates have been volatile in recent months and this could negatively impact fourth quarter earnings. Also, as part of our normal fourth quarter review, we will adjust production to ensure working capital levels are appropriate heading into 2012.
Overall, fourth quarter earnings should approximate the prior year and we still expect full year free cash flow to range between $200 million and $250 million, which is unchanged from the most recent guidance.
Now I will review each of our segments and I will start with Europe, our largest region on Chart 3. Europe generated operating profit of $106 million in the third quarter compared to $114 million in the third quarter of 2010. The benefits of higher shipments in the prices and favorable currency translation were again offset by continued high cost inflation. Shipments were up slightly in Europe during the quarter with higher volume across several key end-use segments such as Macroeconomic news out of Europe has been volatile in the past few months, with the uncertainty related to sovereign debt and the banking sector and although our European shipments growth trends moderated compared to earlier this year, we have not seen any major decline and consumer trends in the end markets.
Market trends vary by countries depending on their exposure to Europe's financial challenges and debenture also vary for the quarter partially.
Selling prices in the third quarter were up about 2% from the prior year, mostly reflecting the impact of the energy surcharges that we implemented. Finally, we have started to negotiate our 2012 annual customer agreements, which cover the majority of our European business. As I mentioned, we expect to fully pass on the impact of unrecovered 2011 cost inflation, as well as 2012 estimated inflation. Our high operating rates have high inflation should enable us to be successful with our pricing strategy.
Overall, we expect to increase our selling prices in Europe, on average, between high single or even double digits across our customer base in 2012. When possible, we intend to include the provision in future as well contracts permitting a timely pass-through of energy cost and actual prices vary significantly from. We will provide an update on the outcome of our contract negotiations on our next earnings call.
Moving to Chart 4. Our South American operations performed well and generated operating profit of $67 million in the third quarter, up from $56 million last year. Volumes increased about 24% from the prior year. Organic growth accounted for about 15 percentage points of this improvement and was driven by strong sales in Brazil and Argentina. The balance of our growth was due to our acquisition of CIV in September of last year.
As expected, segment profit in South America increased to nearly 22% in the third quarter. business in Brazil continues to lead the glass container industry and outperforms other packaging subsegments. Projected Brazilian growth trends are impressive.  Euromonitor estimates 4% annual growth trends through the year 2015. Our customers look to O-I to provide innovative, high-quality glass containers for their products. Last March, our go-to-market approach continues to boost our growth by approximately 5 to 7 percentage points above the average market estimate.
Now let me discuss our capacity trends and plans in Brazil. We continue to expect robust growth in this country. In the short term, we plan to increase our capacity by adding a furnace at an existing plant to meet current volumes while Brazil will remain independent on sizable imports to continue to cover its existing and future demands. As we bring additional capacity online later in 2012, we will be able to reduce some of the incremental costs we have in incurring to import glass into the country.
Finally, like in Europe, we expect high single-digit price improvement across South America in 2012 to offset inflation.
Moving to North America on Chart 5. We made good progress this quarter improving as a result, we generated $73 million of operating profit in the third quarter, slightly up from $72 million in the prior year. Shipments in North America were up 2% from the third quarter of 2010. Better operating performance allows the region to meet our customers shipments requirements, and we continue to see fundamentals strength in the wines, spirits and craft beer end markets we serve. While shipments with our mega deal customers decline from the prior year, total beer shipments in the region were flat due to the double-digit growth. Year-over-year prices were slightly up and 2010 price adjustment. However, 2011 inflation for raw materials and other annual pass-through cost factors more than offset any pricing gains.
To begin to remedy this margin impact, we implemented an average price increase of 6% earlier this month on our open market business in a market, which accounts for about 10% to 15% of our business. This price increases is less than other regions growth in the lower energy inflation in North America. Next year, we scheduled price adjustments in our existing multiyear agreements will recapture the 2011 cost inflation. Let's now move to some of the key operational improvements related in North America this quarter.
First, our average operating rate across our manufacturing base was in the mid-90s, which is a clear improvement from the second quarter. Also, our 2 restarted furnaces ran at full capacity since the beginning of the quarter. To ensure that we've mitigated the risk of future production issues, we are conducting operational audits at all our plants in North America and we have identified and/or beginning to implement a number of process improvement that will serve to increase our performance.
The graph at the bottom of Chart 5 reflects 2 of our trends that we're monitoring as part of our remediation plan. The blue bars show our inventory levels and you can see inventory rapidly decreasing in the first quarter as unplanned production interruptions coincide with stronger demand levels. We made good progress rebuilding inventory in the third quarter and we expect to continue this improvement on the fourth quarter as supply and demand trends dictate The red line is that shows average delivery distances for our customers shipments. As inventory levels decreased early in the year, we will require to reallocate production to manufacturing metrics in North America. As a result, we incurred higher freight costs as we shipped finished products much longer this time. We have made some progress reducing auto pattern freight rate in the third quarter and should continue to see these come down further in a fourth quarter.
Although I'm pleased with our initial progress, we have more work in front of us to improve operating performance in North America.
Moving from North America to Asia-Pacific on Chart 6. We generated segment operating profit of $23 million in the third quarter, down from $37 million of the prior year. However, segment profit rebounded from the $9 million reported in the second quarter. Shipments in the region were up slightly from the prior year as in the second quarter. All growth was attributable to our 2010 acquisitions in China. In Australia, market conditions have stabilized yet remained challenging, resulting in lower year-over-year sales and production levels. Shipments of wine and beer bottles in the country were down nearly 15% from the prior year. To advance the challenges the challenges country, we finalized a significant phase of our Australian restructuring plan in the quarter and we close one furnace at the end of September.
One additional furnace disclosure is planned by mid-2012. We recorded a $20 million charge primarily related to the furnace closures and these actions will reduce fixed cost and improve our capabilities and system flexibility. Additional restructuring activities will be determined after we have set supply and demand trends, as well as the outcome of significant contract negotiations by the mid of 2012.
You may have heard about the landslide in New Zealand earlier this week that has interrupted the supply of natural gas to the upper North Island As a result our factory in Auckland, as well as many other customers facilities have temporarily ceased production until the pipeline is fixed. This may take a week or so and we expect that we have a modest impact on a fourth quarter earnings.
Moving to China. We continue to reorient our existing footprint within a dynamic business environment in the country. We do not foresee any new acquisitions in the short term. Our priorities are to optimize our existing efforts and business performance, which includes integrating our 2010 acquisitions. During the quarter, we made solid progress on raising our prices in China. As we have mentioned in the past, several of our legacy facilities are fast becoming encroached by urban growth. This as a pressure on us to relocate our facilities but also provides you opportunity to move closer to our customers and improve our footprint. As a result of the urban encroachment the land values of these operatives have increased so significantly that they will allow us to fund to revoke of this capacity at alternative sites. I will now turn the call over to Ed."
32583,138457114,179224,"Owens-Illinois, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2011",2011-10-27,"Earnings Calls","O-I Glass, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Al. Let's move to Chart 7 and begin our financial review of the third quarter reconciliation for sales, operating profit and EPS. Third quarter 2011 segment sales increased approximately 10% to more than $1.8 billion. As Al mentioned, our volumes",1060,"Thanks, Al. Let's move to Chart 7 and begin our financial review of the third quarter reconciliation for sales, operating profit and EPS. Third quarter 2011 segment sales increased approximately 10% to more than $1.8 billion. As Al mentioned, our volumes increased 4%, this was the top line basics $4 million. Higher prices also increased the top line by $25 million in the quarter. Shifts in product mix offset approximately about $8 million of the higher selling prices. You can also see the currency translations substantially increased the top line.
Moving over to segment operating profit. The third quarter profit was $269 million, $10 million below $279 million reported last year. Higher volumes added $16 million, largely driven by strong growth in South America. Higher pricing benefited segment operating profit by $25 million while the change in product mix that impacted the top line had a negligible profit impact. Manufacturing and delivery costs increased by $37 million. These higher costs were largely driven by $55 million of cost inflation. But favorable year-over-year production levels in all regions except for Asia-Pacific, partially offset inflation this quarter This benefited a component of the positive operating leverage that we continue to see generated this year as the facility at higher capacity utilization rates. Operating expenses increased by $9 million from the prior year, partially reflecting investments made to support sales and marketing initiatives. Our glass marketing have been running for several months now. Our campaign features the premium in each of O-I glass packaging by showcasing many of our customers products. Early results show that we're assuming new business leads in many food and beverage companies around the world. Several of them do not currently package their products in glass containers. Other costs increased operator profit by about $12 million primarily due to lower equity earnings this quarter from our North American joint venture that underwent a furniture and rebuild. Other costs were also impacted by the absence of several onetime items that benefited the prior year third quarter. And finally currency translation provided a $7 million benefit to segment profit this quarter.
Finishing with the EPS reconciliation, our adjusted net income was $0.84 per share in the quarter compared to $0.83 in the prior year. Operating profit components decreased earnings by $0.05 from the prior year while nonoperating items $0.06 benefit through the earnings in the quarter. This was largely driven by lower year-over-year effective tax rate caused by a change in the annual forecasted earnings mix by country.
Finally, I'll only note one item this quarter the $20 million after-tax charge related to restructure activity. Let's move to Chart 8 for more detail on our balance sheet, cash flow and capital structure. On September 30, 2011, cash was $256 million and gross debt was approximately $4.1 billion. So our net debt was $3.8 billion, an increase of approximately $144 million from the prior year's third quarter, reflecting financing for acquisitions made since the third quarter of last year.
Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 3.0x at the end of the third quarter, well below the same covenant limit of 4 and improved from our second quarter ratio of 3.2x.
Free cash flow was $138 million in the quarter compared with $67 million in the third quarter last year. CapEx is more than $100 million lower in the quarter and this is consistent with our plans to lower capital spending with the full year 2011. At the same time, the change in working capital looks higher this year in the third quarter. driven by increased inventory at reasonable levels to support sales growth. Now, let me shift our capital allocation priorities for the near term. Debt reduction will continue to be our primary focus as we plan to further lower our leverage ratio, we're confident to be within our target range of between 2 and 3x. Also, we will fund our Australian restructuring, as well as a limited capacity expansions in South America.
Finally, let me highlight several years items that we will discuss on our next earnings calls in January. The annual review to update our expenses liability will be conducted in the fourth quarter. In addition, we will conduct our annual evaluation of goodwill in the fourth quarter. The outcome of our Australian restructuring plans and business assessment goodwill impairment in the Asia-Pacific region, which will then require a noncash charge to adjust averages recorded goodwill. As of September 30, 2011, the Asia-Pacific segment had goodwill of approximately $640 million. Finally, we plan to go live with SAP in North America in the first quarter of next year. On Chart 9, we present our business outlook for the fourth quarter, including operating profit by segment, nonoperational costs and overall adjusted earnings. Of course, foreign currency rates have a significant impact on our reported earnings and can create uncertainty. To give additional clarity, we have provided a chart in the appendix to show our earnings and procurement of the major currencies that impact our operations.
We expect our European fourth quarter segment profit will lag the prior year with the macroeconomic volatility in Europe, it's a bit more difficult to gauge our sales volume next quarter but our current expectations that volume will be flat from the prior year while cost inflation will remain elevated. In North America, we expect the operating profit to approximate prior year fourth quarter levels. Operational and supply chain efficiency should continue to improve however, sales volume will likely be flat to up slightly from prior year levels. Meanwhile, cost inflation will lay on margins in the fourth quarter.
Our Asia-Pacific segment operating profit will remain below prior year levels given continued challenging market condition especially in Australia. In South America, profit should improve in the prior year. We have now lapped the one-year anniversary of our acquisition in this region. So year-over-year volume growth will not be as high as the past few quarters.
Overall, our segment margin percentage should be similar to third quarter level. Turning to nonoperational items. We expect corporate costs to be in the $25 million to $30 million range in a fourth quarter. Further details are provided on the chart. Overall, we expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings should approximate prior year fourth quarter levels. I will now turn the call back to Al for closing remarks on Chart 10."

Overall, we made good progress during the third quarter especially with the initial improvements in North America. And to address our market challenges in Australia, we closed capacity to reduce cost. These decisions do not come lightly as we know permanent closures impact many of our long-standing employees income. But unfortunately we have no other choice given the cost structure and changes in the Australian market. And of course, also our responsibility to improve the financial condition of the Asia-Pacific region.
Also, we generated significant free cash flow in the quarter and allocated it towards debt reduction and further debt pay down remains our top priority. Although I am pleased with our initial progress, we have more work to do to prove operating performance, profitability and cash generation. We must ensure that we keep up with inflation, which we expect next year will reach levels similar to this. Several years ago, we initiated our value of a volume strategy to restore margins. We need to continue to inflation, we are in a similar position again and we must take decisive actions to correct our margins decline. As a result, we will increase prices in 2012 as appropriate to repair our margins and improve shareholder value. And if required, we will make some capacity adjustments to align our operations to customer needs as we've done in the past.

With regard to the pricing and the flow-through of the pricing, that really depends on what the increase in inflation is next year. That's why we have to be truly determined at this point in time as we've to next year because it looks like inflation is going to continue at about the same pace that we've seen and if only to recover the inflation that we have experienced in 2011, our margins will still remain flat. So it's really, clearly a requirement and absolute demand for us to make sure that we can pass through not only the inflation that we have incurred this year but also what we expect to see next year. Now fortunately, our utilization is at a better high rate, which gives us the confidence levels of market demand seems to be supportive of that action and offset our strategy but really, we will have to see over the course of our negotiations, which will take place, most of them in this quarter what the outcome is going to be and in January, we'll hopefully be able to give you more perspective on that."

And so, part of our strategy of course does include scenarios of looking at what we could do to either temporarily curtail productions or permanently curtail production and that is part and parcel of the process that we go forward. Now with regards to capacity utilization, I think it was very clear when we talked about our demand profile in the last quarter that we were oversold in the areas in the second quarter and we are now seeing the normal flow of the overall demand peak adding a little bit but that does not really mean that the overall demand is any lower because we have to use these off quarters to prepare again for the high season. As far as the rest of the industry is concerned, I think some of our competitors have reported that their own run rates and their own capacity utilization rates and I believe they're fairly much in line with what we have experienced."

So I would say the high level of demand, so I think the overall balance of supply and demand is still very favorable at this point in time to achieve what we need to achieve. And you also know that clearly, it's much more difficult to get your customers engage in price discussions when inflation is very low or there's no inflation. Maybe that's not the case, inflation has been very high. It's not only been high for us. It's been high for many of our customers and many other basic raw materials in categories that they buy and that I think it's helpful in this overall environment. Now certainly, we will have to also understand that Europe even we always talk about it as one homogenous region, we clearly have some differences in Europe and we've also seen in the past year some different competitive activities. So in some cases, we have to collect margins where we lost 2 years ago when supply was long and recently tried to cover that in other markets, the increase will be more moderate to be more in line with what we see in inflation. So I think it's fair to be a mixed bag and it will require a very high amount of interaction with our customer base to get to the numbers that I mentioned."

With regards to the situation in Latin America, I think that the overall situation there continues to have a strong demand profile, that's the reason why we're building or contemplating on building this additional furnace in Brazil so that we are not going to have that extremely high imported products pushing on the margins that we saw in the first quarter of this year. And I believe that a lot of the work has already been done to make sure that our supply chain is filled so that we can take care of the peak demand now over the next 3 to 4 months in Latin America and typically, we will see LA, I'm sorry, Latin America to drop off in its demand sometime in February, March in small amounts And hopefully then, we would be ready by the second half of the year, with the additional capacity that will was put in place. So I think the overall global to not see the same margin pressure in the first quarter or in the first half of next year that we saw in the first half of this year in Latin America because I think we're better prepared for the supply chain issues that we have to manage because of the higher demand in the market."

32583,138457114,179578,"Owens-Illinois, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2011",2011-10-27,"Earnings Calls","O-I Glass, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John and good morning. Overall, we made good progress during the third quarter, especially following a challenging second quarter as operating performance improved in North America and Asia Pacific. Our third quarter 2011 adjusted earnings were",1918,"Thank you, John and good morning. Overall, we made good progress during the third quarter, especially following a challenging second quarter as operating performance improved in North America and Asia Pacific. Our third quarter 2011 adjusted earnings were $0.84 per share, up considerably from $0.59 in the second quarter and in line with the $0.83 reported in the prior year.
On a year-over-year basis, earnings benefited from higher glass volumes, selling prices and production levels, as well as lower effective tax rate. Yet unrecovered inflation remained a significant headwind and essentially offset these favorable trends.
Shipments in the third quarter were up 4% compared to the same quarter last year. This increase was driven primarily by our 2010 acquisitions. Our global organic growth was around 2% after excluding the impact of unfavorable volume trends in Australia.
Selling prices were up about 1.5 percent this quarter and included the additional energy surcharges that we've successfully implemented in Europe. All regions reported higher production levels. Importantly, North America ran at high operating rates throughout the quarter, and the region further benefited from the restart of 2 previously idle premises.
In Australia, market conditions stabilized at lower levels. To address the challenges in this country, we closed a furnace at the end of the third quarter. Additional restructuring actions will be required in Australia, and one additional furnace closure is planned by mid-2012. As I said before, the benefits of favorable volume, price and production trends a global basis were offset again this quarter by as yet unrecovered cost inflation. Higher selling prices will be required in 2012 to recover inflation from this year, as well as additional inflation expected next year.
We generated $130 million of free cash flow in the third quarter and allocated nearly all of it to pay down debt. Our leverage ratio is now just within our target range, but we will continue to focus on further debt reduction to enhance our financial flexibility.
Reflecting uncertain macroeconomic conditions, we expect that our fourth global shipment levels will be flat to slightly up compared to the prior year. At the same time, high cost inflation will persist and exceed the benefit of higher prices. Currency exchange rates have been volatile in recent months, and this could negatively impact fourth quarter earnings. Also, as part of our normal fourth quarter review, we will adjust production to ensure working capital levels are appropriate heading into 2012.
Overall, fourth quarter earnings should approximate the prior year, and we still expect full year free cash flow to range between $200 million and $250 million, which is unchanged from our most recent guidance.
Now I will review each of our segments, and I'll start with Europe, our largest region on Chart 3. Europe generated operating profit of $106 million in the third quarter compared to $114 million in the third quarter of 2010. The benefits of higher shipments, prices and favorable currency translation were again offset by continued high cost inflation. Shipments were up slightly in Europe during the quarter with higher volumes across several key end-use segments such as beer and spirit. Macroeconomic news out of Europe has been volatile in the past few months due to uncertainty related to sovereign debt and the banking sector, and although our European shipment growth trends moderated compared to earlier this year, we have not seen any major decline in the consumer trends in the end markets that we serve.
Market trends vary by country depending on their exposure to Europe's financial challenges and demand trends also varied throughout the quarter partially due to poor weather.
Selling prices in the third quarter were up about 2% from the prior year, mostly reflecting the impact of the energy surcharges that we implemented. Finally, we have started to negotiate our 2012 annual customer agreements, which cover the majority of our European business. As I mentioned, we expect to fully pass on the impact of unrecovered 2011 cost inflation, as well as 2012 estimated inflation. Our high operating rates and high inflation should enable us to be successful with our pricing strategy.
Overall, we expect to increase our selling prices in Europe, on average, between high single or even double digits across our customer base in 2012. When possible, we intend to include a provision in future annual contracts permitting a timely pass-through of energy cost if actual prices vary significantly from agreed-upon rates. We will provide an update on the outcome of our contract negotiations on our next earnings call.
Moving to Chart 4. Our South American operations performed well and generated operating profit of $67 million in the third quarter, up from $56 million last year. Volumes increased about 24% from the prior year. Organic growth accounted for about 15 percentage points of this improvement and was driven by strong sales in Brazil and Argentina. The balance of our growth was due to our acquisition of CIV in September of last year.
As expected, segment profit in South America increased to nearly 22% in the third quarter. O-I's business in Brazil continues to lead the glass container industry and outperforms other packaging substance. Projected Brazilian growth trends are impressive. Euromonitor estimates 4% annual growth trends through the year 2015. Our customers look to O-I to provide innovative, high-quality glass containers for their products. Glass Smart, our go-to-market approach, continues to boost our growth by approximately 5 to 7 percentage points above the average market estimate.
Now let me discuss our capacity-expansion plans in Brazil. We continue to expect robust growth in this country. In the short term, we plan to increase our capacity by adding a furnace at an existing plant to meet current volumes, but Brazil will remain dependent on sizable imports to continue to cover its existing and future demands. As we bring additional capacity online later in 2012, we will be able to reduce some of the incremental costs we have been incurring to import glass into the country.
Finally, like in Europe, we expect high single-digit price improvement across South America in 2012 to offset inflation.
Moving to North America on Chart 5. We made good progress this quarter improving operating performance in this region. As a result, we generated $73 million of operating profit in the third quarter, slightly up from $72 million in the prior year. Shipments in North America were up 2% from the third quarter of 2010. Better operating performance allowed the region to meet our customers' shipment requirements, and we continue to see fundamentals strength in the wine, spirits and craft beer end markets we serve. While shipments for our mega beer customers declined from the prior year, total beer shipments in the region were flat due to the double-digit growth in craft beer. Year-over-year prices were slightly up due to the 2010 price adjustment formula. However, 2011 inflation for raw materials and other annual pass-through cost factors more than offset any pricing gains.
To begin to remedy this margin impact, we implemented an average price increase of 6% earlier this month on our open market business in North America, which accounts for about 10% to 15% of our business. This price increase is less than in other regions due to the lower energy inflation in North America. Next year, the scheduled price adjustments in our existing multiyear agreements will recapture the 2011 cost inflation. Let me now move to some of the key operational improvements related to North America this quarter.
First, our average operating rate across our manufacturing base was in the mid-90s, which was a clear improvement from the second quarter. Also, our 2 restarted furnaces ran at full capacity since the beginning of the quarter. To ensure that we mitigate the risk of future production issues, we are conducting operational audits at all our plants in North America, and we have identified and are beginning to implement a number of process improvements that will serve to increase our performance even more.
The graph at the bottom of Chart 5 depicts 2 of the trends that we are monitoring as part of our remediation plan. The blue bars show our inventory levels, and you can see inventory rapidly decreasing in the first quarter as unplanned production interruptions coincided with stronger demand levels. We made good progress rebuilding inventory in the third quarter, and we expect to continue this improvement in the fourth quarter as supply and demand trends dictate. The red line on the graph shows average delivery distances for our customer shipment. As inventory levels decreased early in the year, we were required to reallocate production to other manufacturing networks in North America. As a result, we incurred higher freight costs as we shipped finished products much longer distance. We have made some progress reducing out-of-freight pattern -- out-of-patter freight in the third quarter and should continue to see these costs come down further in the fourth quarter.
Although I'm pleased with our initial progress, we have more work in front of us to improve operating performance in North America.
Moving from North America to Asia-Pacific on Chart 6. We generated segment operating profit of $23 million in the third quarter, down from $37 million of the prior year. However, segment profit rebounded from the $9 million reported in the second quarter. Shipments in the region were up slightly from the prior year. As in the second quarter, all growth was attributable to our 2010 acquisitions in China. In Australia, market conditions have stabilized yet remain challenging, resulting in lower year-over-year sales and production levels. Shipments of wine and beer bottles in the country were down nearly 15% from the prior year. To address the challenges in this country, we finalized a significant phase of our Australian restructuring plan in the quarter, and we closed one furnace at the end of September.
One additional furnace closure is planned by mid-2012. We recorded a $20 million charge primarily related to the furnace closures, and these actions will reduce fixed cost and will improve our capabilities and system flexibility. Additional restructuring activities will be determined after we assess supply and demand trends, as well as the outcome of significant contract negotiations by the mid of 2012.
You may have heard about the landslide in New Zealand earlier this week that has interrupted the supply of natural gas to the upper North Island. As a result, our factory in Auckland, as well as many other customers' facilities, have temporarily ceased production until the pipeline is fixed. This may take a week or so, and we expect that this may have a modest impact on fourth quarter earnings.
Moving to China. We continue to reorient our existing footprint within the dynamic business environment in the country. We do not foresee any new acquisitions in the short term. Our priorities are to optimize our existing assets and business performance, which includes integrating our 2010 acquisitions. During this quarter, we made solid progress on raising our prices in China. As we have mentioned in the past, several of our legacy facilities in China are fast becoming encroached by urban growth. This puts the pressure on us to relocate some of our facilities but also provides the opportunity to move closer to our customers and improve our footprint. As a result of the urban encroachment, the land values of these properties have increased so significantly that they will allow us to fund the rebuild of these capacities at alternative sites. I will now turn the call over to Ed."

Let's move to Chart 7 and begin our financial review with the third quarter reconciliation for sales, operating profit and EPS. Third quarter 2011 segment sales increased approximately 10% to more than $1.8 billion. As Al mentioned, our volume",1071,"Thanks, Al. Let's move to Chart 7 and begin our financial review with the third quarter reconciliation for sales, operating profit and EPS. Third quarter 2011 segment sales increased approximately 10% to more than $1.8 billion. As Al mentioned, our volumes increased 4%. This boosted the top line by $64 million. Higher prices also increased the top line by $25 million in the quarter. Shifts in product mix offset approximately  $8 million of the higher selling prices. You can also see that currency translation substantially increased the top line.
Moving over to segment operating profit. The third quarter profit was $269 million, $10 million below the $279 million reported last year. Higher volumes added $16 million, largely driven by strong growth in South America. Higher pricing benefited segment operating profit by $25 million while the change in product mix that impacted the top line had a negligible profit impact. Manufacturing and delivery costs increased by $37 million. These higher costs were largely driven by $55 million of cost inflation. But favorable year-over-year production levels in all regions, except for Asia Pacific, partially offset inflation this quarter This benefited a component of the positive operating leverage that we continue to see generated this year as we operate facilities at higher capacity utilization rates. Operating expenses increased by $9 million from the prior year, partially reflecting investments made to support sales and marketing initiatives. Our Glass is Life marketing campaign has been running for several months now. Our campaign features the premium image of O-I glass packaging by showcasing many of our customers' products. Early results show that we're receiving new business leads in many food and beverage companies around the world, several of whom do not currently package their products in glass containers. Other costs decreased operating profit by about $12 million, primarily due to lower equity earnings this quarter from our North American joint venture that underwent a furnace rebuild. Other costs were also impacted by the absence of several onetime items that benefited the prior year third quarter. And finally, currency translation provided a $7 million benefit to segment profit this quarter.
Finishing with the EPS reconciliation, our adjusted net income was $0.84 per share in the quarter compared to $0.83 in the prior year. Operating profit components decreased earnings by $0.05 from the prior year while nonoperating items netted to a $0.06 benefit to the earnings in the quarter. This was largely driven by lower year-over-year effective tax rate caused by a change in the annual forecasted earnings mix by country.
Finally, our only Note 1 item this quarter was a $20 million after-tax charge related to restructuring activity. Let's move to Chart 8 for more detail on our balance sheet, cash flow and capital structure. On September 30, 2011, cash was $256 million and gross debt was approximately $4.1 billion. So net debt was $3.8 billion, an increase of approximately $144 million from the prior year third quarter, reflecting financing for acquisitions made since the third quarter of last year.
Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 3.0x at the end of the third quarter, well below the bank covenant limit of 4 and improved from our second quarter ratio of 3.2x
Free cash flow was $138 million in the quarter compared with $67 million in the third quarter of last year. CapEx was more than $100 million lower in the quarter, and this is consistent with our planned lower CapEx spending for the full year 2011. At the same time, the change in working capital was higher this year in the third quarter, driven by increased inventory and receivable levels to support sales growth. Now, let me shift to our capital allocation priorities for the near term. Debt reduction will continue to be our primary focus as we plan to further lower our leverage ratio to be comfortably within our target range of between 2 and 3x EBITDA. Also, we will fund our Australian restructuring, as well as some limited capacity expansions in South America.
Finally, let me highlight several year-end items that we will discuss on our next earnings call in January. The annual review to update our asbestos liability will be conducted in the fourth quarter. In addition, we will conduct our annual evaluation of goodwill in the fourth quarter. The outcome of our Australian restructuring plans and business assessment may lead to a goodwill impairment in the Asia-Pacific region, which will then require a noncash charge to adjust that region's recorded goodwill. As of September 30, 2011, the Asia-Pacific segment had goodwill of approximately $640 million. Finally, we plan to go live with SAP in North America in the first quarter of next year. On Chart 9, we present our business outlook for the fourth quarter, including operating profit by segment, nonoperational costs and overall adjusted earnings. Of course, foreign currency rates have a significant impact on our reported earnings and can create uncertainty. To give additional clarity, we have provided a chart in the appendix to show our earning sensitivity to the major currencies that impact our operations.
We expect our European fourth quarter segment profit will lag the prior year. With the macroeconomic volatility in Europe, it's a bit more difficult to gauge our sales volume next quarter, but our current expectation is that volume will be flat with the prior year while cost inflation will remain elevated. In North America, we expect operating profit to approximate prior year fourth quarter levels. Operational and supply chain efficiency should continue to improve, however, sales volume will likely be flat to up slightly from prior year levels. Meanwhile, cost inflation will lay on margins in the fourth quarter.
Our Asia-Pacific segment operating profit will remain below prior year levels given continued challenging market condition, especially in Australia. In South America, profit should improve from the prior year. We have now lapped the one-year anniversary of our acquisition in this region, so year-over-year volume growth will not be as high as the past few quarters.
Overall, our segment margin percentage should be similar to third quarter level. Turning to nonoperational items. We expect corporate costs to be in the $25 million to $30 million range in the fourth quarter. Further details are provided on the chart. Overall, we expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings should approximate prior year fourth quarter levels. I will now turn the call back to Al for closing remarks on Chart 10."

Overall, we made good progress during the third quarter, especially with the initial improvements in North America. And to address our market challenges in Australia, we closed capacity to reduce costs. These decisions do not come lightly since we know permanent closures impact many of our long-standing employees and their families, but we, unfortunately, have no other choice given the cost structure and changes in the Australian markets that we serve and of course, also, our responsibility to improve the financial condition of the Asia Pacific region.
Also, we generated significant free cash flow in the quarter and allocated it towards debt reduction and further debt pay down remains top priority. Although I am pleased with our initial progress, we have more work to do to prove operating performance, profitability and cash generation. We must ensure that we keep up with inflation, which we expect next year will reach levels similar to this year. Several years ago, we initiated our value of a volume strategy to restore margins. Due to continued inflation, we are in a similar position again, and we must take decisive action to correct our margin decline. As a result, we will increase prices in 2012 as appropriate to repair our margins and improve shareholder value. And if required, we will make some capacity adjustments to align our operations to customer needs as we have done in the past.
Thank you, and now I will ask Angela to open up the lines for your questions."

With regard to the pricing and the flow-through of the pricing, that really depends on what the increase in inflation is going to be next year. And that's why we have to be fairly determined at this point in time as we go into next year because it looks like inflation is going to continue at about the same pace that we have seen, and if we were only to recover the inflation that we have experienced in 2011, our margins would really remain flat. So that's really, clearly a requirement and an absolute demand for us to make sure that we can pass through not only the inflation that we have incurred this year but also what we expect to see next year. Now fortunately, our utilization is at a very high rate, which gives us the confidence level that market demand seems to be supportive of that action and offset strategy, but really, we will have to see over the course of our negotiations, which will take place, most of them in this quarter, what the outcome is going to be. And in January, we'll hopefully be able to give you more perspective on that."

Now with regard to capacity utilization, I think that was very clear when we talked about our demand profile in the last quarter that we were oversold in the high-peak areas of the second quarter, and we are now seeing the normal flow of the overall demand peak ebbing a little bit, but that does not really mean that the overall demand is any lower because we have to use these off quarters to prepare again for the high season. As far as the rest of the industry is concerned, I think some of our competitors have reported that their own run rates and their own capacity utilization rates, and I believe they're fairly much in line with what we have experienced."

And then, of course, energy is the big open question but we still see significant increases in electricity, in particular, coming from Europe at this point in time. How natural gas and oil is going to behave, that's more reactive to certain market and political conditions. So we'll have to see how that's going to work out. But clearly, we've seen a dramatic increase in the course of 2011. And then, the other part that is going to play an important role in Australia, is that we're going to see a carbon tax increase or a carbon tax becoming effective Australia in the middle of next year.

Because, otherwise, if we had seen continued growth, it would have been really difficult for us to achieve our customers' supply. So I would say, the high level demand -- so, I think, that the overall balance of supply and demand is still very favorable at this point in time, to achieve what we need to achieve. And you also know that, clearly, it's much more difficult to get your customers engaged in price discussions when inflation is very low or there's no inflation. Really, that' not the case, inflation has been very high. It's not only been high for us, it's been high for many of our customers and many other basic raw materials in categories that they buy. And that, I think is, too, helpful in this overall environment. Now, certainly, we will have to also understand that Europe is, even though we always talk about it as one homogenous region, we clearly have some differences in Europe. And we've also seen, in the past 2 years, some different competitive activities. So in some cases, we have to collect margins where we lost some feathers, 2 years ago, when supply was long, and we'll certainly going to try to cover that. In other markets, the increase will be more moderate, to be more in line with what we see in inflation. So I think it's going to be a mixed bag, and it will require a very high amount of interaction with our customer base to get to the numbers that I have mentioned."

The market being underpowered, as far as installed capacity is concerned, so the market became dependent on imports. And that, of course, that put a fairly high demand initially because customers try to cover their bets, and then when, suddenly demand was perhaps weakening a bit, they immediately then went to taking the supply chain down, with regard to what's in the pipeline, and then you get these wide swings in demand. We certainly, in the glass industry, didn't see that. We saw continued strength in the Brazilian market, as was reflected in our sales numbers.

I think those corrections have taken place, so I would say the margin out between a balanced supply demand and shortage, or long, has become a much shorter range of overall demand fluctuation. Now, with regard to the viewpoint that we have with what's the impact going to be, if I look back at 2007 and 2008, we saw some pretty good profitability improvements in Europe, despite the fact that we had volume leakage. And so, in this environment and especially with our focus on cash flow and cash generation, I think it's a trade-off that we have to make.

Fortunately, we have corrected a part of this, already, in the third quarter and saw an improvement. I would say our first objective and target in Australia, New Zealand or in Asia-Pacific, to get back to double-digit margins. And then we'll see, over the course of next year as we go through our contract negotiations, what additional steps we can take and what additional improvements over margins we can achieve. With regards to the situation in Latin America. I think that the overall situation there continues to have a strong demand profile, that's the reason why we're building or contemplating on building the traditional furnace in Brazil. So that we are not going to have that extremely high peak of imported products pushing down the margins that we saw in the first quarter of this year. And I believe that a lot of the work has already been done to make sure that our supply chain is filled, so that we can take care of the peak demand, now over the next 3 to 4 months in Latin America. And then, typically, we would see LA -- I'm sorry, Latin America, to drop off in its demand sometime in February, March with the total peak of slower months. And, hopefully, then we would be ready by the second half of the year, with the additional capacity that was put in place. So I think, overall, results probably will not see the same margin pressure in the first quarter or in the first half of next year, that we saw in the first half of this year in Latin America. Because I think we're better prepared for the supply chain issues that we have to manage because of the higher demand in the market place."

So even if it were going to go back to $0.90 or so, I don't think it's going to fundamentally change the way that the wineries are looking at the situation on top of that. Some of the larger wineries also have made significant investments in the receiving countries to be able to do the filling in those countries. So they're not just going to walk away from that investment. So I would say, most probably broke through a significant decision barrier over the last year or so, where people are on the fence, but I think has jumped off the fence and I don't believe they're going to go back again. So I would say what we're dealing, in Australia in particular, but I think it's actually also in New Zealand, is a more fundamental issue of people having the decision they want and then basically living with that decision for a long time and not jumping back and forth.

Overall, we made good progress during the third quarter, especially following a challenging second quarter as operating performance improved in North America and Asia Pacific. Our third quarter 2011 adjusted earnings were",1920,"Thank you, John and good morning. Overall, we made good progress during the third quarter, especially following a challenging second quarter as operating performance improved in North America and Asia Pacific. Our third quarter 2011 adjusted earnings were $0.84 per share, up considerably from $0.59 in the second quarter and in line with the $0.83 reported in the prior year.
On a year-over-year basis, earnings benefited from higher glass volumes, selling prices and production levels, as well as lower effective tax rate. Yet unrecovered inflation remained a significant headwind and essentially offsets these favorable trends.
Shipments in the third quarter were up 4% compared to the same quarter last year. This increase was driven primarily by our 2010 acquisitions. Our global organic growth was around 2% after excluding the impact of unfavorable volume trends in Australia.
Selling prices were up about 1.5 percent this quarter and included the additional energy surcharges that we've successfully implemented in Europe. All regions reported higher production levels. Importantly, North America ran at high operating rates throughout the quarter, and the region further benefited from the restart of 2 previously idle premises.
In Australia, market conditions stabilized at lower levels. To address the challenges in this country, we closed a furnace at the end of the third quarter. Additional restructuring actions will be required in Australia, and one additional furnace closure is planned by mid-2012. As I said before, the benefits of favorable volume, price and production trends a global basis were offset again this quarter by as yet unrecovered cost inflation. Higher selling prices will be required in 2012 to recover inflation from this year, as well as additional inflation expected next year.
We generated $130 million of free cash flow in the third quarter and allocated nearly all of it to pay down debt. Our leverage ratio is now just within our target range, but we will continue to focus on further debt reduction to enhance our financial flexibility.
Reflecting uncertain macroeconomic conditions, we expect that our fourth global shipment levels will be flat to slightly up compared to the prior year. At the same time, high cost inflation will persist and exceed the benefit of higher prices. Currency exchange rates have been volatile in recent months, and this could negatively impact fourth quarter earnings. Also, as part of our normal fourth quarter review, we will adjust production to ensure working capital levels are appropriate heading into 2012.
Overall, fourth quarter earnings should approximate the prior year, and we still expect full year free cash flow to range between $200 million and $250 million, which is unchanged from our most recent guidance.
Now I will review each of our segments, and I'll start with Europe, our largest region on Chart 3. Europe generated operating profit of $106 million in the third quarter compared to $114 million in the third quarter of 2010. The benefits of higher shipments, prices and favorable currency translation were again offset by continued high cost inflation. Shipments were up slightly in Europe during the quarter with higher volumes across several key end-use segments such as beer and spirit. Macroeconomic news out of Europe has been volatile in the past few months due to uncertainty related to sovereign debt and the banking sector, and although our European shipment growth trends moderated compared to earlier this year, we have not seen any major decline in the consumer trends in the end markets that we serve.
Market trends vary by country depending on their exposure to Europe's financial challenges and demand trends also varied throughout the quarter partially due to poor weather.
Selling prices in the third quarter were up about 2% from the prior year, mostly reflecting the impact of the energy surcharges that we implemented. Finally, we have started to negotiate our 2012 annual customer agreements, which cover a majority of our European business. As I mentioned, we expect to fully pass on the impact of unrecovered 2011 cost inflation, as well as 2012 estimated inflation. Our high operating rates and high inflation should enable us to be successful with our pricing strategy.
Overall, we expect to increase our selling prices in Europe, on average, between high single or even double digits across our customer base in 2012. When possible, we intend to include a provision in future annual contracts permitting a timely pass-through of energy cost if actual prices vary significantly from agreed-upon rates. We will provide an update on the outcome of our contract negotiations on our next earnings call.
Moving to Chart 4. Our South American operations performed well and generated operating profit of $67 million in the third quarter, up from $56 million last year. Volumes increased about 24% from the prior year. Organic growth accounted for about 15 percentage points of this improvement and was driven by strong sales in Brazil and Argentina. The balance of our growth was due to our acquisition of CIV in September of last year.
As expected, segment profit in South America increased to nearly 22% in the third quarter. O-I's business in Brazil continues to lead the glass container industry and outperforms other packaging substance. Projected Brazilian growth trends are impressive. Euromonitor estimates 4% annual growth trends through the year 2015. Our customers look to O-I to provide innovative, high-quality glass containers for their products. Glass Smart, our go-to-market approach, continues to boost our growth by approximately 5 to 7 percentage points above the average market estimate.
Now let me discuss our capacity-expansion plans in Brazil. We continue to expect robust growth in this country. In the short term, we plan to increase our capacity by adding a furnace at an existing plant to meet current volumes, but Brazil will remain dependent on sizable imports to continue to cover its existing and future demands. As we bring additional capacity online later in 2012, we will be able to reduce some of the incremental costs we have been incurring to import glass into the country.
Finally, like in Europe, we expect high single-digit price improvement across South America in 2012 to offset inflation.
Moving to North America on Chart 5. We made good progress this quarter improving operating performance in this region. As a result, we generated $73 million of operating profit in the third quarter, slightly up from $72 million in the prior year. Shipments in North America were up 2% from the third quarter of 2010. Better operating performance allowed the region to meet our customers' shipment requirements, and we continue to see fundamentals strength in the wine, spirits and craft beer end markets that we serve. While shipments for our mega beer customers declined from the prior year, total beer shipments in the region were flat due to the double-digit growth in craft beer. Year-over-year prices were slightly up due to the 2010 price adjustment formula. However, 2011 inflation for raw materials and other annual pass-through cost factors more than offset any pricing gains.
To begin to remedy this margin impact, we implemented an average price increase of 6% earlier this month in our open market business in North America, which accounts for about 10% to 15% of our business. This price increase is less than in other regions due to the lower energy inflation in North America. Next year, the scheduled price adjustments in our existing multiyear agreements will recapture the 2011 cost inflation. Let me now move to some of the key operational improvements we made in North America this quarter.
First, our average operating rate across our manufacturing base was in the mid-90s, which was a clear improvement from the second quarter. Also, our 2 restarted furnaces ran at full capacity since the beginning of the quarter. To ensure that we mitigate the risk of future production issues, we are conducting operational audits of all our plants in North America, and we have identified and are beginning to implement a number of process improvements that will serve to increase our performance even more.
The graph at the bottom of Chart 5 depicts 2 of the trends that we are monitoring as part of our remediation plan. The blue bars show our inventory levels, and you can see inventory rapidly decreasing in the first quarter as unplanned production interruptions coincided with stronger demand levels. We made good progress rebuilding inventory in the third quarter, and we expect to continue this improvement in the fourth quarter as supply and demand trends dictate. The red line on the graph shows average delivery distances for our customer shipment. As inventory levels decreased early in the year, we were required to reallocate production to other manufacturing networks in North America. As a result, we incurred higher freight costs as we shipped finished products much longer distances. We have made some progress reducing out-of-freight pattern -- out-of-pattern freight in the third quarter and should continue to see these costs come down further in the fourth quarter.
Although I'm pleased with our initial progress, we have more work in front of us to improve operating performance in North America.
Moving from North America to Asia-Pacific on Chart 6. We generated segment operating profit of $23 million in the third quarter, down from $37 million of the prior year. However, segment profit rebounded from the $9 million reported in the second quarter. Shipments in the region were up slightly from the prior year. As in the second quarter, all growth was attributable to our 2010 acquisitions in China. In Australia, market conditions have stabilized yet remain challenging, resulting in lower year-over-year sales and production levels. Shipments of wine and beer bottles in the country were down nearly 15% from the prior year. To address the challenges in this country, we finalized a significant phase of our Australian restructuring plan in the quarter, and we closed one furnace at the end of September.
One additional furnace closure is planned by mid-2012. We recorded a $20 million charge primarily related to the furnace closures, and these actions will reduce fixed cost and will improve our capabilities and system flexibility. Additional restructuring activities will be determined after we assess supply and demand trends, as well as the outcome of significant contract negotiations by the mid of 2012.
You may have heard about the landslide in New Zealand earlier this week that has interrupted the supply of natural gas to the upper North Island. As a result, our factory in Auckland, as well as many other customers' facilities, have temporarily ceased production until the pipeline is fixed. This may take a week or so, and we expect that this may have a modest impact on fourth quarter earnings.
Moving to China. We continue to reorient our existing footprint within the dynamic business environment in the country. We do not foresee any new acquisitions in the short term. Our priorities are to optimize our existing assets and business performance, which includes integrating our 2010 acquisitions. During this quarter, we made solid progress on raising our prices in China. As we have mentioned in the past, several of our legacy facilities in China are fast becoming encroached by urban growth. This has put pressure on us to relocate some of our facilities but also provides the opportunity to move closer to our customers and improve our footprint. As a result of the urban encroachment, the land values of these properties have increased so significantly that they will allow us to fund the rebuild of these capacities at alternative sites. I will now turn the call over to Ed."

Let's move to Chart 7 and begin our financial review with the third quarter reconciliation for sales, operating profit and EPS. Third quarter 2011 segment sales increased approximately 10% to more than $1.8 billion. As Al mentioned, our volumes increased 4%. This boosted the top line by $64 million. Higher prices also increased the top line by $25 million in the quarter. Shifts in product mix offset approximately  $8 million of the higher selling prices. You can also see that currency translation substantially increased the top line.
Moving over to segment operating profit. The third quarter profit was $269 million, $10 million below the $279 million reported last year. Higher volumes added $16 million, largely driven by strong growth in South America. Higher pricing benefited segment operating profit by $25 million while the change in product mix that impacted the top line had a negligible profit impact. Manufacturing and delivery costs increased by $37 million. These higher costs were largely driven by $55 million of cost inflation. But favorable year-over-year production levels in all regions, except for Asia Pacific, partially offset inflation this quarter. This benefited a component of the positive operating leverage that we continue to see generated this year as we operate facilities at higher capacity utilization rates. Operating expenses increased by $9 million from the prior year, partially reflecting investments made to support sales and marketing initiatives. Our Glass is Life marketing campaign has been running for several months now. Our campaign features the premium image of O-I glass packaging by showcasing many of our customers' products. Early results show that we're receiving new business leads in many food and beverage companies around the world, several of whom do not currently package their products in glass containers. Other costs decreased operating profit by about $12 million, primarily due to lower equity earnings this quarter from our North American joint venture that underwent a furnace rebuild. Other costs were also impacted by the absence of several onetime items that benefited the prior year third quarter. And finally, currency translation provided a $7 million benefit to segment profit this quarter.
Finishing with the EPS reconciliation, our adjusted net income was $0.84 per share in the quarter compared to $0.83 in the prior year. Operating profit components decreased earnings by $0.05 from the prior year while nonoperating items netted to a $0.06 benefit to the earnings in the quarter. This was largely driven by lower year-over-year effective tax rate caused by a change in the annual forecasted earnings mix by country.
Finally, our only Note 1 item this quarter was a $20 million after-tax charge related to restructuring activity. Let's move to Chart 8 for more detail on our balance sheet, cash flow and capital structure. On September 30, 2011, cash was $256 million and gross debt was approximately $4.1 billion. So net debt was $3.8 billion, an increase of approximately $144 million from the prior year third quarter, reflecting financing for acquisitions made since the third quarter of last year.
Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 3.0x at the end of the third quarter, well below the bank covenant limit of 4 and improved from our second quarter ratio of 3.2x
Free cash flow was $138 million in the quarter compared with $67 million in the third quarter of last year. CapEx was more than $100 million lower in the quarter, and this is consistent with our planned lower CapEx spending for the full year 2011. At the same time, the change in working capital was higher this year in the third quarter, driven by increased inventory and receivable levels to support sales growth. Now, let me shift to our capital allocation priorities for the near term. Debt reduction will continue to be our primary focus as we plan to further lower our leverage ratio to be comfortably within our target range of between 2 and 3x EBITDA. Also, we will fund our Australian restructuring, as well as some limited capacity expansion in South America.
Finally, let me highlight several year-end items that we will discuss on our next earnings call in January. The annual review to update our asbestos liability will be conducted in the fourth quarter. In addition, we will conduct our annual evaluation of goodwill in the fourth quarter. The outcome of our Australian restructuring plans and business assessment may lead to a goodwill impairment in the Asia-Pacific region, which will then require a noncash charge to adjust that region's recorded goodwill. As of September 30, 2011, the Asia-Pacific segment had goodwill of approximately $640 million. Finally, we plan to go live with SAP in North America in the first quarter of next year. On Chart 9, we present our business outlook for the fourth quarter, including operating profit by segment, nonoperational costs and overall adjusted earnings. Of course, foreign currency rates have a significant impact on our reported earnings and can create uncertainty. To give additional clarity, we have provided a chart in the appendix to show our earning sensitivity to the major currencies that impact our operations.
We expect our European fourth quarter segment profit will lag the prior year. With the macroeconomic volatility in Europe, it's a bit more difficult to gauge our sales volumes next quarter, but our current expectation is that volume will be flat with the prior year while cost inflation will remain elevated. In North America, we expect operating profit to approximate prior year fourth quarter levels. Operational and supply chain efficiency should continue to improve, however, sales volume will likely be flat to up slightly from prior year levels. Meanwhile, cost inflation will lay on margins in the fourth quarter.
Our Asia-Pacific segment operating profit will remain below prior year levels given continued challenging market condition, especially in Australia. In South America, profit should improve from the prior year. We have now lapped the one-year anniversary of our acquisition in this region, so year-over-year volume growth will not be as high as the past few quarters.
Overall, our segment margin percentage should be similar to third quarter level. Turning to nonoperational items. We expect corporate costs to be in the $25 million to $30 million range in the fourth quarter. Further details are provided on the chart. Overall, we expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings should approximate prior year fourth quarter levels. I will now turn the call back to Al for closing remarks on Chart 10."

Overall, we made good progress during the third quarter, especially with the initial improvements in North America. And to address our market challenges in Australia, we closed capacity to reduce costs. These decisions do not come lightly since we know permanent closures impact many of our long-standing employees and their families, but we, unfortunately, have no other choice given the cost structure and changes in the Australian markets that we serve and of course, also, our responsibility to improve the financial condition of the Asia Pacific region.
Also, we generated significant free cash flow in the quarter and allocated it towards debt reduction and further debt pay down remains top priority. And although I am pleased with our initial progress, we have more work to do to prove operating performance, profitability and cash generation. We must ensure that we keep up with inflation, which we expect next year will reach levels similar to this year. Several years ago, we initiated our value of a volume strategy to restore margins. Due to continued inflation, we are in a similar position again, and we must take decisive action to correct our margin decline. As a result, we will increase prices in 2012 as appropriate to repair our margins and improve shareholder value. And if required, we will make some capacity adjustments to align our operations to customer needs as we have done in the past.
Thank you, and now I will ask Angela to open up the lines for your questions."

With regard to the pricing and the flow-through of the pricing, that really depends on what the increase in inflation is going to be next year. And that's why we have to be fairly determined at this point in time as we go into next year because it looks like inflation is going to continue at about the same pace that we have seen, and if we were only to recover the inflation that we have experienced in 2011, our margins would really remain flat. So that's really, clearly a requirement and an absolute demand for us to make sure that we can pass through not only the inflation that we have incurred this year but also what we expect to see next year. Now fortunately, our utilization is at a very high rate, which gives us the confidence level that market demand seems to be supportive of that action and offset strategy, but really, we will have to see over the course of our negotiations, which will take place, most of them in this quarter, what the outcome is going to be.

Now with regard to capacity utilization, I think that was very clear when we talked about our demand profile in the last quarter that we were oversold in the high-peak areas of the second quarter, and we are now seeing the normal flow of the overall demand peak ebbing a little bit, but that does not really mean that the overall demand is any lower because we have to use these off quarters to prepare again for the high season. As far as the rest of the industry is concerned, I think some of our competitors have reported that their own run rates and their own capacity utilization rates, and I believe they're fairly much in line with what we have experienced."

So I would say, the high level demand -- so, I think, that the overall balance of supply and demand is still very favorable at this point in time, to achieve what we need to achieve. And you also know that, clearly, it's much more difficult to get your customers engaged in price discussions when inflation is very low or there's no inflation. Really, that's not the case, inflation has been very high. It's not only been high for us, it's been high for many of our customers and many other basic raw materials in categories that they buy. And that, I think is, too, helpful in this overall environment. Now, certainly, we will have to also understand that Europe is, even though we always talk about it as one homogenous region, we clearly have some differences in Europe. And we've also seen, in the past 2 years, some different competitive activities. So in some cases, we have to correct margins where we lost some feathers, 2 years ago, when supply was long, and we'll certainly going to try to recover that. In other markets, the increase will be more moderate, to be more in line with what we see in inflation. So I think it's going to be a mixed bag, and it will require a very high amount of interaction with our customer base to get to the numbers that I have mentioned."

I believe, that it was, clearly, for many years, if not for decades, a significant amount of capacity that was not fully utilized around. A lot of that has been taken out over the last couple of years. And I believe the band [ph] between supply and demand to be long and/or supply being short, insured has become much narrower over the last couple of years. And so even if we are going into a situation where it's difficult to get the targeted increases that we have for our customers, we still have the leverage and the ability then, to adjust our cost structure, by taking temporary shutdowns or taking capacity out but I don't think it's going to have to be of any category or size we saw in 2007 and 2008."

So one of our focus areas, again, is going to be going to try this again just like what I said 2 years, is in contracts with our larger customers because that's really where a lot of this impact comes from. To see whether we can either get to a greater predictability with regard to forecast accuracy on an SKU level, or potentially, come to some kind of understanding that, if additional costs are being created by those changes in demand, that some way then, there has be a pass-through provision of that additional cost that's being generated by that imposition in their forecasting.

And I believe one of our competitors in the aluminum business, this morning they reported that, certainly, in the third quarter volumes picked up again. So I think this was more of an issue of either currency rates in Brazil fluctuating significantly. The market being underpowered, as far as installed capacity is concerned, so the market became dependent on imports. And that, of course, that put a fairly high demand initially because customers try to cover their bets, and then when, suddenly demand was perhaps weakening a bit, they immediately then went to taking the supply chain down, with regard to what's in the pipeline, and then you get these wide swings in demand. We certainly, in the glass industry, didn't see that. We saw continued strength in the Brazilian market, as was reflected in our sales numbers. Even though, I must say, that perhaps 1 or 2 percentage points of more billion growth rates were taking off or were shaved off but it's still attractive growth rate overall."

Now, with regard to the viewpoint that we have with what's the impact going to be, if I look back at 2007 and 2008, we saw some pretty good profitability improvements in Europe, despite the fact that we had volume leakage.

Fortunately, we have corrected part of this, already, in the third quarter and saw an improvement. I would say our first objective and target in Australia, New Zealand or in Asia-Pacific, to get back to double-digit margins. And then we'll see, and the course of next year as we go through our contract negotiations, what additional steps we can take and what additional improvements over margins we can achieve. With regards to the situation in Latin America. I think that the overall situation there continues to have a strong demand profile, that's the reason why we're building or contemplating on building the traditional furnace in Brazil. So that we are not going to have that extremely high peak of imported products pushing down the margins that we saw in the first quarter of this year. And I believe that a lot of the work has already been done to make sure that our supply chain is filled, so that we can take care of the peak demand, now over the next 3 to 4 months in Latin America. And then, typically, we would see LA -- I'm sorry, Latin America, to drop off in its demand sometime in February, March with the total peak of slower months. And, hopefully, then we would be ready by the second half of the year, with the additional capacity that was put in place. So I think, overall, results probably will not see the same margin pressure in the first quarter or in the first half of next year, that we saw in the first half of this year in Latin America. Because I think we're better prepared for the supply chain issues that we have to manage because of the higher demand in the market place."

You can see the impact of this strategic shift in our financial results. 
Segment operating profit increased more than 8% from the prior year. This increase reflected both our margin repair efforts as we completed our 2010 North American restructuring program as well as emerging market growth, particularly in South America.  Higher operating profit was offset by additional non-operating costs, including pension and interest expense. As a result, O-I reported full-year 2010 adjusted net income of $2.60 per share compared to $2.61 in 2009.
Volumes improved in most of the markets that we served in 2010, especially South America. Shipments also increased across nearly all end-use categories including wine, spirits and food. Here in the mature markets was the notable exception as consumption was down primarily due to continued high unemployment. In total, shipments from continuing operations were down about 1%. Our shipment trends reflect additional volume from acquisitions and volume loss tied to customer contract renegotiations that supported our margin restoration efforts. Excluding these factors, our underlying shipments were up 2% from 2009, which was in line with gradually improving consumption trend. Globally, lower manufacturing and delivery costs reflected the improved operating rate and footprint savings from restructuring activities, which more than offset cost inflation.
The expropriation of our two plants in Venezuela was an unexpected and unfortunate development. However, we are optimistic about the future contributions of our 10 newly acquired plants and the three new furnaces we built this year to serve fast-growing markets in South America and Asia.
Most of the developments I discussed regarding full year 2010 also apply to the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter 2010 adjusted earnings were $0.45 per share compared to $0.43 in 2009. Segment operating profit increased more than 25% over fourth quarter 2009. This improvement was mostly due to higher capacity utilization as the inventory correction we conducted in late 2009 did not repeat, given our positive growth outlook for this year.
Overall, our average fourth quarter selling price was consistent with prior year. Globally, our total shipments were flat with the fourth quarter 2009, while underlying shipments were up 2%, similar to our full year trends.
In the fourth quarter, we completed the acquisition of three plants in China, including one in Guangdong and two near Beijing. We also opened a newly constructed furnace in Auckland, New Zealand.
Looking to 2011, we expect higher shipment and production level. This reflects strong growth and expansion in emerging market. Sales will benefit from organic growth as markets continue to recover. We are also investing in our own sales and marketing innovation capabilities. Part of the strong growth we experienced in our South American region this past year was attributable to a new robust sales and marketing program. We are now implementing this leading practice across all regions in 2011. Further, higher selling prices will partially offset additional cost inflation. 
Free cash flow should improve significantly in 2011. We expect lower restructuring charges and capital expenditures now that we have completed our recent footprint initiatives and invested in new capacity during 2010 for future growth. Overall, 2011 free cash flow should approximate $300 million. Expansion in the high-growth markets will remain our top use of free cash flow.
Now let's review our operating performance on Chart 3. Here, we show segment operating profit and margins for the company, as well as for each of our four regions. Full year profits are on the left and fourth quarter results are on the right. Our full year 2010 segment operating profit was $964 million, up $73 million from last year. Margins improved to 14.6% from around 13.5% in 2009. Favorable foreign currency translation represented $60 million of the year-over-year profit improvement. Most currencies strengthened against the dollar, which helped offset the impact of a weaker euro. Segment operating profit was comparable with the prior year for most regions, with the exception of South America, which posted a significant improvement from 2009.
In Europe, segment profit was $324 million, a decline of $9 million from the prior year, but profits actually increased approximately $10 million in the currency neutral basis. While we did experience some pricing pressure, volumes were up low single digits and operating rates improved. Our North American operating profit of $275 million was just below prior-year results, which is a significant achievement given all the restructuring activity during 2010.
The benefits from higher selling prices and footprint savings offset a 12% volume decline following customer contract renegotiations. Adjusted for these contracts, North American shipments were down slightly from 2009, reflecting a sluggish U.S. beer market.
Our South American segment profit was $224 million, up 55% from 2009, reflecting very strong growth in our business. Shipments improved more than 30% from last year. Most of this increase reflected the rebound in consumption and new product introductions. The balance of the improvement was attributable to new business from acquisitions, additional furnaces and footprint optimization efforts.
Asia-Pacific's operating profit of $141 million increased $10 million on the prior year, added by favorable currency translation. Volume trends in the region varied by country. Shipments were down in Australia and New Zealand, as strong currencies in those countries impacted wine exports. And beer consumption was also down in Australia.
In China, on the other hand, our shipments were boosted by increased consumer demand. To support this growth, we expanded our base in China through several acquisitions, and we also entered into a joint venture in Southeast Asia.
Turning to the fourth quarter. Total operating profit was $221 million, up from $174 million last year, reflecting a strong performance in both North and South America. The impact of currency translation was negligible. Our European operating profit was $50 million, up $10 million from the fourth quarter of 2009.
Average selling prices declined modestly. However, shipment levels improved by low single digits from the prior year, and higher productivity led to lower manufacturing costs. Market conditions continue to vary, but we did see some improvement over the course of the quarter. While beer remained weak, the end-use categories like wine and food showed solid growth.
In North America, operating profit was $53 million, an improvement from $33 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Shipments were down about 10% from the prior year, reflecting the customer contract negotiations that I mentioned earlier. Excluding the impact of those contracts, North American shipments were flat with the prior year. Earnings benefited from improved selling prices, as well as higher productivity now that our current restructuring program is complete.
Our South American operating profit was $82 million, a 70% improvement from the prior year, representing the best performance across our regions. Total shipments were up nearly 50%. Organic growth represented more than half of the increase as a broad-based economic recovery benefited all end-use segments. Our recent acquisitions and new furnaces, which are performing very well, made up the balance of our higher shipments this quarter.
Our Asia-Pacific operating profit was $36 million, a decline of $17 million, as total shipments were down more than 10% from the prior year. This decline reflected challenging market conditions in Australia and New Zealand. Strong currencies in those countries impacted wine exports, higher interest rates, and unfavorable weather conditions in Australia resulted in lower consumer spending, which impacted our customers' sale. In fact, domestic beer consumption was down 10% from the prior year, according to recent retail statistics. 
Volume growth in China was capacity-constrained. To enable future growth, as I mentioned, we acquired three plants in China near year end. We see many opportunities to better serve this expanding market as we drive productivity improvement in these locations. Overall, we faced different challenges and opportunities in 2010, and our segment operating profit improved in both the full year and fourth quarter of 2010.
Going to Chart 4, more importantly, we really expect our operating results to improve further during 2011 as markets continue to recover and our recent acquisitions drive additional profitable growth. As illustrated on Chart 4, we made progress this past year as we completed four acquisitions, one joint venture and constructed three new furnaces. As a result, we have added 10 new plants and 24 new furnaces to our manufacturing footprint in high-growth markets including Brazil, Argentina, Peru, China, Vietnam and Malaysia. O-I is now the largest glass container producer in Brazil and the second larger producer in China, two very important markets for O-I as they both have excellent long-term growth opportunities.  
Our strategy is focused on bolt-on acquisitions, and integration efforts are off to a good start. Overall, we are seeing very promising productivity improvements at these facilities. In total, we expect our expansion investment will be accretive to 2011 earnings and will improve further in future years.
We have been reorienting our business to the growing, emerging markets. As illustrated on the right, we have added a significant number of furnaces in South America, as well as China and Southeast Asia. Now more than 25% of our capacity is in these fast-growing markets. Over time, we will continue to increase our commitment to these emerging markets, and we'll significantly improve the growth profile for O-I.
I will now turn the call over to Ed."

Let's begin our financial review with the fourth quarter reconciliations for sales, operating profit and EPS on Chart 5. Please note that these reconciliations reflect continuing operations only. 2009 amounts have been restated to exclude the impact of our Venezuelan business. The appendix includes more details on this reclassification, as well as our full year 2010 reconciliations.
Fourth quarter 2010 segment sales decreased slightly to $1.7 billion. As expected, price and product mix were essentially flat with the prior year. And, as we have seen all year, cost pass-through provisions in our North American customer contracts resulted in a small impact on sales and had a negligible effect on operating profit.
Moving to sales volume on the following line, glass shipments, in tons, were flat with the prior year on a global basis. Its sales dollars increased by $17 million, reflecting favorable regional sales mix, especially from our acquisitions in South America. Finally, currency translation reduced our top line by $29 million in the fourth quarter. This impact was due to a weaker euro, partially offset by stronger currencies in other countries.
Moving over to segment operating profit, the fourth quarter was $221 million, up $47 million from the same period in 2009. Since price and product mix were essentially flat, they had very little impact on operating profit. While volumes were also flat, operating profit benefited by $7 million from improved regional mix, given the strong growth of higher margin business in South America. Manufacturing and delivery costs decreased $35 million, due to the benefits from footprint savings and higher operating rate. However, this was partially offset by $20 million of cost inflation, mostly driven by higher energy prices.
Finishing with the EPS reconciliation, our adjusted net income was $0.45 per share in the quarter, compared to $0.43 in the prior year. Operating profit was up $0.21 from the prior year. However, earnings were impacted $0.19 from unfavorable non-operating items. These included additional non-cash pension expense, which drove higher corporate cost. We incurred $0.08 of additional interest expense on incremental debt to fund our several accretive acquisitions. Finally, the effective tax rate was higher than last year, reflecting our current regional earnings mix.
I have two comments on GAAP EPS. We reported approximately $160 million of Note 1 charges in the fourth quarter, primarily related to our annual asbestos review and reserve adjustment. And, as we discussed in our 8-K filing last month, we incurred a onetime charge of $329 million in the fourth quarter, to write off our Venezuelan net assets and the related cumulative currency translation adjustments recorded in prior years. The company continues to negotiate with the Venezuelan government with respect to certain aspects of the expropriation, including compensation.
Let's move to Chart 6 for more detail on our balance sheet and on asbestos. Keep in mind, this information reflects Venezuela classified as a discontinued operation for both 2009 and 2010. On December 31, cash was $640 million and total debt was $4.3 billion. Net debt was $3.6 billion, an increase of $785 million from 2009 as we put our healthy balance sheet to work to fund several acquisitions. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was around 2.8x at year-end 2010 and remained within our target leverage range of between 2x and 3x EBITDA. Our underfunded pension liability was $530 million at year-end, compared to $540 million in the prior year. We generated free cash flow from continuing operations of $100 million in 2010, and this was after prefunding approximately $35 million of 2011 tax payments and pension contributions in late December. 
As Al mentioned, 2010 was a year of transition. Capital expenditures peaked as we completed our restructuring activities and, at the same time, we invested in new furnace expansions to support growing markets. Working capital levels remained lean, as we did not need to repeat the significant inventory correction conducted in late 2009. And we are now positioned for more growth this year.
Turning to asbestos. Nothing has changed in the basic pack pattern. During the fourth quarter, we conducted the annual review of our asbestos-related liabilities. As a result, the company recorded a non-cash charge of $170 million in the fourth quarter. This charge compares to $180 million in 2009. Likewise, asbestos payments dropped by $11 million from the prior year.
As illustrated in the chart, about 3,200 new cases were filed in 2010, compared to 6,000 in 2009. The number of total pending cases at the end of 2010 was 5,900, which is 1,000 fewer pendings than the prior year. Overall, asbestos remained a limited and declining liability.
On Chart 7, we present our business outlook for both first quarter and full year 2011. We have provided the usual directional guidance and expanded disclosure for annual price, volume and cost trends, as well as a number of cash flow items. Of course, as with any estimates, they are subject to change throughout the year. Overall, we're looking forward to a good year as we profitably grow our business and significantly improve free cash flow generation. 
Let's review the first quarter trends. As you can see, we expect improved pricing, higher sales volume and lower manufacturing cost. These will more than offset additional cost inflation. But we do expect higher non-operating cost, which I will review further in a minute. In addition, I'd like to highlight a couple of first quarter events.
Sales volumes should be up across all of our regions, including Asia-Pacific. Unfortunately, flooding in Australia this month has affected our customers and our Brisbane plant, which was shut down for several weeks in January. As a result of the flooding and continued challenging market conditions, our first quarter Asia-Pacific segment operating profit could be down modestly from prior-year levels. We greatly appreciate the efforts of our Australian team, which has been working night and day to serve our customers and get the Brisbane plant back into production.
Next, we deferred furnace maintenance in South America during the latter half of 2010, as very strong growth required high operating rate. Now taking advantage of a seasonally slower period, we will be conducting a number of furnace rebuilds across that region during the next 90 days. While total first quarter operating profit in South America will improve modestly from 2009, profit margins will temporarily dip below the prior year. These discrete items had impacted the first quarter; however, we expect the rate of our financial improvement to accelerate starting in the second quarter. We continue to see gradually improving market conditions and are encouraged about the contributions from our numerous recent acquisitions. In fact, our January month-to-date volumes are positive in every region and total shipments are up mid to high single digits over prior year. 
Let's review our key business factors for full year 2011. Price and mix. Following slight cost inflation in 2010, we expect modestly higher selling prices this year, which should positively impact global sales by up to 1% in 2011. Broadly speaking, prices should improve across all regions.
Sales volume. We expect global shipments will increase between 5% and 10% from 2010 levels. Recent acquisitions should boost volume between 3% and 5%, most notable in the first half of the year. Further, we anticipate organic sales growth will range between 2% and 5%, lead by innovation and overall economic improvement in each region. Please note in North America and Europe, organic growth would yield EBIT contribution margins of between 40% and 60%, depending on the plant. This is higher than normal due to the significant operating leverage to improving volumes that remained in those regions. Contribution margins in emerging markets, from both organic and acquisition-related growth, would be closer to the historic averages for those respective countries given their high operating rates. Keep in mind that during the first quarter, we will anniversary the contract changes that resulted in lower beer shipments in 2010, so future volume trends should compare more favorably to prior-year levels. And, over the course of the year, volume trends should also improve on a year-over-year basis.
Cost inflation. While 2010 cost inflation totaled only $20 million, we anticipate 2011 inflation will range between $150 million and $180 million, or about 3% of cost of goods sold. Most of the increase is due to higher raw material prices including soda ash, as well as generally higher energy and labor cost. Currently, we estimate that price improvement in 2011 would partially offset this conditional cost inflation forecast. Having said that, we will continue to seek opportunities over the course of the year to better offset cost pressures with additional higher selling prices.
Other manufacturing and delivery costs. As shipment levels in North America and Europe increase, our operating rates should improve, resulting in lower unabsorbed fixed cost. And we expect productivity and logistic initiative will provide additional benefit. Further, the completion of our footprint efforts in North America will generate $30 million to $35 million of incremental savings across the first half of 2011.
Other costs. We anticipate approximately $70 million to $80 million of additional operating expense and corporate cost, including $20 million of higher non-cash pension expense. As Al mentioned, we expect to further enhance our sales, marketing and innovation capabilities to drive top line growth. This includes our global sales and marketing program and an SAP information system for the Americas. We see these investments as a meaningful way for O-I to advance its strategic priority to strengthen glass marketing.
Overall, the rate of spending will be managed throughout the year, depending on our financial performance. Interest expense is expected to increase $35 million in 2011, as we used our balance sheet to finance our recent acquisitions. As we mentioned, our acquisitions will be accretive this year, so improved operating profit from these transactions will more than offset the financing cost.  Our 2011 effective tax rate should approximate 27%. Tax expense and tax payments should be about the same.
Free cash flow. Our major restructuring program is now complete, and we're well positioned for growth in the emerging markets. As a result, CapEx should decline from $500 million in 2010 to approximately $350 million in 2011. Restructuring payments would drop from $61 million in the prior year to approximately $20 million in 2011. Expected pension contribution and asbestos payments are also provided on Chart 7. While we target further working capital efficiency, working capital will most likely be a modest use of cash in 2011 as sales increase. Overall, free cash flow should approximate $300 million this year.
In summary, we expect both improved financial results and greater free cash flow generation in 2011. Now, I'll turn it back to Al on Chart 8."

Number one, first of all, our inflation is a projection, and it's really influenced significantly by what could happen in the last few months, with regards to commodity prices and with regards to",435,"Yes, Rick, let me try to give you some perspective on that. Number one, first of all, our inflation is a projection, and it's really influenced significantly by what could happen in the last few months, with regards to commodity prices and with regards to energy prices. We have put a significant focus in the long-term contracts on making sure that we have quarterly pass-through provisions for energy. But still, if you have an escalating energy price development, you still run behind one quarter in each of the successive quarters. Now it may very well be that in the course of the year, there are going to be ups and downs from one quarter to the next. Then, of course, this profile would change a little bit, and we would not have this factor that we would be running behind. With regard to the more stable prices that we have seen in the past, with regard to commodities, in particular, that affects our raw materials, we generally have annual pass-through provisions. And as we have gone into this year, of course, the evolution that we saw last year was pretty mild, so the price adjustment has been fairly low. Now as we go through this escalation of commodity prices in this coming year, we will be running a bit behind, but I think overall, of course, that would fix itself again and in the subsequent year. And I believe that the dynamics that we're seeing are predominantly related, of course, to the longer-term contracts. And now you know that in Europe, which, of course, is a significant share of our business, we only do about 30% of our volume in longer-term contracts. So the contracts in Europe are more determined on a short-term annual basis. And of course, it's very difficult at the beginning of the year, as you negotiate these contracts, to argue that at the end of the year, raw materials are going to be much higher and, therefore, the price should be much higher. So I think what we'll see in the course of the year is, hopefully, our competitors in Europe will also see these cost increases coming in, and that will hopefully allow us to do some additional price adjustments. So we'll keep an eye on it, and we'll keep moving to make sure that we get recovery as quickly as we can. But coming into this year, with especially the escalations happening so rapidly in the last three months, it's very difficult to really fully include that in our model, so we tended to be a bit more careful."

And they, of course, over the course of the year, add up. The other part is with regard to basic raw materials like our soda ash and other products, those tend to have faster provisions on an annual basis. And there is, of course, when you have a dramatic change or a rapid change in the course of the year, you have to wait until the following year. The third part that I believe is important to consider is that we are also projecting a cost evolution in the course of the year. Now at the beginning of the year as we set our annual contracts, of course, it was very difficult to argue for higher prices in November, December or September, October, November, December that you expect as there is no proof that you can demonstrate to your customers. And, of course, that also depends a little bit on how proactive your competitor stands to be in passing through those prospective increases in cost."

And I think having had a presence in Venezuela for more than 40 years, or 50 years, clearly, I think it has been a good decision. It has been a good investment. And I think that the only lesson that we learned from it is to make sure that in, perhaps, some of the other countries where there is some greater volatility, we at least have actions in place and plans in place to make sure that we can deal with a situation in a proactive fashion."

In fact, in some of these, we have seen 10% to 15% productivity improvements in a very short period of time, which, of course, are very beneficial to the overall return that we're projecting for these businesses. But I think what is also happening, of course, is that it is giving us access to new geographies, like for instance, in Brazil, the northern part of Brazil, we were not really very active. And that really is a fairly strongly expanding market. The other part was in Argentina. We really never had a position in Argentina, and beer demand, as well as wine, in Argentina, are evolving very nicely. Similarly, Malaysia, Vietnam, I recently was there, and it's just amazing to see the vibrancy of the economy. So I think the strategy so far is working out very well. And, certainly, in the first six to three months, depending on when we did the acquisition of the transactions that we've done, we're very satisfied and very happy with the progress that we're making."

And so that strategy is working out very well. With regard to the mix between one-way and refillable, I think that's really an issue that's driven by the overall income levels in those countries. And even though we have strongly emerging middle-class sections in Latin America, as well as in Asia Pacific, the overall income level relative to, let's say, Europe or North America is, of course, still very low. So what we're seeing is continued use of refillable containers as the preferable packaging modality, because it does really allow our customers to hit that emerging middle class sooner in the curve because the packaging cost is so low on a per transaction cost that it really allows them to access a broader base of the market, but sooner. And that makes it a very attractive package in their marketing strategy there as well."
