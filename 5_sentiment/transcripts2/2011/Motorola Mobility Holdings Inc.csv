Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I will begin today with a review of the business. Marc will then discuss the detailed financial results and our guidance, after that we’ll take your question.In January, Mobile Device",1489,"Thank you, Dean. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I will begin today with a review of the business. Marc will then discuss the detailed financial results and our guidance, after that we’ll take your question.
In January, Mobile Devices and Home became an independent public company, particularly well-positioned for the opportunities in smartphones, tablets, video solutions and converged experiences.
During the first quarter, we grew our business and diversified our sales mix. We launched two new smartphones, bringing our total cumulative smartphone launches to 27 and total smartphone shipments to nearly 20 million units.
We shipped the first tablet running Android 3.0. We introduced ATRIX, WebTop and Lapdock, an innovative mobile computing experience for consumers and the enterprise. And we addressed our supply chain challenges created by the tragic events in Japan.
We accomplished a lot, but we also have some takeaway. We know that consumers want to expand their price points and enhanced productivity suite functionalities for the ATRIX Lapdock bundle. Consumers want more apps for Android tablets and with the delay of Bionic from the second quarter to this summer we know that execution needs to get better.
From a financial results’ perspective, we grew our revenue to $3 billion - to $3 billion, a growth of 22% year-over-year.
On a non-GAAP basis, the net loss was $0.08 per share, an 83% improvement, compared to a loss of $0.48 per share in the year ago quarter. We exceeded the top-end of our guidance range with strong results in our Home businesses - Home business and by reducing our year-over-year operating loss in Mobile Devices.
From a cash perspective, we generated $107 million in operating cash flow. In Mobile Devices business, we shipped 4.1 million smartphones and over 250,000 tablets.
Our revenue mix was more diversified in the quarter and reflected our effort to drive growth in geographies outside of North America. In the quarter, China and Latin America and other international markets accounted for 44% of total Mobile Devices revenue, compared to 37% in the fourth quarter of 2010 and 34% in the year-ago quarter.
This increase was driven primarily by smartphone shipments outside of North America that were more than twice the level of the year ago quarter, accounting for over 50% of our smartphone unit shipment.
This compares to one-third of smartphone shipments in the fourth quarter of last year and 25% in the year ago quarter. In China, we increased our presence across the retail channel, strengthened our carrier sales efforts, enhanced point of sale branding and expanded our smartphone portfolio.
From a product perspective, with more than 20 smartphones to launch since the end of 2009 in China, we continue to be a leading provider of Android smartphones. DEFY, our life proof water resistant smartphone, with the dual-mode, dual-standby XT800 were two of the best selling smartphones in China.
In the quarter, smartphone shipments exceeded 1 million units or more than half of what we shipped all of last year. In the second quarter, we will begin to ship ATRIX and two new dual-core smartphones developed specifically for the China market. These include the dual SIM XT882 for China Telecom and MT870 for China Mobile.
In Latin America, market demand continues to be very strong. In the quarter, we expanded our retail presence in key markets. We also introduced DEFY with both SIM and bebo in Brazil and Telecom Personal and Claro in Argentina.
Smartphone shipments were up year-over-year and sequentially with SPICE and DEFY our top sellers. In the second quarter, we are adding ATRIX to our Latin American line up, beginning with this month’s launch in Brazil.
In Europe, smartphone shipments grew compared to the year ago quarter. We’re getting good traction in our portfolio with DEFY being our leading seller and we’re beginning to increase our media presence as part of our plan to further grow our sales.
In North America, we launched our first high-performance smartphone with AT&T, the ATRIX 4G, when combined with its companion Lapdock and enabled by our WebTop application, ATRIX delivers a new experience in mobile computing. Total smartphone shipments in the quarter, including solid sales of the Droid family of devices increased by over 10%, compared to the year ago quarter.
In tablets, we have an incremental growth opportunity in we - in which we can leverage existing investments in R&D and distribution. In February, we launched the Motorola XOOM, the first tablet on Android 3.0 with Verizon. In March, we introduced the XOOM Wi-Fi only tablet at seven major U.S. retailers, including Amazon, Best Buy, Costco and Staples.
We also re-entered the Japan market by launching the Wi-Fi tablet with KDDI. In the quarter, we shipped over 250,000 tablets. We plan to further expand our - expand availability by launching our Wi-Fi tablet at Sprint and internationally we will begin shipping this quarter in China, Brazil, Argentina, Korea and Germany.
In the second quarter, we have the opportunity to significantly increase second quarter XOOM shipments compared to the first quarter. Our LTE upgrade to XOOM will be available in summer, followed by additional 4G and Wi-Fi tablets, including new form factors later this year.
As we look ahead within the Android ecosystem, we have a very strong pipeline of devices and experiences. We plan to differentiate ourselves in the following four key areas.
In mobile computing, we created a whole new experience category with the introduction of Motorola ATRIX 4G, Lapdock and our proprietary WebTop software. This unique product offering simplifies, improve and dramatically reduces the cost of existing mobile computing solutions for consumers, as well as business users.
In May, the full bundle of Motorola ATRIX 4G smartphone, WebTop software and Lapdock will be offered at AT&T for $399 after mail in rebate. We also plan on introducing successive iterations of our WebTop software and related accessories that incorporate improved productivity tools at multiple price point.
Second, in the enterprise, our focus is on differentiated software to optimize Android for business. Devices including DROID Pro, ATRIX and XOOM have demonstrated a strong value proposition and helped accelerate the level of interest in adoption of Android-based devices in the enterprise.
Technology from our wholly owned subsidiary 3LM enables superior device level security and manageability specifically for Android devices. We are also working with a number of other enterprise software partners to deliver fully integrated solutions for the enterprise.
Third, in media and content services, the user-based on MOTOBLUR, a cloud-based services platform continues to grow and it’s currently over 7 million users. We intend to continue to evolve the platform to support enhanced services and improve the device management. We also plan on utilizing Zecter’s innovative applications and services technology so that users of our smartphones and tablets will have access to their content anywhere, anytime.
Finally, we’re continuing to work on converged Home experiences that provide our customers with infrastructure-based solutions that blend video and entertainment delivery with Internet communication. In addition, we’re developing consumer centric devices for interactive multi-screen features and services.
Turning now to Home. In the Home business, compared to a year ago, revenues were up and operating margin was higher. This team is delivering solid financial results, holding share in priority markets, introducing new products and services and taking the lead in critical industry transitions, such as multi-screen content delivery and all-IP video.
In this business, we are prioritizing our R&D investments to ensure sustainable profitability in our core business and to position us for growth in new market segments such as software services and media experiences.
For the near-term we continue to invest in our consumer premise equipment portfolio, our network infrastructure and on our software and services offering to further enhance our solutions for end operators.
For a longer-term perspective, we are investing in the transformation to all IP network and cloud-based multi-screen consumer experiences. For operators, this means developing next-generation infrastructure and software solutions to provide more bandwidth capacity, IP-based content distribution, cloud-based service management and processing and delivery of content to multiple screens.
For consumers, this means creating IP-based Home network and devices that enable a connected ecosystem which provides a broad range of video experiences, including multi-room DVRs, streaming TV and sync and go content mobility. To support these efforts, we have acquired several software-based companies, including 4Home, Zecter, and, most recently, Dreampark, a leading provider of software solutions for IPTV systems.
With Dreampark's portfolio, we can further enhance the capabilities of operators to customize their consumer-facing service portal regardless of the screen being used. Together, the software technologies we have acquired and those developed internally have been integrated into a comprehensive software portfolio.
The result is an increasing number of solutions which help drive incremental revenue and increased differentiation for network operators. With that, I will now turn the call over to Marc to provide additional details on the financial results for the quarter and our guidance. Marc?

On a GAAP basis, we reported an operating loss of $36 million. Non-GAAP adjustments totaled an expense of $56 million and related to stock compensation expense and intangible asset amortization.
On a non-GAAP basis, operating earnings were $20 million. This was favorable to our operating earnings guidance and a significant improvement compared to the operating loss of $101 million in the year-ago quarter.
We reported a first quarter GAAP loss per share of $0.27, compared to a loss of $0.72 per share in the year ago quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, the first quarter loss was $0.08 per share, compared to a loss of $0.48 per share in the first quarter of 2010. Earnings per share exceeded the top end of our guidance of a loss of $0.09 to $0.21 per share, reflecting a strong quarter in the home business and in-line results for mobile devices.
Further details on our non-GAAP results are included as part of today's press release and available on our website. My remaining income statement references will be on a non-GAAP basis.
The first quarter gross margin percentage of Motorola Mobility was 25.0%, compared to 24.3% in the first quarter of 2010. The improvement was driven by higher gross margin levels in both mobile devices and home.
On a sequential basis, gross margin percentage was lower, due largely to product mix and international growth, resulting in mid-range smartphones representing a larger percentage of the overall portfolio mix. The operating expenses in the quarter were $739 million, up 5% year-over-year.
This increase is attributable largely to higher sales and marketing expenses to support business growth in mobile devices. Head count in the company was essentially unchanged from year-end.
Total non-operating expenses were $15 million, reflecting foreign-exchange costs as well as certain non-recurring costs related to our separation. The provision for income taxes was $30 million, slightly higher than our forecast, attributable to changes in our geographic mix of operating income and losses.
Turning now to our business segments, in mobile devices, first-quarter revenues were $2.1 million, up 30% year-over-year. Total mobile device shipments were $9.3 million units, including 4.1 million smartphones and over 250,000 XOOM tablets.
Our overall ASP increased to $229, compared to $214 in the fourth quarter of last year. This increase was driven by tablets. The non-GAAP operating loss in mobile devices was $61 million, compared to a loss of $148 million in the first quarter of 2010.
The year-over-year improvement was driven by higher smartphone sales and improved gross margin percentage, offset partially by higher advertising and promotion expenses in key markets around the world.
Turning to the home business. In the home business, first-quarter revenues were $904 million, up 8% year-over-year. This reflects higher set-top box revenues and a comparable level of infrastructure sales.
With respect to the growth rate, recall that during the first and second quarters of 2010, the industry was experiencing a reduced level of demand, particularly in the U.S. Demand levels began to recover in the second half of last year and as a result, year-on-year growth rates in the first half of this year are expected to be higher than what we anticipate for the second half of 2011.
Non-GAAP operating margin was 9%, compared to 5.6% in the first quarter of last year. The margin in the quarter reflects leverage on the revenue growth, a favorable product mix and controls over operating expenses.
Moving now to cash flow and the balance sheet. From a cash perspective, we generated $107 million of cash, our seventh consecutive quarter of positive operating cash flow for the business. Total cash at the end of the quarter was approximately $3.3 billion. Of this amount, $3.1 billion was classified as cash and cash equivalents. The remaining $168 million is restricted cash, primarily related to cash on deposit in Brazil.
Total inventory at the end of the quarter was $859 million, up $16 million from year-end. Days sales in inventory were 34 days, compared to 30 days for the December quarter. Accounts receivable was essentially flat with the fourth quarter. Days sales outstanding increased sequentially to 46 days from 41 days. This is due largely to changes in geographic and customer mix.
Accounts payable was $1.6 billion, a decrease of $151 million from year-end. Days payable remain unchanged at 62 days.
I'll turn now to our outlook for the second quarter. In mobile devices, we expect sequential growth in smartphones and tablets. We also expect sequential improvement in the operating loss.
In home, on a sequential basis, we expect comparable revenues and operating margins. For Motorola Mobility, we expect approximately $10 million in non-operating expenses and a provision for income taxes in the range of $35 million to $40 million this quarter. In the second quarter, we expect non-GAAP earnings in the range of breakeven to $35 million. This is equivalent to earnings per share of zero to positive $0.12.
With respect to supply, following the tragic events in Japan, we began a detailed review of our supply chain. Our assessment indicates much of our supply chain was unaffected. In impacted areas, we have secured alternative sources of supply or implemented engineering solutions.
While some uncertainty still exists and our review is ongoing, we believe we have a balanced supply outlook reflected in our expectations for the balance of the year. Specifically for the second quarter, we anticipate no significant impact to our mobile device and home businesses.
In addition, I would like to provide the following updates on the full year. In mobile devices, we continue to expect significant revenue growth this year to be driven by the shipment of 20 million to 23 million mobile devices, including 1.5 million to 2 million tablets.
In our home business, we continue to expect revenues in 2011 to be comparable to 2010. And from an operating-margin perspective for the full year, we continue to expect low single-digit operating margin on mobile devices and slight operating margin improvement in home compared to 2010.
For stock compensation expense and amortization of intangibles, we continue to expect approximately $220 million in total expense for the full year. For the second quarter, we expect a total expense of $65 million and in the third and fourth quarters, we expect $52 million and $47 million, respectively.
The quarterly volatility relates to stock compensation expense and has to do with the amount and types of equity compensation, vesting and other factors. With respect to income taxes, we continue to anticipate an ongoing annual effective tax rate of approximately 30%.
As we indicated on the last call, given our expected geographic distribution of operating profits and losses, we expect some volatility in the quarterly tax rate. And on an expense basis, the quarterly tax provision is expected to increase through the year as our business grows. This is due to tax expenses on foreign earnings which, for now, cannot be offset by tax benefits on U.S. operating results.
Over time, as we achieve normalized earning levels across our various geographies and are able to utilize our deferred tax assets, we expect a lower annual tax rate. The earnings guidance we have provided today is on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, intangible asset amortization and items similar to those historically highlighted in our quarterly earnings results.
With that, I will turn the call back over to Dean to start the questions and answers.

And we will continue to focus on that. You will see multiple devices from us in the second half launching with these capabilities and we will expand the range of our Lapdock devices so we cover a broader price point, addressing both enterprise premium tier as well as more consumer tiers.

With respect to the gross margins on the tablets, what we've said and what we saw in Q1 were that the tablet gross margins were lower than the overall gross margins for the business.
Secondly, with respect to the pricing, clearly we are looking to have multiple devices in the marketplace, multiple form factors, in the second half of this year to move the growth and that will have some impact on the ASPs. I don't see any short term ASP erosion on the products that we launched in the marketplace you know, we have the WiFi tablet as well as the cellular tablet and we'll be expanding with that product outside the U.S. in a more meaningful way in Q2.
The trajectory in the gross margins, I think we're going to have to see how the market plays out with respect to pricing, but we'll continue to look at the cost of our devices and ensure that we have competitive costs and competitive pricing and the gross margin will play itself out, but clearly, this is - there's two things.

With respect specifically to your comments regarding Europe, at the moment we have DEFY, which is our best seller in Europe, ATRIX launches in Germany with Vodafone and the PhoneWarehouse - the PhoneHouse, rather, and we have tablet launches in UK with Carphone Warehouse, Best Buy and obviously part of Best Buy, and Dixons. Germany, we launched the XOOM with Deutsche Telecom. We have launches coming up in France and Italy. We are certainly expanding our presence in the second quarter in Germany.

And the range of Smartphones that we see selling well in the U.S. still continues to be relatively narrow. But as you’ve seen, we have offered differentiated offerings like ATRIX, which extends the capability of Smartphones to more broadly applicable situations for consumers and that has resonated very well.
I will tell you that in surveys that we’ve done, the ATRIX users have shown a great deal of satisfaction with the value proposition of that product. The enterprise is obviously going to be very, very important for us, as I highlighted earlier.
The second thing I would say is that we see mid-tier becoming very important in international markets. China, Brazil, and Europe, we see mid-tier being very important. The success of DEFY in all three regions really underlines two points. One, the price point of that device is right, and the life proof value proposition is resonating. So, I think that we will continue to be very selective about the markets and consumer segments that we go after but it’s unlikely that we will consolidate into one device. You will see us consolidating into fewer devices than we did, perhaps, in the past, but by no means one device.

We’re beginning to see much more interest from carriers, perhaps unrelated to what is happening with Nokia, but certainly we are seeing a little more interest from carriers in Europe as well.
In China, I think we have much better distribution through our retail channels and we have much better relationship with China Telecom, China Mobile and China Unicom. Those things are driving our revenue in these regions, Simona.

We can see, really, over the last several quarters the amount of inventory that we've had to dispose of without utilization has gone down significantly. We see that trend continuing to be favorable as our end-of-lifeing of product becomes much more manageable and efficient.

And then, secondly, any greater detail on kind of your position in China? I think you mentioned you were leading Android share there. I want to make sure I heard that right. And I was wondering if it is heavily skewed towards one of the carriers or are you seeing strength at all three? Thanks.

And actually, that part of the business is proceeding very well, I would say ahead of plan, in terms of its traction in the marketplace. So, I would say both the feature phone as well as the mass-market smartphone categories are continuing to perform well for us.
In terms of China, again, you heard us right. We are the leading ANDROID handset provider in China. As you know, we have a great deal of support from local application providers. We have our own shop for apps in China, which differentiates our device.
We have relationships with all three carriers there. And certainly our China Telecom XT800 device has done extremely well for us. But DEFY is also doing extremely well in multiple carrier networks. So I don't think there is very heavy differentiation amongst carrier relationships there in China.

Marc will then discuss the detailed financial results for the quarter and our guidance. After that we’ll take your questions.
Just becoming an independent company in January, we have been focused on a number of key priorities. In Mobile Devices, these include growing the business, expanding customer and geographic diversity, delivering a compelling and differentiated product portfolio and improving the financial results. In Home our priorities include, maintaining leadership and improving profitability in our core business taking a lead in the transition underway to all IP solutions and developing solutions to address the multi-screen environment.
In each of these areas, we have made good progress. In Mobile Devices, we grew revenues by over 40% year-over-year. Our growth was driven by the shipments of 4.4 million smartphones, 440,000 tablets and 6.2 million feature phones. For the first six months of the year, we have announced 13 new smartphones and tablet devices growing revenues by 35%, increased smartphones shipment by 70% and cut the operating loss by 64%. We continued to diversify our geographic footprint by expanding our sales outside of the US.
In the quarter, revenues in China, Latin America and other international markets were up significantly compared to the second quarter a year ago, due primarily to smartphone unit shipments that more than tripled. Feature phone sales were also higher driven by a competitive portfolio of mass market devices developed for emerging markets. In China, we continued our growth momentum with additional smartphone launches and by focusing on expanding our retail presence.
New launches included ATRIX for China Unicom, the XT882 for China Telecom and our first value priced smartphone the XT316. We have now launched eight smartphones in China this year with several more devices planned for the second half of the year. Second quarter smartphone shipments were up sequentially led by DEFY in the mid-range and XT800 at the high-end. We remained one of the top Android smartphone providers in China. And in the first six months of the year, we have surpassed our total smartphone unit shipments for the all of last year.
In Latin America, handset demand continues to be very strong. We continued to grow our business by reentering Chile and Columbia and increasing share in Brazil and Mexico. During the quarter, we added ATRIX and XOOM to the product lineup and just recently launched the XT316 marketed as Motorola SPICE Key. Smartphone unit shipments were up significantly from a year-ago quarter, with our mid-tier SPICE and DEFY devices the top sellers. Sales of our mass market phones particularly MOTOKEY and Motorola SCREAM [ph] also increased substantially.
In Europe, we continued to focus on key carrier relationships and expanding our retail distribution in priority markets including the UK, France and Germany. Smartphone shipments were up significantly from a year-ago. ATRIX supported with few campaigns by Orange in France and the UK and DEFY our life proof device were the leading sellers. In North America second quarter total revenues and total smartphone shipments declined from a year-ago quarter. That said, ATRIX sent towards AT&T is up since moving to the $99 price point in June. In addition, we announced the plan to launch 10 new devices with Sprint in 2011, Android 3 has come out of the gates in July with strong sell through.
While the smartphone market continues to expand rapidly all around the world, particularly with the introduction of LTE, it is still in its early stages. To address the growth opportunity in the second half of the year, we have a strong product lineup. In North America, we will have several smartphones ready for back to school season including PHOTON 4G and TRIUMPH at Sprint, Android X2, Android 3 at Verizon. Regarding the DROID BIONIC, we want to ensure that we deliver an exceptional consumer experience. BIONIC will be the first device to deliver the combination of the power of LTE and a dual core gigahertz processor. And it will be in the stores in September.
We also plan to launch a number of new smartphones later in the year, including at least one additional LTE device, a re-brush up DEFY and several sub 200 smartphones for emerging markets. In tablets, the Android experience continues to improve. An increasing number of tablet applications that are available in the market and the Honeycomb upgrade underway enhances media and video experiences.
In the second quarter, we expanded XOOM distribution internationally, including launches in Latin America, Europe, China, Korea and Japan. Our upgrade to LTE for XOOM will be available in September followed by two additional LTE tablets introductions later this year. All-to-all we will have at least five LTE devices in the market by the end of the year. In addition to driving growth through new products and expanded distributions, differentiation is also a driver of growth. We are keenly focused on differentiating our product portfolios in the following areas.
In mobile computing, we will introduce enhancements to our webtop application which enables consumers to get more out of their Motorola smartphones. Later this year, our high performance smartphones and suite of smartphone accessories will feature improved capabilities in a number of areas including office productivity and multimedia. Accessory and device bundle price points will be more competitive and form factor will be expanded to address both the enterprise and consumer segments of the market.
In enterprise, Android is gaining momentum by offering consumers and CIOs more choices. We are supporting ongoing enterprise trails and expanding our ready for business portfolio of smartphones and webtop enabled accessories. Upcoming devices will include more comprehensive security features, device management and enterprise support capabilities. In cloud-based services, we continued to enhance our offering, for example vast majority of the consumer personal content using photos, music photos, videos and files is typically stored on a PC. We have developed a secure personal cloud by integrating our ZumoCast experience to enable consumer to access that content from a Motorola smartphone or tablet.
Users will also be able to stream content and sync content among multiple devices. Motorola smartphone users will also be able to access the leading on-demand music streaming service with the availability of Spotify for which we are the exclusive US mobile device launch and marketing partner.
Let me now turn to the Home business. The industry continues to face constraint but stable levels of demand. That said the transition to all-IP solutions is underway and competition and consumer are driving operators to provide more advanced and interactive services. In our core business, we are focused on expanding new customer relationships developing solutions to improve consumer experiences and network efficiencies and increasing profitability. We are also positioning ourselves to lead in the multiyear transition to all-IP network and delivery of more advanced services.
Solutions we are developing includes, streaming TV, home monitoring and control and advanced video gateways. From an infrastructure perspective, our focus includes solution for network based storage and delivery, enhanced network capacity and improving consumer service level. Some process point on these priorities include the following. We have significantly improved operating margin in the first half of the year compared to the same period a year ago. We announced Televation, a broadband video device that allows consumers to watch TV on any connected IP device in or around the home. We launched the Medios Xperience platform which enables service providers to merge video content with social network, games and other web based contents to deliver more personalized multi-screen TV viewing experience.
We’re collaborating with Time Warner to develop a video gateway platform that creates an IP home network capable of delivering premium in-home entertainment across multiple devices. And our full home solution with selective for the rollout of a home monitoring control and energy management service to be announced later this quarter. Across the company we have made good progress in our strategy and priority. For the second half, we have a strong lineup of new products and experiences and a high level of confidence in our ability to continue to grow the business and further improve our financial results.
But before passing the call to Marc to cover financials, I also want to comment briefly on the topic of intellectual property. As most of you know, we own one of the strongest and most respected patent portfolios in the industry. We have over 17,000 patents granted and over 7,000 patents pending with particular strength in 2G and 3G essential, non-essential patents important to the delivery of competitive products in the marketplace, video particularly compression, decompression and security technologies and finally, a leading position in 4G LTE essential.
With new entrants to the mobile space resulting from the convergence of mobility, media, computing and the internet, our patent portfolio is increasingly important. We regularly review the company’s strategies opportunities and assets including IP with the goal of creating and enhancing value.
With that I now turn the call over to Marc to provide additional details on the financial results for the quarter and our guidance. Marc?

In the second quarter, we continued to grow our business. Motorola Mobility revenues were $3.3 billion, up 28% from the second quarter of 2010.

Motorola Mobility revenues were $3.3 billion, up 28% from the second quarter of 2010. On a GAAP basis, we reported an operating loss of $23 million. Non-GAAP adjustments on a pre-tax basis totaled an expense of $82 million. This includes stock compensation expense and intangible asset amortization of $62 million and $20 million related to our reserve for a legal matter.
On a non-GAAP basis, operating earnings were $59 million, a significant improvement compared to the operating loss of $51 million in the year-ago quarter. On a per share basis, we reported a second quarter GAAP net loss of $0.19. On a non-GAAP basis, earnings were $0.09 per share compared to a loss of $0.30 per share in the second quarter of 2010. Further details on our non-GAAP results are included as part of today’s press release and available on our website. My remaining income statement references will be on a non-GAAP basis.
The second quarter gross margin percentage for Motorola Mobility was 26%, up from 25% in the first quarter and 25.7% in the second quarter of 2010. On a sequential basis, the improvement was driven by higher gross margin bubbles in both, Mobile Devices and Home associated with the favorable product mix. Total operating expenses in the quarter were $809 million, up 12% year-over-year. The increase was driven primarily by higher sales and marketing expense to support revenue growth in Mobile Devices.
Non-operating income was $6 million. This is favorable to our prior guidance, due to income from the sale of certain equity investments no longer considered strategic. The provision for income taxes was $39 million. This was at the high end of our guidance due primarily to the increased level of business in Brazil and China.
Turning now to our business segments. In Mobile Devices, second quarter revenues were $2.4 billion, up 41% year-over-year. Total mobile device shipments were 11 million units including 4.4 million smartphones and 440,000 XOOM tablets. Feature phone unit shipments were 6.2 million, up 1.3 million units sequentially due primarily to continued strong demand for our devices in Latin America. The strong feature phone demand resulted in overall ASP of $220 compared to $229 in the first quarter. Smartphone ASP was up sequentially driven by an increased mix of high performance devices while the overall tablet ASP was lower due to a larger mix of Wi-Fi only devices in our recent price reduction action.
The non-GAAP operating loss for mobile devices was $31 million compared to a loss of $109 million in the second quarter of 2010. The year-over-year improvement reflects higher sales volume, offset partially by increased sales and marketing expenses. In the Home business, second quarter revenues were $907 million, up 2% year-over-year. Higher set-top revenues were offset by slightly lower infrastructure sales. Non-GAAP operating margin was 9.9% compared to 6.5% in the second quarter of last year. The margin improvement is attributable primarily to an improved product and customer mix.
Moving now to cash flow and the balance sheet. In the quarter, operating cash flow was breakeven compared to a $107 million inflow in the first quarter. The decline was due primarily to growth in accounts receivable related to the higher level of sales. Total cash, cash equivalence and cash deposits at the end of the quarter were approximately $3.2 billion. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we received $75 million of the $300 million of deferred cash contribution from Motorola Solutions. We expect to receive the balance of the deferred contribution from our former parent over time as they complete the associated capital repatriation activities.
Accounts receivables was $1.8 billion compared to $1.6 billion in the first quarter. Days sales outstanding increased sequentially from 50 days from 46 days due largely to changes in geographic and customer mix. Net inventory declined to $744 million, days sales in inventory were 27 days compared to 34 days for the March quarter. Accounts payable was $1.7 billion, an increase of $1.6 billion from the first quarter. Days payable outstanding increased slightly to 63 days.
Moving now to our outlook. In the third quarter in Mobile Devices, we expect sequential growth in total unit shipments including a higher smartphones and feature phone shipments. We expect XOOM shipments to be sequentially lower as we transition the portfolio. Sales in the third quarter are expected to be up slightly on a sequential basis compared to the second quarter.
We also expect further sequential improvement in the operating loss. In Home, as we have anticipated and reflected our previous outlooks we expect lower revenues and operating margin in the third quarter on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. For Motorola Mobility, we expect non-operating income and expense to be breakeven and make impact provision in the range of $40 million to $45 million. All in, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share of breakeven to $0.10. For the full-year, we expect shipments of smartphones and tablets to be between 21 million and 23 million units including 1.3 million to 1.5 million tablets.
In our Home business, we continue to expect 2011 revenues to be comparable from 2010. From an operating earnings perspective for the full-year, we expect Mobile Devices to be modestly profitable. In Home, we expect 2011 operating margins to improve by as much as 100 basis points compared to 2010. With respect to income taxes for the year, we anticipate a total tax provision of approximately $160 million to $170 million primarily related to taxes in foreign jurisdictions.
In addition for this call, we will also provide a full-year perspective on non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.48 to $0.60. And again that is for the full-year. Our common share assumptions for earnings per share include approximately 297 million basic shares and approximately 303 million shares on a fully diluted basis. For stock compensation expense and amortization of intangibles, we expect approximately $51 million and $220 million for the third quarter and full-year respectively.
Finally, the earnings per share guidance we have provided today is on a non-GAAP basis which excludes stock based compensation expense, intangible asset amortization and items similar to those historically highlighted in our quarterly earnings results.
With that, I will turn the call back over to Dean.

As a result of that, there is a flow through effect relative to the operating margin performance in the quarter. That said, again if you look at the Home business on a full-year basis, we are guiding to relatively flat year-over-year revenue and an operating income performance increase of as large as 100 basis points.

I am just wondering what’s the issue with the incremental margin in your Mobile Devices business. You perhaps underestimated or overestimated profitability on the tablet side? Is it the pricing environment is may be slightly worse or you haven’t spent more. And the reason why I am asking is that my best guess is that your overall devices revenues might go up by more than $2 billion this year, but your profit increase had only be $200 million of sales. The incremental margin is 10% or slightly more not really that significant. So I am trying to figure out, if something has changed in the leverage that you potentially have in this business now and long-term?

I think those two factors have been key contributors in the net effect that you highlight in your question.

So just curious how you see the cost trajectory going there in the margins? And then secondly, I got a tough topic to talk about, on the intellectual property, I just wondered that my interpretation have you guys response to Carl Icahn’s 13D filing was that you see that patent portfolio as part of that reason you’ve been able to deliver the kind of growth you’ve delivered in the business.

First of all let me tell you that at $499 32-gigabyte device we are pricing our tablets more aggressively than iPad. That’s the first point. So we are not just placing iPad as a competitor there are other competitors in the Android ecosystem that we need to be competitive with. Second point going forward, remember one of the advantages of being first is that you get the halo effect of being first but also you have less time to cost optimize. As we look at our second generation of devices, we have really focused on cost optimizing those devices. And what I’ve guided you before is the profitability in tablet business will be somewhere between PC and smartphone growth margins. And I anticipate that we will get those gross margins with the new tablet that we’ve launched. And we have designed them with more aggressive cost points in mind already. So I feel pretty good that we will be able to get gross margins on the tablets.
With respect to your IP point Rod, I think when I first came here one of the reasons that I liked this opportunity was because I had to view that most brand and IP portfolio here was very strong. As I have arrived here and have had an opportunity to understand our IP portfolio, I actually think it’s stronger than I anticipated. And there are really a few areas where our patent portfolio is extremely strong. First I think 2G, 3G essentials I think that’s very well understood by the street and the industry and we’ve monetized that asset over the last few years very well.
Probably a little less well known of our terms and patent portfolio is in the non-essential patents which are capabilities which are important to have in delivering competitive products in the marketplace. Third, I think is in our video encoding, decoding and security. And fourth, and probably the least understood and most underestimated is the strength in our 4G LTE patent portfolio. As I look at these patent portfolios, I feel very good that we will be able to go forward and find ways to create and enhance shareholder value for all of our shareholders.

Two reasons, one, I think we will manage our R&D very effectively at the levels that it is at and secondly because I anticipate we will have volume increase.",372,"Mark, let me just start by saying I do not believe per unit R&D increase is likely or necessary. Two reasons, one, I think we will manage our R&D very effectively at the levels that it is at and secondly because I anticipate we will have volume increase. Let me then address the substance of your question with regards to how will we differentiate our product? I think if you look we have always said that there are four elements to our differentiation. First is enterprise, second is this notion of personal cloud and I’ll spend a little bit of time on that, third is disability to differentiate in care as to how we provide care to our consumers and fourth is cloud-based services.
So let me take enterprise. I think today in Android ecosystem, I believe that we have and we get this feedback from our customers differentiated in terms of the capabilities that we have embedded in our devices to support enterprise class security, to support feature sets which are relevant to enterprises. And I think we’re beginning to see that traction in the marketplace. Second, we have talked about our cloud services. We have over 10 million subscribers now to our cloud services and we are increasingly able to provide them services like making them aware of what is happening on their phones like delivering them aggregated social networking, like delivering them rich social location services, like delivering them connected media and connected gallery features which I think our consumers more and more recognize as being differentiated.
Third thing is this notion of being able to access your content on your PC from anywhere. As much as we all believe that all of the consumers contents will eventually go to the cloud, today vast majority of that content actually exists on our PCs. And with the acquisition of the Zecter Company, they have a solution called ZumoCast which enables you to either download or sync or stream from your PC. And this resonated extremely well with our consumers. And I think that that is a very differentiated capability. So we are already focused on differentiating ourselves and we will certainly manage our R&D expense very carefully and with discipline.

So we are prepared to engage in both models where we think we could differentiate, we will go do our own tablets but in lot of places, I think we can leverage our brand name, our distribution, our software experience and leverage the development capabilities and manufacturing capabilities of Taiwanese ODM.

Now when you look at the marketing front, and how the XOOM was originally priced and it was promoted, and I guess the ATRIX as well, I’d love to hear your thoughts on how the ATRIX at AT&T did versus your expectations. But most thoughts out externally were that with the laptop dock which was a webtop dock which was just very novel and a super idea but the marketing of it and the price points of the combined product were a little high and to it, the price point of that combined laptop dock came down. You lowered down the price point on the XOOM ended up coming down, you lowered them. There was a lot of talk both on blogs and in the investment community etcetera that the price points that you initially came out with for those two products were high. I assume that your marketing department decided that these were the right places to go, and you can always lower prices. What have you learned between last February when those products were just coming out and today that could help you price some of these products a little more appropriately upfront, it just seems like phones sort of like movies do well over the long-term basis and how their first weekend sort of goes. And if they get this priced upfront, it might be a little harder to make up for it later on. So I’m wondering on the marketing department have you made any changes - are there any changes in personnel, or there any changes in thought process in terms of how to price some of these novel new types of things as you do roll out some new products?

In both places, we see a lot of interest but believe it or not, the traction is actually greater for the webtop capabilities with the enterprise than it is with consumers. And what you will see us do is actually recognize that the pricing of our initial devices were little higher and you will see us introduce two tiers of laptops, lap docks rather. One in the lower tier to address the consumer needs and another higher tier to address the enterprise needs which the customers there are little less sensitive to pricing and much more careful about the capabilities that they receive. So I think that you will see us responding to that.
There are two other things clearly I think you alluded to the marketing of webtop and lap dock in our opinion and all the research that we have done is continues to indicate that it was a very differentiated capability. We think that we can market that and deliver the message better the next time we have understood the messaging and the particular connection that that best combination has for consumers. And I think we will do that much better going forward. We have much better resolution on the feature set on what was thought as the hardware that touchpad wasn’t resonating quite as much, the keyboard wasn’t sounds to be quite as good. We have very granular understanding of what new things we need to do here Ehud, and I think you would see us deliver on that.

It will be almost exclusively and international launch. What has resonated so strongly? There are two things that are resonated very strongly with that product. One, is the ratio of glass to the front surface area. And the second has been the light proof proposition. In Europe there was another factor I think which is the price point hit the very sweet spot where the volume happens in Europe. Those three things drove the European sales. In Latin America light proof and the form factor really resonated and with DEFY plus all we do is keep the same form factor but upgrade the software and some of the processor and some of the components. And we believe that that will continue to do well in the marketplace.
In terms of enterprise, we have - with acquisition of 3LM, we have the full mobile device management software which enables any CIO to provision any Android device, not just ours, ours, HTCs, Sony Ericsson, LG and others. I believe Samsung is the only exception to that rule today. They get provision of any Android device using this software. Within our clients we have a very well tested email client. We have security, we have remote wipe, we have compliance to - I believe about 160 enterprise features which is not found on a standard Android device. Your ability to turn off Bluetooth, your ability to turn off camera, all of these capabilities we will deliver.
Beyond that we are looking at integrating with video - with Polycom and others videoconferencing capability. We have integrated very good document opening and document management capability. And there are few other things that we are very focused on delivering. But we have spent a lot of time with CIOs of Fortune 500 companies to understand from and what they believe is essential for us to win. And I think we’re very focused in delivering all of those experiences.

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today for the first Motorola Mobility earnings call. After 2 plus years of planning and a lot of hard work by employees from around the world, Motorola separated into 2 publicly traded companies on January 4, 2011. As an independent company, we will focus on growth as we transform the organization by strengthening our team the new talented leadership delivering differentiated products and services and leveraging the Motorola brand name. 
Our brand will represent a simple message, that by making technology intuitive and easy to use and enabling consumers to connect with people and things that matter to them, we can simplify and enrich people's lives. Our growth will be driven by smartphones, tablets and, over time, converged experiences in the home and on the go. As we innovate and grow, we plan to leverage our cost structure, achieve full-year operating profitability in mobile devices in 2011 and improve our overall annual operating margin to 8% to 12% over the longer-term. With that, I will comment on our fourth quarter business result and then discuss opportunities for growth and strategic priorities. Following that, Mark will discuss our financial results in more detail and our guidance. 
Fourth quarter revenues and operating earnings grew sequentially and year-on-year. On total revenues of $3.4 billion, we generated a non-GAAP operating profit of $146 million compared to a loss in the year-ago quarter and we generated $225 million in cash from operation. In mobile devices, we shipped 4.9 million smartphones in the quarter, bringing our total to 13.7 million for the year. On a non-GAAP basis, mobile devices generated an operating profit of $56 million. In fourth quarter, we launched 7 new smartphones in markets around the world, including the DROID Pro, DROID 2 Global, BRAVO and DEFY. This brought our total smartphones launches last year to 23. North America accounted for 63% of our total revenue compared to 69% in the fourth quarter of 2009. Demand for DROID 2 and DROID X continued to be strong. Sales of midrange smartphones, including BRAVO and DEFY was solid, but slightly below our expectations. 
At side of North America, smartphone shipment grew by over 50% sequentially and accounted for over 30% of total smartphone units. In China, our second largest market, we saw very strong sequential growth in the quarter. During the year, we introduced over 20 smartphones, including the XP800 with China Telecom, several phone devices with China Mobile and a refreshed lineup introduced under our main brand. For the full-year, we shipped nearly 2 million smartphones across the 3 network operators. 
In Latin America as well as in certain markets in Europe, fourth quarter smartphone volumes were also higher sequentially, led by sales of DEFY and other midrange smartphones. Globally, we have deployed BLUR enabled devices to over 40 carriers and we have approximately 6 million subscribers. This service, which provides consumers with push Internet content and operated with network-efficient devices, continues to be an integral part of differentiation strategy. During the quarter, we acquired Zecter, our fifth acquisition of innovative software technology in 2010. But integrating capabilities into BLUR, we will enable consumers to enjoy on-demand access to the additional media across multiple devices and provide enhanced content security. 
Shifting now to this year. We began 2011 with the announcement of 3 new smartphones and our first tablet. This included the ATRIX 4G, which was initially launched with AT&T and subsequently with Bell Canada, Orange and others. For Verizon, we announced the DROID BIONIC, our first LTE smartphone, and XOOM, the first tablet on Honeycomb, an Android release designed specifically to deliver a unique tablet experience. 
Each of these devices inspired by leading edge dual core processor providing 2 gigahertz of processing power. Feedback on these new devices has been very positive and includes a variety of awards at the recent Consumer Electronics Show. The ATRIX 4G and the upgradable version of XOOM will which begin to ship by the end of the February. The LTE version of XOOM and DROID BIONIC is expected to ship in the second quarter. From a broader portfolio perspective, our growth this year will be driven by compelling product growth map. 
First, smartphones. In North America, we will focus on smartphones as the leading edge technology that delivers the best consumer and enterprise experience as possible. In China, smartphone demand is growing rapidly in midrange devices as well as in highest height year. We will continue to address both segments and all deployed technologies in China. 
In Latin America, we see the opportunity for growth predominantly in midrange smartphones. And for the near term, we will address opportunities in Europe in select markets as we did in 2010.  To serve consumer's meeting enterprise functionality, we will continue to deliver retail on top of Android that provides security capabilities essential to CIOs. With DROID Pro and other high-performance smartphones, we'll provide the enterprise-ready alternative these consumers have been looking for. 
From a feature phone and voice-centric device's perspective, we will continue to be focused on a limited number of devices to address the basic market opportunity. We will continue to refresh the portfolio for our U.S. and international customer. Finally, the convergence of mobility and computing opens up a new area of growth for us. The HS 4G smartphone with docking accessories and the XOOM tablet as a first example of how we are beginning to address this opportunity. 
HS 4G is more than just a high-performance smartphone. When combined with this unique docking accessories and enabled by our proprietary Webtop application, it enables enhanced and more interactive experiences. For example, paired with a laptop dock, consumers can have the large screen experience for consumption of HD content, editing documents and browsing the web. The XOOM tablet provides best-in-class performance, HD display and rich graphic. It opens up new and innovative services and takes media consumption and gaming to a new level. 
 
Growing for profitability in smartphones and tablets is building our momentum and differentiating our devices. We intend to do this by staying at leading edge hardware innovation by providing unique services and experience that includes social collaboration, content management and delivery and cloud storage and by integrating essential enterprise capabilities on top of the fastest growing mobile platform. Consistently executing and this set of priorities in conjunction with our brand, intellectual property and carrier relationship is what will set us apart, enable our growth and drive operating profit improvements in mobile devices. 
Now, turning to Home. Fourth quarter total revenues were up sequentially, reflecting solid demand for HD and DVR set-tops. From product portfolio perspective, we launched the industry's highest density upstream DOCSIS solution and the next generation IP set-top for the Europe market, extending our leadership position in IPTV. We also expanded our software solution suite with the introduction of our Edge Home Center. This cloud-based solution enables consumers to manage their home network, mobile devices and services from home or remotely. 
During the quarter, we acquired For Home, the developer of a software platform for managed services in the home. By integrating their capabilities with our cloud-based media service management software portfolio, we can begin to enable consumer converged experiences that include home and energy management, security, monitoring and control.  
Looking back at 2010, macroeconomic conditions in U.S. provided a headwind for the industry. After a challenging start of the year, we began to see demand for our set-top boxes stabilize in the second half. And infrastructure revenue grew last year as operating short hour solutions for the network capacity and advanced services. 
Overall, the team performed well in a difficult environment and holding share in our priority market, including innovative products, reducing cost while continuing to invest in future technology and improving profitability. 
As we look ahead in Home, we expect a mid-single-digit CAGR for the industry over the next several year as economic conditions improve and demand recovers. That said, in 2011, we expect industry demand to be relatively flat compared to 2010. Our priorities would include sustaining our leadership in advanced set-tops and gateways and prioritizing our investment and in IP-based home solutions, next generation content delivery, cloud-based services and multiscreen experiences. 
In addition, we plan to continue to improve operating margin as we further streamline our product portfolio and manage our cost. I'll turn the call over now to Marc to provide additional details on financial results for the quarter and our guidance. Marc?"

On a GAAP basis, fourth quarter operating",1482,"Thanks, Sanjay. Motorola Mobility revenues were $3.4 billion in the quarter, up 16% sequentially and up 21% from the fourth quarter of 2009. For the full-year, revenues were $11.5 billion, up 4% compared to 2009. On a GAAP basis, fourth quarter operating earnings were $126 million. Non-GAAP adjustments for operating earnings were net expense of $20 million. This includes stock compensation and intangible assets amortization expense of $57 million and a restructuring charge of $18 million, offset by income of $55 million related to an IP seller. 
Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating earnings were $146 million compared to $80 million in the third quarter and a loss of $46 million in the year-ago quarter. For the full year, we generated operating earnings on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis compared to a significant loss incurred in 2009. On a per-share basis, using 294.3 million shares outstanding, we reported fourth quarter GAAP net earnings of $0.27 per share compared to a loss of $0.69 per share in the year-ago quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter net earnings were $0.37 per share compared to a loss of $0.24 per share in the fourth quarter of 2009. 
Further details on our non-GAAP results are included in our today's press release and available on our website. My remaining income statement references will be on a non-GAAP basis. Our overall gross margin percentage in the quarter was 27%, comparable with the third quarter and up from 25.5% in the fourth quarter of 2009. For the full year, we improved gross margin percentage to 26.2% from 19.9% in 2009. This was driven primarily by shifting our mix to higher margins smartphones from lower margin feature phones and improved supply chain efficiencies. In addition, Home gross margin increased driven by improved product mix and product cost reduction action. 
Total operating expenses in the quarter were up 8% sequentially. The increase was driven primarily by sales and marketing expenses to support business growth and new product introductions in mobile devices. Compared to 2009, total OpEx for the quarter and the full year were comparable. Total net interest expense in the quarter was $12 million, reflecting an allocation of net interest cost from our former parent company. 
Turning now to our business segments. In mobile devices, fourth quarter revenues were $2.4 billion, up 33% year-over-year. Total shipments were 11.3 million units, including 4.9 million smartphones. As we anticipated, our overall OFP declined to $214 compared to $223 in the third quarter. This was driven by midrange devices, representing a larger portion of our total smartphone volume. For the full-year, mobile device revenues were $7.8 billion, up 9% compared to 2009, driven by the shipment of 13.7 million smartphones compared to 2 million in 2009. 
In Mobile Devices, we generated a $56 million operating profit in the quarter compared to a $3 million profit in the third quarter of 2010. Our sequential improvement was driven by higher smartphone volumes offset by higher sales and marketing expenses. For the full-year, with growth in smartphones, improvement in gross margin and tight control over our operating expenses, we reduced mobile devices operating loss of the full-year to $198 million from $924 million in 2009. 
Now in the Home business. Fourth quarter revenues were $1 billion, up 10% sequentially and 1% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, set-top revenue was up 21%, offset partially by slightly lower infrastructure sales. For the full year, revenue in our home business was $3.6 billion, down 7% from 2009. Sales of consumer premise equipment were lower, partially offset by 30% increase in video and asset infrastructure. Infrastructure accounted for 25% of our total home revenues compared to 18% in 2009. 
Operating margin the quarter for home increased to 9% from 7.1% in the fourth quarter of last year and, for the full year, operating margin also improved 7.5% from 5% in 2009. This improvement was driven by product mix and a reduction in operating cost. 
Moving now to the balance sheet. At separation, we received $3.2 billion in cash from Motorola. As planned, we expect to receive an additional $300 million once certain cash repatriation activities are completed over time by our former parent company. Approximately 1/3 of our cash outside the states, primarily used to capitalize and fund the working capital of our international business. On Page 16 of our site presentation, you'll see our year end balance sheet on a GAAP and pro forma basis. 
In the pro forma view, we have a corporate casual Motorola to give you another view as to our balance sheet position as we made into the new year. We continue to make good progress in working capital management in both the mobile devices and home businesses. Inventory year end was down slightly from third quarter. Our days sales inventory improved sequentially to 30 days from 36 days. 
Accounts receivable was essentially flat with the third quarter and days sales outstanding declined sequentially to 41 days from 48 days. Our overall SaaS conversion cycle improved sequentially to 10 days and this compares to 13 days at the end of 2009. 
In the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $225 million, our sixth consecutive quarter of positive cash flow. For the full year, we generated $606 million in operating cash flows. This compares to an outflow in 2009 of over $1.1 billion. Finally, in recent weeks, we completed a $500 million three-year unsecured credit facility, 10 leading banks committed to these facilities with favorable terms and conditions. 
Turning now to our outlook for the first quarter. As we indicated last December, given seasonality in the United States and improved competitive conditions in the U.S. smartphone market, we expect operating earnings for Motorola Mobility to be in the range around break even. In mobile devices, we expect significant growth in smartphones and total revenue compared to first quarter of 2010. We also expect an operating loss significantly below the year-ago quarter. 
In home, compared to the first quarter of 2010, we expect slightly higher revenues and higher operating margin. A per share basis for Motorola Mobility, we expect to incur a net loss in the range of $26 million to $62 million, equivalent to a loss of $0.09 to $0.21 per share. This loss includes a provision for income taxes of approximately $25 million, which I will explain in more detail in a moment. 
Now I would like to provide the following color for full-year 2011. In mobile devices, we expect revenue growth this year to be driven by the shipment of 20 million to 23 million smartphones and tablet devices combined. In our home business, we expect revenues in 2011 to be comparable to 2010. For the company, research and development and general and administrative costs spend would be very tightly manage. Sales and marketing will increase in mobile devices to support a product introduction and grow our top line. 
We expect total stock compensation and intangible amortization expenses to approximate $55 million per quarter comparable with 2010. From an operating profit perspective for the full year, we expect low single-digit operating margin in mobile devices, a significant improvement compared to the operating loss last year. In home, we expect slight operating margin improvement for 2011 compared to 2010. Below operating income, we expect approximately $10 million in net expenses each quarter. This includes a cost associated with foreign currency management and exchange rate fluctuation, partially offset by modest interest income in our cash and cash equivalents. 
With respect to income taxes, we anticipate an ongoing annual effective tax rate for the full year of approximately 30%. Given our expected geographic distribution of operating profits and losses in 2011, we expect some volatility in the fourth of the tax rate as compared to our projected annual rate. This is due to tax expense on foreign earned income, which for now cannot be offset by tax benefits on U.S. operating results. As a result, we plan to provide you with an estimate of our expected income tax provision for the upcoming quarter on each of our earnings calls. 
In the first quarter, we expect a tax provision of approximately $25 million, as I just mentioned. Overtime, as we achieve normalized earning levels across our various geographies and we're able to utilize our deferred tax asset, we expect a lower annual tax rate. Finally, with regards to share counts, as of January 4, we have 294 million basic shares outstanding and approximately 305 million shares on a fully diluted basis. Through the balance of the year, we anticipate only a modest increase in share count. 
The segment and consolidated earnings guidance we have provided today is on a non-GAAP basis and excludes stock-based compensation expense intangible asset amortization and items so much as those historically highlighted in our quarterly earnings result. With that, I will turn the call back over to Dean to start the Q&A."

At T-Mobile, as you know, at Verizon, as well as AT&T, we have midrange smartphones and we had anticipated, as a result of availability of tiered data pricing, that there will be accelerated take-up of midtier phones. Actually, what we continue to see was that, that was not the case and that consumers continue to buy high tiered smartphones like DROID X and I think that was actually the fact that I referred to in my script. With respect to the second part of your question about marketing dollars, I anticipate that there will be actually quite a lot of excitement around ATRIX 4G as you saw at CES and we are certainly looking to support our products but we are also looking to leverage the pull from our carriers without being specific about the support. As you know, we have a very good continuing relationship with Verizon and I think they continue to view the DROID franchise as being a very important franchise for them. So we will certainly continue to participate and work closely with Verizon, but we will diversify our portfolio in the United States with AT&T and others, and I have no reason for believing that there is not going to be support. The levels,  I think, I probably can't comment with precision at the moment. But certainly, given the quality of our portfolio, we are looking to support our portfolio in the marketplace."

Certainly, since the announcement of iPhone, we have seen a little slowdown in our of our sell-through of our devices because there's clearly anticipation of some devices coming through Verizon, so we have seen that affect even prior to the iPhone launching. But I think we continue to feel that when the door swings occur, consumers coming to Verizon stores, that being offered the choices that they're being offered by Verizon. Because the fundamental principle that Verizon has stuck to is that they want to offer choices to their consumers. As the consumers come into the store, they will see a choice and I think time will tell as to what percentage of those doors swings actually translates to which brand purchase. But I think that we have seen some slowdown as a result of the announcement from Verizon. With respect to color around 20 million to 23 million units this year, clearly, vas t majority of that will be smartphones. In the United States, our focus will continue to be at the high-end. But I anticipate that the midtier market in Latin America and China will become more important for us and there will be continued growth there. I think in Europe, which also is a little more of a midtier marketplace, we have seen good traction with DEFY and we will continue to introduce products to support that further. I would say one other thing. As you know, we have had a team in China, which has been very focused on what we call MMCP, mass market consumer products, or voice-centric feature phones, and they contributed in 2010 in stabilizing our feature phone shipment in second half. As we go through 2011, will shift focus for that team towards low and midtier smartphones. So I anticipate that they will be able to support some volume shipments for us in Latin America and China and Europe where midtier is much more important part of the marketplace. For tablets, I think, clearly, we have a very compelling product. As you know, there was a lot of excitement around that product and we will launch that product at Verizon in February and with Honeycomb and some of the new innovative services that you will see there, we're excited about that product. But it is really, at the moment, a little too early to be precise about how much volume that may lead to us, either in the first quarter or through the year. I would say that in second half of the year, you will see us introduce tablets, 7-inch, and based on the form factor and we anticipate that that will further support our growth into tablets and converge computing devices."

We have a good relationship with Verizon and continued good relationship with Verizon there. In terms of diversification in U.S., you've seen the launch or at least the announcement of ATRIX 4G at AT&T, you'll see a diversified in retail channel as well as with other carriers in the U.S. So I think if you look at our international diversification, even the fourth quarter results shows the growth in our shipments of smartphones and China and Latin America and to a certain extent, in Europe. And I think that in 2011, I think we will have a much greater focus and diversification and growth in our shipments in these regions. So already, I think you've seen that.

Most of the devices follow at the trailing edge and their -- our ability to use our own software capability, use enterprise capability, use multimedia everywhere and use phone diagnostics and device diagnostics, I think actually enables us to differentiate. In midtier, brand, channel distribution, become more important. So I actually -- of course, we use Android operating environment and we have a great partnership with Google and dependence. But in midtier, actually, I think the factors that enable success are more varied. In leading edge, you have to be one of the first of every fast follower and then the this release of software in midtier, the dynamic is slightly different.

In the foreign operations, we're generating profits in many of our subsidiaries because of our manufacturing operations and our distribution centers. In the U.S., we're not going to be able to take the benefit on the operating losses that we may be incurring early in the year. So in fact, because of the operating losses that we've had historically, it's created these NOLs that we're carrying forward and some other attributes with the separation. So overall, when the financial profile of Mobility improves, we'll be able to take advantage of those NOLs. But today, a lot of the profits of the company are going to be offshore. But again, as the earnings improve overall, we'll be able to benefit from the fact that we have significant tax NOLs inside the U.S. operations. So what we'll do is, for the full year, I was prepared to give guidance today that we expect the number to be approximately 30% for the full year and I'll be able to give quarterly guidance in terms of our expectations, the exact number, and today it's $25 million.

I think this 3.0 is probably innovative, if not more innovative than what the 2.0 delivered in Android ecosystem. And you will recall that 2.0 became the vehicle which drove the growth for Android. So I think that the amount of work, the number of innovative things that are going on here are quite large and, therefore, we of course demoed only a small number of things when we demoed it at CES. I'm pretty confident that you will see some very good applications and services, but I should also say that in working with Google, we will continue to add new services to this device through course of it. And of course, all of these XOOM 3G tablets are upgradable to 4G. The Verizon 3G tablets are upgradable to 4G LTE. So anyone who acquires these in February or March will be able to upgrade it to 4G.

And maybe a quick one for Dan. We've been waiting for many years for Motorola to make a bigger portion to internationalize the sales of Home.

If you look at the last couple of years, we've had a relatively stable percentage of business inside the U.S. versus outside. I continue to believe that as the video business model evolves outside North America, we will continue to see new opportunities we can chase. Certainly, there has been some consolidation in Latin America of the traditional cable properties, which has created some new opportunities. China remains a very fragmented market around video distribution and as that begins to sort itself through, it should create some new opportunities. And Western Europe has had spotty opportunities over the last few years that we believe has the general economy in Western Europe improves in many countries create new opportunities.

My anticipation is that the margins in the tablet business, by and large, would be lower than the performance tier or higher tier of smartphone marketplace. And of course, remember that even the tablet business will get segmented into 2 kind of broad categories. One is whether it's 3G or 4G or not, and the second will be of course whether it's a WiFi. That's the best one segmentation. I'm sorry, let me start again. One is whether it's 3G, 4G versus WiFi and second is whether it's 7, 8, 10 or 11-inch. This size will make a difference. So let me just -- by way of illustration, say, that the 7-inch WiFi tablet obviously would carry much smaller gross margin than a 10-inch 4G tablet will. So that's 1 factor. But by and large, I would say that the tablet business, because meaningful portion of it will go through retail, will be lower gross margin business. I would say there is uncertainty in my mind as to how carriers will deal with tablets. I think, again, I think if I have to say clearly as they get a two-year subscription, there is much greater willingness the subscribe. But it's not clear what portion of tablet sales will go through, will have the growth subscription. So far, with you seen around 50% of the tablets tend to be WiFi tablets. So there's certainly as to on average, what level of subsidy will be there on tablets. So i don't know if I -- sorry to confuse, but those are the factors that will be in play. I think that China will also be quite important there."

Clearly, as I said to you. We have 6 million subscribers in MOTOBLUR. What that allows us to do is have the very good understanding, for instance, of what is the battery life experience that our consumers are seeing. We have a distribution of battery life across all of our consumer base. We have a better understanding what experience do people get if they download certain applications. As you know, the marketplace is quite open and there is 1 application in particular that I've been using, which has crashed quite often and that impacts consumers experiences. Having some visibility to that, allows us to help consumers. If you look up to this point, 30% of the smartphone base is speaking, in smartphone, the vast majority of people who are still using feature phones come to this marketplace. I think having an ability to connect with them and to help them manage their device will be a very important thing. 70% of our returns are no found and we still -- not just us, but I think nobody in our industry yet knows why those returns come back. And I think our ability to withstand with goes on the phone and for instance, we have accelerometer, if the phone comes back and we see unusual readings in the accelerometer, it allows us to understand what went on in the phone. So I think that is 1 aspect of what most of the allows us to do. The second aspect of course, you've seen the social networking. But I think you should think of it more broadly as being able to understand what consumers like and being able to push information that they care about on their own screen. And this, of course, relies very strongly in our ability to figure out what consumers want. If we get that wrong, it becomes very,  very quickly. So it's something that will take a lot of time. We've made some acquisitions of companies who do good work in this area. So I think that's a couple of important things, but other things fits into the scheme. But enterprise, i think is a very important part of our differentiation strategy. We have focused the result of our convergence with and delivering multimedia everywhere support part very important part of our strategy. The other things, but what will become clearer and we'll talk a little more about it in the Mobile World Congress. I think that being able to connect with our consumers and understand their needs and preferences is an important part of our strategy. With respect to Honeycomb, I have no commitment or guarantee of what will be our lead. Certainly, working very, very closely as we have done with Google gives us some advantages in performance as well as close working relationship. And I think as a result of which we anticipate that will have some lead in the marketplace. But there's really no great guarantee that, that lead to be very large. We would have to compete in the marketplace, a lot of other people have access to do will core processors. But I think this industry and marketplace is changing fast enough that some of the software differentiation that I talked about will make a difference very quickly in this market."

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today for the first Motorola Mobility earnings call. After 2-plus years of planning and a lot of hard work by employees from around the world, Motorola is separated into 2 publicly traded companies on January 4, 2011. As an independent company, we will focus on growth as we transform the organization by strengthening our team with new talented leadership delivering differentiated products and services and leveraging the Motorola brand name. 
Our brand will represent a simple message, that by making technology intuitive and easy to use, and enabling consumers to connect with people and things that matter to them, we can simplify and enrich people's lives. Our growth will be driven by smartphones, tablets, and over time, converged experiences in the home and on the go. As we innovate and grow, we plan to leverage our cost structure, achieve full year operating profitability in mobile devices in 2011 and improve our overall annual operating margin to 8% to 12% over the longer term. With that, I will comment on our fourth quarter business result and then discuss opportunities for growth and strategic priorities. Following that, Mark will discuss our financial results in more detail and our guidance. 
Fourth quarter revenues and operating earnings grew sequentially and year-on-year. On total revenues of $3.4 billion, we generated a non-GAAP operating profit of $146 million compared to a loss in the year-ago quarter, and we generated $225 million in cash from operation. In mobile devices, we shipped 4.9 million smartphones in the quarter, bringing our total to 13.7 million for the year. On a non-GAAP basis, mobile devices generated an operating profit of $56 million. In fourth quarter, we launched 7 new smartphones in markets around the world, including the DROID Pro, DROID 2 Global, BRAVO and DEFY. This brought our total smartphone launches last year to 23. 
North America accounted for 63% of our total revenue compared to 69% in the fourth quarter of 2009. Demand for DROID 2 and DROID X continued to be strong. Sales of midrange smartphones, including BRAVO and DEFY was solid, but slightly below our expectations. Aside from North America, smartphone shipments grew by over 50% sequentially and accounted for over 30% of total smartphone units. In China, our second largest market, we saw very strong sequential growth in the quarter. During the year, we introduced over 20 smartphones, including the XP800 with China Telecom, several OPhone devices with China Mobile and a refreshed lineup introduced under our main brand. For the full year, we shipped nearly 2 million smartphones across the 3 network operators.
In Latin America, as well as in certain markets in Europe, fourth quarter smartphone volumes were also higher sequentially, led by sales of DEFY and other midrange smartphones. Globally, we have deployed BLUR-enabled devices to over 40 carriers and we have approximately 6 million subscribers. This service, which provides consumers with push Internet content and operated with network-efficient devices, continues to be an integral part of our differentiation strategy. During the quarter, we acquired Vector, our fifth acquisition of innovative software technology in 2010. By integrating Vector's capabilities into BLUR, we will enable consumers to enjoy on-demand access to the additional media across multiple devices and provide enhanced content security. 
Shifting now to this year. We began 2011 with the announcement of 3 new smartphones and our first tablet. This included the ATRIX 4G, which will initially launch with AT&T and subsequently with Bell Canada, Orange and others. For Verizon, we announced the DROID BIONIC, our first LTE smartphone, and XOOM, the first tablet on Honeycomb, an Android release designed specifically to deliver a unique tablet experience. 
Each of these devices inspired by a leading edge dual-core processor providing 2 gigahertz of processing power. Feedback on these new devices has been very positive and includes a variety of awards at the recent Consumer Electronics Show. The ATRIX 4G and the upgradable version of XOOM, which we'll begin to ship by the end of the February. The LTE version of XOOM and DROID BIONIC are expected to ship in the second quarter. From a broader portfolio perspective, our growth this year will be driven by compelling product growth map. 
First, smartphones. In North America, we will focus on smartphones as the leading edge technology that delivers the best consumer and enterprise experience as possible. In China, smartphone demand is growing rapidly in midrange devices, as well as in the high tier. We will continue to address both segments and all deployed technologies in China. 
In Latin America, we see the opportunity for growth predominantly in midrange smartphones. And for the near term, we will address opportunities in Europe in select markets as we did in 2010. To serve consumers needing enterprise functionality, we will continue to deliver retail features on top of Android that provides security capabilities essential to CIOs. With DROID Pro and other high-performance smartphones, we'll provide the enterprise-ready alternative these consumers have been looking for. 
From a feature phone and voice-centric devices perspective, we will continue to be focused on a limited number of devices to address the basic market opportunities. In iDEN, we'll continue to refresh the portfolio for our U.S. and international customers. 
Finally, the convergence of mobility and computing opens up a new area of growth for us. The ATRIX 4G smartphone with docking accessories and the XOOM tablet are the first examples of how we are beginning to address this opportunity. ATRIX 4G is more than just a high-performance smartphone. When combined with this unique docking accessories and enabled by our proprietary Webtop application, it enables and enhance a more interactive experiences. For example, paired with a laptop dock, consumers can have the large screen experience for consumption of HD content, editing documents and browsing the web. The XOOM tablet provides best-in-class performance, HD display enrich graphics. It opens up new and innovative services and takes media consumption and gaming to a new level. 
 
Growing for profitability in smartphones and tablets is possible by building on our momentum and differentiating our devices. We intend to do this by staying at the leading-edge hardware innovation; by providing unique services and experience that includes social collaboration, content management and delivery and cloud storage and by integrating essential enterprise capabilities on top of the fastest growing mobile platform. Consistently executing and this set of priorities in conjunction with our brand, intellectual property and carrier relationship is what will set us apart, enable our growth and drive operating profit improvements in mobile devices. 
Now turning to Home. Fourth quarter total revenues were up sequentially, reflecting solid demand for HD and DVR set-top. From a product portfolio perspective, we launched the industry's highest density upstream DOCSIS solution and a next-generation IP set-top for the Europe market, extending our leadership position in IPTV. We also expanded our software solution suite with the introduction of our EDGE Home Center. This cloud-based solution enables consumers to manage their home network, mobile devices and services from home or remotely. 
During the quarter, we acquired 4Home, the developer of a software platform for managed services in the home. By integrating their capabilities with our cloud-based media service manager software portfolio, we can begin to enable consumer converged experiences, that include home energy management, security, monitoring and control.  
Looking back at 2010, macroeconomic conditions in U.S. provided a headwind for the industry. After a challenging start to the year, we began to see demand for our set-top boxes stabilize in the second half. In infrastructure, revenue grew last year as operator showed us solutions for the network capacity and advanced services. Overall, the team performed well in a difficult environment by holding share in our priority market, including innovative products, reducing cost while continuing to invest in future technology and improving profitability. 
As we look ahead in Home, we expect a mid-single-digit CAGR for the industry over the next several years, as economic conditions improve and demand recovers. That said, in 2011, we expect industry demand to be relatively flat compared to 2010. Our priorities will include sustaining our leadership in advanced set-tops and gateways and prioritizing our investment in IP-based home solutions, next generation content delivery, cloud-based services and multiscreen experiences. In addition, we plan to continue to improve operating margin as we further streamline our product portfolio and manage our cost. 
I'll turn the call over now to Marc to provide additional details on financial results for the quarter and our guidance. Marc?"

Motorola Mobility revenues were $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up 16% sequentially and up 21% from the fourth quarter of 2009. For the full year, revenues were $11.5 billion, up 4% compared to 2009. On a GAAP basis, fourth quarter operating earnings were $126 million. Non-GAAP adjustments for operating earnings were net expense of $20 million. This includes stock compensation and intangible assets amortization expense of $57 million and a restructuring charge of $18 million, offset by income of $55 million related to an IP seller. 
Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating earnings were $146 million compared to $80 million in the third quarter and a loss of $46 million in the year-ago quarter. For the full year, we generated operating earnings on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis compared to the significant loss incurred in 2009. On a per share basis, using 294.3 million shares outstanding, we reported fourth quarter GAAP net earnings of $0.27 per share compared to a loss of $0.69 per share in the year-ago quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter net earnings were $0.37 per share compared to a loss of $0.24 per share in the fourth quarter of 2009. Further details on our non-GAAP results are included in our today's press release and available on our website. 
My remaining income statement references will be on a non-GAAP basis. Our overall gross margin percentage in the quarter was 27%, comparable with the third quarter and up from 25.5% in the fourth quarter of 2009. For the full year, we improved gross margin percentage to 26.2% from 19.9% in 2009. This was driven primarily by shifting our mix to higher margins smartphones from lower margin feature phones, and improved supply chain efficiencies. In addition, Home gross margin increased driven by improved product mix and product cost reduction actions. 
Total operating expenses in the quarter were up 8% sequentially. The increase was driven primarily by sales and marketing expenses to support business growth and new product introductions in mobile devices. Compared to 2009, total OpEx for the quarter and the full year were comparable. Total net interest expense in the quarter was $12 million, reflecting an allocation of net interest cost from our former parent company. 
Turning now to our business segments. In Mobile Devices, fourth quarter revenues were $2.4 billion, up 33% year-over-year. Total shipments were 11.3 million units, including 4.9 million smartphones. As we anticipated, our overall ASP declined to $214 compared to $223 in the third quarter. This was driven by midrange devices, representing a larger portion of our total smartphone volume. For the full year, Mobile Device revenues were $7.8 billion, up 9% compared to 2009, driven by the shipment of 13.7 million smartphones compared to 2 million in 2009. 
In Mobile Devices, we generated a $56 million operating profit in the quarter compared to a $3 million profit in the third quarter of 2010. Our sequential improvement was driven by higher smartphone volumes offset partially by higher sales and marketing expenses. For the full year, with growth in smartphones, improvement in gross margin and tight control over our operating expenses, we reduced mobile devices operating loss for the full year to $198 million from $924 million in 2009. 
Now in the Home business. Fourth quarter revenues were $1 billion, up 10% sequentially and 1% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, set-top revenue was up 21%, offset partially by slightly lower infrastructure sales. For the full year, revenue in our Home business was $3.6 billion, down 7% from 2009. Sales of consumer equipment were lower, partially offset by 30% increase in video and asset infrastructure. Infrastructure accounted for 25% of our total home revenues compared to 18% in 2009. Operating margin in the quarter for Home increased to 9% from 7.1% in the fourth quarter of last year. And for the full year, operating margin also improved 7.5% from 5% in 2009. This improvement was driven by product mix and a reduction in operating cost. 
Moving now to the balance sheet. At separation, we received a $3.2 billion in cash from Motorola. As planned, we expect to receive an additional $300 million once certain cash repatriation activities are completed over time by our former parent company. Approximately 1/3 of our cash outside the United States was primarily used to capitalize and fund the working capital need of our international business. On Page 16 of our slide presentation, you'll see our year-end balance sheet on a GAAP and pro forma basis. In the pro forma view, we've incorporated the cash from Motorola to give you another view as to our balance sheet position as we head into the new year. 
We continue to make good progress in working capital management in both the Mobile Devices and Home businesses. Inventory at year end was down slightly from third quarter, and our days sales inventory improved sequentially to 30 days from 36 days.  Accounts receivable was essentially flat with the third quarter and days sales outstanding declined sequentially to 41 days from 48 days. Our overall SaaS conversion cycle improved sequentially to 10 days, and this compares to 13 days at the end of 2009. 
In the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $225 million, our sixth consecutive quarter of positive cash flow. For the full year, we generated $606 million in operating cash flows. This compares to an outflow in 2009 of over $1.1 billion. Finally, in recent weeks, we completed a $500 million 3-year unsecured credit facility, 10 leading banks committed to this facility with favorable terms and conditions. 
Turning now to our outlook for the first quarter. As we indicated last December, given seasonality in the United States and improved competitive conditions in the U.S. smartphone market, we expect operating earnings for Motorola Mobility to be in the range around breakeven. In Mobile Devices, we expect significant growth in smartphones and total revenue compared to first quarter of 2010. We also expect an operating loss significantly below the year-ago quarter. 
In Home, compared to the first quarter of 2010, we expect slightly higher revenues and higher operating margin. A per share basis for Motorola Mobility, we expect to incur a net loss in the range of $26 million to $62 million, equivalent to a loss of $0.09 to $0.21 per share. This loss includes a provision for income taxes of approximately $25 million, which I will explain in more detail in a moment. 
Now I would like to provide the following color for full year 2011. In mobile devices, we expect revenue growth this year to be driven by the shipment of 20 million to 23 million smartphones and tablet devices combined. In our Home business, we expect revenues in 2011 to be comparable to 2010. For the company, research and development and general and administrative costs spend will be very tightly manage. Sales and marketing will increase in mobile devices to support new product introduction and grow our top line. We expect total stock compensation and intangible amortization expenses to approximate $55 million per quarter comparable with 2010. 
From an operating profit perspective for the full year, we expect low-single-digit operating margin in mobile devices, a significant improvement compared to the operating loss last year. In Home, we expect slight operating margin improvement for 2011 compared to 2010. Below operating income, we expect approximately $10 million in net expenses each quarter. This includes cost associated with foreign currency management and exchange rate fluctuation, partially offset by modest interest income and our cash and cash equivalents. 
With respect to income taxes, we anticipate an ongoing annual effective tax rate for the full year of approximately 30%. Given our expected geographic distribution of operating profits and losses in 2011, we expect some volatility in the quarterly tax rate as compared to our projected annual rate. This is due to tax expense on foreign earned income, which for now, cannot be offset by tax benefits on U.S. operating results. As a result, we plan to provide you with an estimate of our expected income tax provision for the upcoming quarter on each of our earnings calls. 
In the first quarter, we expect a tax provision of approximately $25 million, as I just mentioned. Over time, as we achieve normalized earning levels across our various geographies and we are able to utilize our deferred tax asset, we expect a lower annual tax rate. Finally, with regards to share counts, as of January 4, we had 294 million basic shares outstanding and approximately 305 million shares on a fully diluted basis. Through the balance of the year, we anticipate only a modest increase in share count. 
The segment and consolidated earnings guidance we have provided today is on a non-GAAP basis where applicable and excludes stock-based compensation expense intangible asset amortization and items similar to those historically highlighted in our quarterly earnings result. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Dean to start the Q&A."

And then more importantly, as we look at the promotional dollars associated with each new smartphone, do you think AT&T and other expanding customers for Motorola are willing to spend similar levels of advertising spending that Verizon did in the past with the original DROID, as they transition to a new device?

At T-Mobile, as you know, at Verizon, as well as AT&T, we have midrange smartphones and we had anticipated, as a result of availability of tiered data pricing, that there will be accelerated take-up of mid-tier phones. Actually, what we continue to see was that, that was not the case and that consumers continue to buy high-tiered smartphones like DROID X. And I think that was actually the fact that I referred to in my script. With respect to the second part of your question about marketing dollars, I anticipate that there will be -- there's actually quite a lot of excitement around ATRIX 4G, as you saw at CES and we are certainly looking to support our products, but we are also looking to leverage the pull from our carriers without being specific about the support. As you know, we have a  very good continuing relationship with Verizon and I think they continue to view the DROID franchise as being a very important franchise for them. So we will certainly continue to participate and work closely with Verizon, but we will diversify our portfolio in the United States with AT&T and others. And I have no reason for believing that there is not going to be support. The levels,  I think, I probably can't comment with precision at the moment. But certainly, I think, given the quality of our portfolio, we are looking to support our portfolio in the marketplace."

Certainly, since the announcement of iPhone, we have seen a little slowdown in our of our sell-through of our devices because there's clearly an anticipation of some devices coming through Verizon, so we have seen that affect even prior to the iPhone launching. But I think we continue to feel that when the door swings occur, consumers coming to Verizon stores, that being offered the choices that they're being offered by Verizon, because the fundamental principle that Verizon has stuck to is that they want to offer choices to their consumers. As the consumers come into the store, they will see a choice. And I think time will tell as to what percentage of those doors swings actually translates to which brand purchase. But I think that we have seen some slowdown as a result of the announcement from Verizon. With respect to color around 20 million to 23 million units this year, clearly, vast majority of that will be smartphones. In the United States, our focus will continue to be at the high end. But I anticipate that the mid-tier market in Latin America and China will become more important for us and there will be continued growth there. I think in Europe, which also is a little more of a mid-tier marketplace, we have seen good traction with DEFY and we'll continue to introduce products to support that further. I would say one other thing. And as you know, we've had a team in China, which has been very focused on what we call MMCP, mass market consumer products, or voice-centric feature phones. And they contributed in 2010 in stabilizing our feature phone shipment in second half. As we go through 2011, we will shift focus for that team towards low- and mid-tier smartphones. So I anticipate that they will be able to support some volume shipments for us in Latin America and China and Europe, where mid-tier is much more important part of the marketplace. For tablets, I think, clearly, we have a very compelling product. As you know, there was a lot of excitement around that product and we will launch that product at Verizon in February. And with Honeycomb and some of the new innovative services that you will see there, we're excited about that product. But it is really, at the moment, a little too early to be precise about how much volume that may lead to us, either in the first quarter or through the year. I would say that in second half of the year, you will see us introduce tablets, 7-inch, and various other form factor. And we anticipate that, that will further support our growth into tablets that converge to computing devices."

And I'm not yet convinced that Verizon will not continue to push forward with DROID as a franchise. And of course, we participate in that, others participate also, and we have a good relationship with Verizon and continued good relationship with Verizon there. In terms of diversification in U.S., you have seen the launch or at least the announcement of ATRIX 4G at AT&T, you will see us diversify in retail channel as well, as with the other carriers in the U.S. So I think if you look at our international diversification, even the fourth quarter results shows the growth in our shipments of smartphones in China and Latin America, and to a certain extent, in Europe. And I think that in 2011, I think we will have a much greater focus in diversification and growth in our shipments in these regions. So already, I think you've seen that. And then of course, with the introduction of tablet, that creates another growth area for us. And then we're actually excited about that possibility. Outside of U.S., you will see us launch WiFi tablets as well as 3G tablets in other regions also. So that creates further opportunity for us in 2011 also."

Most the devices follow at the trailing edge and their -- our ability to use our own software capability, we use BLUR, we use enterprise capability, we use multimedia anywhere and use phone diagnostics and device diagnostics, I think, actually, enables us to differentiate. In mid-tier, brand, channel distribution, become even more important. So I actually -- of course, we use Android operating environment and we have a great partnership with Google and there is that dependence. But in mid-tier, actually, I think the factors that enables success are more varied. In leading edge, you have to be one of the first of very fast follower at the latest release of software. In mid-tier, the dynamic is slightly different. So as the expansion occurs to mid-tier, I think it's both good for Google because they obviously get more broader base of consumers looking for such results.

In the U.S., we're not going to be able to take the benefit on the operating losses that we may be incurring early in the year. So in fact, that because of the operating losses that we've had historically, it's created these NOLs that we're carrying forward and some other attributes with the separation. So overall, when the financial profile of Mobility improves, we'll be able to take advantage of those NOLs. But today, a lot of the profits of the company are going to be offshore. But again, as the earnings improve overall, we'll be able to benefit from the fact that we have significant tax NOLs inside the U.S. operations.

I actually think that the positive reason is that, I think, this operating system -- and I have been, as you know, involved in Android pretty much from the beginning. I think this 3.0 is probably as innovative, if not, more innovative than what the 2.0 delivered in Android ecosystem. And you will recall that 2.0 became the vehicle on which drove the growth for Android. So I think that the amount of work, the number of innovative things that are going on here are quite large and, therefore, we, of course, demoed only a small number of things when we demoed it at CES. I'm pretty confident that you will see some very good applications and services, but I should also say that in working with Google, we will continue to add new services to this device through the course of it. And of course, all of these XOOM 3G tablets are upgradable to 4G. The Verizon 3G tablets are upgradable to 4G LTE. So anyone who acquires these in February or March will be able to upgrade it to 4G. So I think that -- it's really a software as well as hardware, which is very upgradable, because of the memory and hardware capability that we have built in. This product will have a long life.

The second thing was that I think the best way to say it, Simona, is that we anticipate that for our devices, that inventory in the channels are at quite normal levels. So by extension, obviously, the sell-ins also was reduced. But I'm not commenting particularly on Verizon, but generally, broadly for our mid-tier products, the sell-in was also reduced. And of course, you saw that we guided you to higher end of '14 and with 13 7, we delivered -- they closed to the high end of that number. So by the way, our sense is from third quarter to fourth quarter, the growth in smartphone shipment was marginally outstripped by our growth in smartphones shipment. So very modestly, I think, we gained in market share in fourth quarter."

We've been waiting for many years for Motorola to make a bigger push to internationalize the sales of Home.

We'll reinvest in certain areas, software in particular, on R&D, but our expectation is that we will be able to maintain that same kind of cost structure year on year. So don't expect much in terms of restructuring. And selling and marketing cost, both the distribution side as well as advertising and promotion, we will ramp that accordingly with the growth particularly in the Mobile Device business.

If you look at the last couple of years, we've had a relatively stable percentage of business inside the U.S. versus outside. I continue to believe that as the video business model evolves outside North America, we will continue to see new opportunities we can chase. Certainly, there has been some consolidation in Latin America of the traditional cable properties, which has created some new opportunities. China remains a very fragmented market around video distribution and as that begins to sort itself through, it should create some new opportunities. And Western Europe has had spotty opportunities over the last few years that we believe as the general economy in Western Europe improves in many countries will create new opportunities.

That's the best one segmentation. I'm sorry, let me start again. I kind of got myself confused. One is whether it's 3G, 4G versus Wi-Fi and second is whether it's 7, 8, 10 or 11-inch. This size will make a difference. So let me just, by way of illustration, say, that a 7-inch Wi-Fi tablet obviously will carry much smaller gross margin than a 10-inch 4G tablet will. So that's 1 factor. But by and large, I would say that the tablet business, because meaningful portion of it will go through retail, would be lower gross margin business. I would say there is uncertainty in my mind as to how carriers will deal with tablets. I think, again, I think if I have to say clearly as they get 2-year subscription, there is much greater willingness to subscribe. But it's not clear what portion of tablet sales will go through -- will have to wear subscription. So far, what we've seen is around 50% of the tablets tend to be Wi-Fi tablets. So there's uncertainty as to, on average, what level of subsidy will be available on tablets. So i don't know if I -- sorry to confuse, but those are the factors that will be in play.

Clearly, we -- as I think we've indicated to you, we have 6 million subscribers in MOTOBLUR. Peter, what that allows us to do is have a very good understanding, for instance, of what is the battery life experience that our consumers are seeing. We have a distribution of battery life across all of our consumer base. We have a better understanding what experience do people get if they download certain applications. As you know, the marketplace is quite open and there is 1 application in particular that I've been using, which has crashed quite often and that impacts consumer's experiences. Us having some visibility to that, allows us to help consumers. If you look, up to this point, 30% of the smartphone base is roughly speaking, in smartphone, as the -- a vast majority of people who are still using feature phones come to this marketplace. I think having an ability to connect with them and to help them manage their device will be a very important thing. 70% of our returns, Peter, are no-fault found and we still -- not just us, but I think -- perhaps I'm overstating, but I think nobody in our industry yet knows why those returns come back. And I think our ability to understand what goes on in the phone and for instance, we have accelerometer, if the phone comes back and we see unusual readings in the accelerometer, it allows us to understand what went on in the phone. So I think that is 1 aspect of what MOTOBLUR allows us to do. The second aspect, of course, I think you've seen the social networking. But I think you should think of it more broadly as being able to understand what consumers like and being able to push information that they care about on their home screen. And this, this of course, relies very strongly in our ability to figure out what consumers want. If we get that wrong, it becomes noise very, very quickly. So it's something that will take a lot of time. We've made some acquisitions of companies who do good work in this area. So I think there are a couple of important things, a few other things. I think Vector fits into the scheme. But enterprise, I think, is very important part of our differentiation strategy. We have focused as a result of our convergence with set top box in delivering multimedia everywhere, that's the third part, a very important part of our strategy. And other few other things, that I think will become clear and certainly we'll talk a little more about it at Mobile World Congress. I think that being able to connect with our consumer and understand their needs and preferences is an important part of our strategy. With respect to Honeycomb, I have no commitment or guarantee of what will be our lead. Certainly, working very, very closely, as we have done with Google, gives us some advantages in performance as well as close working relationship. And I think as a result of which we anticipate that we'll have some lead in the marketplace. But there's really no great guarantee that, that lead would be very large. We will have to compete in the marketplace, a lot of other people have access to do will core processors. But I think this industry and marketplace is changing fast enough that some of the software differentiation that I talked about will make a difference very quickly in this market."

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today for the first Motorola Mobility earnings call. After 2-plus years of planning and a lot of hard work by employees from around the world, Motorola is separated into 2 publicly traded companies on January 4, 2011. As an independent company, we will focus on growth as we transform the organization by strengthening our team with new talented leadership delivering differentiated products and services and leveraging the Motorola brand name. 
Our brand will represent a simple message, that by making technology intuitive and easy to use, and enabling consumers to connect with people and things that matter to them, we can simplify and enrich people's lives. Our growth will be driven by smartphones, tablets, and over time, converged experiences in the home and on the go. As we innovate and grow, we plan to leverage our cost structure, achieve full year operating profitability in mobile devices in 2011 and improve our overall annual operating margin to 8% to 12% over the longer term. With that, I will comment on our fourth quarter business result and then discuss opportunities for growth and strategic priorities. Following that, Mark will discuss our financial results in more detail and our guidance. 
Fourth quarter revenues and operating earnings grew sequentially and year-on-year. On total revenues of $3.4 billion, we generated a non-GAAP operating profit of $146 million compared to a loss in the year-ago quarter, and we generated $225 million in cash from operation. In mobile devices, we shipped 4.9 million smartphones in the quarter, bringing our total to 13.7 million for the year. On a non-GAAP basis, mobile devices generated an operating profit of $56 million. In fourth quarter, we launched 7 new smartphones in markets around the world, including the DROID Pro, DROID 2 Global, BRAVO and DEFY. This brought our total smartphone launches last year to 23. 
North America accounted for 63% of our total revenue compared to 69% in the fourth quarter of 2009. Demand for DROID 2 and DROID X continued to be strong. Sales of midrange smartphones, including BRAVO and DEFY was solid, but slightly below our expectations. Aside from North America, smartphone shipments grew by over 50% sequentially and accounted for over 30% of total smartphone units. In China, our second largest market, we saw very strong sequential growth in the quarter. During the year, we introduced over 20 smartphones, including the XP800 with China Telecom, several OPhone devices with China Mobile and a refreshed lineup introduced under our main brand. For the full year, we shipped nearly 2 million smartphones across the 3 network operators.
In Latin America, as well as in certain markets in Europe, fourth quarter smartphone volumes were also higher sequentially, led by sales of DEFY and other midrange smartphones. Globally, we have deployed BLUR-enabled devices to over 40 carriers and we have approximately 6 million subscribers. This service, which provides consumers with push Internet content and operated with network-efficient devices, continues to be an integral part of our differentiation strategy. During the quarter, we acquired Vector, our fifth acquisition of innovative software technology in 2010. By integrating Vector's capabilities into BLUR, we will enable consumers to enjoy on-demand access to the additional media across multiple devices and provide enhanced content security. 
Shifting now to this year. We began 2011 with the announcement of 3 new smartphones and our first tablet. This included the ATRIX 4G, which will initially launch with AT&T and subsequently with Bell Canada, Orange and others. For Verizon, we announced the DROID BIONIC, our first LTE smartphone, and XOOM, the first tablet on Honeycomb, an Android release designed specifically to deliver a unique tablet experience. 
Each of these devices inspired by a leading edge dual-core processor providing 2 gigahertz of processing power. Feedback on these new devices has been very positive and includes a variety of awards at the recent Consumer Electronics Show. The ATRIX 4G and the upgradable version of XOOM, which we'll begin to ship by the end of the February. The LTE version of XOOM and DROID BIONIC are expected to ship in the second quarter. From a broader portfolio perspective, our growth this year will be driven by compelling product road map. 
First, smartphones. In North America, we will focus on smartphones as the leading edge of technology that delivers the best consumer and enterprise experience as possible. In China, smartphone demand is growing rapidly in midrange devices, as well as in the high tier. We will continue to address both segments and all deployed technologies in China. 
In Latin America, we see the opportunity for growth predominantly in midrange smartphones. And for the near term, we will address opportunities in Europe in select markets as we did in 2010. To serve consumers needing enterprise functionality, we will continue to deliver features on top of Android that provides security capabilities essential to CIOs. With DROID Pro and other high-performance smartphones, we'll provide the enterprise-ready alternative these consumers have been looking for. 
From a feature phone and voice-centric devices perspective, we will continue to be focused on a limited number of devices to address the basic market opportunities. In iDEN, we'll continue to refresh the portfolio for our U.S. and international customers. 
Finally, the convergence of mobility and computing opens up a new area of growth for us. The ATRIX 4G smartphone with docking accessories and the XOOM tablet are the first examples of how we are beginning to address this opportunity. ATRIX 4G is more than just a high-performance smartphone. When combined with this unique docking accessories and enabled by our proprietary Webtop application, it enables enhance aand more interactive experiences. For example, paired with a laptop dock, consumers can have the large screen experience for consumption of HD content, editing documents and browsing the web. The XOOM tablet provides best-in-class performance, HD display enriched graphics. It opens up new and innovative services and takes media consumption and gaming to a new level. 
 
Growing for profitability in smartphones and tablets is possible by building on our momentum and differentiating our devices. We intend to do this by staying at the leading-edge of hardware innovation; by providing unique services and experience that includes social collaboration, content management and delivery and cloud storage and by integrating essential enterprise capabilities on top of the fastest growing mobile platform. Consistently executing and this set of priorities in conjunction with our brand, intellectual property and carrier relationship is what will set us apart, enable our growth and drive operating profit improvements in mobile devices. 
Now turning to Home. Fourth quarter total revenues were up sequentially, reflecting solid demand for HD and DVR set-top. From a product portfolio perspective, we launched the industry's highest density upstream DOCSIS solution and a next-generation IP set-top for the Europe market, extending our leadership position in IPTV. We also expanded our software solution suite with the introduction of our EDGE Home Center. This cloud-based solution enables consumers to manage their home network, mobile devices and services from home or remotely. 
During the quarter, we acquired 4Home, the developer of a software platform for managed services in the home. By integrating their capabilities with our cloud-based media service manager software portfolio, we can begin to enable consumer converged experiences, that include home energy management, security, monitoring and control.  
Looking back at 2010, macroeconomic conditions in U.S. provided a headwind for the industry. After a challenging start to the year, we began to see demand for our set-top boxes stabilize in the second half. In infrastructure, revenue grew last year as operator showed us solutions for the network capacity and advanced services. Overall, the team performed well in a difficult environment by holding share in our priority market, including innovative products, reducing cost while continuing to invest in future technology and improving profitability. 
As we look ahead in Home, we expect a mid-single-digit CAGR for the industry over the next several years, as economic conditions improve and demand recovers. That said, in 2011, we expect industry demand to be relatively flat compared to 2010. Our priorities will include sustaining our leadership in advanced set-tops and gateways and prioritizing our investment in IP-based home solutions, next generation content delivery, cloud-based services and multiscreen experiences. In addition, we plan to continue to improve operating margin as we further streamline our product portfolio and manage our cost. 
I'll turn the call over now to Marc to provide additional details on financial results for the quarter and our guidance. Marc?"

Motorola Mobility revenues were $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up 16% sequentially and up 21% from the fourth quarter of 2009. For the full year, revenues were $11.5 billion, up 4% compared to 2009. On a GAAP basis, fourth quarter operating earnings were $126 million. Non-GAAP adjustments for operating earnings were net expense of $20 million. This includes stock compensation and intangible assets amortization expense of $57 million and a restructuring charge of $18 million, offset by income of $55 million related to an IP seller. 
Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating earnings were $146 million compared to $80 million in the third quarter and a loss of $46 million in the year-ago quarter. For the full year, we generated operating earnings on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis compared to the significant loss incurred in 2009. On a per share basis, using 294.3 million shares outstanding, we reported fourth quarter GAAP net earnings of $0.27 per share compared to a loss of $0.69 per share in the year-ago quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter net earnings were $0.37 per share compared to a loss of $0.24 per share in the fourth quarter of 2009. Further details on our non-GAAP results are included in our today's press release and available on our website. 
My remaining income statement references will be on a non-GAAP basis. Our overall gross margin percentage in the quarter was 27%, comparable with the third quarter and up from 25.5% in the fourth quarter of 2009. For the full year, we improved gross margin percentage to 26.2% from 19.9% in 2009. This was driven primarily by shifting our mix to higher margins smartphones from lower margin feature phones, and improved supply chain efficiencies. In addition, Home gross margin increased driven by improved product mix and product cost reduction actions. 
Total operating expenses in the quarter were up 8% sequentially. The increase was driven primarily by sales and marketing expenses to support business growth and new product introductions in mobile devices. Compared to 2009, total OpEx for the quarter and the full year were comparable. Total net interest expense in the quarter was $12 million, reflecting an allocation of net interest cost from our former parent company. 
Turning now to our business segments. In Mobile Devices, fourth quarter revenues were $2.4 billion, up 33% year-over-year. Total shipments were 11.3 million units, including 4.9 million smartphones. As we anticipated, our overall ASP declined to $214 compared to $223 in the third quarter. This was driven by midrange devices, representing a larger portion of our total smartphone volume. For the full year, Mobile Device revenues were $7.8 billion, up 9% compared to 2009, driven by the shipment of 13.7 million smartphones compared to 2 million in 2009. 
In Mobile Devices, we generated a $56 million operating profit in the quarter compared to a $3 million profit in the third quarter of 2010. Our sequential improvement was driven by higher smartphone volumes offset partially by higher sales and marketing expenses. For the full year, with growth in smartphones, improvement in gross margin and tight control over our operating expenses, we reduced mobile devices operating loss for the full year to $198 million from $924 million in 2009. 
Now in the Home business. Fourth quarter revenues were $1 billion, up 10% sequentially and 1% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, set-top revenue was up 21%, offset partially by slightly lower infrastructure sales. For the full year, revenue in our Home business was $3.6 billion, down 7% from 2009. Sales of consumer equipment were lower, partially offset by 30% increase in video and asset infrastructure. Infrastructure accounted for 25% of our total home revenues compared to 18% in 2009. Operating margin in the quarter for Home increased to 9% from 7.1% in the fourth quarter of last year. And for the full year, operating margin also improved 7.5% from 5% in 2009. This improvement was driven by product mix and a reduction in operating cost. 
Moving now to the balance sheet. At separation, we received a $3.2 billion in cash from Motorola. As planned, we expect to receive an additional $300 million once certain cash repatriation activities are completed over time by our former parent company. Approximately 1/3 of our cash outside the United States was primarily used to capitalize and fund the working capital need of our international business. On Page 16 of our slide presentation, you'll see our year-end balance sheet on a GAAP and pro forma basis. In the pro forma view, we've incorporated the cash from Motorola to give you another view as to our balance sheet position as we head into the new year. 
We continue to make good progress in working capital management in both the Mobile Devices and Home businesses. Inventory at year end was down slightly from third quarter, and our days sales inventory improved sequentially to 30 days from 36 days.  Accounts receivable was essentially flat with the third quarter and days sales outstanding declined sequentially to 41 days from 48 days. Our overall SaaS conversion cycle improved sequentially to 10 days, and this compares to 13 days at the end of 2009. 
In the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $225 million, our sixth consecutive quarter of positive cash flow. For the full year, we generated $606 million in operating cash flows. This compares to an outflow in 2009 of over $1.1 billion. Finally, in recent weeks, we completed a $500 million 3-year unsecured credit facility, 10 leading banks committed to this facility with favorable terms and conditions. 
Turning now to our outlook for the first quarter. As we indicated last December, given seasonality in the United States and improved competitive conditions in the U.S. smartphone market, we expect operating earnings for Motorola Mobility to be in the range around breakeven. In Mobile Devices, we expect significant growth in smartphones and total revenue compared to first quarter of 2010. We also expect an operating loss significantly below the year-ago quarter. 
In Home, compared to the first quarter of 2010, we expect slightly higher revenues and higher operating margin. At a per share basis for Motorola Mobility, we expect to incur a net loss in the range of $26 million to $62 million, equivalent to a loss of $0.09 to $0.21 per share. This loss includes a provision for income taxes of approximately $25 million, which I will explain in more detail in a moment. 
Now I would like to provide the following color for full year 2011. In mobile devices, we expect revenue growth this year to be driven by the shipment of 20 million to 23 million smartphones and tablet devices combined. In our Home business, we expect revenues in 2011 to be comparable to 2010. For the company, research and development and general and administrative costs spend will be very tightly manage. Sales and marketing will increase in mobile devices to support new product introduction and grow our top line. We expect total stock compensation and intangible amortization expenses to approximate $55 million per quarter comparable with 2010. 
From an operating profit perspective for the full year, we expect low-single-digit operating margin in mobile devices, a significant improvement compared to the operating loss last year. In Home, we expect slight operating margin improvement for 2011 compared to 2010. Below operating income, we expect approximately $10 million in net expenses each quarter. This includes cost associated with foreign currency management and exchange rate fluctuation, partially offset by modest interest income and our cash and cash equivalents. 
With respect to income taxes, we anticipate an ongoing annual effective tax rate for the full year of approximately 30%. Given our expected geographic distribution of operating profits and losses in 2011, we expect some volatility in the quarterly tax rate as compared to our projected annual rate. This is due to tax expense on foreign earned income, which for now, cannot be offset by tax benefits on U.S. operating results. As a result, we plan to provide you with an estimate of our expected income tax provision for the upcoming quarter on each of our earnings calls. 
In the first quarter, we expect a tax provision of approximately $25 million, as I just mentioned. Over time, as we achieve normalized earning levels across our various geographies and we are able to utilize our deferred tax asset, we expect a lower annual tax rate. Finally, with regards to share counts, as of January 4, we had 294 million basic shares outstanding and approximately 305 million shares on a fully diluted basis. Through the balance of the year, we anticipate only a modest increase in share count. 
The segment and consolidated earnings guidance we have provided today is on a non-GAAP basis where applicable and excludes stock-based compensation expense intangible asset amortization and items similar to those historically highlighted in our quarterly earnings result. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Dean to start the Q&A."

And then more importantly, as we look at the promotional dollars associated with each new smartphone, do you think AT&T and other expanding customers for Motorola are willing to spend similar levels of advertising spending that Verizon did in the past with the original DROID, as they transition to a new device?

At T-Mobile, as you know, at Verizon, as well as AT&T, we have midrange smartphones and we had anticipated, as a result of availability of tiered data pricing, that there will be accelerated take-up of mid-tier phones. Actually, what we continue to see was that, that was not the case and that consumers continue to buy high-tiered smartphones like DROID X. And I think that was actually the factor that I referred to in my script. With respect to the second part of your question about marketing dollars, I anticipate that there will be -- there's actually quite a lot of excitement around ATRIX 4G, as you saw at CES and we are certainly looking to support our products, but we are also looking to leverage the pull from our carriers without being specific about the support. As you know, we have a  very good continuing relationship with Verizon and I think they continue to view the DROID franchise as being a very important franchise for them. So we will certainly continue to participate and work closely with Verizon, but we will diversify our portfolio in the United States with AT&T and others. And I have no reason for believing that there is not going to be support. The levels,  I think, I probably can't comment with precision at the moment. But certainly, I think, given the quality of our portfolio, we are looking to support our portfolio in the marketplace."

Certainly, since the announcement of iPhone, we have seen a little slowdown in our sell-through of our devices because there's clearly an anticipation of some devices coming through Verizon, so we have seen that affect even prior to the iPhone launching. But I think we continue to feel that when the door swings occur, consumers coming to Verizon stores, that being offered the choices that they're being offered by Verizon, because the fundamental principle that Verizon has stuck to is that they want to offer choices to their consumers. As the consumers come into the store, they will see a choice. And I think time will tell as to what percentage of those doors swings actually translates to which brand purchase. But I think that we have seen some slowdown as a result of the announcement from Verizon. With respect to color around 20 million to 23 million units this year, clearly, vast majority of that will be smartphones. In the United States, our focus will continue to be at the high end. But I anticipate that the mid-tier market in Latin America and China will become more important for us and there will be continued growth there. I think in Europe, which also is a little more of a mid-tier marketplace, we have seen good traction with DEFY and we'll continue to introduce products to support that further. I would say one other thing. And as you know, we've had a team in China, which has been very focused on what we call MMCP, mass market consumer products, or voice-centric feature phones. And they contributed in 2010 in stabilizing our feature phone shipment in second half. As we go through 2011, we will shift focus for that team towards low- and mid-tier smartphones. So I anticipate that they will be able to support some volume shipments for us in Latin America and China and Europe, where mid-tier is much more important part of the marketplace. For tablets, I think, clearly, we have a very compelling product. As you know, there was a lot of excitement around that product and we will launch that product at Verizon in February. And with Honeycomb and some of the new innovative services that you will see there, we're excited about that product. But it is really, at the moment, a little too early to be precise about how much volume that may lead to us, either in the first quarter or through the year. I would say that in second half of the year, you will see us introduce tablets, 7-inch, and various other form factor. And we anticipate that, that will further support our growth into tablets that converge to computing devices."

And I'm not yet convinced that Verizon will not continue to push forward with DROID as a franchise. And of course, we participate in that, others participate also, and we have a good relationship with Verizon and continued good relationship with Verizon there. In terms of diversification in U.S., you have seen the launch or at least the announcement of ATRIX 4G at AT&T, you will see us diversify in retail channel as well, as with the other carriers in the U.S. So I think if you look at our international diversification, even the fourth quarter results shows the growth in our shipments of smartphones in China and Latin America, and to a certain extent, in Europe. And I think that in 2011, I think we will have a much greater focus in diversification and growth in our shipments in these regions. So already, I think you've seen that. And then of course, with the introduction of tablet, that creates another growth area for us. And then we're actually excited about that possibility. Outside of U.S., you will see us launch WiFi tablets as well as 3G tablets in other regions also. So that creates further opportunity for us in 2011 also."

In mid-tier, brand, channel distribution, become even more important. So I actually -- of course, we use Android operating environment and we have a great partnership with Google and there is that dependence. But in mid-tier, actually, I think the factors that enables success are more varied. In leading edge, you have to be one of the first of very fast follower at the latest release of software. In mid-tier, the dynamic is slightly different.

In the U.S., we're not going to be able to take the benefit on the operating losses that we may be incurring early in the year. So in fact, that because of the operating losses that we've had historically, it's created these NOLs that we're carrying forward and some other attributes with the separation. So overall, when the financial profile of Mobility improves, we'll be able to take advantage of those NOLs. But today, a lot of the profits of the company are going to be offshore. But again, as the earnings improve overall, we'll be able to benefit from the fact that we have significant tax NOLs inside the U.S. operations.

I actually think that part of the reason is that, I think, this operating system -- and I have been, as you know, involved in Android pretty much from the beginning. I think this 3.0 is probably as innovative, if not, more innovative than what the 2.0 delivered in Android ecosystem. And you will recall that 2.0 became the vehicle on which drove the growth for Android. So I think that the amount of work, the number of innovative things that are going on here are quite large and, therefore, we, of course, demoed only a small number of things when we demoed it at CES. I'm pretty confident that you will see some very good applications and services, but I should also say that in working with Google, we will continue to add new services to this device through the course of it. And of course, all of these XOOM 3G tablets are upgradable to 4G. The Verizon 3G tablets are upgradable to 4G LTE. So anyone who acquires these in February or March will be able to upgrade it to 4G.

So by extension, obviously, the sell-ins also was reduced. But I'm not commenting particularly on Verizon, but generally, broadly for our mid-tier products, the sell-in was also reduced. And of course, you saw that we guided you to higher end of '14 and with 13.7 million, we delivered -- they closed to the high end of that number. So by the way, our sense is from third quarter to fourth quarter, the growth in smartphone shipment was marginally outstripped by our growth in smartphones shipment.

China remains a very fragmented market around video distribution and as that begins to sort itself through, it should create some new opportunities.

That's the best one segmentation. I'm sorry, let me start again. I kind of got myself confused. One is whether it's 3G, 4G versus Wi-Fi and second is whether it's 7, 8, 10 or 11-inch. This size will make a difference. So let me just, by way of illustration, say, that a 7-inch Wi-Fi tablet obviously will carry much smaller gross margin than a 10-inch 4G tablet will. So that's 1 factor. But by and large, I would say that the tablet business, because meaningful portion of it will go through retail, would be lower gross margin business. I would say there is uncertainty in my mind as to how carriers will deal with tablets. I think, again, I think if I have to say clearly as they get 2-year subscription, there is much greater willingness to subscribe. But it's not clear what portion of tablet sales will go through -- will have to wear subscription. So far, what we've seen is around 50% of the tablets tend to be Wi-Fi tablets. So there's uncertainty as to, on average, what level of subsidy will be available on tablets. So i don't know if I -- sorry to confuse, but those are the factors that will be in play.

I didn't understand -- you wouldn't mind just asking the question again related to the ASP on the Android devices and I'll see if I can give any color on it."

Clearly, we -- as I think we've indicated to you, we have 6 million subscribers in MOTOBLUR. Peter, what that allows us to do is have a very good understanding, for instance, of what is the battery life experience that our consumers are seeing. We have a distribution of battery life across all of our consumer base. We have a better understanding what experience do people get if they download certain applications. As you know, the marketplace is quite open and there is 1 application in particular that I've been using, which has crashed quite often and that impacts consumer's experiences. Us having some visibility to that, allows us to help consumers. If you look, up to this point, 30% of the smartphone base is roughly speaking, in smartphone, as the -- a vast majority of people who are still using feature phones come to this marketplace. I think having an ability to connect with them and to help them manage their device will be a very important thing. 70% of our returns, Peter, are no-fault found and we still -- not just us, but I think -- perhaps I'm overstating, but I think nobody in our industry yet knows why those returns come back. And I think our ability to understand what goes on in the phone and for instance, we have accelerometer, if the phone comes back and we see unusual readings in the accelerometer, it allows us to understand what went on in the phone. So I think that is 1 aspect of what MOTOBLUR allows us to do. The second aspect, of course, I think you've seen the social networking. But I think you should think of it more broadly as being able to understand what consumers like and being able to push information that they care about on their home screen. And this, this of course, relies very strongly in our ability to figure out what consumers want. If we get that wrong, it becomes noise very, very quickly. So it's something that will take a lot of time. We've made some acquisitions of companies who do good work in this area. So I think there are a couple of important things, a few other things. I think Vector fits into the scheme. But enterprise, I think, is very important part of our differentiation strategy. We have focused as a result of our convergence with set top box in delivering multimedia everywhere, that's the third part, a very important part of our strategy. And other few other things, that I think will become clear and certainly we'll talk a little more about it at Mobile World Congress. I think that being able to connect with our consumer and understand their needs and preferences is an important part of our strategy. With respect to Honeycomb, I have no commitment or guarantee of what will be our lead. Certainly, working very, very closely, as we have done with Google, gives us some advantages in performance as well as close working relationship. And I think as a result of which we anticipate that we'll have some lead in the marketplace. But there's really no great guarantee that, that lead would be very large. We will have to compete in the marketplace, a lot of other people have access to dual core processors. But I think this industry and marketplace is changing fast enough that some of the software differentiation that I talked about will make a difference very quickly in this market."
