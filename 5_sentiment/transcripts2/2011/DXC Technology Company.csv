In general, the impacts of the third quarter, while",1347,"Thank you, Bryan. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us today. I'll start my comments by addressing our third quarter results in the context of our modified full year guidance. In general, the impacts of the third quarter, while significant, are narrow in nature. They do not change our longer-term positive outlook. Third quarter profitability was primarily impacted by some trailing effects from the previously disclosed Nordics issue. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we anticipate a rebound in operating income margin to the level we achieved in the fourth quarter of fiscal year '10, thus, a 25 basis point improvement.
The operating income recovery in the fourth quarter, combined with the improved tax rate, brings our full-year EPS guidance to $5.20. Topline revenue guidance for the full year is impacted by a couple of factors, MPS delays in new words as well as the impact of temporary funding shortages on existing contracts. And there is a shift of an NHS milestone from the fourth quarter to early next fiscal year.
However, our Commercial business in the third quarter continued its positive track, delivering 4.2% growth sequentially and 3% year-over-year in constant currency. Geographically, we are particularly pleased that our emerging market businesses in Latin America and Asia Pacific delivered double-digit growth.
Our new business bookings for Q3 were softer than we had expected, coming in at $2.3 billion. year-to-date, through Q3, we've signed $10 billion in total contract value bookings. Let me provide some color to this metric and give you a view into what we are expecting for coming periods.
Entering Q3, we expected a stronger quarter and second half of the year for new business awards in both our North American Public Sector and global Commercial segments. I'm pleased to say that our win rates on competitive outcomes continues to be strong and better than 50%. The headwinds store bookings are attributed to an abnormally high level of delays in decision-making for larger opportunities. This is true on both our Government and Commercial segments.
Since our last call, clients award dates for some $6.6 billion of opportunities out of our fiscal year '11 into fiscal year '12. Of this total, $3.9 billion are in MPS and $2.7 billion are in the MSS pipeline. These opportunities are delayed, not lost, and they remain in our competitive pipeline.
The volume of these release requires, however, that we amend our bookings guidance for the fiscal year '11 to $16 billion in TCP.
Currently, our pipeline anticipates the customer award decision for some $11 billion of DCB during the fourth quarter and our rolling 12 month pipeline of qualified opportunity stands at $30 billion in TCP. For our MPS unit, we expanded our business development efforts for both new initiatives and our ID/IQ contract base in anticipation of increased uncertainty in the spending decisions in our government market. We've expanded our pipeline of new opportunities and the volume of our submitted proposals. That said, the market environment continues to be challenging and is manifesting itself in an unexpected delays and a longer cycle of the conversion of awards to revenues, which has led to growth below our expectations. Of note, our strategy to sell more work through our base of over 100 active ID/IQ contracts is showing promise. Of the $4.6 billion in NPS TCV bookings year-to-date, approximately $2.3 billion for 70% came through these contract vehicles. We are adjusting our sales programs to more effectively leverage these contract vehicles. Looking forward, we continue to show a strong pipeline of ID/IQ related tasks orders as the U.S. government looks to spend through these contract vehicles as a matter of efficiency.
As of the end of the third quarter, we had $6.5 billion and submitted proposals for our your NPS business awaiting decisions. That's up $1.2 billion from last quarter and up 8% compared with year ago. In addition, on a year-over-year basis, our NPS qualified pipeline is up about 26%. The combination of increases in outstanding proposals and new business pipeline or the engines for future growth in this challenging environment.
Across our markets, racing a constructive shift in buying notice from cost avoidance to capability expansion and from bill to buy. In particular, crowd or Cloud oriented business services are becoming more prevalent. The service growing demand for bi as a service, we are promoting our expertise in credentials adjusted systems operations, global reach, service integration and business process  Orchestration. Our MSS business is navigating significant shifts in the outsourcing market to take advantage of innovations and virtualization, applications migration and Cloud Computing. And we're pleased with the traction being achieved for our offerings in these categories as evidenced by the sequential year-over-year revenue growth.
Year-to-date, we have signed a number of new clients for our Cloud offerings. These clients represents an almost equal distribution between new or gross and then an extension of our existing relationships. while these projects tend to be small, they are important first steps for companies evaluating the merits of Cloud Computing and a relationship with CSC.
We go to market with three primary classes of Cloud related offerings, infrastructure as a service, platform as a service and Software as a Service. From bottom to top, this is the value stack of Cloud Computing. Infrastructure as a service is a layer of the stack receiving the strongest early market demand. To support this demand, we've invested in and deployed seven Cloud enabled data centers around the world. We support most of the markets leading operating platforms, including force, Azure, SpringSource and . These platforms are the targeted operating environments for the mobility and modernization strategies of our demanding clients. At the top end of the business service stack, CSC is generally recognized as a leader for the financial services and Healthcare industries. With IT-based solutions, application and infrastructure offerings, we operate end-to-end business processes for insurance, banking and Healthcare.
As the market moves towards and as a service orientation, we are well-positioned to serve the modernization agenda of enterprises in these industries. Indeed, during the third quarter, BSS won some sizable multiyear BPO contracts and financial services and has a growing pipeline of these deals. We believe that CSC is competing for the market of tomorrow. We are Cloud enabling our data centers, leveraging strategic alliance partners, supporting multiple development platform environments and generally enabling the ambitions of our clients.
Now turning to NHS. As you know, we've been working on the implementation of the Lorenzo at the trust, our fourth and final early adapter site for patient care. On February 4, NHS notified us that it believes are delayed achieving a milestone related to the than I trust implementation constitutes a breach of contract. The company has disputed the alleged breach and we're jointly are continuing to work towards the completion of the implementation. Both the NHS and CSC has indicated their intent to continue discussions regarding modifications to the contract with the agreed mutual intend to reach agreement as soon as possible on terms satisfactory to both parties. The financial impact of shifting the NHS milestone into the next fiscal year is included in our fiscal year guidance. Our estimate did not include any provision that might result from the ongoing negotiations. We are proud of our accomplishments on the NHS program. This is a multiyear complex software and systems integration efforts that is transformational for the NHS client and the patients they serve. We are aware and sympathetic of NHS's goals and requirements and are diligently working with them to meet their objectives while preserving and protecting our rights.
Turning to Slide 5 for the summary. In summary, our strategic direction is sound, our markets are healthy and provide the opportunity for topline growth. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen, and our financial performance is expected to return to its positive trajectory for the fourth quarter and beyond.
I'll now turn it over to Mike Mancuso for further details of our third quarter results and for the outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year."

In his opening commentary, Mike has characterized how we view this quarter's results. He highlighted for you the important areas in which you should focus and reinforce our commitment to continue to improve our performance and add value for our shareholders. My goal is to provide some further detail and insight to our third quarter results and our full-year outlook to help you better understand and interpret our performance and full-year outlook.
Chart 7 attempts to provide a scorecard. On the plus side, we continued to realize respectable revenue growth in our Commercial businesses. A very favorable free cash flow as compared to last year. We further strengthened our balance sheet, as you'll see later, increased our EPS over last year, increased our dividend and obtained the approval of our board to initiate open market share repurchases.
On the not so plus side. In NPS, we continued to experience delays by the federal government in awarding contracts despite previously announced decision dates. Inaction by the Congress on funding bills and continuing resolutions are part of the root cause. Again, this quarter, our margins were negatively impacted by additional charges stemming from our Nordics business, the result of our continuing cleanup actions. And Mike Laphen outlined for you the current status of the NHS contract.
With regard to new business, Chart 8 lays out our year-over-year new bookings results by quarter. The first two quarters pretty much mirror one another. Q3 of last year is spiked by the signing of a few very large awards in MSS. The largest of which was the Zürich 10-year deal. We have always commented that MSS bookings would be lumpy. We anticipate Q4 to exceed last year based on contract negotiations underway and a sizable number of proposals and evaluation. We think, on balance, $16 billion is about the right number for the year, given the federal government delays discussed earlier.
Chart 9 lays out the year-over-year Q3 P&L statement. There are three lines of focus should be operating income, corporate G&A and the tax rate. Operating income and margin rate are lower than last year primarily because of the Nordics and a one-time positive adjustment in our NPS business in Q3 of FY '10 that did not repeat this year. The effect of these will become more apparent on Chart 12. On the positive side, we continue to control corporate G&A spending and manage our interest expense through reduced debt.
As you can see, in Q3 of this year, our tax rate is dramatically lower than last year. A result of the realization of R&D tax credits spanning several years. So the combination of below the line expense management and tax credits has enabled us to offset the impact of the lower margins and thus increased EPS. The year-to-date P&L story on Chart 10 essentially follows the same theme, so I won't spend time repeating the drivers. It is important to note that our revenue has held despite the tough overall economic climate. Revenue by line of business on Chart 11 shows the revenue growth in our Commercial businesses both on an as reported basis and in constant currency, with about 2% growth as reported and about 3% in constant currency.
Operating income by line of business on Chart 12 displays the year-over-year comparison and picks up the point I made on the earlier P&L chart. On comparable revenue, the NPS operating income is lower this quarter because of last year's one-time positive adjustment. And MSS is considerably lower this year primarily a result of our Nordics issues.
Our balance sheet on Chart 13 has strengthened significantly as the highlighted accounts demonstrate. Cash is lower because we did pay down our $1.5 billion fully drawn revolver. Receivables are lower. Debt is obviously lower, and our debt to capital ratios have improved dramatically. We have ample cash and leverage capacity to support our strategic focus, our shareholder value initiatives with the ability to further enhance our investment grade credit rating.
My only comment on Chart 14 with regards to DSOs is that we are back on track.
Chart 15 is another positive, improved net income, improved working capital and lower capital spending resulted in a year-over-year $360 million increase in free cash flow. EPS on Chart 16, shown by quarter, reflects our estimate for Q4. The sum of the four quarters totals $5.20.
So if you'll turn to Chart 17 which updates our full-year guidance, these numbers, which are lower than our prior guidance, reflect the slowdown in orders and revenue resulting from the award delays and the NHS milestone we talked about earlier. Operating income margin has been reduced primarily because of lower revenue, mix and the Nordics. And lower EPS is a fallout of both. Free cash flow is still expected to exceed 90% of net income.
So in summary, this is what we believe you should take away from this discussion. Our strategy is sound and unchanged. NPS will grow. Acquisitions are a key part of that strategy. The Nordics, albeit painful, is an isolated issue and a recovery plan is in place. And as Mike Laphen said, the NHS discussions are progressing and we will continue to manage for cash and focus on creating shareholder value.
Now I'll turn it back to Bryan to set up the question-and-answer session."

Let me break them down into the federal piece and the Commercial piece. On the federal piece, I think what we're seeing is, again, an impact of the continuing resolution and some of the constipation in here and the government procurement process. So those procurements really the procurement shop announces that it's going to slip out and that we move that out accordingly into whatever new timeframe, or new quarter they have adjusted for. That's just not something we have any control over, we just have to roll with that. On the Commercial side again, there's been some slowdowns in the decision process on the Commercial side. There's nothing particularly to read into that other than it's taking longer for some of these bigger deals to work their way through the Commercial procurement process. So those opportunities that we addressed as moving out, they are they are, they're real, but they've shifted in time. And what I would say is, it was an abnormally high shift. Certainly disappointing to us, but they are still there, and they'll contribute to next fiscal year."

As far as the Nordics is concerned, one way to think about this thing, we have taken the Nordics organization, its financial statements and turned it literally upside down. We have, with a very large team of in-house and out of house experts, examined every contract that they are engaged with and every line item on the balance sheet. In addition to that, we have undertaken an inquiry of our customers to determine whether or not there were commitments made to the customers or negotiations or agreements made that we are not aware of that have an impact on the financials, that have not been booked kept. It's a very thorough, exhaustive, lengthy process. The individuals involved, as I said on the last call, are no longer part of the organization.

You are completely on schedule in terms of the softer delivery that we were scheduled to make a delivery in December, which we did, to the customer environment. As it went through the go live testing of the customer side, a greater number of the effects were uncovered, not anticipated, and the decision was made at that point in time that we would take my time to square off to quote. We are already in the process of doing that. We have our no show stoppers in that. And in fact, were back into the retesting notes as we speak. We are quite confident we will make that delivery of the software. There are no structural problems, there an opera for problems that were lit up. So it was basically driven by requirements interpretations as you get other large software drop like this. We expect the defects.

I'll start my comments by addressing our third quarter results in the context of our modified full year guidance. In general, the impacts to the third quarter, while significant, are narrow in nature. They do not change our longer-term positive outlook. Third quarter profitability was primarily impacted by some trailing effects from the previously disclosed Nordics issue. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we anticipate a rebound in operating income margin to the level we achieved in the fourth quarter of fiscal year '10, thus, a 25-basis-point improvement.
The operating income recovery in the fourth quarter, combined with the improved tax rate, brings our full-year EPS guidance to $5.20. Topline revenue guidance for the full year is impacted by a couple of factors, NPS delays in new awards as well as the impact of temporary funding shortages on existing contracts. And there is a shift of an NHS milestone from the fourth quarter to early next fiscal year.
However, our Commercial business in the third quarter continued its positive track, delivering 4.2% growth sequentially and 3% year-over-year in constant currency. Geographically, we are particularly pleased that our emerging market businesses in Latin America and Asia Pacific delivered double-digit growth.
Our new business bookings for Q3 were softer than we had expected, coming in at $2.3 billion. Year-to-date, through Q3, we've signed $10 billion in total contract value bookings. Let me provide some color to this metric and give you a view into what we are expecting for coming periods.
Entering Q3, we expected a stronger quarter and second half of the year for new business awards in both our North American Public Sector and global Commercial segments. I'm pleased to say that our win rates on competitive outcomes continues to be strong and better than 50%. The headwinds store bookings are attributed to an abnormally high level of delays in decision-making for larger opportunities. This is true on both the Government and Commercial segments.
Since our last call, clients slipped award dates for some $6.6 billion of opportunities out of our fiscal year '11 into fiscal year '12. Of this total, $3.9 billion are in NPS, and $2.7 billion are in the MSS pipeline. These opportunities are delayed, not lost, and they remain in our competitive pipeline.
The volume of these delays requires, however, that we amend our bookings guidance for the fiscal year '11 to $16 billion in TCV.
Currently, our pipeline anticipates the customer award decision for some $11 billion of TCV during the fourth quarter and our rolling 12-month pipeline of qualified opportunity stands at $30 billion in TCV. For our NPS unit, we expanded our business development efforts for both new initiatives and our ID/IQ contract base in anticipation of increased uncertainty in the spending decisions in our government market. 
We've expanded our pipeline of new opportunities and the volume of our submitted proposals. That said, the market environment continues to be challenging and is manifesting itself in unexpected delays and a longer cycle of the conversion of awards to revenues, which has led to growth below our expectations. 
Of note, our strategy to sell more work through our base of over 100 active ID/IQ contracts is showing promise. Of the $4.6 billion in NPS TCV bookings year-to-date, approximately $3.2 billion or 70% came through these contract vehicles. We are adjusting our sales programs to more effectively leverage these contract vehicles. Looking forward, we continue to show a strong pipeline of ID/IQ-related tasks orders as the U.S. government looks to spend through these contract vehicles as a matter of efficiency.
As of the end of the third quarter, we had $6.5 billion in submitted proposals for our NPS business awaiting decisions. That's up $1.2 billion from last quarter and up 8% compared with a year ago. In addition, on a year-over-year basis, our NPS qualified pipeline is up about 26%. The combination of increases in outstanding proposals and new business pipeline are the engines for future growth in this challenging environment.
Across our markets, we're seeing a constructive shift in buying motives from cost avoidance to capability expansion and from build to buy. In particular, Cloud-oriented business services are becoming more prevalent. To serve this growing demand for BI as a service, we are promoting our expertise and credentials in trusted systems operations, global reach, service integration and business process orchestration. Our MSS business is navigating significant shifts in the outsourcing market to take advantage of innovations and virtualization-s, applications migration and cloud Computing. And we're pleased with the traction being achieved for our offerings in these categories as evidenced by the sequential year-over-year revenue growth.
Year-to-date, we have signed a number of new clients for our cloud offerings. These clients represents an almost equal distribution between new logos and an extension of our existing relationships. While these projects tend to be small, they are important first steps for companies in evaluating the merits of cloud Computing and a relationship with CSC.
We go to market with three primary classes of Cloud-related offerings, infrastructure as a service, platform as a service and software as a service. From bottom to top, this is the value stack of cloud Computing. Infrastructure as a service is the layer of the stack receiving the strongest early market demand. To support this demand, we've invested in and deployed seven Cloud-enabled data Centers around the world. We support most of the market's leading operating platforms, including Force, Azure, SpringSource and Cordys. These platforms are the targeted operating environments for the mobility and modernization strategies of our demanding clients. At the top end of the business service stack, CSC is generally recognized as a leader for the Financial Services and Healthcare industries. With IT-based solutions, application and infrastructure offerings, we operate end-to-end business processes for insurance, banking and Healthcare.
As the market moves towards and as a service orientation, we are well-positioned to serve the modernization agenda of enterprises in these industries. Indeed, during the third quarter, BSS won some sizable multiyear BPO contracts in financial services and has a growing pipeline of these deals. We believe that CSC is competing for the market of tomorrow. We are Cloud-enabling our data centers, leveraging strategic alliance partners, supporting multiple development platform environments and generally enabling the ambitions of our clients.
Now turning to NHS. As you know, we've been working on the implementation of Lorenzo at the Pennine Trust, our fourth and final early adapter site for patient care. On February 4, NHS notified us that it believes our delay in achieving a milestone related to the Pennine Trust implementation constitutes a breach of contract. The company has disputed the alleged breach, and we jointly are continuing the work towards the completion of the Pennine implementation. Both the NHS and CSC has indicated their intent to continue discussions regarding modifications to the contract with the agreed mutual intend to reach agreement as soon as possible on terms satisfactory to both parties. The financial impact of shifting NHS milestone into the next fiscal year is included in our fiscal year guidance. Our estimate did not include any provision that might result from the ongoing negotiations. We are proud of our accomplishments on the NHS program. This is a multiyear complex software and systems integration efforts that is transformational for the NHS client and the patients they serve. We are aware and sympathetic of NHS's goals and requirements and are diligently working with them to meet their objectives while preserving and protecting our rights.
Turning to Slide 5 for a summary. In summary, our strategic direction is sound, our markets are healthy and provide the opportunity for topline growth. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen, and our financial performance is expected to return to its positive trajectory for the fourth quarter and beyond.
I'll now turn it over to Mike Mancuso for further details of our third quarter results and for the outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year."

In his opening commentary, Mike has characterized how we view this quarter's results. He highlighted for you the important areas in which you should focus and reinforced our commitment to continue to improve our performance and add value for our shareholders. My goal is to provide some further detail and insight to our third quarter results and our full-year outlook to help you better understand and interpret our performance and full-year outlook.
Chart 7 attempts to provide a scorecard. On the plus side, we continued to realize respectable revenue growth in our Commercial businesses, very favorable free cash flow as compared to last year. We further strengthened our balance sheet, as you'll see later, increased our EPS over last year, increased our dividend and obtained the approval of our board to initiate open market share repurchases.
On the not so plus side. In NPS, we continued to experience delays by the federal government in awarding contracts despite previously announced decision dates. Inaction by the Congress on funding bills and continuing resolutions are part of the root cause. Again, this quarter, our margins were negatively impacted by additional charges stemming from our Nordics business, the result of our continuing cleanup actions. And Mike Laphen outlined for you the current status of the NHS contract.
With regard to new business, Chart 8 lays out our year-over-year new bookings results by quarter. The first two quarters pretty much mirror one another. Q3 of last year is spiked by the signing of a few very large awards in MSS. The largest of which was the Zürich 10-year deal. We have always commented that MSS bookings would be lumpy. We anticipate Q4 to exceed last year based on contract negotiations underway and a sizable number of proposals in evaluation. We think, on balance, $16 billion is about the right number for the year, given the federal government delays discussed earlier.
Chart 9 lays out the year-over-year Q3 P&L statement. Your three lines of focus should be operating income, corporate G&A and the tax rate. Operating income and margin rate are lower than last year primarily because of the Nordics and a one-time positive adjustment in our NPS business in Q3 of FY '10 that did not repeat this year. The effect of these will become more apparent on Chart 12. On the positive side, we continue to control corporate G&A spending and manage our interest expense through reduced debt.
As you can see, in Q3 of this year, our tax rate is dramatically lower than last year. A result of the realization of R&D tax credits spanning several years. So the combination of below the line expense management and tax credits has enabled us to offset the impact of the lower margins and thus increase EPS. 
The year-to-date P&L story on Chart 10 essentially follows the same theme, so I won't spend time repeating the drivers. It is important to note that our revenue has held despite the tough overall economic climate. Revenue by line of business on Chart 11 shows the revenue growth in our Commercial businesses, both on an as reported basis and in constant currency, with about 2% growth as reported and about 3% in constant currency.
Operating income by line of business on Chart 12 displays the year-over-year comparison and picks up the point I made on the earlier P&L chart. On comparable revenue, the NPS operating income is lower this quarter because of last year's one-time positive adjustment. And MSS is considerably lower this year primarily a result of our Nordics issues.
Our balance sheet on Chart 13 has strengthened significantly as the highlighted accounts demonstrate. Cash is lower because we did pay down our $1.5 billion fully drawn revolver. Receivables are lower. Debt is obviously lower, and our debt to capital ratios have improved dramatically. We have ample cash and leverage capacity to support our strategic focus, our shareholder value initiatives with the ability to further enhance our investment grade credit rating.
My only comment on Chart 14 with regards to DSOs is that we are back on track.
Chart 15 is another positive, improved net income, improved working capital and lower capital spending resulted in a year-over-year $360 million increase in free cash flow. EPS on Chart 16, shown by quarter, reflects our estimate for Q4. The sum of the four quarters totals $5.20.
So if you'll turn to Chart 17, which updates our full-year guidance, these numbers, which are lower than our prior guidance, reflect the slowdown in orders and revenue resulting from the award delays and the NHS milestone we talked about earlier. Operating income margin has been reduced primarily because of lower revenue, mix and the Nordics. And lower EPS is a fallout of both. Free cash flow is still expected to exceed 90% of net income.
So in summary, this is what we believe you should take away from this discussion. Our strategy is sound and unchanged. NPS will grow. Acquisitions are a key part of that strategy. The Nordics, albeit painful, is an isolated issue and a recovery plan is in place. And as Mike Laphen said, the NHS discussions are progressing, and we will continue to manage for cash and focus on creating shareholder value.
Now I'll turn it back to Bryan to set up the question-and-answer session."

Let me break them down into the federal piece and the Commercial piece. On the federal piece, I think what we're seeing is, again, an impact of the continuing resolution and some of the constipation in the government procurement process. So those procurements, really the procurement shop announces that it's going to slip out and we move that out accordingly into whatever new timeframe, or new quarter they have adjusted for. That's just not something we have any control over, we just have to roll with that. On the Commercial side again, there's been some slowdowns in the decision process from the Commercial side. There's nothing particularly to read into that other than it's taking longer for some of these bigger deals to work their way through the Commercial procurement process. So those opportunities that we addressed as moving out, they're there, they're real, but they've shifted in time. And what I would say is, it was an abnormally high shift. Certainly disappointing to us, but they're still there, and they'll contribute to next fiscal year."

As far as the Nordics is concerned, one way to think about this thing, we have taken the Nordics organization, its financial statements and turned it literally upside down. We have, with a very large team of in-house and out of house experts, examined every contract that they are engaged with and every line item on the balance sheet. In addition to that, we have undertaken an inquiry of our customers to determine whether or not there were commitments made to the customers or negotiations or agreements made that we are not aware of that have an impact on the financials that have not been booked yet. It's a very thorough, exhaustive, lengthy process. The individuals involved, as I said on last call, are no longer part of the organization.

Now next year, again, we think in terms of low 30s, our crystal ball for next year is not nearly as clear as it would be for our fourth quarter. But I know the street tends to discount tax initiatives etc, but in our mind, taxes is an imported element of managing our expense and obligation and generates a fair amount of cash if we're able to optimize our tax situation. So we view tax with significant importance. We surrounded with a lot of talented people. We spend a lot of time on initiatives that will help us be more efficient in that regard. And I would tell you ongoing you should continue to expect to see that from us, and that will give rise to variations. I also remind you that we're in the throes of the audit of years 2005, six and seven. That will conclude in the June summertime of this year timeframe. There could be some fallout plus and minus from resolution of those audit years. So ballpark-wise, we'll stay on safe ground and say low 30s going forward, but just be aware that obviously that things could be different."

This particular drop was for new functionality for mental health. We were completely on schedule in terms of the software delivery that we were scheduled to make that delivery in December, which we did, to the customer environment. As it went through the go live testing at the customer's site, a greater number of defects were uncovered than anticipated. And the decision was made at that point in time that we would take more time to square up the quote. We are already in the process of doing that. We have our no showstoppers in that. And in fact, we're back into the retesting notes as we speak. We're quite confident we will make that delivery of the software. There are no structural problems. There are no performance problems that we're aware of. So it was basically driven by requirements, interpretations as, you get, on a large software drop like this. We expected defects. We got a bit more than we anticipated. The customers being very strict in terms of what it will accept and what workarounds it may or may not get, and they've extended the testing time, certainly disappointing to us, but I am not concerned relative to our ability to make that delivery."

263093,117936383,101065,"Computer Sciences Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2011",2011-02-09,"Earnings Calls","DXC Technology Company","Executives","Thank you, Bryan. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us today. I'll start my comments by addressing our third quarter results in the context of our modified full year guidance. In general, the impacts to the third quarter, while",1340,"Thank you, Bryan. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us today. I'll start my comments by addressing our third quarter results in the context of our modified full year guidance. In general, the impacts to the third quarter, while significant, are narrow in nature. They do not change our longer-term positive outlook. Third quarter profitability was primarily impacted by some trailing effects from the previously disclosed Nordics issue. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we anticipate a rebound in operating income margin to the level we achieved in the fourth quarter of fiscal year '10, thus, a 25-basis-point improvement.
The operating income recovery in the fourth quarter, combined with the improved tax rate, brings our full-year EPS guidance to $5.20. Topline revenue guidance for the full year is impacted by a couple of factors, NPS delays in new awards as well as the impact of temporary funding shortages on existing contracts. And there is a shift of an NHS milestone from the fourth quarter to early next fiscal year.
However, our Commercial business in the third quarter continued its positive track, delivering 4.2% growth sequentially and 3% year-over-year in constant currency. Geographically, we are particularly pleased that our emerging market businesses in Latin America and Asia Pacific delivered double-digit growth.
Our new business bookings for Q3 were softer than we had expected, coming in at $2.3 billion. Year-to-date, through Q3, we've signed $10 billion in total contract value bookings. Let me provide some color to this metric and give you a view into what we are expecting for coming periods.
Entering Q3, we expected a stronger quarter and second half of the year for new business awards in both our North American Public Sector and global Commercial segments. I'm pleased to say that our win rates on competitive outcomes continues to be strong and better than 50%. The headwinds store bookings are attributed to an abnormally high level of delays in decision-making for larger opportunities. This is true on both the Government and Commercial segments.
Since our last call, clients slipped award dates for some $6.6 billion of opportunities out of our fiscal year '11 into fiscal year '12. Of this total, $3.9 billion are in NPS, and $2.7 billion are in the MSS pipeline. These opportunities are delayed, not lost, and they remain in our competitive pipeline.
The volume of these delays requires, however, that we amend our bookings guidance for the fiscal year '11 to $16 billion in TCV.
Currently, our pipeline anticipates the customer award decision for some $11 billion of TCV during the fourth quarter and our rolling 12-month pipeline of qualified opportunity stands at $30 billion in TCV. For our NPS unit, we expanded our business development efforts for both new initiatives and our ID/IQ contract base in anticipation of increased uncertainty in the spending decisions in our government market. 
We've expanded our pipeline of new opportunities and the volume of our submitted proposals. That said, the market environment continues to be challenging and is manifesting itself in unexpected delays and a longer cycle of the conversion of awards to revenues, which has led to growth below our expectations. 
Of note, our strategy to sell more work through our base of over 100 active ID/IQ contracts is showing promise. Of the $4.6 billion in NPS TCV bookings year-to-date, approximately $3.2 billion or 70% came through these contract vehicles. We are adjusting our sales programs to more effectively leverage these contract vehicles. Looking forward, we continue to show a strong pipeline of ID/IQ-related tasks orders as the U.S. government looks to spend through these contract vehicles as a matter of efficiency.
As of the end of the third quarter, we had $6.5 billion in submitted proposals for our NPS business awaiting decisions. That's up $1.2 billion from last quarter and up 8% compared with a year ago. In addition, on a year-over-year basis, our NPS qualified pipeline is up about 26%. The combination of increases in outstanding proposals and new business pipeline are the engines for future growth in this challenging environment.
Across our markets, we're seeing a constructive shift in buying motives from cost avoidance to capability expansion and from build to buy. In particular, Cloud-oriented business services are becoming more prevalent. To serve this growing demand for BI as a service, we are promoting our expertise and credentials in trusted systems operations, global reach, service integration and business process orchestration. Our MSS business is navigating significant shifts in the outsourcing market to take advantage of innovations and virtualizations, applications migration and Cloud Computing. And we're pleased with the traction being achieved for our offerings in these categories as evidenced by the sequential year-over-year revenue growth.
Year-to-date, we have signed a number of new clients for our Cloud offerings. These clients represents an almost equal distribution between new logos and an extension of our existing relationships. While these projects tend to be small, they are important first steps for companies in evaluating the merits of Cloud Computing and a relationship with CSC.
We go to market with three primary classes of Cloud-related offerings, infrastructure as a service, platform as a service and software as a service. From bottom to top, this is the value stack of Cloud Computing. Infrastructure as a service is the layer of the stack receiving the strongest early market demand. To support this demand, we've invested in and deployed seven Cloud-enabled data Centers around the world. We support most of the market's leading operating platforms, including Force, Azure, SpringSource and Cordys. These platforms are the targeted operating environments for the mobility and modernization strategies of our demanding clients. At the top end of the business service stack, CSC is generally recognized as a leader for the Financial Services and Healthcare industries. With IT-based solutions, application and infrastructure offerings, we operate end-to-end business processes for insurance, banking and Healthcare.
As the market moves towards and as a service orientation, we are well-positioned to serve the modernization agenda of enterprises in these industries. Indeed, during the third quarter, BSS won some sizable multiyear BPO contracts in financial services and has a growing pipeline of these deals. We believe that CSC is competing for the market of tomorrow. We are Cloud-enabling our data centers, leveraging strategic alliance partners, supporting multiple development platform environments and generally enabling the ambitions of our clients.
Now turning to NHS. As you know, we've been working on the implementation of Lorenzo at the Pennine Trust, our fourth and final early adapter site for patient care. On February 4, NHS notified us that it believes our delay in achieving a milestone related to the Pennine Trust implementation constitutes a breach of contract. The company has disputed the alleged breach, and we jointly are continuing the work towards the completion of the Pennine implementation. Both the NHS and CSC has indicated their intent to continue discussions regarding modifications to the contract with the agreed mutual intend to reach agreement as soon as possible on terms satisfactory to both parties. The financial impact of shifting the NHS milestone into the next fiscal year is included in our fiscal year guidance. Our estimate did not include any provision that might result from the ongoing negotiations. We are proud of our accomplishments on the NHS program. This is a multiyear complex software and systems integration effort that is transformational for the NHS client and the patients they serve. We are aware and sympathetic of NHS's goals and requirements and are diligently working with them to meet their objectives while preserving and protecting our rights.
Turning to Slide 5 for a summary. In summary, our strategic direction is sound, our markets are healthy and provide the opportunity for topline growth. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen, and our financial performance is expected to return to its positive trajectory for the fourth quarter and beyond.
I'll now turn it over to Mike Mancuso for further details of our third quarter results and for the outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year."

In his opening commentary, Mike has characterized how we view this quarter's results. He highlighted for you the important areas in which you should focus and reinforced our commitment to continue to improve our performance and add value for our shareholders. My goal is to provide some further detail and insight to our third quarter results and our full-year outlook to help you better understand and interpret our performance and full-year outlook.
Chart 7 attempts to provide a scorecard. On the plus side, we continued to realize respectable revenue growth in our Commercial businesses, very favorable free cash flow as compared to last year. We further strengthened our balance sheet, as you'll see later, increased our EPS over last year, increased our dividend and obtained the approval of our board to initiate open market share repurchases.
On the not so plus side. In NPS, we continued to experience delays by the federal government in awarding contracts despite previously announced decision dates. Inaction by the Congress on funding bills and continuing resolutions are part of the root cause. Again, this quarter, our margins were negatively impacted by additional charges stemming from our Nordics business, the result of our continuing cleanup actions. And Mike Laphen outlined for you the current status of the NHS contract.
With regard to new business, Chart 8 lays out our year-over-year new bookings results by quarter. The first two quarters pretty much mirror one another. Q3 of last year is spiked by the signing of a few very large awards in MSS. The largest of which was the Zürich 10-year deal. We have always commented that MSS bookings would be lumpy. We anticipate Q4 to exceed last year based on contract negotiations underway and a sizable number of proposals in evaluation. We think, on balance, $16 billion is about the right number for the year, given the federal government delays discussed earlier.
Chart 9 lays out the year-over-year Q3 P&L statement. Your three lines of focus should be operating income, corporate G&A and the tax rate. Operating income and margin rate are lower than last year primarily because of the Nordics and a one-time positive adjustment in our NPS business in Q3 of FY '10 that did not repeat this year. The effect of these will become more apparent on Chart 12. On the positive side, we continue to control corporate G&A spending and manage our interest expense through reduced debt.
As you can see, in Q3 of this year, our tax rate is dramatically lower than last year. A result of the realization of R&D tax credits spanning several years. So the combination of below the line expense management and tax credits has enabled us to offset the impact of the lower margins and thus increase EPS. 
The year-to-date P&L story on Chart 10 essentially follows the same theme, so I won't spend time repeating the drivers. It is important to note that our revenue has held despite the tough overall economic climate. Revenue by line of business on Chart 11 shows the revenue growth in our Commercial businesses, both on an as reported basis and in constant currency, with about 2% growth as reported and about 3% in constant currency.
Operating income by line of business on Chart 12 displays the year-over-year comparison and picks up the point I made on the earlier P&L chart. On comparable revenue, the NPS operating income is lower this quarter because of last year's one-time positive adjustment. And MSS is considerably lower this year primarily a result of our Nordics issues.
Our balance sheet on Chart 13 has strengthened significantly as the highlighted accounts demonstrate. Cash is lower because we did pay down our $1.5 billion fully drawn revolver. Receivables are lower. Debt is obviously lower, and our debt to capital ratios have improved dramatically. We have ample cash and leverage capacity to support our strategic focus, our shareholder value initiatives with the ability to further enhance our investment grade credit rating.
My only comment on Chart 14 with regards to DSOs is that we are back on track.
Chart 15 is another positive, improved net income, improved working capital and lower capital spending resulted in a year-over-year $360 million increase in free cash flow. EPS on Chart 16, shown by quarter, reflects our estimate for Q4. The sum of the four quarters totals $5.20.
So if you'll turn to Chart 17, which updates our full-year guidance, these numbers, which are lower than our prior guidance, reflect the slowdown in orders and revenue resulting from the award delays and the NHS milestone we talked about earlier. Operating income margin has been reduced primarily because of lower revenue, mix and the Nordics. And lower EPS is a fallout of both. Free cash flow is still expected to exceed 90% of net income.
So in summary, this is what we believe you should take away from this discussion. Our strategy is sound and unchanged. NPS will grow. Acquisitions are a key part of that strategy. The Nordics, albeit painful, is an isolated issue and a recovery plan is in place. And as Mike Laphen said, the NHS discussions are progressing, and we will continue to manage for cash and focus on creating shareholder value.
Now I'll turn it back to Bryan to set up the question-and-answer session."

Let me break them down into the federal piece and the Commercial piece. On the federal piece, I think what we're seeing is, again, an impact of the continuing resolution and some of the constipation in the government procurement process. So those procurements, really the procurement shop announces that it's going to slip out and we move that out accordingly into whatever new timeframe, or new quarter they have adjusted for. That's just not something we have any control over, we just have to roll with that. On the Commercial side again, there's been some slowdowns in the decision process from the Commercial side. There's nothing particularly to read into that other than it's taking longer for some of these bigger deals to work their way through the Commercial procurement process. So those opportunities that we addressed as moving out, they're there, they're real, but they've shifted in time. And what I would say is, it was an abnormally high shift.

On the latter point, I'm not going to comment on the SEC investigation. It's ongoing, we're fully cooperating. As far as the Nordics is concerned, one way to think about this thing, we have taken the Nordics organization, its financial statements and turned it literally upside down. We have, with a very large team of in-house and out of house experts, examined every contract that they are engaged with and every line item on the balance sheet. In addition to that, we have undertaken an inquiry of our customers to determine whether or not there were commitments made to the customers or negotiations or agreements made that we are not aware of that have an impact on the financials that have not been booked yet. It's a very thorough, exhaustive, lengthy process. The individuals involved, as I said on last call, are no longer part of the organization. But the follow-up and the cleanup is ongoing and, unfortunately, perhaps, we will still find issues in the remaining weeks as we conclude this thing. So the root causes have been fixed, the recovery is still in process in terms of exhausting all the detail. We are highly confident that we have most of the issues identified, but that's not to say that something won't pop, which it did this quarter that we didn't anticipate. But again, it gave us the confidence that we're getting to the bottom of all of the issues. So I can't guarantee there won't be a few more hiccups, but I can guarantee that the investigation will be exhaustive."

But I know the street tends to discount tax initiatives etc, etc, but in our mind, taxes is an imported element of managing our expense and obligations and generates a fair amount of cash if we're able to optimize our tax situation. So we view tax with significant importance. We surround it with a lot of talented people. We spend a lot of time on initiatives that will help us be more efficient in that regard. And I would tell you ongoing you should continue to expect to see that from us, and that will give rise to variations. I also remind you that we're in the throes of the audit of years 2005, six and seven. That will conclude in the June summertime of this year timeframe.

As I'm sure you've seen in our earnings release, we are presenting preliminary unaudited financial results today with the expected completion of our audit and filing of our 10-K by no later than June 15. This delay is necessary to allow our audit committee to accomplish some additional investigative work related to our previously disclosed accounting irregularities in our MSS Nordics Region and to allow our auditors to then finalize the audit. We have filed the Form 12b-25 with the SEC today confirming that we expect to file our 10-K by no later than June 15. 
Although fiscal year '11 was challenging given the NHS uncertainty, the expected difficulties in the Nordics and the delays in the federal budgets, we are pleased with the positive revenue growth in our Commercial business both sequentially and year-over-year. Importantly, excluding these challenges, our underlying business is where we said it would be in terms of operating margin and free cash flow. 
Additionally, we significantly strengthened our balance sheet by paying down debt, initiating the payment of a dividend, defined and activated an open market stock buyback program and secured a new bank stop credit facility. We also continued to implement our strategy with positive results that signaled we're on the right path for future success. Our acquisitions have been focused on our high-growth segments in cybersecurity, acquiring important intellectual property for our healthcare vertical and expanding in Brazil, a key geography. 
With respect to new business, our fiscal year '11 bookings totaled $14 billion. As we indicated at our recent investor's conference, circumstances did not accommodate the timeframe we and our clients had envisioned for some $2 billion of additional awards. Of this amount, we are pursuing approximately $1.7 billion of pending awards which are either sole source or for which we have been selected and are the only party in active client negotiations. 
Additionally, there were further delays of some $1 billion of U.S. federal government opportunities. Announcements were anticipated to have closed in the fourth quarter. In the first few weeks of April, 4 of these opportunities worth approximately $200 million were awarded to CSC. These and the other said file will now be booked as fiscal year '12 awards. 
Cash performance for fiscal year '11 was solid as we delivered $620 million in free cash flow. While this is only 84% of net income, the performance in the rest of the business overcame 25 of the 35 points of negative cash impact resulting from the NHS program. 
With respect to the NHS program, as you know, we've been in protracted negotiations on a nonbinding agreement in principal or MOU to realign our contract with the direction the NHS wants to take the program. The U.K. government is currently conducting a review of the entire NHS national program. The proposed MOU terms are included within the scope of this review and, therefore, signing an agreement is dependent upon the completion of the government's process. The financial impact of our proposed MOU terms are included in our Q4 and full year results. Mike Mancuso will provide further details in his comments. 
Our commercial markets continued to improve throughout fiscal year '11. Our MSS and BSS segments each delivered positive year-over-year growth in every quarter throughout fiscal year '11 as reported. Overall, Commercial business grew 2.7% for the fourth quarter and 2.2% for the full year as reported and inclusive of all NHS impacts. Our pipeline for commercial opportunities stands at $16 billion with several deals in the late stages of negotiation. These, together with some of the late wins in the fourth quarter, will provide the opportunity for revenue ramp-ups in fiscal year '12. In summary, our commercial markets have turned positive and our Commercial business is growing. Setting aside the Nordics and the onetime adjustments in the NHS program, the underlying profitability of the current portfolio in fiscal year '11 was about 9%. This provides a constructive basis for a positive overall result in fiscal year '12. 
Turning then to our U.S. Federal business, Throughout the fourth quarter, the U.S. federal government operated without an agreed budget. Our government clients remained unsure of their fiscal situation and were unable to initiate new programs while operating under continuing resolutions. Those awards that were announced continued to be heavily contested with further substantial delays caused by contract protests. As a result, basic market operating efficiency slowed tremendously, impacting both revenue and booking projections. 
Adding to these uncertainties, many companies operating in the U.S. federal market have been required to divest business units due to government concerns over organizational conflicts of interest or OCI. We were similarly impacted. And as a result, in fiscal year '11, we divested 2 business units due to the OCI concerns. The financial impacts of these actions are expressed as discontinued operations in our fourth quarter and full year results. As we look forward, the U.S. federal market remains an attractive $500 billion marketplace. Within this market, we expect the top line IT budgets will be slightly positive. However, within that spend, there will be significant shift in the type of mix of spending as IT departments focus on achieving greater efficiencies. We believe these shifts in expenditures are favorable to the types of services or offerings that CSC provides and represents an opportunity for our Public Sector business. 
Additionally, our Strategic Market segments continue to grow and we plan to continue to invest in these high-growth market segments which include data center consolidation, virtualization and cloud, health IT, cybersecurity and identity and privacy. Currently, we have more than $6 billion in submitted proposals awaiting award by the government and a 12-month pipeline of some $20 billion of opportunities, more than half of which are in our selected high-growth segments. Given the approved DOD budget for the remainder of the government fiscal year, we are hopeful that some of our clients will now be able to announce awards more expeditiously. 
In summary, uncertainty still exists within our federal market while our commercial markets have continued to strengthen. We are projecting top line growth for fiscal year '12 in the range of 3% to 6% based on a range of 0% to 3% for the Federal business and 5% to 8% for our Commercial business. We expect slightly higher EPS growth in the range of 4% to 6% based on continuing improvement and mix cost controls and execution improvements. 
Our forecasting and operating margins in the range of 8.75% to 9.25% given our normalized performance of 9% in fiscal year '11 and the absence of further Nordic or NHS adjustments. We're also projecting cash performance will return to our normal projection of greater than 90% of net income. 
I'll now turn it over to Mike Mancuso for further details of our fourth quarter results and our outlook for fiscal year '12."
263093,129590742,131693,"Computer Sciences Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, May 25, 2011",2011-05-25,"Earnings Calls","DXC Technology Company","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon. Let's get right to the numbers. I'll begin with Chart 8 which at a high level attempts to walk you from our February 9 guidance through the significant changes that led to our May 2 revised guidance and to our preliminary",808,"Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon. Let's get right to the numbers. I'll begin with Chart 8 which at a high level attempts to walk you from our February 9 guidance through the significant changes that led to our May 2 revised guidance and to our preliminary FY '11 results. 
When we issued the February guidance, we did not contemplate the discontinued operations accounting treatment of the gains on the sale of the 2 businesses, one sale that had occurred in our first half and the second that was anticipated in our fourth quarter. The gains were large enough to classify as discontinued operations. For the purpose of this chart, the guidance includes the disco ops revenue, margin and EPS. The preliminary results revenue excludes disco ops. As noted on the chart, the preliminary EPS results includes the disco ops gains which were assumed in our February guidance. 
We were also very clear in February that our guidance did not include any impact from the NHS MOU negotiations. Other than the NHS impact, the other single most significant change from our February guidance is a 100-plus basis point increase in our tax rate which accounts for most of the $0.11 in the middle column on the chart. There are a myriad of other plus and minuses in that $0.11, including a Nordics-related prior period adjustment of approximately $0.04. 
With regard to NHS, we will not get into the details of the MOU-related changes, but I do want to clarify some confusion around surrounding the $0.34 EPS adjustment. It represents an inception to date margin adjustment on the previously recognized revenue. In other words, the anticipated overall estimated margin on the program at completion is now lower than what we had historically booked. But to remind you, the assumed margin rate is accretive to the FY '14 target we discussed at our May 11 Investors Conference. And before I get off this chart, I want to direct your attention to the free cash flow anticipated 84% result despite the negative 35% NHS impact. 
Now if you'll turn to Chart 9, we expect bookings of $14 billion in FY '11 and $17 billion in FY '12. Mike Laphen gave you the insight into the FY '11 performance. Bookings in our business tend to be very lumpy. And to remind you, the MSS FY '10 actual of $8.7 billion included the $2.9 billion Zürich booking. 
Chart 10 displays our preliminary FY '11 Q4 P&L with the comparison to Q4 FY '10 on a continuing ops basis. Revenue is flat, margin lower primarily due to the NHS adjustment but largely offset by lower corporate G&A and interest expense. A much higher assumed FY '11 tax rate is creating the significant year-over-year disparity in EPS. 
Chart 11 displays the full year P&L comparison. The lower OI in FY '11 is primarily the result of the Nordics corrections and the NHS adjustment. Lower corporate G&A and interest expense offset about 2/3 of the OI dilution. The significant difference in the tax rate results in a much lower EPS. 
Chart 12 displays revenue by line of business. As Mike Laphen commented earlier, we did realize a respectable revenue growth in our Commercial segments in line with our peers, but we are seeing a decline in our Public Sector revenue. 
Chart 13, operating income by line of business. You can see year-over-year reduction in MSS and BSS, driven by the Nordics and NHS adjustments discussed earlier. 
Our balance sheet on Chart 14 represents solid year-over-year improvement. By paying down our $1.5 billion fully drawn revolver, we dramatically improved our debt ratios. We entered FY '12 with ample liquidity. 
On Chart 15, you can see a significant sequential reduction in day sales outstanding or DSOs and their respectable improvement over last year. 
And as depicted on Chart 16, although we didn't match last year's 99% cash-flow-to-net-income ratio, we feel very good about the 84% given the lower NHS receipts. 
Chart 17 reiterates our FY '12 guidance with revenue growth in the 3% to 6% range, a significant improvement on OI margin and a 4% to 6% increase in EPS despite a much higher FY '12 tax rate. This does assume the NHS program proceeds within the framework of the anticipated MOU. And as the chart footnote says, this guidance excludes any impact from the pending iSOFT acquisition. We'll update our guidance after the transaction is completed. 
On Chart 18, we've taken our best shot at quarterly EPS guidance, at least for the first 2 quarters. 
So, in summary, obviously there are a lot of moving parts with many unsettled activities underway. However, the basic fundamentals of CSC are solid. We have the right strategy, technology, people and resources; and we are committed to delivering on our potential. 
Now, I'll turn it back to Bryan to start the Q&A."

And if you assume reasonable behavior in the below-the-line items of corporate G&A, interest expense and the like, you assume no additional gains from divested businesses and the numbers and you apply a 32% tax rate, I think you should zero right in on that 4.70 or 4.80 kind of number. The tax rate alone is worth about $0.40 to $0.50 year-over-year. So if you apply the FY '11 tax rate to FY '12, you could add $0.50 to that EPS and get yourself up around 25 30 real quick. So that's the best I can tell you on that. David, the story on FY '11 is really not EPS, and this is not an attempt to divert your attention away from it. The story on FY '12, and I mean FY '12 is about revenue. If we achieve the revenue growth we're expecting, the EPS numbers are going to be significantly perpetrated by whatever happens with the iSOFT acquisition, assuming it closes and when it closes. We'll be converting IFRS to the GAAP. There'll be significant adjustments in the accounting which will affect EPS, including spending integration costs. So not to divert you away from the EPS number, but if you want to think about us, think about the revenue, whether it's achievable, et cetera. The rest of it will fall the to the bottom line as it does. And yes, the tax rate can move around another thing. But for now, that 4.70 and 4.8 is in the proper ballpark given the revenue ranges and margin ranges we're giving here."

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us today. As I'm sure you've seen in our earnings release, we are presenting preliminary unaudited financial results today, with the expected completion of our audit and filing of our 10-K by no later than June 15. 
This delay is necessary to allow our audit committee to accomplish some additional investigative work related to our previously disclosed accounting irregularities in our MSS Nordics Region and to allow our auditors to then finalize the audit. We have filed a Form 12b-25 with the SEC today confirming that we expect to file our 10-K by no later than June 15. 
Although fiscal year '11 was challenging given the NHS uncertainty, the unexpected difficulties in the Nordics, and the delays in the federal budgets, we are pleased with the positive revenue growth in our Commercial business both sequentially and year-over-year. Importantly, excluding these challenges, our underlying business is where we said it would be in terms of operating margin and free cash flow. 
Additionally, we significantly strengthened our balance sheet by paying down debt, initiating the payment of a dividend, defined and activated an open market stock buyback program and secured a new backstop credit facility. We also continued to implement our strategy with positive results that signaled we're on the right path for future success. Our acquisitions have been focused on our high-growth segments in cybersecurity, acquiring important intellectual property for our healthcare vertical, and expanding in Brazil, a key geography. 
With respect to new business, our fiscal year '11 bookings totaled $14 billion. As we indicated at our recent investor's conference, circumstances did not accommodate the timeframe we and our clients had envisioned for some $2 billion of additional awards. Of this amount, we are pursuing approximately $1.7 billion of pending awards which are either sole source or for which we have been down selected and are the only party in active client negotiations. 
Additionally, there were further delays of some $1 billion of U.S. federal government opportunities who award announcements were anticipated to have closed in the fourth quarter. In the first few weeks of April, 4 of these opportunities worth approximately $200 million were awarded to CSC. These and the other said file will now be booked as fiscal year '12 awards. 
Cash performance for fiscal year '11 was solid, as we delivered $620 million in free cash flow. While this is only 84% of net income, the performance in the rest of the business overcame 25 of the 35 points of negative cash impact resulting from the NHS program. 
With respect to the NHS program, as you know, we've been in protracted negotiations on a nonbinding agreement in principal or MOU to realign our contract with the direction the NHS wants to take the program. The U.K. government is currently conducting a review of the entire NHS national program. The proposed MOU terms are included within the scope of this review and, therefore, signing an agreement is dependent upon the completion of the government's process. The financial impact of our proposed MOU terms are included in our Q4 and full year results. Mike Mancuso will provide further details in his comments. 
Our commercial markets continued to improve throughout fiscal year '11. Our MSS and BSS segments each delivered positive year-over-year growth in every quarter throughout fiscal year '11 as reported. Overall, Commercial business grew 2.7% for the fourth quarter and 2.2% for the full year as reported and inclusive of all NHS impacts. 
Our pipeline for commercial opportunities stands at $16 billion with several deals in the late stages of negotiation. These, together with some of the late wins in the fourth quarter, will provide the opportunity for revenue ramp-ups in fiscal year '12.
In summary, our commercial markets have turned positive and our Commercial business is growing. Setting aside the Nordics and the onetime adjustments in the NHS program, the underlying profitability of the current portfolio in fiscal year '11 was about 9%. This provides a constructive basis for a positive overall result in fiscal year '12. 
Turning then to our U.S. Federal business, Throughout our fourth quarter, the U.S. federal government operated without an agreed budget. Our government clients remained unsure of their fiscal situation and were unable to initiate new programs while operating under continuing resolutions. Those awards that were announced continued to be heavily contested with further substantial delays caused by contract protests. As a result, basic market operating efficiency slowed tremendously, impacting both revenue and booking projections. 
Adding to these uncertainties, many companies operating in the U.S. federal market have been required to divest business units due to government concerns over organizational conflicts of interest or OCI. We were similarly impacted. And as a result, in fiscal year '11, we divested 2 business units due to these OCI concerns. The financial impacts of these actions are expressed as discontinued operations in our fourth quarter and full year results. 
As we look forward, the U.S. federal market remains an attractive $500 billion marketplace. Within this market, we expect the top line IT budgets will be slightly positive. However, within that spend, there will be significant shift in the type of mix of spending as IT departments focus on achieving greater efficiencies. We believe these shifts in expenditures are favorable to the types of services or offerings that CSC provides and represents an opportunity for our Public Sector business. 
Additionally, our Strategic Market segments continue to grow and we plan to continue to invest in these high-growth market segments, which include data center consolidation, virtualization and cloud, health IT, cybersecurity, and identity and privacy. 
Currently, we have more than $6 billion in submitted proposals awaiting award by the government and a 12-month pipeline of some $20 billion of opportunities, more than half of which are in our selected high-growth segments. Given the approved DOD budget for the remainder of the government fiscal year, we are hopeful that some of our clients will now be able to announce awards more expeditiously. 
In summary, uncertainty still exists within our federal market while our commercial markets have continued to strengthen. We are projecting top line growth for fiscal year '12 in the range of 3% to 6% based on a range of 0% to 3% for the Federal business and 5% to 8% for our Commercial business. We expect slightly higher EPS growth in the range of 4% to 6% based on continuing improvement and mix cost controls and execution improvements. 
Our forecasting and operating margins in the range of 8.75% to 9.25% given our normalized performance of 9% in fiscal year '11 and the absence of further Nordic or NHS adjustments. We're also projecting cash performance will return to our normal projection of greater than 90% of net income. 
I'll now turn it over to Mike Mancuso for further details of our fourth quarter results and our outlook for fiscal year '12."
263093,129590742,131735,"Computer Sciences Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, May 25, 2011",2011-05-25,"Earnings Calls","DXC Technology Company","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon. Let's get right to the numbers. I'll begin with Chart 8, which at a high level attempts to walk you from our February 9 guidance through the significant changes that led to our May 2 revised guidance, and to our prelimina",813,"Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon. Let's get right to the numbers. I'll begin with Chart 8, which at a high level attempts to walk you from our February 9 guidance through the significant changes that led to our May 2 revised guidance, and to our preliminary FY '11 results. 
When we issued the February guidance, we did not contemplate the discontinued operations accounting treatment of the gains on the sale of the 2 businesses, one sale that had occurred in our first half and the second that was anticipated in our fourth quarter. The gains were large enough to classify as discontinued operations. For the purposes of this chart, the guidance includes the disco ops revenue, margin, and EPS. The preliminary results revenue excludes disco ops. As noted on the chart, the preliminary EPS results includes the disco ops gains, which were assumed in our February guidance. 
We were also very clear in February that our guidance did not include any impact from the NHS MOU negotiations. Other than the NHS impact, the other single most significant change from our February guidance is a 100-plus basis point increase in our tax rate which accounts for most of the $0.11 in the middle column on the chart. There are a myriad of other plus and minuses in that $0.11, including a Nordics-related prior period adjustment of approximately $0.04. 
With regard to NHS, we will not get into the details of the MOU-related changes, but I do want to clarify some confusion around surrounding the $0.34 EPS adjustment. It represents an inception to date margin adjustment on the previously recognized revenue. In other words, the anticipated overall estimated margin on the program at completion is now lower than what we had historically booked. But to remind you, the assumed margin rate is accretive to the FY '14 target we discussed at our May 11 Investors Conference. And before I get off this chart, I want to direct your attention to the free cash flow anticipated 84% result despite the negative 35% NHS impact. 
Now if you'll turn to Chart 9, we expect bookings of $14 billion in FY '11, and $17 billion in FY '12. Mike Laphen gave you the insight into the FY '11 performance. Bookings in our business tend to be very lumpy. And to remind you, the MSS FY '10 actual of $8.7 billion included the $2.9 billion Zürich booking. 
Chart 10 displays our preliminary FY '11 Q4 P&L with a comparison to Q4 FY '10 on a continuing ops basis. Revenue is flat, margin lower, primarily due to the NHS adjustment but largely offset by lower corporate G&A and interest expense. A much higher assumed FY '11 tax rate is creating the significant year-over-year disparity in EPS. 
Chart 11 displays the full year P&L comparison. The lower OI in FY '11 is primarily the result of the Nordics corrections and the NHS adjustment. Lower corporate G&A and interest expense offset about 2/3 of the OI dilution. The significant difference in the tax rate results in a much lower EPS. 
Chart 12 displays revenue by line of business. As Mike Laphen commented earlier, we did realize a respectable revenue growth in our Commercial segments in line with our peers, but we are seeing a decline in our Public Sector revenue. 
Chart 13, operating income by line of business. You can see year-over-year reduction in MSS and BSS, driven by the Nordics and NHS adjustments discussed earlier. 
Our balance sheet on Chart 14 represents solid year-over-year improvement. By paying down our $1.5 billion fully drawn revolver, we dramatically improved our debt ratios. We entered FY '12 with ample liquidity. 
On Chart 15, you can see a significant sequential reduction in day sales outstanding or DSOs, and a respectable improvement over last year. 
And as depicted on Chart 16, although we didn't match last year's 99% free cash flow to net income ratio, we feel very good about the 84% given the lower NHS receipts. 
Chart 17 reiterates our FY '12 guidance, with revenue growth in the 3% to 6% range, a significant improvement on OI margin and a 4% to 6% increase in EPS despite a much higher FY '12 tax rate. This does assume the NHS program proceeds within the framework of the anticipated MOU. And as the chart footnote says, this guidance excludes any impact from the pending iSOFT acquisition. We'll update our guidance after the transaction is completed. 
On Chart 18, we've taken our best shot at quarterly EPS guidance, at least for the first 2 quarters. 
So, in summary, obviously there are a lot of moving parts with many unsettled activities underway. However, the basic fundamentals of CSC are solid. We have the right strategy, technology, people and resources; and we are committed to delivering on our potential. 
Now, I'll turn it back to Bryan to start the Q&A."

And if you assume reasonable behavior in the below-the-line items of corporate G&A, interest expense and the like, you assume no additional gains from divested businesses and the numbers, and you apply a 32% tax rate, I think you should zero right in on that 4.70 or 4.80 kind of number. The tax rate alone is worth about $0.40 to $0.50 year-over-year. So if we apply the FY '11 tax rate to FY '12, you could add $0.50 to that EPS and get yourself up around 25 30 real quick. So that's the best I can tell you on that. David, the story on FY '11 is really not EPS, and this is not an attempt to divert your attention away from it. The story on FY '12, and I mean FY '12, is about revenue. If we achieve the revenue growth we're expecting, the EPS numbers are going to be significantly perturbated by whatever happens with the iSOFT acquisition, assuming it closes and when it closes. We'll be converting IFRS to the GAAP. There'll be significant adjustments in the accounting which will affect EPS, including spending integration costs. So not to divert you away from the EPS number, but if you want to think about us, think about the revenue, whether it's achievable, et cetera. The rest of it will fall to the bottom line as it does. And yes, the tax rate can move around another thing. But for now, that 4.70 to 4.80 is in the proper ballpark given the revenue ranges and margin ranges we're giving you."

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us today. As I'm sure you've seen in our earnings release, we are presenting preliminary unaudited financial results today, with the expected completion of our audit and filing of our 10-K by no later than June 15. 
This delay is necessary to allow our audit committee to accomplish some additional investigative work related to our previously disclosed accounting irregularities in our MSS Nordics Region and to allow our auditors to then finalize the audit. We have filed a Form 12b-25 with the SEC today confirming that we expect to file our 10-K by no later than June 15. 
Although fiscal year '11 was challenging given the NHS uncertainty, the unexpected difficulties in the Nordics, and the delays in the federal budgets, we are pleased with the positive revenue growth in our Commercial business both sequentially and year-over-year. Importantly, excluding these challenges, our underlying business is where we said it would be in terms of operating margin and free cash flow. 
Additionally, we significantly strengthened our balance sheet by paying down debt, initiated the payment of a dividend, defined and activated an open market stock buyback program and secured a new backstop credit facility. We also continued to implement our strategy with positive results that signaled we're on the right path for future success. Our acquisitions have been focused on our high-growth segments in cybersecurity, acquiring important intellectual property for our healthcare vertical, and expanding in Brazil, a key geography. 
With respect to new business, our fiscal year '11 bookings totaled $14 billion. As we indicated at our recent investor's conference, circumstances did not accommodate the timeframe we and our clients had envisioned for some $2 billion of additional awards. Of this amount, we are pursuing approximately $1.7 billion of pending awards which are either sole source or for which we have been down selected and are the only party in active client negotiations. 
Additionally, there were further delays of some $1 billion of U.S. federal government opportunities who award announcements were anticipated to have closed in the fourth quarter. In the first few weeks of April, 4 of these opportunities worth approximately $200 million were awarded to CSC. These and the other said file will now be booked as fiscal year '12 awards. 
Cash performance for fiscal year '11 was solid, as we delivered $620 million in free cash flow. While this is only 84% of net income, the performance in the rest of the business overcame 25 of the 35 points of negative cash impact resulting from the NHS program. 
With respect to the NHS program, as you know, we've been in protracted negotiations on a nonbinding agreement in principle or MOU to realign our contract with the direction the NHS wants to take the program. The U.K. government is currently conducting a review of the entire NHS national program. The proposed MOU terms are included within the scope of this review and, therefore, signing an agreement is dependent upon the completion of the government's process. The financial impact of our proposed MOU terms are included in our Q4 and full year results. Mike Mancuso will provide further details in his comments. 
Our commercial markets continued to improve throughout fiscal year '11. Our MSS and BSS segments each delivered positive year-over-year growth in every quarter throughout fiscal year '11 as reported. Overall, Commercial business grew 2.7% for the fourth quarter and 2.2% for the full year as reported and inclusive of all NHS impacts. 
Our pipeline for commercial opportunities stands at $16 billion with several deals in the late stages of negotiation. These, together with some of the late wins in the fourth quarter, will provide the opportunity for revenue ramp-ups in fiscal year '12.
In summary, our commercial markets have turned positive and our Commercial business is growing. Setting aside the Nordics and the onetime adjustments in the NHS program, the underlying profitability of the current portfolio in fiscal year '11 was about 9%. This provides a constructive basis for a positive overall result in fiscal year '12. 
Turning then to our U.S. Federal business. Throughout our fourth quarter, the U.S. federal government operated without an agreed budget. Our government clients remained unsure of their fiscal situation and were unable to initiate new programs while operating under continuing resolutions. Those awards that were announced continued to be heavily contested with further substantial delays caused by contract protests. As a result, basic market operating conditions slowed tremendously, impacting both revenue and booking projections. 
Adding to these uncertainties, many companies operating in the U.S. federal market have been required to divest business units due to government concerns over organizational conflicts of interest or OCI. We were similarly impacted. And as a result, in fiscal year '11, we divested 2 business units due to these OCI concerns. The financial impacts of these actions are expressed as discontinued operations in our fourth quarter and full year results. 
As we look forward, the U.S. federal market remains an attractive $500 billion marketplace. Within this market, we expect the top line IT budgets will be slightly positive. However, within that spend, there will be significant shift in the type of mix of spending as IT departments focus on achieving greater efficiencies. We believe these shifts in expenditures are favorable to the types of services or offerings that CSC provides and represents an opportunity for our Public Sector business. 
Additionally, our Strategic Market segments continue to grow and we plan to continue to invest in these high-growth market segments, which include data center consolidation, virtualization and cloud, health IT, cybersecurity, and identity and privacy. 
Currently, we have more than $6 billion in submitted proposals awaiting award by the government and a 12-month pipeline of some $20 billion of opportunities, more than half of which are in our selected high-growth segments. Given the approved DOD budget for the remainder of the government fiscal year, we are hopeful that some of our clients will now be able to announce awards more expeditiously. 
In summary, uncertainty still exists within our federal market while our commercial markets have continued to strengthen. We are projecting top line growth for fiscal year '12 in the range of 3% to 6% based on a range of 0% to 3% for the Federal business and 5% to 8% for our Commercial business. We expect slightly higher EPS growth in the range of 4% to 6% based on continuing improvement and mix cost controls and execution improvements, our forecasting and operating margins in the range of 8.75% to 9.25% given our normalized performance of 9% in fiscal year '11 and the absence of further Nordic or NHS adjustments. We're also projecting cash performance will return to our normal projection of greater than 90% of net income. 
I'll now turn it over to Mike Mancuso for further details of our fourth quarter results and our outlook for fiscal year '12."
263093,129590742,131746,"Computer Sciences Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, May 25, 2011",2011-05-25,"Earnings Calls","DXC Technology Company","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon. Let's get right to the numbers. I'll begin with Chart 8, which at a high level attempts to walk you from our February 9 guidance through the significant changes that led to our May 2 revised guidance, and to our prelimina",812,"Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon. Let's get right to the numbers. I'll begin with Chart 8, which at a high level attempts to walk you from our February 9 guidance through the significant changes that led to our May 2 revised guidance, and to our preliminary FY '11 results. 
When we issued the February guidance, we did not contemplate the discontinued operations accounting treatment of the gains on the sale of the 2 businesses, one sale that had occurred in our first half and the second that was anticipated in our fourth quarter. The gains were large enough to classify as discontinued operations. For the purposes of this chart, the guidance includes the disco ops revenue, margin and EPS. The preliminary results revenue excludes disco ops. As noted on the chart, the preliminary EPS results includes the disco ops gains, which were assumed in our February guidance. 
We were also very clear in February that our guidance did not include any impact from the NHS MOU negotiations. Other than the NHS impact, the other single most significant change from our February guidance is a 100-plus basis point increase in our tax rate which accounts for most of the $0.11 in the middle column on the chart. There are a myriad of other plus and minuses in that $0.11, including a Nordics-related prior period adjustment of approximately $0.04. 
With regard to NHS, we will not get into the details of the MOU-related changes, but I do want to clarify some confusion around surrounding the $0.34 EPS adjustment. It represents an inception to date margin adjustment on the previously recognized revenue. In other words, the anticipated overall estimated margin on the program at completion is now lower than what we had historically booked. But to remind you, the assumed margin rate is accretive to the FY '14 target we discussed at our May 11 Investors Conference. And before I get off this chart, I want to direct your attention to the free cash flow anticipated 84% result despite the negative 35% NHS impact. 
Now if you'll turn to Chart 9, we expect bookings of $14 billion in FY '11, and $17 billion in FY '12. Mike Laphen gave you the insight into the FY '11 performance. Bookings in our business tend to be very lumpy. And to remind you, the MSS FY '10 actual of $8.7 billion included the $2.9 billion Zürich booking. 
Chart 10 displays our preliminary FY '11 Q4 P&L with a comparison to Q4 FY '10 on a continuing ops basis. Revenue is flat, margin lower, primarily due to the NHS adjustment but largely offset by lower corporate G&A and interest expense. A much higher assumed FY '11 tax rate is creating the significant year-over-year disparity in EPS. 
Chart 11 displays the full year P&L comparison. The lower OI in FY '11 is primarily the result of the Nordics corrections and the NHS adjustment. Lower corporate G&A and interest expense offset about 2/3 of the OI dilution. The significant difference in the tax rate results in a much lower EPS. 
Chart 12 displays revenue by line of business. As Mike Laphen commented earlier, we did realize respectable revenue growth in our Commercial segments in line with our peers, but we are seeing a decline in our Public Sector revenue. 
Chart 13, operating income by line of business. You can see year-over-year reduction in MSS and BSS, driven by the Nordics and NHS adjustments discussed earlier. 
Our balance sheet on Chart 14 represents solid year-over-year improvement. By paying down our $1.5 billion fully drawn revolver, we dramatically improved our debt ratios. We entered FY '12 with ample liquidity. 
On Chart 15, you can see a significant sequential reduction in day sales outstanding or DSOs, and a respectable improvement over last year. 
And as depicted on Chart 16, although we didn't match last year's 99% free cash flow to net income ratio, we feel very good about the 84% given the lower NHS receipts. 
Chart 17 reiterates our FY '12 guidance, with revenue growth in the 3% to 6% range, a significant improvement on OI margin and a 4% to 6% increase in EPS despite a much higher FY '12 tax rate. This does assume the NHS program proceeds within the framework of the anticipated MOU. And as the chart footnote says, this guidance excludes any impact from the pending iSOFT acquisition. We'll update our guidance after the transaction is completed. 
On Chart 18, we've taken our best shot at quarterly EPS guidance, at least for the first 2 quarters. 
So, in summary, obviously there are a lot of moving parts with many unsettled activities underway. However, the basic fundamentals of CSC are solid. We have the right strategy, technology, people and resources, and we are committed to delivering on our potential. 
Now, I'll turn it back to Bryan to start the Q&A."

And if you assume reasonable behavior in the below-the-line items of corporate G&A, interest expense and the like, you assume no additional gains from divested businesses in the numbers, and you apply a 32% tax rate, I think you should zero right in on that $4.70 or $4.80 kind of number. The tax rate alone is worth about $0.40 to $0.50 year-over-year. So if we apply the FY '11 tax rate to FY '12, you could add $0.50 to that EPS and get yourself up around $5.25, $5.30 real quick. So that's the best I can tell you on that. David, the story on FY '11 is really not EPS, and this is not an attempt to divert your attention away from it. The story on FY '12, and I mean FY '12, is about revenue. If we achieve the revenue growth we're expecting, the EPS numbers are going to be significantly perturbated by whatever happens with the iSOFT acquisition, assuming it closes and when it closes. We'll be converting IFRS to GAAP. There'll be significant adjustments in the accounting which will affect EPS, including spending integration costs. So not to divert you away from the EPS number, but if you want to think about us, think about the revenue, whether it's achievable, et cetera, et cetera. The rest of it will fall to the bottom line as it does. And yes, the tax rate can move around, kind of thing. But for now, that $4.70 to $4.80 is in the proper ballpark given the revenue ranges and margin ranges we're giving you."

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us today. In addition to covering our financial performance for the first quarter of our fiscal year 2012, I will provide some further insight into our recently announced acquisition of iSOFT an update of the status of our NHS program and our new business bookings. At the end of July, we successfully completed our acquisition of iSOFT Group Limited. This strategic acquisition brings to CSC approximately 3,000 health care IT skilled employees, including those from major research and development centers in India, Spain, the U.K., Australia, New Zealand Central Europe. We also gained roughly 200 qualified health care administrators and some 100 clinical practitioners, as well as 100 premium health care software products to add to CSC's portfolio. These assets in combination with CSC's existing health care capabilities, intellectual property and client base create a vertical business unit that operates at all levels of the health care value chain. This includes individual patient care to national government settings across both payers and providers with offerings spanning from consultancy engagements to solution, design, delivery, and technology and business process outsourcing. Strategically, our health care vertical now has a strong foundation of IP to leverage, much as we do with our very successful financial services vertical. Geographically and iSOFT coverage of the global markets complements that of CSC. The combined entity provide solid market positions in North America, the U.K., Central Europe, Australia and New Zealand, as well as IP-end solutions necessary to enhance expansion within Asia, South America and the Middle East. Acquisition-related costs, including the requisite accounting treatments for conversion from international standards to GAAP as well as integration costs, result in a dilutive effect in the current fiscal year. In subsequent years, we expect this business to generate double-digit margins and be accretive on a pro forma basis. Mike Mancuso will provide you with additional insight during this presentations.
Turning to NHS. We continue to execute and deliver against our current commitments across both primary and secondary care. Lorenzo remains in production routinely supporting daily operations at SunTrust, including the 3 early adopters sites released 1.9. We are progressing the next set delivery modules includes emergency care and outpatient prescribing, which are anticipated to be installed at the University hospitals Morecambe Bay once an agreement is reached with the authority. As we reported, finalization of an NIU remains dependent upon the completion of the U.K. government's review process. HSS has indicated that they will be scheduling a September meeting with CSC to discuss the program. 
Moving now to new business. Our year-to-date bookings as of Monday totaled $4.1 billion with $2.3 billion of that total occurring in our first quarter. Additionally, there is a further $1.4 billion of awards for which we have been down selected to 1 were already the only party in the negotiations. We currently anticipate closing the second quarter at approximately the midpoint of our full year guidance.
Key new awards include a significant new outsourcing contract with the  steel producer, ArcelorMittal, expansion of our outsourcing relationship with a major consumer goods company to include application services, and in the federal sector, a new contract for the World Trade Center health program to support health treatment for emergency responders, recovery and cleanup workers, and others who were adversely affected by the terrorist attack of 911. Turning now to the public sector. NPS revenues declined 2.4% quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by the completion of our support of last year's U.S. census, which occurs once every 10 years. We are experienced growth in areas aligned with key government priorities including more than $600 million in key wins in fiscal year 2011 at Health and Human Services. Continued success of winning tests on the Department of State Global Support Strategy for overseas consular support services and our expansion in activities in beta consider consolidation and cloud activities with our public sector clients. Currently over 60% of our fiscal year '12 pipeline lies within our identified high-growth market segments. These market segments in health, cybersecurity, identity management, data center consolidation and cloud services are continuing to grow at about market rates, partially offsetting the reductions in pressures in other areas of our U.S. public sector portfolio. Across the customer base in our U.S. government market budget uncertainties in conjunction with the prolonged debate around the debt limit continued to create delays in awarding new initiatives. The trend toward smaller awards and the increased use of ID/IQ contract vehicles continue. Currently, NPS has a substantial backlog of approximately $4.6 billion of submitted proposals scheduled for award in our fiscal year 2012. At the end of the first quarter, pipeline through U.S. public sector were scheduled for year '12 stands at $11 million, with $2.9 million of those scheduled for award within our second quarter. For the full year, we expect NPS will continue to generate solid profitable cash flows with essentially flat full year revenues.
Consistent with recent improvements in our commercial pipeline, top line revenue growth in our first quarter of our BSS segment was 17% as reported, and 8% on a constant-currency basis. Demand for consulting services were strong in North America, Brazil, Australia and selected markets in EMEA. Our financial services vertical continues to perform well with first quarter year-over-year growth of 14% as reported. Overall commercial growth was 6.7% on an as reported basis as the strong revenue performance from BSS was offset by a weaker MSS event. Managed services sector first quarter revenue increase of 1.3% year-over-year was aided by currency tailwinds. Recent delays and softness in contract awards contributed to the decline in constant currency revenues. However, for the full year, we anticipate revenues comparable to last year.
As you have seen in our press release, and NOI margin declined in our first quarter driven primarily the performance of our MSS business unit. MSS issues included normal first quarter workforce rationalizations, additional expenses required to offset the Nordic strike related actions, higher than expected program and start up transition costs, and an adverse EAC adjustment. In spite of these MSS difficulties and increased legal fees, we delivered strong EPS growth year-over-year as a result of our continued focus on the efficient effective management of tax globally. For the full fiscal year, we have revised our margin guidance to reflect the anticipated effects of the iSOFT acquisition, increased legal fees and the MSS performance issues discussed earlier. We expect our improved tax efficiency will offset the dilutive first year impact of our iSOFT acquisition. Consequently, our full year guidance for bookings revenue, cash and EPS remains intact.
I'll now turn it over to Mike Mancuso for further details of our first quarter results, the financial impacts of the iSOFT acquisition and our outlook for the remainder of fiscal year '12."

The good news is the strong commercial revenue growth in our BSS segment. I'll have more to say on revenue a little later. Operating income declined significantly in our MSS segment. The margins in our other 2 segments were about where we expected, with the variation on mix and timing affecting the absolute rate. Our tax rate for the quarter offset the impacts of the MSS margin performance and the higher corporate G&A, resulting in a sizable increase in EPS versus last year and our earlier guidance. I'll add more color to these areas as we get further into my charts.
Now if you'll turn to Chart 8 labeled new business booking. Historically, in our business as the FY '11 data suggests, the booking profile is lumpy with no real predictable pattern. We booked $2.3 billion in this Q1. And for Q2 to date, we have booked 1.8 in have been down selected for another $1.4 billion, and we believe we will capture another $2.8 billion by the end of September. So our best estimate for Q2 is $6 billion, which would give us $8.3 billion at the halfway mark. And we are still of the view that $17 billion is achievable for the full year. However, if the world economic conditions weaken further and U.S. government spending is further disrupted, then the $17 billion becomes more challenging. But for now, it's our best estimate.
Chart 9 talks to our EPS for the quarter relative to our guidance. We offered the Q1 guidance on May 25, we considered the labor situation in the Nordics, corporate G&A potential increases, et cetera, and we guided accordingly. As it turned out, tax planning initiatives progressed favorably, driving our tax rate into negative territory, resulting in a sizable tax benefit that more than offset the unanticipated MSS program issues and corporate G&A increase.
Chart 10 addresses revenue highlighted business and compares it to Q1 FY '11. On a GAAP basis, revenue grew by 3% and declined by 1.6% in constant currency, with the BSS segment growing at 17% and 8%, respectively, for the reasons Michael Laphen noted in his remarks.
Chart 11 displays operating income by segment. As we discussed, the decline in MSS accounts for the year-over-year decrease. I also need to remind you that we report the NHS contract and the BSS segment and the margin rate on that contract was higher in Q1 of FY '11. You will recall we adjusted that margin downward in Q4 FY '11 and the NHS contract is recorded at the lower rate in this quarter.
Turning to Chart 12, the P&L statement for the quarter with comparison to last year. You can see the lower operating income and higher corporate G&A is more than offset by the lower tax rate, resulting in a $0.29 increase in continuing ops EPS over last year.
Chart 13 reflects selected balance sheet accounts with comparisons to last year. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter of $1.7 billion when compared to last year is lower primarily because we paid off our $1.5 billion fully drawn bank line subsequent to Q1 FY '11, debt is lower as a result, and our debt to capital ratios continued to improve.
Chart 14 shows our DSO position for the last several quarters. On average, we have improved by 1 day relative to Q1 of last year.
Now to the hard part, the full year guidance. Chart 15 is a walk from our May 25 full year EPS guidance to our updated guidance, which as you can see, is unchanged. Moving left to right, for now, we are forecasting a tax rate of 20% versus the earlier guidance of 32%, which generates an $0.82 EPS benefit. Our increased corporate G&A, driven primarily by a legal fees coupled with the MSS performance issues, results in a $0.27 decrease such that excluding iSOFT, our EPS would climb to a range of $5.25 to $5.35. We have been very clear that our guidance always excluded the iSOFT acquisition. And assuming the transaction received regulatory approval, it would be dilutive to our EPS in the first year. The dilution results from the conversion of iSOFT from IFRS, International Financial Reporting Standards, to GAAP and the amortization impact of intangible assets and our own integration spend. The iSOFT transaction closed on July 29. Australian regulatory requirements restricted our preclosing access to iSOFT though we are now deep into the purchase accounting details by contract, region, et cetera. We estimate and I underscore estimate that iSOFT will dilute our EPS by $0.55 this year. On a pro forma basis, excluding the after mentioned purchase accounting adjustments, iSOFT will yield double-digit operating margins in FY '13 and beyond.
So somewhat coincidentally, if we adjust FY '12 guidance for the inclusion of iSOFT, we come back to the range of $4.70 to $4.80 EPS. Now the next challenge is to estimate how the iSOFT dilution will fall by quarter. Chart 16 reflects our best estimate at this time of Q2 EPS with and without iSOFT. It's a dollar rate excluding and $0.58 to $0.78 including. Let me say one final word of caution about FY '12 guidance. As you know, there are a number of large balls still in the air principally the NHS contract, MSS performance, the iSOFT integration, federal government spending, our ongoing SEC investigation and our ADR process with the federal government to name a few.
Now if you'll turn to Chart 17, I'll summarize our position on guidance. We are expressing our current guidance including and excluding iSOFT. We think $17 billion of bookings is achievable. On revenue, iSOFT will contribute on a GAAP basis approximately $150 million this year. The midpoint of our range is 16, 750. So iSOFT's inclusion is within our current range. My got the stage message is that our business is sound. We have one of the strong this balance sheets in our industry. In fact, this morning, S&P issued a press release removing us from CreditWatch and affirming our A- rating. We will perform our way through the challenges on our plate. We'll continue to focus on cash generation and provide meaningful returns to our shareholders. Now I'll turn it back to Bryan to initiate the Q&A."

On the other hand, in the business solutions side, we continued to see the a demand for offerings that improve the top line as well as the bottom line and particularly from an industry perspective. And barring a significant downturn in the macroeconomic picture, I think we will continue to see that. We have purposely positioned ourselves for that market. As I said, our financial services vertical is doing very well in that market. And the acquisition of iSOFT and the IP that's associated with that positions us in the same manner in the health care market as it did for, as we are in the financial services. So we see CSC and industry in general, the IT services industry in general, I believe are in a significant transition and we're all working our way through this."

There's always a lot of puts and takes but let me break this down into 3 major tranches to help give a little bit more visibility and clarity on it. The first element was a significant amount of costs in the Nordics Region to support our efforts to be able to realign and rationalize the workforce in the Nordics to put us back in a more competitive situation. That involved a strike by that workforce. It went to court, with the court ruled favorably for CSC, which we are extremely pleased about. So therefore, we now have the ability going forward to rationalize the workforce at a significantly lower cost as well. Unfortunately, we had to infuse an incremental higher level of external resources to keep the business running while the CSC contingent that was on strike was out of the facility. So that one from a standpoint of the incremental costs is behind us. But I would say that the benefits will take place in the upcoming quarters and into next year in terms of being able to rationalize workforce, we have some constraints on some of the timing there. But it's exceptionally better than what it was, so again, we are pleased with that, and I would say that one is behind us. A second major tranche that contributed to it was a EAC adjustment on a classified program, and that simply is we -- as we went through the quarter, it surfaced at the delivery timetable that they were signed up for with the customer they were not going to be and it acquired incremental time to do that and there were some penalties associated with that. We have taken the EAC hit that we believe covers the issue there. The classified program, Mike as why didn't we catch it, it is a lot more difficult actually to get the visibility of our quality assurance people on a classified program and this was a classified program overseas as well, so it was sort of unique, but we believe we have that one behind us as well. The final one is a start-up transition outsourcing program. We are performing very well. It's amicable with the customer but it's costing us more than we expected it to cost us. I expect that will continue to bleed in somewhat into Q2. So those are 3 major things. So David, what I would say is that if you look at MSS profitability on a whole, what I would suggest you would take away is that we expect our profitability for the full year to be in excess of what was reported last year for MSS just to give you some parameter. It will be somewhat less and if you normalize it for the Nordics reduction. So unfortunately, we will not recover the full Nordics impact, if you will, because of these other things. But still very profitable, very sound business and unfortunate stumbles here."

I think we've got out in front of the cloud very well, and I think we get a lot of kudos for that. So as the outsourcing morph, which it is in the process of doing, we will morph with it and hopefully stay one step ahead of it."

I think first of all, I think you have to recognize 2 macro market forces that are impacting our bookings, and I think others as well. First of all, in the federal marketplace, we continued to be impacted by the budgetary uncertainties that are involved there. Obviously, the full second half of our last fiscal year which ended at the end of March, there was no federal budgets in place we're just continuing resolutions which dramatically impacted the bookings process. Even as we go through our first half of the fiscal year here, the civil agencies still operate under continuing resolutions are there are still somewhat of an impact there. And as we said the, I think there has been softness in the outsourcing market as people sort their way through exactly what they want to do. I think quite frankly, if we are successful on booking what we currently see as likely for the second quarter, I think that's going to be an extremely good picture and positions for the remainder of the fiscal year. I think, Mike pointed out that we were still facing uncertainties here. If we go through another government fiscal year where they can't get their act together and get a budget. We could again, get impacted and then the broader macro picture that we're all dealing with in terms of the U.S. credit rating and the fallout from all that, that could at some point hit our commercial and discretionary spend business. So Mike, you want to add anything on there?"

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us today. In addition to covering our financial performance for the first quarter of our fiscal year 2012, I will provide some further insight into our recently announced acquisition of iSOFT, an update on the status of our NHS program and our new business bookings. 
At the end of July, we successfully completed our acquisition of iSOFT Group Limited. This strategic acquisition brings to CSC approximately 3,000 health care IT skilled employees including those from major research and development centers in India, Spain, the U.K., Australia, New Zealand and Central Europe. We also gained roughly 200 qualified health care administrators and some 100 clinical practitioners, as well as 100 premium health care software products to add to CSC's portfolio. These assets, in combination with CSC's existing health care capabilities, intellectual property and client base create a vertical business unit that operates at all levels of the health care value chain. This includes individual patient care to national government settings across both payers and providers with offerings spanning from consultancy engagements to solution, design, delivery and technology and business process outsourcing. Strategically, our health care vertical now has a strong foundation of IP to leverage, much as we do with our very successful financial services vertical. 
Geographically, iSOFT's coverage of the global markets complements that of CSC. The combined entity provide solid market positions in North America, the U.K., Central Europe, Australia and New Zealand, as well as IP and solutions necessary to enhance expansion within Asia, South America and the Middle East. Acquisition-related costs, including the requisite accounting treatments for conversion from international standards to GAAP, as well as integration costs, result in a dilutive effect in the current fiscal year. In subsequent years, we expect this business to generate double-digit margins and be accretive on a pro forma basis. Mike Mancuso will provide you with additional insight during this presentation.
Turning to NHS. We continue to execute and deliver against our current commitments across both primary and secondary care. Lorenzo remains in production, routinely supporting daily operations at 10 trust [ph], including the 3 early adopters sites Release 1.9. We are progressing the next set of delivery modules includes emergency care and outpatient prescribing, which are anticipated to be installed at the University Hospitals Morecambe Bay once an agreement is reached with the authority. As we reported, finalization of an MLU remains dependent upon the completion of the U.K. government's review process. The NHS has indicated that they will be scheduling a September meeting with CSC to discuss the program. 
Moving now to new business. Our year-to-date bookings as of Monday totaled $4.1 billion with $2.3 billion of that total occurring in our first quarter. Additionally, there is a further $1.4 billion of awards for which we have been down selected to one, where we're the only party in the negotiations. We currently anticipate closing the second quarter at approximately the midpoint of our full year guidance.
Key new awards include a significant new outsourcing contract with the steel producer, ArcelorMittal; expansion of our outsourcing relationship with a major consumer goods company to include application services; and in the federal sector, a new contract for the World Trade Center health program to support health monitoring treatment for emergency responders, recovery and cleanup workers and others who were adversely affected by the terrorist attack of 911. 
Turning now to the public sector. NPS' revenues declined 2.4% quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by the completion of our support of last year's U.S. census, which occurs once every 10 years. We are experiencing growth in areas aligned with key government priorities including more than $600 million in key wins in fiscal year 2011 at Health and Human Services; continued success of winning tests on the Department of State Global Support Strategy for overseas consular support services; and our expansion in activities in data center consider consolidation and cloud activities with our public sector clients. Currently, over 60% of our fiscal year '12 pipeline lies within our identified high-growth market segments. These market segments in health, cybersecurity, identity management, data center consolidation and cloud services are continuing to grow at above-market rates, partially offsetting the reductions and pressures in other areas of our U.S. public sector portfolio. 
Across the customer base in our U.S. government market, budget uncertainties in conjunction with the prolonged debate around the debt limit, continued to create delays in awarding new initiatives. The trend towards smaller awards and the increased use of ID/IQ contract vehicles continue. Currently, MPS has a substantial backlog of approximately $4.6 billion of submitted proposals scheduled for award in our fiscal year 2012. At the end of the first quarter, pipelines for U.S. public sector awards scheduled for year '12 stands at $11 million, with $2.9 million of those scheduled for award within our second quarter. For the full year, we expect MPS will continue to generate solid profitable cash flows with essentially flat full year revenues.
Consistent with recent improvements in our commercial pipeline, top line revenue growth in our first quarter of our BSS segment was 17% as reported and 8% on a constant-currency basis. Demand for consulting services were strong in North America, Brazil, Australia and selected markets in EMEA. Our financial services vertical continues to perform well with first quarter year-over-year growth of 14% as reported. Overall commercial growth was 6.7% on an as-reported basis, as the strong revenue performance from BSS was offset by weaker MSS demand. Managed services sector first quarter revenue increase of 1.3% year-over-year was aided by currency tailwinds. Recent delays and softness in contract awards contributed to the decline in constant currency revenues. However, for the full year, we anticipate revenues comparable to last year.
As you have seen in our press release, OI and OI margin declined in our first quarter driven primarily the performance of our MSS business unit. MSS issues included normal first quarter workforce rationalizations, additional expenses required to offset the Nordic strike-related actions, higher-than-expected program and start-up transition costs and an adverse EAC adjustment. In spite of these MSS difficulties and increased legal fees, we delivered strong EPS growth year-over-year as a result of our continued focus on the efficient effective management of tax globally. For the full fiscal year, we have revised our margin guidance to reflect the anticipated effects of the iSOFT acquisition, increased legal fees and the MSS performance issues discussed earlier. We expect our improved tax efficiency will offset the dilutive first year EPS impact of our iSOFT acquisition. Consequently, our full year guidance for bookings revenue, cash and EPS remains intact.
I'll now turn it over to Mike Mancuso for further details of our first quarter results, the financial impacts of the iSOFT acquisition and our outlook for the remainder of fiscal year '12."

I'll begin on Chart 7. As Mike Laphen indicated, overall revenue in the quarter increased 3% as reported and declined about 2% when adjusted for currency. The good news is the strong commercial revenue growth in our BSS segment. I'll have more to say on revenue a little later. 
Operating income declined significantly in our MSS segment. The margins in our other 2 segments were about where we expected, with the variation on mix and timing affecting the absolute rate. Our tax rate for the quarter offset the impacts of the MSS margin performance and the higher corporate G&A, resulting in a sizable increase in EPS versus last year and our earlier guidance. I'll add more color to these areas as we get further into my charts.
Now if you'll turn to Chart 8 labeled, ""New Business Bookings."" Historically in our business, as the FY '11 data suggest, the booking profile is lumpy with no real predictable pattern. We booked $2.3 billion in this Q1, and for Q2-to-date, we have booked $1.8 billion, in have been down selected for another $1.4 billion, and we believe we will capture another $2.8 billion by the end of September. So our best estimate for Q2 is $6 billion, which would give us $8.3 billion at the halfway mark. And we are still of the view that $17 billion is achievable for the full year. However, if the world economic conditions weaken further and U.S. government spending is further disrupted, then the $17 billion becomes more challenging. But for now, it's our best estimate.
Chart 9 talks to our EPS for the quarter relative to our guidance. When we offered the Q1 guidance on May 25, we considered the labor situation in the Nordics, corporate G&A potential increases, et cetera, and we guided accordingly. As it turned out, tax planning initiatives progressed favorably, driving our tax rate into negative territory, resulting in a sizable tax benefit that more than offset the unanticipated MSS program issues and corporate G&A increase.
Chart 10 addresses revenue by line of business with a comparison to Q1 FY '11. On a GAAP basis, revenue grew by 3% and declined by 1.6% in constant currency, with the BSS segment growing at 17% and 8%, respectively, for the reasons Michael Laphen noted in his remarks.
Chart 11 displays operating income by segment. As we discussed, the decline in MSS accounts for the year-over-year decrease. I also need to remind you that we report the NHS contract in the BSS segment, and the margin rate on that contract was higher in Q1 of FY '11. You will recall we adjusted that margin downward in Q4 FY '11, and the NHS contract is recorded at the lower rate in this quarter.
Turning to Chart 12, the P&L statement for the quarter with comparison to last year. You can see the lower operating income and higher corporate G&A is more than offset by the lower tax rate, resulting in a $0.29 increase in continuing ops EPS over last year.
Chart 13 reflects selected balance sheet accounts with comparisons to last year. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter of $1.7 billion when compared to last year is lower primarily because we paid off our $1.5 billion fully drawn bank line subsequent to Q1 FY '11. Debt is lower as a result, and our debt-to-capital ratios continued to improve.
Chart 14 shows our DSO position for the last several quarters. On average, we have improved by one day relative to Q1 of last year.
Now to the hard part, the full year guidance. Chart 15 is a walk from our May 25 full year EPS guidance to our updated guidance, which as you can see, is unchanged. Moving left to right. For now, we are forecasting a tax rate of 20% versus the earlier guidance of 32%, which generates an $0.82 EPS benefit. Our increased corporate G&A, driven primarily by legal fees coupled with the MSS performance issues, results in a $0.27 decrease such that excluding iSOFT, our EPS would climb to a range of $5.25 to $5.35. We have been very clear that our guidance always excluded the iSOFT acquisition. And assuming the transaction received regulatory approval, it would be dilutive to our EPS in the first year. The dilution results from the conversion of iSOFT from IFRS, International Financial Reporting Standards, to GAAP and the amortization impact of intangible assets and our own integration spend. The iSOFT transaction closed on July 29. Australian regulatory requirements restricted our pre-closing access to iSOFT though we are now deep into the purchase accounting details by contract, region, et cetera. We estimate, and I underscore estimate, that iSOFT will dilute our EPS by $0.55 this year. On a pro forma basis, excluding the aforementioned purchase accounting adjustments, iSOFT will yield double-digit operating margins in FY '13 and beyond. So somewhat coincidentally, if we adjust FY '12 guidance for the inclusion of iSOFT, we come back to the range of $4.70 to $4.80 EPS. 
Now the next challenge is to estimate how the iSOFT dilution will fall by quarter. Chart 16 reflects our best estimate at this time of Q2 EPS with and without iSOFT. It's $1 rate, excluding; and $0.58 to $0.78, including. Let me say one final word of caution about FY '12 guidance. As you know, there are a number of large balls still in the air, principally the NHS contract, MSS performance, the iSOFT integration, federal government spending, our ongoing SEC investigation and our ADR process with the federal government to name a few.
Now if you'll turn to Chart 17, I'll summarize our position on guidance. We are expressing our current guidance including and excluding iSOFT. We think $17 billion of bookings is achievable. On revenue, iSOFT will contribute on a GAAP basis, approximately $150 million this year. The midpoint of our range is 16 750. So iSOFT's inclusion is within our current range. 
My get-off-the-stage message is that our business is sound. We have one of the strongest balance sheets in our industry. In fact, this morning, S&P issued a press release removing us from CreditWatch and affirming our A- rating. We will perform our way through the challenges on our plates, we'll continue to focus on cash generation and provide meaningful returns to our shareholders. 
Now I'll turn it back to Bryan to initiate the Q&A."

And barring a significant downturn in the macroeconomic picture, I think we will continue to see that. We have purposely positioned ourselves for that market.

There's always a lot of puts and takes, but let me break this down into 3 major tranches to help give a little bit more visibility and clarity on it. The first element was a significant amount of costs in the Nordics Region to support our efforts to be able to realign and rationalize the workforce in the Nordics to put us back in a more competitive situation. That involved a strike by that workforce. It went to court, with the court ruled favorably for CSC, which we are extremely pleased about. So therefore, we now have the ability, going forward, to rationalize the workforce at a significantly lower cost as well. Unfortunately, we had to infuse an incremental higher level of external resources to keep the business running while the CSC contingent that was on strike was out of the facility. So that one from a standpoint of the incremental costs is behind us. But I would say that the benefits will take place in the upcoming quarters and into next year in terms of being able to rationalize workforce. We have some constraints on some of the timing there, but it's exceptionally better than what it was. So again, we're pleased with that and I would say that one is behind us. A second major tranche that contributed to it was a EAC adjustment on a classified program, and that simply is we, as we went through the quarter, it surfaced that the delivery timetable that they were signed up for with the customer they were not going to meet and required incremental time to do that, and there were some penalties associated with that. We have taken the EAC hit that we believe covers the issue there. The classified program and you might ask why didn't we catch it, it's a little bit more, it is a lot more difficult actually to get the visibility of our quality assurance people on a classified program, and this was a classified program overseas as well, so it was sort of unique. But we believe we have that one behind us as well. The final one is a start-up transition outsourcing program. We are performing very well. It's amicable with the customer, but it's costing us more than we expected it to cost us. I expect that will continue to bleed in somewhat into Q2. So those are 3 major things. So David, what I would say is that if you look at MSS profitability on a whole, what I would suggest you would take away is that we expect our profitability for the full year to be in excess of what was reported last year for MSS just to give you some parameter. It will be somewhat less and if you normalize it for the Nordics reduction. So unfortunately, we will not recover the full Nordics impact, if you will, because of these other things, but still very profitable, very sound business and unfortunate stumbles here."

In terms of the capital structure, you might have seen that we again announced our dividend, so that dividend program continues and we anticipate that we will continue well into the future and probably gets stronger as it goes forward. Unfortunately, we have been advised by outside counsel that we need to suspend our open market buyback program until the conclusion of the audit committee's external/internal review associated with the Nordics. So that's got us -- bought that for bit of time, hopefully not too long. Other than that, I would say that we have a strategic direction that has been endorsed by the Board. I think that strategic direction is on target. I think that our performance in the BSS, along with our acquisition of iSOFT to further build our vertical businesses, is right on target. I think we've got out in front of the cloud very well, and I think we get a lot of kudos for that.

I think first of all, I think you have to recognize 2 macro market forces that are impacting our bookings and I think others as well. First of all, in the federal marketplace, we continue to be impacted by the budgetary uncertainties that are involved there. Obviously, the full second half of our last fiscal year, which ended at the end of March, there was no federal budgets in place, we're just continuing resolutions which dramatically impacted the bookings process. Even as we go through our first half of the fiscal year here, the civil agencies still operate under continuing resolutions. So there's still somewhat of an impact there. And as we said the, I think there has been softness in the outsourcing market as people sort their way through exactly what they want to do. I think, quite frankly, if we are successful on booking what we currently see as likely for the second quarter, I think that's going to be an extremely good picture and positions for the remainder of the fiscal year. I think Mike pointed out that we're still facing uncertainties here. If we go into another government fiscal year where they can't get their act together and get a budget, we could again get impacted. And then the broader macro picture that we're all dealing with in terms of the U.S. credit rating and the fallout from all that, that could, at some point, hit our commercial and discretionary spend business. So Mike, you want to add anything on there?"

263093,137263327,156164,"Computer Sciences Corporation, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 10, 2011",2011-08-10,"Earnings Calls","DXC Technology Company","Executives","Thank you, Bryan.

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us today. In addition to covering our financial performance for the first quarter of our fiscal year 2012, I will provide some further insight into our recently announced acquisition of iSOFT, an update on the status of our NHS program and our new business bookings. 
At the end of July, we successfully completed our acquisition of iSOFT Group Limited. This strategic acquisition brings to CSC approximately 3,000 health care IT skilled employees including those from major research and development centers in India, Spain, the U.K., Australia, New Zealand and Central Europe. We also gained roughly 200 qualified health care administrators and some 100 clinical practitioners, as well as 100 premium health care software products to add to CSC's portfolio. These assets, in combination with CSC's existing health care capabilities, intellectual property and client base create a vertical business unit that operates at all levels of the health care value chain. This includes individual patient care to national government settings across both payers and providers with offerings spanning from consultancy engagements to solution, design, delivery and technology and business process outsourcing. Strategically, our health care vertical now has a strong foundation of IP to leverage, much as we do with our very successful financial services vertical. 
Geographically, iSOFT's coverage of the global markets complements that of CSC. The combined entity provide solid market positions in North America, the U.K., Central Europe, Australia and New Zealand, as well as IP and solutions necessary to enhance expansion within Asia, South America and the Middle East. Acquisition-related costs, including the requisite accounting treatments for conversion from international standards to GAAP, as well as integration costs, result in a dilutive effect in the current fiscal year. In subsequent years, we expect this business to generate double-digit margins and be accretive on a pro forma basis. Mike Mancuso will provide you with additional insight during this presentation.
Turning to NHS. We continue to execute and deliver against our current commitments across both primary and secondary care. Lorenzo remains in production, routinely supporting daily operations at Acute Trust [ph], including the 3 early adopters sites Release 1.9. We are progressing the next set of delivery modules includes emergency care and outpatient prescribing, which are anticipated to be installed at the University Hospitals Morecambe Bay once an agreement is reached with the authority. As we reported, finalization of an MLU remains dependent upon the completion of the U.K. government review process. The NHS has indicated that they will be scheduling a September meeting with CSC to discuss the program. 
Moving now to new business. Our year-to-date bookings as of Monday totaled $4.1 billion with $2.3 billion of that total occurring in our first quarter. Additionally, there is a further $1.4 billion of awards for which we have been down selected to one, where we're the only party in the negotiations. We currently anticipate closing the second quarter at approximately the midpoint of our full year guidance.
Key new awards include a significant new outsourcing contract with the steel producer, ArcelorMittal; expansion of our outsourcing relationship with a major consumer goods company to include application services; and in the federal sector, a new contract for the World Trade Center health program to support health monitoring treatment for emergency responders, recovery and cleanup workers and others who were adversely affected by the terrorist attack of 9/11. 
Turning now to the public sector. NPS' revenues declined 2.4% quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by the completion of our support of last year's U.S. census, which occurs once every 10 years. We are experiencing growth in areas aligned with key government priorities including more than $600 million in key wins in fiscal year 2011 at Health and Human Services; continued success of winning tests on the Department of State Global Support Strategy for overseas consular support services; and our expansion of activities in data center consider consolidation and cloud activities with our public sector clients. Currently, over 60% of our fiscal year '12 pipeline lies within our identified high-growth market segments. These market segments in health, cybersecurity, identity management, data center consolidation and cloud services are continuing to grow at above-market rates, partially offsetting the reductions and pressures in other areas of our U.S. public sector portfolio. 
Across the customer base in our U.S. government market, budget uncertainties in conjunction with the prolonged debate around the debt limit, continue to create delays in awarding new initiatives. The trend towards smaller awards and the increased use of ID/IQ contract vehicles continue. Currently, MPS has a substantial backlog of approximately $4.6 billion of submitted proposals scheduled for award in our fiscal year 2012. At the end of the first quarter, pipelines for U.S. public sector awards scheduled for year '12 stands at $11 million, with $2.9 million of those scheduled for award within our second quarter. For the full year, we expect MPS will continue to generate solid profitable cash flows with essentially flat full year revenues.
Consistent with recent improvements in our commercial pipeline, top line revenue growth in our first quarter of our BSS segment was 17% as reported and 8% on a constant-currency basis. Demand for consulting services was strong in North America, Brazil, Australia and selected markets in EMEA. Our financial services vertical continues to perform well with first quarter year-over-year growth of 14% as reported. Overall commercial growth was 6.7% on an as-reported basis, as the strong revenue performance from BSS was offset by weaker MSS demand. Managed services sector first quarter revenue increase of 1.3% year-over-year was aided by currency tailwinds. Recent delays and softness in contract awards contributed to the decline in constant currency revenues. However, for the full year, we anticipate revenues comparable to last year.
As you have seen in our press release, OI and OI margin declined in our first quarter driven primarily by the performance of our MSS business unit. MSS issues included normal first quarter workforce rationalizations, additional expenses required to offset the Nordic strike-related actions, higher-than-expected program and start-up transition costs and an adverse EAC adjustment. In spite of these MSS difficulties and increased legal court fees, we delivered strong EPS growth year-over-year as a result of our continued focus on the efficient effective management of tax globally. For the full fiscal year, we have revised our margin guidance to reflect the anticipated effects of the iSOFT acquisition, increased legal fees and the MSS performance issues discussed earlier. We expect that our improved tax efficiency will offset the dilutive first year EPS impact of our iSOFT acquisition. Consequently, our full year guidance for bookings, revenue, cash and EPS remains intact.
I'll now turn it over to Mike Mancuso for further details of our first quarter results, the financial impact of the iSOFT acquisition and our outlook for the remainder of fiscal year '12."

I'll begin on Chart 7. As Mike Laphen indicated, overall revenue in the quarter increased 3% as reported and declined about 2% when adjusted for currency.

I'll begin on Chart 7. As Mike Laphen indicated, overall revenue in the quarter increased 3% as reported and declined about 2% when adjusted for currency. The good news is the strong commercial revenue growth in our BSS segment. I'll have more to say on revenue a little later. 
Operating income declined significantly in our MSS segment. The margins in our other 2 segments were about where we expected, with the variation on mix and timing affecting the absolute rate. Our tax rate for the quarter offset the impacts of the MSS margin performance and the higher corporate G&A, resulting in a sizable increase in EPS versus last year and our earlier guidance. I'll add more color to these areas as we get further into my charts.
Now if you'll turn to Chart 8 labeled, ""New Business Bookings."" Historically in our business, as the FY '11 data suggests, the booking profile is lumpy with no real predictable pattern. We booked $2.3 billion in this Q1, and for Q2-to-date, we have booked $1.8 billion, have been down selected for another $1.4 billion, and we believe we will capture another $2.8 billion by the end of September. So our best estimate for Q2 is $6 billion, which would give us $8.3 billion at the halfway mark. And we are still of the view that $17 billion is achievable for the full year. However, if the world economic conditions weaken further and U.S. government spending is further disrupted, then the $17 billion becomes more challenging. But for now, it's our best estimate.
Chart 9 talks to our EPS for the quarter relative to our guidance. When we offered the Q1 guidance on May 25, we considered the labor situation in the Nordics, corporate G&A potential increases, et cetera, and we guided accordingly. As it turned out, tax planning initiatives progressed favorably, driving our tax rate into negative territory, resulting in a sizable tax benefit that more than offset the unanticipated MSS program issues and corporate G&A increase.
Chart 10 addresses revenue by line of business with a comparison to Q1 FY '11. On a GAAP basis, revenue grew by 3% and declined by 1.6% in constant currency, with the BSS segment growing at 17% and 8%, respectively, for the reasons Michael Laphen noted in his remarks.
Chart 11 displays operating income by segment. As we discussed, the decline in MSS accounts for the year-over-year decrease. I also need to remind you that we report the NHS contract in the BSS segment, and the margin rate on that contract was higher in Q1 of FY '11. You will recall we adjusted that margin downward in Q4 FY '11, and the NHS contract is recorded at the lower rate in this quarter.
Turning to Chart 12, the P&L statement for the quarter with comparison to last year. You can see the lower operating income and higher corporate G&A is more than offset by the lower tax rate, resulting in a $0.29 increase in continuing ops EPS over last year.
Chart 13 reflects selected balance sheet accounts with comparisons to last year. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter of $1.7 billion when compared to last year is lower primarily because we paid off our $1.5 billion fully drawn bank line subsequent to Q1 FY '11. Debt is lower as a result, and our debt-to-capital ratios continue to improve.
Chart 14 shows our DSO position for the last several quarters. On average, we have improved by one day relative to Q1 of last year.
Now to the hard part, full year guidance. Chart 15 is a walk from our May 25 full year EPS guidance to our updated guidance, which as you can see, is unchanged. Moving left to right. For now, we are forecasting a tax rate of 20% versus the earlier guidance of 32%, which generates a $0.82 EPS benefit. Our increased corporate G&A, driven primarily by legal fees coupled with the MSS performance issues, results in a $0.27 decrease such that excluding iSOFT, our EPS would climb to a range of $5.25 to $5.35. We have been very clear that our guidance always excluded the iSOFT acquisition. And assuming the transaction received regulatory approval, it would be dilutive to our EPS in the first year. The dilution results from the conversion of iSOFT from IFRS, International Financial Reporting Standards, to GAAP and the amortization impact of intangible assets and our own integration spend. The iSOFT transaction closed on July 29. Australian regulatory requirements restricted our pre-closing access to iSOFT, though we are now deep into the purchase accounting details by contract, region, et cetera. We estimate, and I underscore estimate, that iSOFT will dilute our EPS by $0.55 this year. On a pro forma basis, excluding the aforementioned purchase accounting adjustments, iSOFT will yield double-digit operating margins in FY '13 and beyond. So somewhat coincidentally, if we adjust FY '12 guidance for the inclusion of iSOFT, we come back to the range of $4.70 to $4.80 EPS. 
Now the next challenge is to estimate how the iSOFT dilution will fall by quarter. Chart 16 reflects our best estimate at this time of Q2 EPS with and without iSOFT. Its $1 rate, excluding; and $0.58 to $0.78, including. Let me say one final word of caution about FY '12 guidance. As you know, there are a number of large balls still in the air, principally the NHS contract, MSS performance, the iSOFT integration, federal government spending, our ongoing SEC investigation and our ADR process with the federal government to name a few.
Now if you'll turn to Chart 17, I'll summarize our position on guidance. We are expressing our current guidance including and excluding iSOFT. We think $17 billion of bookings is achievable. On revenue, iSOFT will contribute on a GAAP basis, approximately $150 million this year. The midpoint of our range is 16 750. So iSOFT's inclusion is within our current range. 
My get-off-the-stage message is that our business is sound. We have one of the strongest balance sheets in our industry. In fact, this morning, S&P issued a press release removing us from CreditWatch and affirming our A- rating. We will perform our way through the challenges on our plates, we'll continue to focus on cash generation and provide meaningful returns to our shareholders. 
Now I'll turn it back to Bryan to initiate the Q&A."

On the other hand, in the business solutions side, we continue to see the demand for offerings that improve the top line as well as the bottom line and particularly from an industry perspective. And barring a significant downturn in the macroeconomic picture, I think we will continue to see that. We have purposely positioned ourselves for that market. As I said, our financial services vertical is doing very well in that market. And the acquisition of iSOFT and the IP that's associated with that positions us in the same manner in the health care market as it did for the -- as we are in the financial services.

There's always a lot of puts and takes, but let me break this down into 3 major tranches to help give a little bit more visibility and clarity on it. The first element was a significant amount of costs in the Nordics Region to support our efforts to be able to realign and rationalize the workforce in the Nordics to put us back in a more competitive situation. That involved a strike by that workforce. It went to court, with the court ruled favorably for CSC, which we are extremely pleased about. So therefore, we now have the ability, going forward, to rationalize the workforce at a significantly lower cost as well. Unfortunately, we had to infuse an incremental higher level of external resources to keep the business running while the CSC contingent that was on strike was out of the facility. So that one from a standpoint of the incremental cost is behind us. But I would say that the benefits will take place in the upcoming quarters and into next year in terms of being able to rationalize workforce. We have some constraints on some of the timing there, but it's exceptionally better than what it was. So again, we're pleased with that and I would say that one is behind us. A second major tranche that contributed to it was a EAC adjustment on a classified program, and that simply is we, as we went through the quarter, it surfaced that the delivery timetable that they were signed up for with the customer they were not going to meet and required incremental time to do that, and there were some penalties associated with that. We have taken the EAC hit that we believe covers the issue there. The classified program and you might ask why didn't we catch it, it's a little bit more, it is a lot more difficult actually to get the visibility of our quality assurance people on a classified program, and this was a classified program overseas as well, so it was sort of unique. But we believe we have that one behind us as well. The final one is a start-up transition outsourcing program. We are performing very well. It's amicable with the customer, but it's costing us more than we expected it to cost us. I expect that will continue to bleed in somewhat into Q2. So they're the 3 major things. So David, what I would say is that if you look at MSS profitability on a whole, what I would suggest you would take away is that we expect our profitability for the full year to be in excess of what was reported last year for MSS just to give you some parameter. It will be somewhat less than if you normalize it for the Nordics reduction. So unfortunately, we will not recover the full Nordics impact, if you will, because of these other things, but still very profitable, very sound business and unfortunate stumbles here."

So that's got us -- bought that for bit of time, hopefully not too long. Other than that, I would say that we have a strategic direction that has been endorsed by the Board.

I think first of all, I think you have to recognize 2 macro market forces that are impacting our bookings and I think others as well. First of all, in the federal marketplace, we continue to be impacted by the budgetary uncertainties that are involved there. Obviously, the full second half of our last fiscal year, which ended at the end of March, there was no federal budgets in place, there just continuing resolutions which dramatically impacted the bookings process. Even as we go through our first half of the fiscal year here, the civil agencies still operate under continuing resolutions. So there's still somewhat of an impact there. And as we said the -- I think there has been softness in the outsourcing market as people sort their way through exactly what they want to do. I think, quite frankly, if we are successful on booking what we currently see as likely for the second quarter, I think that's going to be an extremely good picture and positions us for the remainder of the fiscal year. I think -- Mike pointed out that we're still facing uncertainties here. If we go into another government fiscal year where they can't get their act together and get a budget, we could again get impacted. And then the broader macro picture that we're all dealing with in terms of the U.S. credit rating and the fallout from all that, that could, at some point, hit our commercial and discretionary spend business. So Mike, you want to add anything on there?"

No. There is a whole bunch of different scenarios that could happen here. But I guess the one thing that I would offer up as a little bit more visibility is that we have included within our forecast about $250 million of NHS revenue that's just associated with implementations throughout the remainder of the year. So if we're not at a baseline in September or at least by the end of September, then the net number will start to get impacted because some things will start to slip out of the fiscal year. But right now, we're assuming that we're still on target with the MOU. We're absolutely staffed up, ready to execute. We've got the products in the delivery pipeline, and we believe we have the demand. So hopefully, we'll get the turn on and things will move forward."

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us today. In addition to covering our financial performance for the second quarter of our fiscal year 2012, I will provide some further insight into our new business booking",1622,"Thank you, Bryan. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us today. 
In addition to covering our financial performance for the second quarter of our fiscal year 2012, I will provide some further insight into our new business bookings and an update of the status of our NHS program and comment on the goodwill impairment charge. Our strategic repositioning and the investments we had made to our sales and go-to-market capabilities over the last year are now delivering solid results. New business bookings this quarter were a strong $6.6 billion, resulting in a total of $8.9 billion for the first half of our fiscal year, up 13% increase over last year's first half. Win rates on competitive outcomes for all business segments are over 50%. And our pipeline of new business opportunities continued to expand, we have a total value of $9 billion and submitted proposals awaiting decisions. These results affirm the competitiveness of our current offerings in the marketplace and should provide confidence in the ongoing strength of CSC's market position. They are also evidence that we are in an excellent position to meet or exceed our full year bookings guidance of $17 billion. 
At the top line, revenues rose 1% as reported to $3.9 billion for the quarter. In the first half, total revenues rose 2% with commercial revenues growing 5.5% as reported. Within commercial, strong revenue performance from BSS offset weaker MSS revenue performance. We expect BSS to be our commercial growth engine and they performed reportedly, delivering growth of 12.8% as reported and 5.1% in constant currency. The U.S. public-sector business, federal public pressures impacted all competitors. We anticipate that the federal government will continue to operate under 1 or more continuing resolutions throughout this government fiscal year. Driven by the ongoing uncertainties in the government's budgets and the day-to-day difficulties our clients are facing in awarding new initiatives, we expect government spending will most likely bring low single-digit declines in the near term as the government implements spending decisions to reduce the federal deficit. In spite of the difficult operating environment, our North American Public Sector business, NPS, continues to deliver solid margins, and when compared to many other of its peers, relatively modest declines in revenue. Excluding the one-time impacts of the claims settlement, NPS revenues declined 2.1%, while delivering 9.3% in operating margin for the quarter. We're additionally pleased to report that NPS closed $3.1 billion in new business bookings in Q2, a 7% increase over fiscal year '11 Q2. Second quarter new business activity was particularly strong in our Homeland Security and intelligence clients with over $800 million of contract value bookings. Of the $4 billion in the first half NPS bookings, approximately $2.3 billion or 58% came to our base of over 100 active ID/IQ contracts, an indicator that the adjustments made in our sales program to more effectively leverage these contract vehicles are proving successful. 
Overall, we continued to experience substantial activity in our high-growth market segments in health, data center consolidation, cloud, cyber and identity management, which we expect will continue to offset some of the reductions and pressures in other areas of our U.S. public-sector portfolio. NPS has a new business pipeline of opportunities scheduled for award in the remainder of fiscal year '12 of $5.8 billion and a $3.7 billion backlog of submitted proposals that are waiting decision. This combination of pipeline and outstanding proposals positions NPS for a solid fiscal year '12 in terms of new business performance. Our Business Solutions & Services sector grew 8.7% in the quarter and 12.8% for the first half as reported. In constant currency, first half was 5.1%. 
Within BSS, the consulting business delivered second quarter growth of 10% as reported. Geographically, demand was strong in the Americas and Asia-Pacific while weakening in EMEA, particularly in Germany. Our global Health Care business, exclusive of the iSOFT acquisition, delivered second quarter growth of 8% in constant currency. Partially offsetting these results, NHS revenues declined as a result of lower scheduled milestones relative to the second quarter of last year. 
Our global financial services vertical continued to deliver results even though confidence in the financial services space deteriorated as a function of the sovereign debt crisis. Vertical grew 11% and closed over $1 billion in new business over the first half as new asset service solutions and process offerings were well received. 
As previously reported, MSS operating margin performance, although improved from the first quarter, continues to be a drag on the company's performance and the primary contributor to the reduction in our guidance numbers. As part of our remediation plan to return to acceptable levels of margin performance, we put new leadership in charge of the MSS business, including a dedicated senior executive to focus exclusively on operations and delivery. To speed and ensure the remedy of the delivery issues occurring in the Nordics Regions, we've assembled and ensure a seasoned team into that region to manage necessary corrective plans and actions. MSS is previously identified start up issue has to a contract resolution. We anticipate that our collective remediation actions should result in operating margin improvement over the second half and into next fiscal year. 
With respect to new business, the managed services segment had a strong quarter with $2.6 billion in bookings. At the half, MSS recognized a 55% increase in bookings compared to the first half of fiscal year '11. Key MSS awards in Q2 includes Big Nose shipbuilding, ArcelorMittal and a global multibrand products manufacturer, all of which are new logos for CSC. Our cloud-related business continues to show strength based on the strong acceleration we have seen in the adoption of both on-premise and off-premise cloud solutions. Since the beginning of the year, we have seen a steady growth in the overall cloud pipeline across all regions and we've been able to achieve a healthy mix of new business and account expansion wins with about $100 million in bookings over the first half. We have won new work with customers like Eleanor, Golden State Foods and the Educational Testing Services, among many others. 
The quality of our managed services offerings and solutions continues to be recognized by industry market analysts. CSC is positioned in the largest quadrant for data center outsourcing, infrastructure, utility services in North America, and with this cloud expressly called out as a strong offering and well thought-out cloud-based delivery model. 
Turning to NHS, I'm pleased to report that authority agreed that the criteria for granting delivery key milestones for Lorenzo 1.9 have now been achieved at 3 early adopter sites, the University Hospitals of Morecambe, Birmingham Women's and Bury. Additionally, Humbert NHS Foundation trust which is replacing Pennine as the early adopter for Lorenzo's mental health functionality is progressing through their go-live preparations, having completed their trainer activities a few weeks ago. I would note that without much fanfare, the University Hospitals of Morecambe recently posted on their website their account of their Lorenzo journey and how they are now using it to deliver better healthcare. It's an informative real-world article that's well worth a read. The URL is identified on Slide 5. CSC's latest Lorenzo release, in addition to delivering some richer outpatient clinic management functionality, moves beyond the care management mental health capabilities of Release 1.9 and delivers 2 new deployment units to take out prescribing, TTO, and emergency care. Accordingly, in late October, Morecambe became the first to go live with TTO prescribing PTT oh enables the trust to electronically record medications on admission, prescribed medication on discharge and within outpatient clinics, and notify GPSI about any medication changes. The trustees TTO is a key to safer prescribing and to preventing medication related admissions and is now rolling it out to additional work across the trust. CSC and NHS have resumed discussions with the target of reaching an agreed way forward by the end of 2011. However, there can be no assurance that the agreement will be reached. Our 10-Q, being filed later today, include additional details regarding the status of our NHS contract. 
Turning now to the goodwill impairment. As you have seen in our press release, we have taken a noncash goodwill impairment charges a result of the annual test that we normally conduct in our second quarter. In our estimation, a key contributor to this charge is the fact that our stock price, which has been under pressure from both market declines and the uncertainties surrounding the MSS challenges, depending CSC investigation, the NHS program and U.S. federal budget deficits. Although we expect these uncertainties eventually to be resolved, our low stock price has persisted for us a sufficient to create a discontinuity between the market price and the book value. And it as this discontinuity that necessitates the adjustment to goodwill. 
So in summary, our new businesses engines performed well in the first half and our plans to deliver an our full year booking guidance of $17 billion are on track. Our large claims with the U.S. government have been resolved and lie behind us. Now this business environment remains difficult and uncertain, MPS is delivering meaningful operating margin and will continue to be a significant component of our portfolio. We expect our commercial business to deliver positive growth this year on both and as reported in constant-currency basis, with BSS powering that result and offsetting the weaker performance of MSS. 
And finally, even though we have lowered guidance, we anticipate improvements in our operating margins across all 3 lines of business in the second half. This, in conjunction with our new business success, should provide a foundation for improved financial performance in fiscal year '13. Now I'll turn it over to Mike Mancuso."

As you've no doubt concluded from our press release and its supporting attachment, this quarter's financial results have more than the usual amount of moving parts. Capturing a clear understanding of our performance and outlook may have been challenging, at least up to now. With the ensuing charts, I'll do my best to confuse the numbers of that you are better able to assess our performance, and perhaps more importantly, formulate an investment thesis prospectively. 
I'll open with Chart 7. Clearly, the iSOFT acquisition, the claims settlement with the U.S. government, and the goodwill impairment charge have significantly influenced our results and forecast. In my commentary, I will speak to the numbers with and without these impacts. 
So if you'll turn to Chart 8, you can see the breakdown of our bookings by segment with comparisons to last year. The take away from this chart is that we have recorded $8.9 billion of new business thus far and remain optimistic that we can meet or exceed the $17 billion FY '12 target we set for ourselves. Our success in the markets speaks volume as to the viability and desirability of the product offerings. Thus far in this third quarter, our bookings are in excess of $1 billion, and as Mike Laphen indicated, we have a line of sight to several billion more based on our submitted proposals and/or qualified pipeline. 
If you would turn to Chart 9, you will find a breakdown of second quarter revenue by line of business. Revenue of $3.966 billion on a GAAP basis is net of a $42 million revenue reduction MPS business arising from the claims settlement. NPS revenue modestly decline from last year. MSS revenue in constant currency reflects roughly a 3% decline. Our BSS is showing meaningful revenue growth over last year. 
Operating income on Chart 10 is presented on a GAAP basis and pro forma. As noted, the pro forma presentation excludes the claims settlement impact of $269 million and the iSOFT dilution in the BSS segment of $27 million. The overall performance in MSS is eroded as reflected in the year-over-year OI reduction. As has been said, MSS is under new leadership and several initiatives underway to improve performance. Timing of licensed revenue, contract negotiations and softness in Central Europe contribute to the reduction in BSS in the quarter. 
Chart 11 lays out the full P&L for the quarter on a GAAP basis, as well as adjusted for the 3 unique items. The goodwill impairment charge of $2.685 billion and the claims settlement result in an EPS loss of $18.56 on a GAAP basis for the quarter. On a pro forma basis, adjusting out the goodwill settlement claim and iSOFT dilution, EPS would be $0.94. Further to this chart, I want to draw your attention to the tax rate in the quarter. During the quarter, we settled the IRS audit of 2005 through 2007 tax years. This resulted in a significant reduction of the company's tax liability for the quarter. 
Chart 12 walks you from our August EPS guidance to our actual result. We begin with $1.08, at that time, we estimated $0.40 reduction in iSOFT. The actual EPS affect of iSOFT, lower operations performance and legal fees, reduced EPS by $0.20. However, the lower tax rate more than offset those reductions. As the previous chart indicated, the iSOFT dilution turned out to be $0.09, not $0.40. You'll see later on that we expect iSOFT to dilute EPS by $0.55 for the fiscal year, primarily caused by the conversion from IFRS to GAAP and the amortization of purchase intangibles. 
Turning to our selected balance sheet items on Chart 13. You will note that cash is lower than last year resulting from the repayment of our revolving credit line of $1.5 billion, plus various acquisition activities and and iSOFT debt retirement payment. The NHS repayment and dividend payments also contributed to lower cash. The impairment charge reduced the goodwill balance, net of increases through acquisitions. On the liability side, deferred revenue is lower primarily due to the refund of the NHS advance. Debt reflects the revolver payment, net of Commercial Paper borrowings, and equity is reduced principally by the goodwill charge. Obviously, less cash, coupled with the equity reduction, have moved our balance sheet ratios. 
Chart 14 displays DSOs which continued to improve. On an absolute basis, we should see in the coming quarters a reduction of approximately 8 days as the result of the government claims settlement. This moves us much closer to our industry norm. 
Now let's move to guidance. And as you can see from Chart 15, it is expressed with and without the claims settlement and goodwill, but including iSOFT. We remain convinced that the $17 billion in new business bookings is achievable. Since our last guidance, the macro economic factors affecting revenue have not improved. The NPS revenue outlook for the rest of this fiscal year given all the and certainty in the federal sector with the super committee is problematic. The European outlook also presents a question mark, coupled with timely decision-making or lack thereof on the NHS program, both can impact second half revenue growth. The $16.5 billion is still about a 3% increase above last year. Operating margin of 6% or 4.5% including the claim reflects the performance issues in MSS, the continuing challenge in the Nordics and softness in BSS Europe. EPS of $4.05 to $4.10 recognizes the reductions in operating income, the added negative impact of G&A spending on litigation and the SEC investigation, but with the added benefit of the lower tax rate. Underlying our guidance is the assumption that the NHS program continues within the framework of the MOU. 
Chart 16 attempts to simplify the movement and changes in full year EPS by walking you from our last year guidance in August of -- our full year guidance, sorry, that we gave in August of $5.30, excluding iSOFT, through all the big-ticket changes that get us through our full year GAAP basis EPS estimate. The question around guidance is really twofold. Did we achieve the second half improvement needed to achieve guidance? And what about margin improvement beyond? 
Chart 17 attempts to normalize first half margin performance by line of business by adding back the significant adjustments. Looking at the second half estimate, in light of the normalized first half performance, the answer is that the second half is not overwhelmingly difficult to achieve. As we look to the future, the realization of an overall margin of 10% or greater for CSC can be met. NPS should continue to perform around the nominal 9%. BSS, with future contribution of NHS and iSOFT, coupled with an overall European economic recovery, can yield margins in excess of 10%. MSS is the performance issue and with that people changes and process fixes underway, margins in excess of 10% are achievable. 
So now what about EPS guidance by quarter for the second half? If you turn to Chart 18, we lay out our guidance estimate for Q3 and Q4 with comparisons to last year. Excluding goodwill and the claims settlement, we are guiding to $4.05 to $4.10, and if you adjust for the iSOFT dilution, we would exceed last year. Certainly, the improvement in our tax rate provided the offset to the OI shortfall and G&A spending. 
In closing my prepared remarks, I want remind you that we are in the process of filing our quarterly 10-Q with the SEC. If you take the time to read it, you will find expansive detailed disclosures around most, if not all, of this commentary. I will not comment specifically on the status of the SEC investigation, which, as you know, is being conducted under the direction of the independent members of our audit committee. The 10-Q will disclose that the investigation has expanded to include our Australian business, and that certain accounting errors, including suspected intentional misconduct, have been identified there. The magnitude of what has surfaced to date is much lower than in Nordics and nonetheless disturbing. 
And finally, despite some obviously disappointing operational performance and the large noncash goodwill impairment charge, there are several very positive message to take away and we look forward to a much improved second half. With that said, I'll turn it back to Bryan to initiate the Q&A session."

However, there will be some lingering negative impact of that through the remainder of the fiscal year.

So perhaps you could help us just walk through -- of the things that are isolated and your slides that are unusual, how many of those continue into next year? And I'm not sure I understood all the details correctly, but it looks like you've got $0.55 for iSOFT in terms of dilution and integration costs, and $1.35 to $1.40 of incremental SG&A to deal with the accounting issues and all the investigations underway. So that gets you in round numbers to about $1.90 to $2. And then you have a tax benefit this year of roughly $200 million. That looks like that's about $1.30. Number 1, are those numbers right, and can you help us think about are those the right numbers and what continues into next year?"

Your numbers are approximately correct. Certainly, you're correct on the iSOFT. So the first supposition around iSOFT is, that and I think we said this back when we announced the acquisition, we expected dilution this year and we expected to be -- it should accrete next year, but in a very low way, not anything astounding. So next year, we'll benefit by the absence of the $0.55 dilution. We'll still have purchased intangibles obviously that have to be amortized, et cetera. But beyond next year, iSOFT should kick in very handsomely. The SG&A spending around the investigations, it's reasonable to expect, you should see a return next year to more normalized levels of G&A spending. Now around G&A spending, there will be some residual spending associated with the remediation activities that we intend to and are in the process of implementing around improved controls and so on and so forth kind of thing. But you should expect that the lion's share of the additional spending will mitigate itself next year, which gets you down now to the operational performance. As you can see from my Chart 17, we said in MSS, we expected the second half of the year to be better than the first half and the assumption there, of course, is that one-off write-offs and the like would not repeat. The underlying structural problems in the Nordics with the large underutilized workforce, et cetera, will take us some time to work our way out of. But said again, you should see an improvement next year overall in MSS. Now at this juncture, we're not going to stick our neck out and give you any guidance about next year in terms of solid numbers, et cetera. It's a little premature for that. But only to leave you with the impression that we expect next year to be better and we'll be a position in a few months probably to share more of that with you. But again, that is founded on a lot of assumptions, of course, overall being that the NHS program continues, that government spending reductions are not as dramatic as the failure of the super committee to reach conclusion might suggest. And again European economic will start to stabilize such that we can see improvement in Germany, et cetera. So with all those qualifiers, we're in violent agreement with your supposition."

So I think that clearly is different than where we have been as a nation historically. And I think that's being reflected in both our forecast and others forecast. More broadly, around the world, I would say that we certainly have been impacted in the U.K. on the NHS contract in some form or fashion relative to the austerity programs that have been put in place in the U.K. So it's hard to draw a direct line from one to the other, but clearly, that there's been to save money and I think that's at least in Western Europe and the Americas, I think that will be at some level of pressure.

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us today. In addition to covering our financial performance for the second quarter of our fiscal year 2012, I will provide some further insight into our new business bookings",1632,"Thank you, Bryan. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us today. In addition to covering our financial performance for the second quarter of our fiscal year 2012, I will provide some further insight into our new business bookings and an update of the status of our NHS program and comment on the goodwill impairment charge. 
Our strategic repositioning and the investments we had made to our sales and go-to-market capabilities over the last year are now delivering solid results. New business bookings this quarter were a strong $6.6 billion, resulting in a total of $8.9 billion for the first half of our fiscal year, up 13% increase over last year's first half. Win rates on competitive outcomes for all business segments are over 50%. And our pipeline of new business opportunities continued to expand, and we have a total value of over $9 billion in submitted proposals awaiting decisions. These results affirm the competitiveness of our current offerings in the marketplace and should provide confidence in the ongoing strength of CSC's market position. They are also evidence that we are in an excellent position to meet or exceed our full year bookings guidance of $17 billion. 
At the top line, revenues rose 1% as reported to $3.9 billion for the quarter. In the first half, total revenues rose 2%, with commercial revenues growing 5.5% as reported. Within commercial, strong revenue performance from BSS offset weaker MSS revenue performance. We expect BSS to be our commercial growth engine, and they've performed reportedly, delivering growth of 12.8% as reported and 5.1% in constant currency. 
In the U.S. Public Sector business, federal budget pressures impacted all competitors. We anticipate that the federal government will continue to operate under one or more continuing resolutions throughout this government fiscal year. Driven by the ongoing uncertainties in the government's budgets and the day-to-day difficulties our clients are facing in awarding new initiatives, we expect government spending will most likely bring low single-digit declines in the near term, as the government implements spending decisions to reduce the federal deficit. 
In spite of the difficult operating environment, our North American Public Sector business, NPS, continues to deliver solid margins, and when compared to many other of its peers, relatively modest declines in revenue. Excluding the onetime impacts of the claim settlement, NPS revenues declined 2.1%, while delivering 9.3% in operating margin for the quarter. I'm additionally pleased to report that NPS closed $3.1 billion in new business bookings in Q2, a 7% increase over fiscal year '11 Q2. 
Second quarter new business activity was particularly strong in our Homeland Security and intelligence clients, with over $800 million of contract value bookings. Of the $4 billion in the first half NPS bookings, approximately $2.3 billion or 58% came to our base of over 100 active ID/IQ contracts, an indicator that the adjustments made in our sales program to more effectively leverage these contract vehicles are proving successful. 
Overall, we continued to experience substantial activity in our high-growth market segments in health, data center consolidation, cloud, cyber and identity management, which we expect will continue to offset some of the reductions and pressures in other areas of our U.S. Public Sector portfolio. NPS has a new business pipeline of opportunities scheduled for award in the remainder of fiscal year '12 of $5.8 billion and a $3.7 billion backlog of submitted proposals that are waiting decision. This combination of pipeline and outstanding proposals positions NPS for a solid fiscal year '12 in terms of new business performance. Our Business Solutions & Services sector grew 8.7% in the quarter and 12.8% for the first half as reported. In constant currency, first half was 5.1%. 
Within BSS, the consulting business delivered second quarter growth of 10% as reported. Geographically, demand was strong in the Americas and Asia-Pacific while weakening in EMEA, particularly in Germany. Our global healthcare business, exclusive of the iSOFT acquisition, delivered second quarter growth of 8% in constant currency. Partially offsetting these results, NHS revenues declined as a result of lower scheduled milestones relative to the second quarter of last year. 
Our global financial services vertical continue to deliver results even though confidence in the financial services space deteriorated as a function of the sovereign debt crisis. The vertical grew 11% and closed over $1 billion in new business over the first half, as new asset service solutions and process offerings were well received. 
As previously reported, MSS operating margin performance, although improved from the first quarter, continues to be a drag on the company's performance and the primary contributor to the reduction in our guidance numbers. As part of our remediation plan to return to acceptable levels of margin performance, we put new leadership in charge of the MSS business, including a dedicated senior executive to focus exclusively on operations and delivery. To speed and ensure the remedy of the delivery issues occurring in the Nordics regions, we've assembled and insured a seasoned team into that region to manage necessary corrective plans and actions. MSS's previously identified startup issue has to a contract resolution. We anticipate that our collective remediation actions should result in operating margin improvement over the second half and into next fiscal year. 
With respect to new business, the managed services segment had a strong quarter, with $2.6 billion in bookings. At the half, MSS recognized a 55% increase in bookings compared to the first half of fiscal year '11. Key MSS awards in Q2 includes Ingalls Shipbuilding, ArcelorMittal and a global multibrand products manufacturer, all of which are new logos for CSC. 
Our cloud-related business continues to show strength based on the strong acceleration we have seen in the adoption of both on-premise and off-premise cloud solutions. Since the beginning of the year, we have seen a steady growth in the overall cloud pipeline across all regions, and we've been able to achieve a healthy mix of new business and account expansion wins with about $100 million in bookings over the first half. We have won new work with customers like Telenor, Golden State Foods and the Educational Testing Services, among many others. 
The quality of our managed services offerings and solutions continues to be recognized by industry market analysts. CSC is positioned in the leader's quadrant for data center outsourcing and infrastructure, utility services in North America, and with this cloud expressly called out as a strong offering and a ""well thought-out cloud-based delivery model."" 
Turning to NHS. I'm pleased to report that we and the authority agreed that the criteria for granting delivery key milestones for Lorenzo 1.9 have now been achieved at the 3 early adopter sites, the University Hospitals of Morecambe, Birmingham Women's and Bury. Additionally, Humber NHS Foundation Trust, which is replacing Pennine as the early adopter for Lorenzo's mental health functionality, is progressing through their go-live preparations, having completed their -- the trainer activities a few weeks ago. I would note that without much fanfare, the University Hospitals of Morecambe recently posted on their website their account of their Lorenzo journey and how they are now using it to deliver better healthcare. It's an informative real-world article that's well worth a read. The URL is identified on Slide 5. 
CSC's latest Lorenzo release, in addition to delivering some richer outpatient clinic management functionality, moves beyond the care management mental health capabilities of Release 1.9 and delivers 2 new deployment units to take out prescribing TTO and emergency care. Accordingly, in late October, Morecambe became the first to go live with TTO prescribing. TTO enables the trust to electronically record medications on admission, prescribe medication on discharge and within outpatient clinics, and notify GPs about any medication changes. The trust sees TTO as a key to safer prescribing and to preventing medication-related admissions and is now rolling it out to additional wards across the trust. 
CSC and NHS have resumed discussions with the target of reaching an agreed way forward by the end of 2011. However, there can be no assurance that the agreement will be reached. Our 10-Q, being filed later today, include additional details regarding the status of our NHS contract. 
Turning now to the goodwill impairment. As you have seen in our press release, we have taken a noncash goodwill impairment charge as a result of the annual test that we normally conduct in our second quarter. In our estimation, a key contributor to this charge is the fact that our stock price, which has been under pressure from both market declines and the uncertainties surrounding the MSS challenges, depending CSC investigation, the NHS program and U.S. federal budget deficits. Although we expect these uncertainties eventually to be resolved, our low stock price has persisted for a sufficient period to create a discontinuity between market price and the book value. And it is this discontinuity that necessitates the adjustment to goodwill. 
So in summary, our new business engine performed well in the first half, and our plans to deliver an our full year booking guidance of $17 billion are on track. Our large claims with the U.S. government have been resolved and lie behind us. While this business and environment remains difficult and uncertain, MPS is delivering meaningful operating margin and will continue to be a significant component of our portfolio. We expect our commercial business to deliver positive growth this year on both on as reported and constant-currency basis, with BSS powering that result and offsetting the weaker performance of MSS. 
And finally, even though we have lowered guidance, we anticipate improvements in our operating margins across all 3 lines of business in the second half. This, in conjunction with our new business success, should provide a foundation for improved financial performance in fiscal year '13. 
I'll now turn it over to Mike Mancuso."

As you've no doubt concluded from our press release and its supporting attachment, this quarter's financial results have more than the usual amount of moving parts. Capturing a clear understanding of our performance and outlook may have been challenging, at least up to now. With the ensuing charts, I'll do my best to unconfuse the numbers such that you are a bit better able to assess our performance and, perhaps more importantly, formulate an investment thesis prospectively. 
I'll open with Chart 7. Clearly, the iSOFT acquisition, the claim settlement with the U.S. government and the goodwill impairment charge have significantly influenced our results and forecast. In my commentary, I will speak to the numbers with and without these impacts. 
So if you'll turn to Chart 8, you can see the breakdown of our bookings by segment with comparisons to last year. The take away from this chart is that we have recorded $8.9 billion of new business thus far and remain optimistic that we can meet or exceed the $17 billion FY '12 target we set for ourselves. Our success in the markets speaks volume as to the viability and desirability of our product offerings. Thus far, in this third quarter, our bookings are in excess of $1 billion, and as Mike Laphen indicated, we have a line of sight to several billion more based on our submitted proposals and/or qualified pipeline. 
If you would turn to Chart 9, you will find a breakdown of second quarter revenue by line of business. The revenue of $3.966 billion on a GAAP basis is net of a $42 million revenue reduction in our MPS business arising from the claim settlement. NPS revenue modestly decline from last year. MSS revenue in constant currency reflects roughly a 3% decline, while BSS is showing meaningful revenue growth over last year. 
Operating income on Chart 10 is presented on a GAAP basis and pro forma. As noted, the pro forma presentation excludes the claims settlement impact of $269 million and the iSOFT dilution in the BSS segment of $27 million. The overall performance in MSS is eroded, as reflected in the year-over-year OI reduction. As has been said, MSS is under new leadership, with several initiatives under way to improve performance. Timing of license revenue, contract negotiations and softness in Central Europe contribute to the reduction in BSS in the quarter. 
Chart 11 lays out the full P&L for the quarter on a GAAP basis, as well as adjusted for the 3 unique items. The goodwill impairment charge of $2.685 billion and the claim settlement result in an EPS loss of $18.56 on a GAAP basis for the quarter. On a pro forma basis, adjusting out the goodwill, settlement claim and iSOFT dilution, EPS would be $0.94. Further to this chart, I want to draw your attention to the tax rate in the quarter. During the quarter, we settled the IRS audit of 2005 through 2007 tax years. This resulted in a significant reduction of the company's tax liability for the quarter. 
Chart 12 walks you from our August EPS guidance to our actual result. We begin with $1.08, at that time, we estimated $0.40 reduction in iSOFT. The actual EPS affect of iSOFT, lower operations performance and legal fees, reduced EPS by $0.20. However, the lower tax rate more than offset those reductions. As the previous chart indicated, the iSOFT dilution turned out to be $0.09, not $0.40. You'll see later on that we expect iSOFT to dilute EPS by $0.55 for the fiscal year, primarily caused by the conversion from IFRS to GAAP and the amortization of purchased intangibles. 
Turning to our selected balance sheet items on Chart 13. You will note that cash is lower than last year resulting from the repayment of our revolving credit line of $1.5 billion, plus various acquisition activities and an iSOFT debt retirement payment. The NHS repayment and dividend payments also contributed to lower cash. The impairment charge reduced the goodwill balance, net of increases through acquisitions. On the liability side, deferred revenue is lower, primarily due to the refund of the NHS advance. Debt reflects the revolver payment net of Commercial Paper borrowings, and equity is reduced principally by the goodwill charge. Obviously, less cash, coupled with the equity reduction, have moved our balance sheet ratios. 
Chart 14 displays DSOs which continued to improve. On an absolute basis, we should see in the coming quarters a reduction of approximately 8 days as a result of the government claim settlement. This moves us much closer to our industry norm. 
Now let's move to guidance. And as you can see from Chart 15, it is expressed with and without the claim settlement and goodwill, but including iSOFT. We remain convinced that the $17 billion in new business bookings is achievable. Since our last guidance, the macro economic factors affecting revenue have not improved. The NPS revenue outlook for the rest of this fiscal year, given all the and certainty in the federal sector with the super committee, is problematic. The European outlook also presents a question mark, coupled with timely decision-making or lack thereof on the NHS program, both can impact second half revenue growth. The $16.5 billion is still about a 3% increase above last year. 
Operating margin of 6% or 4.5% including the claim reflects the performance issues in MSS, the continuing challenge in the Nordics and softness in BSS Europe. EPS of $4.05 to $4.10 recognizes the reductions in operating income, the added negative impact of G&A spending on litigation and the SEC investigation, but with the added benefit of the lower tax rate. Underlying our guidance is the assumption that the NHS program continues within the framework of the MOU. 
Chart 16 attempts to simplify the movement and changes in full year EPS by walking you from our last year guidance in August of -- our full year guidance, sorry, that we gave in August of $5.30, excluding iSOFT, through all the big-ticket changes that get us through our full year GAAP basis EPS estimate. The question around guidance is really twofold. Did we achieve the second half improvement needed to achieve guidance? And what about margin improvement beyond? 
Chart 17 attempts to normalize first half margin performance by line of business by adding back the significant adjustments. Looking at the second half estimate, in light of the normalized first half performance, the answer is that the second half is not overwhelmingly difficult to achieve. As we look to the future, the realization of an overall margin of 10% or greater for CSC can be met. NPS should continue to perform around the nominal 9%. BSS, with future contribution of NHS and iSOFT, coupled with an overall European economic recovery, can yield margins in excess of 10%. MSS is the performance issue. And with that people changes and process fixes under way, margins in excess of 10% are achievable. 
So now what about EPS guidance by quarter for the second half? If you turn to Chart 18, we lay out our guidance estimate for Q3 and Q4 with comparisons to last year. Excluding goodwill and the claim settlement, we are guiding to $4.05 to $4.10, and if you adjust for the iSOFT dilution, we would exceed last year. Certainly, the improvement in our tax rate provided the offset to the OI shortfall and G&A spending. 
In closing my prepared remarks, I want remind you that we are in the process of filing our quarterly 10-Q with the SEC. If you take the time to read it, you will find expansive detailed disclosures around most, if not all, of this commentary. I will not comment specifically on the status of the SEC investigation, which, as you know, is being conducted under the direction of the independent members of our audit committee. The 10-Q will disclose that the investigation has expanded to include our Australian business, and that certain accounting errors, including suspected intentional misconduct, have been identified there. The magnitude of what has surfaced to date is much lower than in Nordics, but nonetheless disturbing. And finally, despite some obviously disappointing operational performance and the large noncash goodwill impairment charge, there are several very positive message to take away, and we look forward to a much improved second half. 
With that said, I'll turn it back to Bryan to initiate the Q&A session."

So perhaps you could help us just walk through, of the things that are isolated in your slides that are unusual, how many of those continue into next year? And I'm not sure I understood all the details correctly, but it looks like you've got $0.55 for iSOFT in terms of dilution and integration costs, and $1.35 to $1.40 of incremental SG&A to deal with the accounting issues and all the investigations under way. So that gets you in round numbers to about $1.90 to $2. And then you have a tax benefit this year of roughly $200 million. That looks like that's about $1.30. Number one, are those numbers right?

So the first supposition around iSOFT is that -- and I think we said this back when we announced the acquisition. We expected dilution this year, and we expected to be -- it should accrete next year, but in a very low way, not anything astounding. So next year we'll benefit by the absence of the $0.55 dilution. We'll still have purchased intangibles obviously that have to be amortized, et cetera. But beyond next year, iSOFT should kick in very handsomely. The SG&A spending around the investigations, it's reasonable to expect, you should see a return next year to more normalized levels of G&A spending. Now around G&A spending, there will be some residual spending associated with the remediation activities that we intend to and are in the process of implementing around improved controls and so on and so forth kind of thing. But you should expect that the lion's share of the additional spending will mitigate itself next year, which gets you down now to the operational performance. As you can see from my Chart 17, we said in MSS we expected the second half of the year to be better than the first half, and the assumption there, of course, is that one-off write-offs and the like would not repeat. The underlying structural problems in the Nordics with the large underutilized workforce, et cetera, will take us some time to work our way out of. But said again, you should see an improvement next year overall in MSS. Now at this juncture, we're not going to stick our neck out and give you any guidance about next year in terms of solid numbers, et cetera. It's a little premature for that. But only to leave you with the impression that we expect next year to be better, and we'll be a position in a few months probably to share more of that with you. But again, that is founded on a lot of assumptions, of course, overall being that the NHS program continues, that government spending reductions are not as dramatic as the failure of the super committee to reach conclusion might suggest. And again, European economic will start to stabilize such that we can see improvement in Germany, et cetera. So with all those qualifiers, we're in violent agreement with your supposition."

More broadly, around the world, I would say that we certainly have been impacted in the U.K. on the NHS contract in some form or fashion relative to the austerity programs that are -- that have been put in place in the U.K. So it's hard to draw a direct line from one to the other, but clearly, that there's -- we're going to look to save money, and I think that's -- at least in Western Europe and the Americas, I think that will be at some level of pressure.

263093,141657013,188796,"Computer Sciences Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 09, 2011",2011-11-09,"Earnings Calls","DXC Technology Company","Executives","Thank you, Bryan. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us today. In addition to covering our financial performance for the second quarter of our fiscal year 2012, I will provide some further insight into our new business bookings",1632,"Thank you, Bryan. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us today. In addition to covering our financial performance for the second quarter of our fiscal year 2012, I will provide some further insight into our new business bookings and an update of the status of our NHS program and comment on the goodwill impairment charge. 
Our strategic repositioning and the investments we had made to our sales and go-to-market capabilities over the last year are now delivering solid results. New business bookings this quarter were a strong $6.6 billion, resulting in a total of $8.9 billion for the first half of our fiscal year, a 13% increase over last year's first half. Win rates on competitive outcomes for all business segments are over 50%. And our pipeline of new business opportunities continued to expand, and we have a total value of over $9 billion in submitted proposals awaiting decisions. These results affirm the competitiveness of our current offerings in the marketplace and should provide confidence in the ongoing strength of CSC's market position. They are also evidence that we are in an excellent position to meet or exceed our full year bookings guidance of $17 billion. 
At the top line, revenues rose 1% as reported to $3.9 billion for the quarter. In the first half, total revenues rose 2%, with commercial revenues growing 5.5% as reported. Within commercial, strong revenue performance from BSS offset weaker MSS revenue performance. We expect BSS to be our commercial growth engine, and they've performed reportedly, delivering growth of 12.8% as reported and 5.1% in constant currency. 
In the U.S. Public Sector business, federal budget pressures impacted all competitors. We anticipate that the federal government will continue to operate under one or more continuing resolutions throughout this government fiscal year. Driven by the ongoing uncertainties in the government's budgets and the day-to-day difficulties our clients are facing in awarding new initiatives, we expect government spending will most likely bring low single-digit declines in the near term, as the government implements spending decisions to reduce the federal deficit. 
In spite of the difficult operating environment, our North American Public Sector business, NPS, continues to deliver solid margins, and when compared to many other of its peers, relatively modest declines in revenue. Excluding the onetime impacts of the claim settlement, NPS revenues declined 2.1%, while delivering 9.3% in operating margin for the quarter. I'm additionally pleased to report that NPS closed $3.1 billion in new business bookings in Q2, a 7% increase over fiscal year '11 Q2. 
Second quarter new business activity was particularly strong in our Homeland Security and intelligence clients, with over $800 million of contract value bookings. Of the $4 billion in the first half NPS bookings, approximately $2.3 billion or 58% came to our base of over 100 active ID/IQ contracts, an indicator that the adjustments made in our sales program to more effectively leverage these contract vehicles are proving successful. 
Overall, we continued to experience substantial activity in our high-growth market segments in health, data center consolidation, cloud, cyber and identity management, which we expect will continue to offset some of the reductions and pressures in other areas of our U.S. Public Sector portfolio. NPS has a new business pipeline of opportunities scheduled for award in the remainder of fiscal year '12 of $5.8 billion and a $3.7 billion backlog of submitted proposals that are waiting decision. This combination of pipeline and outstanding proposals positions NPS for a solid fiscal year '12 in terms of new business performance. Our Business Solutions & Services sector grew 8.7% in the quarter and 12.8% for the first half as reported. In constant currency, first half was 5.1%. 
Within BSS, the consulting business delivered second quarter growth of 10% as reported. Geographically, demand was strong in the Americas and Asia-Pacific while weakening in EMEA, particularly in Germany. Our global healthcare business, exclusive of the iSOFT acquisition, delivered second quarter growth of 8% in constant currency. Partially offsetting these results, NHS revenues declined as a result of lower scheduled milestones relative to the second quarter of last year. 
Our global financial services vertical continue to deliver results even though confidence in the financial services space deteriorated as a function of the sovereign debt crisis. Vertical grew 11% and closed over $1 billion in new business over the first half, as new asset service solutions and process offerings were well received. 
As previously reported, MSS operating margin performance, although improved from the first quarter, continues to be a drag on the company's performance and the primary contributor to the reduction in our guidance numbers. As part of our remediation plan to return to acceptable levels of margin performance, we put new leadership in charge of the MSS business, including a dedicated senior executive to focus exclusively on operations and delivery. To speed and ensure the remedy of the delivery issues occurring in the Nordics regions, we've assembled and insured a seasoned team into that region to manage necessary corrective plans and actions. MSS's previously identified startup issue has progressed to a contract resolution. We anticipate that our collective remediation actions should result in operating margin improvement over the second half and into next fiscal year. 
With respect to new business, the Managed Services segment had a strong quarter, with $2.6 billion in bookings. At the half, MSS recognized a 55% increase in bookings compared to the first half of fiscal year '11. Key MSS awards in Q2 includes Ingalls Shipbuilding, ArcelorMittal and a global multi-brand products manufacturer, all of which are new logos for CSC. 
Our cloud-related business continues to show strength based on the strong acceleration we have seen in the adoption of both on-premise and off-premise cloud solutions. Since the beginning of the year, we have seen a steady growth in the overall cloud pipeline across all regions, and we've been able to achieve a healthy mix of new business and account expansion wins with about $100 million in bookings over the first half. We have won new work with customers like Telenor, Golden State Foods and the Educational Testing Services, among many others. 
The quality of our managed services offerings and solutions continues to be recognized by industry market analysts. CSC is positioned in the leader's quadrant for data center outsourcing and infrastructure, utility services in North America, and with BizCloud expressly called out as a strong offering and a ""well thought-out cloud-based delivery model."" 
Turning to NHS. I'm pleased to report that we and the authority agreed that the criteria for granting delivery key milestones for Lorenzo 1.9 have now been achieved at the 3 early adopter sites, the University Hospitals of Morecambe, Birmingham Women's and Bury. Additionally, Humber NHS Foundation Trust, which is replacing Pennine as the early adopter for Lorenzo's mental health functionality, is progressing through their go-live preparations, having completed their -- the trainer activities a few weeks ago. I would note that without much fanfare, the University Hospitals of Morecambe recently posted on their website their account of their Lorenzo journey and how they are now using it to deliver better healthcare. It's an informative real-world article that's well worth a read. The URL is identified on Slide 5. 
CSC's latest Lorenzo release, in addition to delivering some richer outpatient clinic management functionality, moves beyond the care management mental health capabilities of Release 1.9 and delivers 2 new deployment units to take out prescribing TTO and emergency care. Accordingly, in late October, Morecambe became the first to go live with TTO prescribing. TTO enables the trust to electronically record medications on admission, prescribe medication on discharge and within outpatient clinics, and notify GPs about any medication changes. The trust sees TTO as a key to safer prescribing and to preventing medication-related admissions and is now rolling it out to additional wards across the trust. 
CSC and NHS have resumed discussions with the target of reaching an agreed way forward by the end of 2011. However, there can be no assurance that the agreement will be reached. Our 10-Q, being filed later today, includes additional details regarding the status of our NHS contract. 
Turning now to the goodwill impairment. As you have seen in our press release, we have taken a noncash goodwill impairment charge as a result of the annual test that we normally conduct in our second quarter. In our estimation, a key contributor to this charge is the fact that our stock price, which has been under pressure from both market declines and the uncertainties surrounding the MSS challenges, the pending CSC investigation, the NHS program and U.S. federal budget deficits. Although we expect these uncertainties eventually to be resolved, our low stock price has persisted for a sufficient period to create a discontinuity between market price and the book value. And it is this discontinuity that necessitates the adjustment to goodwill. 
So in summary, our new business engine performed well in the first half, and our plans to deliver an our full year booking guidance of $17 billion are on track. Our large claims with the U.S. government have been resolved and lie behind us. While this business and environment remains difficult and uncertain, MPS is delivering meaningful operating margin and will continue to be a significant component of our portfolio. We expect our commercial business to deliver positive growth this year on both on as reported and constant-currency basis, with BSS powering that result and offsetting the weaker performance of MSS. 
And finally, even though we have lowered guidance, we anticipate improvements in our operating margins across all 3 lines of business in the second half. This, in conjunction with our new business success, should provide a foundation for improved financial performance in fiscal year '13. 
I'll now turn it over to Mike Mancuso."
263093,141657013,188796,"Computer Sciences Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 09, 2011",2011-11-09,"Earnings Calls","DXC Technology Company","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning.

Capturing a clear understanding of our performance and out",1403,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning. As you've no doubt concluded from our press release and its supporting attachment, this quarter's financial results have more than the usual amount of moving parts. Capturing a clear understanding of our performance and outlook may have been challenging, at least up to now. With the ensuing charts, I'll do my best to unconfuse the numbers such that you are a bit better able to assess our performance and, perhaps more importantly, formulate an investment thesis prospectively. 
I'll open with Chart 7. Clearly, the iSOFT acquisition, the claim settlement with the U.S. government and the goodwill impairment charge have significantly influenced our results and forecast. In my commentary, I will speak to the numbers with and without these impacts. 
So if you'll turn to Chart 8. You can see the breakdown of our bookings by segment with comparisons to last year. The take away from this chart is that we have recorded $8.9 billion of new business thus far and remain optimistic that we can meet or exceed the $17 billion FY '12 target we set for ourselves. Our success in the markets speaks volume as to the viability and desirability of our product offerings. Thus far, in this third quarter, our bookings are in excess of $1 billion, and as Mike Laphen indicated, we have a line of sight to several billion more based on our submitted proposals and/or qualified pipeline. 
If you would turn to Chart 9. You will find a breakdown of second quarter revenue by line of business. The revenue of $3.966 billion on a GAAP basis is net of a $42 million revenue reduction in our MPS business arising from the claim settlement. NPS revenue modestly decline from last year. MSS revenue in constant currency reflects roughly a 3% decline, while BSS is showing meaningful revenue growth over last year. 
Operating income on Chart 10 is presented on a GAAP basis and pro forma. As noted, the pro forma presentation excludes the claims settlement impact of $269 million and the iSOFT dilution in the BSS segment of $27 million. The overall performance in MSS is eroded, as reflected in the year-over-year OI reduction. As has been said, MSS is under new leadership, with several initiatives under way to improve performance. Timing of license revenue, contract negotiations and softness in Central Europe contribute to the reduction in BSS in the quarter. 
Chart 11 lays out the full P&L for the quarter on a GAAP basis, as well as adjusted for the 3 unique items. The goodwill impairment charge of $2.685 billion and the claim settlement result in an EPS loss of $18.56 on a GAAP basis for the quarter. For the pro forma basis, adjusting out the goodwill, settlement claim and iSOFT dilution, EPS would be $0.94. Further to this chart, I want to draw your attention to the tax rate in the quarter. During the quarter, we settled the IRS audit of 2005 through 2007 tax years. This resulted in a significant reduction of the company's tax liability for the quarter. 
Chart 12 walks you from our August EPS guidance to our actual result. We begin with $1.08, at that time, we estimated $0.40 reduction in iSOFT. The actual EPS affect of iSOFT, lower operations performance and legal fees, reduced EPS by $0.20. However, the lower tax rate more than offset those reductions. As the previous chart indicated, the iSOFT dilution turned out to be $0.09, not $0.40. You'll see later on that we expect iSOFT to dilute EPS by $0.55 for the fiscal year, primarily caused by the conversion from IFRS to GAAP and the amortization of purchased intangibles. 
Turning to our selected balance sheet items on Chart 13. You will note that cash is lower than last year resulting from the repayment of our revolving credit line of $1.5 billion, plus various acquisition activities and an iSOFT debt retirement payment. The NHS repayment and dividend payments also contributed to lower cash. The impairment charge reduced the goodwill balance, net of increases through acquisitions. On the liability side, deferred revenue is lower, primarily due to the refund of the NHS advance. Debt reflects the revolver payment net of Commercial Paper borrowings, and equity is reduced principally by the goodwill charge. Obviously, less cash, coupled with the equity reduction, have moved our balance sheet ratios. 
Chart 14 displays DSOs which continued to improve. On an absolute basis, we should see in the coming quarters a reduction of approximately 8 days as a result of the government claim settlement. This moves us much closer to our industry norm. 
Now let's move to guidance. And as you can see from Chart 15, it is expressed with and without the claim settlement and goodwill, but including iSOFT. We remain convinced that the $17 billion in new business bookings is achievable. Since our last guidance, the macro economic factors affecting revenue have not improved. The NPS revenue outlook for the rest of this fiscal year, given all the and certainty in the federal sector with the super committee, is problematic. The European outlook also presents a question mark, coupled with timely decision-making or lack thereof on the NHS program, both can impact second half revenue growth. The $16.5 billion is still about a 3% increase above last year. 
Operating margin of 6% or 4.5% including the claim reflects the performance issues in MSS, the continuing challenge in the Nordics and softness in BSS Europe. EPS of $4.05 to $4.10 recognizes the reductions in operating income, the added negative impact of G&A spending on litigation and the SEC investigation, but with the added benefit of the lower tax rate. Underlying our guidance is the assumption that the NHS program continues within the framework of the MOU. 
Chart 16 attempts to simplify the movement and changes in full year EPS by walking you from our last year guidance in August of -- our full year guidance, sorry, that we gave in August of $5.30, excluding iSOFT, through all the big-ticket changes that get us through our full year GAAP basis EPS estimate. The question around guidance is really twofold. Did we achieve the second half improvement needed to achieve guidance? And what about margin improvement beyond? 
Chart 17 attempts to normalize first half margin performance by line of business by adding back the significant adjustments. Looking at the second half estimate, in light of the normalized first half performance, the answer is that the second half is not overwhelmingly difficult to achieve. As we look to the future, the realization of an overall margin of 10% or greater for CSC can be met. NPS should continue to perform around the nominal 9%. BSS, with future contribution of NHS and iSOFT, coupled with an overall European economic recovery, can yield margins in excess of 10%. MSS is the performance issue. And with that people changes and process fixes under way, margins in excess of 10% are achievable. 
So now what about EPS guidance by quarter for the second half? If you turn to Chart 18, we lay out our guidance estimate for Q3 and Q4 with comparisons to last year. Excluding goodwill and the claim settlement, we are guiding to $4.05 to $4.10, and if you adjust for the iSOFT dilution, we would exceed last year. Certainly, the improvement in our tax rate provided the offset to the OI shortfall and G&A spending. 
In closing my prepared remarks, I want remind you that we are in the process of filing our quarterly 10-Q with the SEC. If you take the time to read it, you will find expansive detailed disclosures around most, if not all, of this commentary. I will not comment specifically on the status of the SEC investigation, which, as you know, is being conducted under the direction of the independent members of our audit committee. The 10-Q will disclose that the investigation has expanded to include our Australian business, and that certain accounting errors, including suspected intentional misconduct, have been identified there. The magnitude of what has surfaced to date is much lower than in Nordics, but nonetheless disturbing. And finally, despite some obviously disappointing operational performance and the large noncash goodwill impairment charge, there are several very positive message to take away, and we look forward to a much improved second half. 
With that said, I'll turn it back to Bryan to initiate the Q&A session."

So perhaps you could help us just walk through, of the things that are isolated in your slides that are unusual, how many of those continue into next year? And I'm not sure I understood all the details correctly, but it looks like you've got $0.55 for iSOFT in terms of dilution and integration costs, and $1.35 to $1.40 of incremental SG&A to deal with the accounting issues and all the investigations under way. So that gets you in round numbers to about $1.90 to $2. And then you have a tax benefit this year of roughly $200 million. That looks like that's about $1.30. Number one, are those numbers right?

So the first supposition around iSOFT is that -- and I think we said this back when we announced the acquisition. We expected dilution this year, and we expected to be -- it should accrete next year, but in a very low way, not anything astounding. So next year we'll benefit by the absence of the $0.55 dilution. We'll still have purchased intangibles obviously that have to be amortized, et cetera. But beyond next year, iSOFT should kick in very handsomely. The SG&A spending around the investigations, it's reasonable to expect, you should see a return next year to more normalized levels of G&A spending. Now around G&A spending, there will be some residual spending associated with the remediation activities that we intend to and are in the process of implementing around improved controls and so on and so forth kind of thing. But you should expect that the lion's share of the additional spending will mitigate itself next year, which gets you down now to the operational performance. As you can see from my Chart 17, we said in MSS we expected the second half of the year to be better than the first half, and the assumption there, of course, is that one-off write-offs and the like would not repeat. The underlying structural problems in the Nordics with the large underutilized workforce, et cetera, will take us some time to work our way out of. But said again, you should see an improvement next year overall in MSS. Now at this juncture, we're not going to stick our neck out and give you any guidance about next year in terms of solid numbers, et cetera. It's a little premature for that. But only to leave you with the impression that we expect next year to be better, and we'll be a position in a few months probably to share more of that with you. But again, that is founded on a lot of assumptions, of course, overall being that the NHS program continues, that government spending reductions are not as dramatic as the failure of the super committee to reach conclusion might suggest. And again, European economic will start to stabilize such that we can see improvement in Germany, et cetera. So with all those qualifiers, we're in violent agreement with your supposition."

Now if you go back a couple of years, we were over 8% before some of the MSS problems surfaced and the investigation and so on. There's no reason to assume we can't get back there. And if we had more time and we could walk you through some of the fundamental foundational improvements we have made in the business, going back to the elimination of the pension liability and its cash drain and so on, improvements in the procurement side. So the foundation that supports the operational performance is much improved, but we are suffering from the operational performance and -- to a lesser degree, but nonetheless significant, the economic woes. Those 2 things set aside, this business can certainly outperform where it is today."

Obviously, as Mike commented, the problems and issues we've been experiencing in the MSS segment and the erosion in MSS performance that we saw in the second quarter are relative to our prior expectations have introduced caution on our part to be more conservative in the second half of the year until we're certain that the fixes we have in place have been implemented. And again, there's the economic uncertainty in a macro sense around the world in our various geographies where we're doing business, as well as the federal government are all the factors that roll up into our more conservative guidance in the second half of the year."

So I think that's the starting point from where we're going. I think it's reasonable to expect that, that will continue at that level given what needs to be supported and given the continuing activity in the war efforts. As that war effort come down, there could be more reductions. However, our footprint overseas is far less extensive than many of our competitors so we would expect to see far less impact from the downsizing of the true footprint overseas. I would say the wildcard here is the super committee and what is decided or not decided this month. And I think we'll see where we go from there. I don't expect us to get out of this continuing resolution environment essentially until we get through the elections, which I could say will be different, but I don't think that's the case. So I think through fiscal year -- or through calendar year 2012, I think basically what you see is what you get. What we have is what we get."
