I'm pleased to report we had an excellent first quarter, driven by strong creative content and our unique ability to leverage great entertainment across the many businesses and markets in which we operate. We also be",520,"Thank you, Lowell, and good afternoon. I'm pleased to report we had an excellent first quarter, driven by strong creative content and our unique ability to leverage great entertainment across the many businesses and markets in which we operate. We also benefited from growth in advertising at our Media Networks and improved consumer spending in our Parks and Consumer Products businesses. Net income was up 54% to $1.3 billion on a 10% revenue increase. EPS for the quarter, adjusting for comparability, grew 45% to $0.68.
Next week we're holding an investor conference so today I'm going to keep my remarks brief. Our performance again shows the value of our relentless focus on three core strategic priorities: Creating great entertainment, using new technology to enhance the quality and reach of that entertainment and growing our businesses and promising international markets. Nothing epitomizes our commitment to quality, creativity and future growth like the recently christened Disney cruise ship, the Disney Dream. The Dream demonstrates how we successfully built our legacy of great storytelling, technological innovation and first rate service to create a truly amazing guest experience as only we can. The impact on bookings for the entire fleet has been tremendous. 
Animation has always been at the heart of Disney, and this quarter showed how incredibly beneficial strong animated films can be for the company. Tangled, the crowd-pleasing fairytale adventure, is close to $500 million in global box office, with Japan yet to open. And has added Rapunzel to our popular court of Disney Princesses. Toy Story 3, already the number one animated movie of all time at the box office, did very well in its home video release, was a key part of the holiday success of our Consumer Products business, and I'm happy to say has been nominated for five Oscars, including Best Picture.
We also are extremely pleased with the performance of our Parks and Resorts. Despite difficult weather conditions in the U.S. and Europe, we enjoyed increases in attendance at spending at our U.S. parks with new attractions coming online, at our parks, our new Hawaiian resort opening in August and the expanded Disney Cruise Line, there will be multiple additional reasons for families to enjoy great Disney vacation. 
Our Media Networks, led by ESPN, once again had a very solid quarter. The Bowl Championship Series on ESPN was a big success in its first year, with the Auburn Oregon final being the most watched telecast in cable television history. Monday Night Football had its highest rated and most viewed season since 2006 when it moved from ABC to ESPN. Disney Channel, with its expanded portfolio of original programming, had its best ever first quarter in terms of total viewership. In ABC and particularly its own stations benefited substantially from the continued improvement in advertising rates. 
In sum, we are very pleased with how we've started off the new fiscal year. We've got a strong created strategy focused on building our brands and franchises, a talented team and a consistent focus on growing our businesses in rapidly changing markets.
And with that, I'll turn things over to Jay."

We delivered strong results in our first quarter, with double-digit growth in overall operating income and margin improvement across all of our businesses. Before we turn to your questions, I'd like to highligh",841,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered strong results in our first quarter, with double-digit growth in overall operating income and margin improvement across all of our businesses. 
Before we turn to your questions, I'd like to highlight the key drivers of our Q1 performance and discuss some of the trends and comparison issues that will influence our results for Q2 and the remainder of the year.
Profits at the Media Networks were up 47%, led by strong growth in advertising and affiliate revenue at cable networks. Ad revenue for ESPN came in 34% above prior year, driven in part by strong demand for NFL programming at the back of another year of extremely strong NFL ratings. In the quarter, ESPN added two BCS games, the Rose and Fiesta bowls. After adjusting for these two BCS games, we estimate that ESPN's ad revenue was up 27%. Thus far in Q2, ESPN ad sales are pacing up double digits versus prior year. 
Affiliate and advertising revenue in Q1 were also up at Disney Channel worldwide. In addition, results benefited from higher equity income from ANE Lifetime driven by improved performance. 
At broadcasting, results benefited from higher advertising at our own TV stations, cost reduction in use and daytime production and the shift of the Rose Bowl to ESPN. Ad revenue at our TV stations was up 20% from prior Q1, driven by higher political advertising demand. So far in Q2, ad sales pacings at the TV stations are up double digits versus prior year.
At the Networks, ABC pricing at Q1 came in 24% above upfront levels. So far this quarter, scatter pricing for ABC is running over 30% above at front levels. 
At Studio Entertainment, operating income improved significantly year-over-year, driven by reduced home entertainment distribution and marketing costs. In addition, increased home video units were driven by Toy Story 3's strong Home Entertainment performance and its earlier international release dates compared to last year's release of Up. Results were also helped by lower film write-downs.
Our Parks segment delivered strong double-digit operating income growth, driven primarily by higher guest spending, as well as increased room nights and attendance. Margins grew by 220 basis points, despite increased expenses from labor cost inflation and higher pension and healthcare costs, as well as expenses associated with our newly launched ship, the Disney Dream, and our Disney California Adventure expansion. Domestic attendance came in 2% above prior year levels. Higher admission pricing in part due to a reduction in discounting and higher food and beverage spending helped drive an 8% increase in per capita guest spending. Occupancy across our domestic hotels came in four percentage points above prior year levels at 85%. Average room spending was up 4%. Results also improved at our international parks, with higher guest spending and room nights in Paris and Hong Kong.  Looking ahead, domestic room reservations for Q2 are currently running 3% above prior year levels. 
At Consumer Products we enjoyed continued strength in our Licensing business, primarily driven by Toy Story merchandise. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue was up 12% year-over-year. Higher results also reflected the inclusion of Marvel licensing and publishing business, and improved performance at our Disney Stores North America.
Operating performance in the Interactive Media segment was in line with prior year. Solid results from our self-published games, particularly Epic Mickey and Toy Story 3, were offset by the consolidation of Playdom. Playdom's results were largely driven by purchase accounting, which will continue to impact results for the remainder of the year. 
We continue to be very pleased with advertising and park trends and remain excited about our product lineup for the remainder of the year. Separate from these trends, however, there are a few comparability issues I want to bring to your attention that will impact our Q2 report results. At Media Networks, ESPN's results will be impacted by the cost of adding three BCS games, as well as airing the Cricket World Cup by our ESPN Star Sports joint venture. Studio Entertainment faces tough comps given last year's release of Alice in Wonderland in Q2, as we have no comparable release planned this quarter. In addition Home Video comparisons will be difficult given that Up was released in many international markets in Q2 of last year. 
I also want to remind you that the timing of the Easter holiday will impact our Parks and Resort results, falling entirely in Q3 this year versus last year when one week of the holiday period fell into Q2. Our Q2 results will also include costs associated with the January launch of our new cruise ship, the Disney Dream.
During Q1, we continued to repurchase shares. For the fiscal year so far, we've purchased over 28 million shares for approximately $1 billion. Our 2011 is off to a very good start, and we look forward to discussing our strategy and initiatives in more detail with you next week at our Investor Conference.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Lowell for Q&A."

Relative to the Studio returns, there clearly were particularly in our distribution, Bob and I have talked a lot about how we have reoriented our distribution organization and our marketing organizations to really span all of the channels in the film's release. And part of the benefit of that has been felt in the Home Entertainment segment where we really have reduced both the marketing and distribution costs of taking our product to market. So the savings that are there in the improvement were not solely related to film share by any stretch of the imagination. What that annualizes out at is I'm not going to get into there are a different numbers of the releases and different products in the market every year and how we market them. I don't want to make a commitment about how that cost is going to annualize."

We've cut some deals already Time Warner being I guess the most obvious. There will be more deals to come. We fully expect to gain retransmission consent payments from distributors as deals that are currently in place expire. And we can't give you a sense for when those are, but there are negotiations going on just about all the time, nor can you tell you the percentage of deals that we've already completed or the amount of revenue that we're bringing in. We may give you some ranges about once all these deals are done, what it might mean in terms of steady-state revenue improvement, but we'll discuss that next week at the Investor Conference. The second question about the Dream, Jay I think mentioned in his opening comments that bookings for all three ships were quite strong. They are running over 80% for the year. The Dream itself is 89% booked for the year. So there's considerable interest in our Cruise business. We believe that the fact that the Dream is so booked, particularly during peak periods has actually driven people whose interest was sparked in part by the addition of the new ship to our other ships at our other itineraries. It's been very positive for us. And we've also been selling basically new cruises to people who have been on the Dream. So we've seen some encouraging reaction to people who are already sailing on the Dream and want to come back. On Shanghai, we've signed multiple agreements with the Shanghai government and our prospective partners for Shanghai Disneyland. We had received, prior to signing those agreements, preliminary approval from the Beijing or the central government, and we're now awaiting a final or formal approval from the Beijing government before we make a formal announcement and actually break ground. And we're not going to speculate when that will be."

I don't want to be explicit about the timing, but I will tell you that from our perspective, the combination of continuing to add great product to our parks around the world, as well as the interest in travel definitely coming back and the sense that we have incredible value in the way we priced our products is manifesting itself in a lot of interest. Bob mentioned what's going on in our Cruise business, just blowing the doors off in terms of demand and interest.

And  one thing that I think is interesting and we pointed this out before if you look back at the early part of the last decade, where we obviously experienced some difficult recession and other significant events like 9/11 and Middle East war, we're much better positioned today than we were then in terms of the mix of value-priced rooms, where back then we had a larger percentage of premium priced rooms and now, we've built and we continue to build. In fact, we are building right now a new value priced resort in Orlando. And so we're more accessible and we're more accessibly priced then we were then, and it doesn't have to do with discounting. It just has to do with the inventory that we currently are making available. I think that's a positive thing."

And two, I think Tom Sands was quoted in the last week answering a question related to the impact of Potter Land universal basically saying it safe to say it didn't help us, but it didn't really hurt us and we are just hoping to be can expand on how much of an impact you think Harry Potter has had on you and do you think as I starts to wear off, in terms of the newness of that park, would that actually benefit results going forward next few quarters?"

Now we had a week of torrential rains in California and we had a major Northeast blizzard right after Christmas that shut all the airports down across the northeast and made it impossible to travel. We fully expect that there will be a lot of people from that area would be going down to Orlando for instance. But we cannot quantify exactly what it is that we lost from a revenue perspective. By the way in California, we may have made up for some of it once the rain stopped because you get a lot of local attendance particularly during the holiday season when kids are out of school but its just really difficult to quantify. I'll let Jay take a stab at Harry Potter Land. Except I will say they built a great property down there, not meant to be an advertisement for the competitor. And I believe that when a competitor puts a good property in the marketplace, it brings more people rather to the market. So I think it stimulates attendance to Orlando. And we all know that that's good for us because we usually get a good piece of all visitation to Orlando."

So the impact, if there is any, of what Bob is probably being swamped by what Bob described, that to the extent that it brings more people to the market, we do get a big share of that. On your other question related to weather impacts, I only give you this insight. Needless to say, local people are more affected in general by weather than long-distance people. And across the quarter, our attendance was down on the resident side, but very much up on the international and long distance tourist side. It gives directionally some sense that we were definitely hurt by within the quarter. Whether that's a lasting effect, it usually isn't."

I am going to spend a fair amount of time next week talking about our digital media strategy overall, but I don't want to be dismissive of your question. There isn't one company, Apple or any other company for that matter, that's driving our strategy. What's driving the strategy is really the incredible developments we're seeing on the technology side that when added to great content and brands provide for more opportunity than we've ever seen before. And more opportunity for the consumer as well, not just to consume more media, but to do it in more places and with more convenience in access and navigation and interoperability. The decisions we're making in terms of what media we'll distribute our product are made based on variety of things. We want to be in a good place on a good platform, where there is good navigation and decent access to revenue. And our brand and our products are in effect showcased well and its reliable for the consumer. We want to be in places that we have growth potential so that the underlying technology or the underlying capital behind the effort is such that the platform's going to be around for a long time. And we're looking, both domestically and internationally, for opportunities to essentially create more competition among distributors. When you have great content, the more out there in terms of the ability to distribute your content to consumer the better off you are. And then there's another factor or a couple of other factors that are important. One, piracy. There's no question that being available, well priced, well time to the market is one of the best ways to combat piracy, and we have got to continue to be mindful of that because the absence of being available in a world where there's great technology and great content can be very dangerous. And then I think it's also important for us to be relevant. When you're on these new platforms you just appear to be more relevant to the consumer, and I think that is both brand enhancing and business enhancing. So I don't know if I'm choosing iOS and Android and then getting all those details we might get a little more detail with you next week but I'd be glad to discuss and will discuss in much more detail our thoughts about what's going on in the marketplace in terms of digital media and changing consumer behavior and all the different opportunities that accompany like Disney, with brands, Disney/Pixar, Marvel, ESPN, ABC, all the opportunities that we're seeing. It's pretty interesting time. And it's important to be out in front and to be experimental because we haven't discovered yet the silver bullet or the business model that's going to prevail. Probably will be many."

We've been pretty vocal about the fact that the multi-channel or basic expanded basic cable service is of great value to the consumer, particularly when you consider substantially increased investment in original programming that's available in all those channels. So you're right now getting a lot more quality and a lot more choice, and we think it's a pretty good consumer proposition. If we can add to that authentication, which is giving the consumer the ability to watch that channel in more places as we did with ESPN so you can turn a laptop on in Los Angeles if you're a Time Warner customer or in New York and watch ESPN, that's a big deal. Because all you're doing is the value creating enhanced value with the package that's being offered and for the consumer and for the distributor.

The overall home video marketplace for the industry has softened, continues to soften. We've been relatively well-positioned because of the strength of the brand, the nature of the title that we put out and as we've said a number of times, the fact that we tend to make movies that people want to own so their kids can watch them a multiple times. We also our librarying or managing our libraries very well so that when we bring certain product out, we create events by bringing them out and defy logic so to speak in terms of the marketplace. So Toy Story was a successful title internationally. Certainly the sell through rates, when you consider the conversion and the size of the box office substantially different than the marketplace we saw years back. Interestingly enough, what Toy Story 3 did was it increased sales of Toy Story 1 and 2, which we found very interesting. The library title that I thought was really interesting was we brought Beauty and the Beast back in Blu-ray in the fall, and that was extremely well-received. We bring these out as events and we package them very well in our stores and retail with a variety of different consumer products, and that's been a winning proposition. We've also seen a fair amount of success with some of our direct-the-video titles. And interestingly enough over the last three, four years, they've been fairly steady in terms of performance, and we have not seen the erosion of those kind of titles that we've seen with some of certainly the live-action the live action titles. In terms of the overall impact of home video to the Movie business, we've been steadily reducing the number of Movie titles that we make in a year. We, as you know, are talking about well under 10 Disney-branded titles a year that will include certainly a Pixar title, and hopefully a Disney animation title per year and add to that a couple of Marvel titles per year and then we'll be distributing the DreamWorks titles. We like the level that we're talking about in terms of total investment, and we're going to look as part of that mix to make big blockbusters that have big budgets Because not only we believe the work as movies but they work as franchises for the company and it's company wide or business wide events, Pirates is a great example of that. And we're also going to build into that mix relatively inexpensive titles, Disney-branded but much lower budget. I don't want to speak for the whole industry, but I think for our studio, and they know this well, it's extremely wise to take a very eyes-wide-open approach to the transfer seeing in the marketplace and we react accordingly in terms of expense. And then also react accordingly in terms of how the product is brought to marketplace in terms of pricing and windows and nature of the packages and the offering.

I'm pleased to report we had an excellent first quarter, driven by strong creative content and our unique ability to leverage great entertainment across the many platforms, businesses and markets in which we operate. We also benefited from growth in advertising at our Media Networks, and improved consumer spending in our Parks and Consumer Products businesses. Net income was up 54% to $1.3 billion on a 10% revenue increase. EPS for the quarter, adjusting for comparability, grew 45% to $0.68.
Next week we're holding an investor conference so today I'm going to keep my remarks brief. Our performance again shows the value of our relentless focus on three core strategic priorities: Creating great entertainment, using new technology to enhance the quality and reach of that entertainment and growing our businesses and promising international markets. Nothing epitomizes our commitment to quality, creativity and future growth like the recently christened Disney cruise ship, the Disney Dream. The Dream demonstrates how we successfully built our legacy of great storytelling, technological innovation and first rate service to create a truly amazing guest experience as only we can. The impact on bookings for the entire fleet has been tremendous. 
Animation has always been at the heart of Disney, and this quarter showed how incredibly beneficial strong animated films can be for the company. Tangled, the crowd-pleasing fairytale adventure, is close to $500 million in global box office, with Japan yet to open. And has added Rapunzel to our popular court of Disney Princesses. 
Toy Story 3, already the number one animated movie of all time at the box office, did very well in its home video release, was a key part of the holiday success of our Consumer Products business, and I'm happy to say has been nominated for five Oscars, including Best Picture.
We also are extremely pleased with the performance of our Parks and Resorts. Despite difficult weather conditions in the U.S. and Europe, we enjoyed increases in attendance at spending at our U.S. parks with new attractions coming online at our parks, our new Hawaiian resort opening in August, and the expanded Disney Cruise Line, there will be multiple additional reasons for families to enjoy a great Disney vacation. 
Our Media Networks, led by ESPN, once again had a very solid quarter. The Bowl Championship Series on ESPN was a big success in its first year, with the Auburn Oregon final being the most watched telecast in cable television history. 
Monday Night Football had its highest rated and most viewed season since 2006 when it moved from ABC to ESPN. Disney Channel, with its expanded portfolio of original programming, had its best ever first quarter in terms of total viewership. And ABC, and particularly its own stations, benefited substantially from the continued improvement in advertising rates. 
In sum, we are very pleased with how we've started off the new fiscal year. We've got a strong creative strategy focused on building our brands and franchises, a talented team and a consistent focus on growing our businesses in rapidly changing markets.
And with that, I'll turn things over to Jay."

We delivered strong results in our first quarter, with double-digit growth in overall operating income and margin improvement across all of our businesses. Before we turn to your questions, I'd like to highligh",841,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered strong results in our first quarter, with double-digit growth in overall operating income and margin improvement across all of our businesses. 
Before we turn to your questions, I'd like to highlight the key drivers of our Q1 performance and discuss some of the trends and comparison issues that will influence our results for Q2 and the remainder of the year.
Profits at the Media Networks were up 47%, led by strong growth in advertising and affiliate revenue at cable networks. Ad revenue for ESPN came in 34% above prior year, driven in part by strong demand for NFL programming on the back of another year of extremely strong NFL ratings. In the quarter, ESPN added two BCS games, the Rose and Fiesta bowls. After adjusting for these two BCS games, we estimate that ESPN's ad revenue was up 27%. Thus far in Q2, ESPN ad sales are pacing up double digits versus prior year. 
Affiliate and advertising revenue in Q1 were also up at Disney Channel worldwide. In addition, results benefited from higher equity income from ANE Lifetime driven by improved performance. 
At broadcasting, results benefited from higher advertising at our owned TV stations, cost reduction in use and daytime production and the shift of the Rose Bowl to ESPN. Ad revenue at our TV stations was up 20% from prior Q1, driven by higher political advertising demand. So far in Q2, ad sales pacings at the TV stations are up double digits versus prior year.
At the Networks, scatter CPM pricing in Q1 came in 24% above upfront levels. So far this quarter, scatter pricing for ABC is running over 30% above upfront levels. 
At Studio Entertainment, operating income improved significantly year-over-year, driven by reduced home entertainment distribution and marketing costs. In addition, increased home video units were driven by Toy Story 3's strong Home Entertainment performance and its earlier international release dates compared to last year's release of Up. Results were also helped by lower film write-downs.
Our Parks segment delivered strong double-digit operating income growth, driven primarily by higher guest spending, as well as increased room nights and attendance. Margins grew by 220 basis points, despite increased expenses from labor cost inflation and higher pension and healthcare costs, as well as expenses associated with our newly launched ship, the Disney Dream, and our Disney California Adventure expansion. 
Domestic attendance came in 2% above prior year levels. Higher admission pricing in part due to a reduction in discounting, and higher food and beverage spending helped drive an 8% increase in per capita guest spending. 
Occupancy across our domestic hotels came in four percentage points above prior year levels at 85%. Average room spending was up 4%. Results also improved at our international parks, with higher guest spending and room nights in Paris and Hong Kong. Looking ahead, domestic room reservations for Q2 are currently running 3% above prior year levels. 
At Consumer Products we enjoyed continued strength in our Licensing business, primarily driven by Toy Story merchandise. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue was up 12% year-over-year. Higher results also reflected the inclusion of Marvel licensing and publishing business, and improved performance at our Disney Stores North America.
Operating performance in the Interactive Media segment was in line with prior year. Solid results from our self-published games, particularly Epic Mickey and Toy Story 3, were offset by the consolidation of Playdom. Playdom's results were largely driven by purchase accounting, which will continue to impact results for the remainder of the year. 
We continue to be very pleased with advertising and park trends and remain excited about our product lineup for the remainder of the year. Separate from these trends, however, there are a few comparability issues I want to bring to your attention that will impact our Q2 report results. At Media Networks, ESPN's results will be impacted by the cost of adding three BCS games, as well as airing the Cricket World Cup by our ESPN Star Sports joint venture. Studio Entertainment faces tough comps given last year's release of Alice in Wonderland in Q2, as we have no comparable release planned this quarter. In addition Home Video comparisons will be difficult given that Up was released in many international markets in Q2 of last year. 
I also want to remind you that the timing of the Easter holiday will impact our Parks and Resort results, falling entirely in Q3 this year versus last year when one week of the holiday period fell into Q2. Our Q2 results will also include costs associated with the January launch of our new cruise ship, the Disney Dream.
During Q1, we've continued to repurchase shares. For the fiscal year so far, we've purchased over 28 million shares for approximately $1 billion. Our 2011 is off to a very good start, and we look forward to discussing our strategy and initiatives in more detail with you next week at our Investor Conference.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Lowell for Q&A."

Relative to the Studio returns, there clearly were particularly in our distribution, Bob and I have talked a lot about how we have reoriented our distribution organization and our marketing organizations to really span all of the channels in the film's release. And part of the benefit of that has been felt in the Home Entertainment segment where we really have reduced both the marketing and distribution costs of taking our product to market. So the savings that are there and the improvement were not solely related to film share by any stretch of the imagination. What that annualizes out at is -- I'm not going to get into. There are a different numbers of the releases and different products in the market every year and how we market them. I don't want to make a commitment about how that cost is going to annualize."

We've cut some deals already, Time Warner being I guess the most obvious. There will be more deals to come.

And we can't give you a sense for when those are, but there are negotiations going on just about all the time, nor can we tell you the percentage of deals that we've already completed or the amount of revenue that we're bringing in. We may give you some ranges about once all these deals are done, what it might mean in terms of steady-state revenue improvement, but we'll discuss that next week at the Investor Conference. The second question about the Dream, Jay I think mentioned in his opening comments that bookings for all three ships were quite strong. They are running over 80% for the year. The Dream itself is 89% booked for the year. So there's considerable interest in our Cruise business. We believe that the fact that the Dream is so booked, particularly during peak periods has actually driven people whose interest was sparked in part by the addition of the new ship to our other ships at our other itineraries. It's been very positive for us. And we've also been selling basically new cruises to people who have been on the Dream. So we've seen some encouraging reaction to people who are already sailing on the Dream and want to come back. On Shanghai, we've signed multiple agreements with the Shanghai government and our prospective partners for Shanghai Disneyland. We had received, prior to signing those agreements, preliminary approval from the Beijing or the central government, and we're now awaiting a final or formal approval from the Beijing government before we make a formal announcement and actually break ground. And we're not going to speculate when that will be."

I don't want to be explicit about the timing, but I will tell you that from our perspective, the combination of continuing to add great product to our parks around the world, as well as the interest in travel definitely coming back and the sense that we have incredible value in the way we priced our products is manifesting itself in a lot of interest. Bob mentioned what's going on in our Cruise business, just blowing the doors off in terms of demand and interest.

And one thing that I think is interesting, and we pointed this out before, if you look back at the early part of the last decade, when we obviously experienced some difficult recession and other significant events like 9/11 and Middle East war, we're much better positioned today than we were then in terms of the mix of value-priced rooms, where back then we had a larger percentage of premium priced rooms and now, we've built and we continue to build. In fact, we're building right now a new value priced resort in Orlando. And so we're more accessible and we're more accessibly priced then we were then, and it doesn't have to do with discounting. It just has to do with the inventory that we currently are making available. I think that's a positive thing."

We fully expect that there will be a lot of people from that area that would be going down to Orlando for instance. But we cannot quantify exactly what it is that we lost from a revenue perspective. By the way in California, we may have made up for some of it once the rain stopped because you get a lot of local attendance particularly during the holiday season when kids are out of school but its just really difficult to quantify. I'll let Jay take a stab at Harry Potter Land. Except I will say that they've built a great property down there, not meant to be an advertisement for the competitor.

But there was an offset in sort of core underlying consumer product performance because of the increase in film share that gets recognized at the studio. But the fundamental that consumer products were pretty much across-the-board. The licensing comparables were up, the Disney Store revenue has been up, and then Marvel, both the Marvel licensing business and the publishing business being included in the results, all accounted for the increase in overall CP.

I am going to spend a fair amount of time next week talking about our digital media strategy overall, but I don't want to be dismissive of your question. There isn't one company, Apple or any other company for that matter, that's driving our strategy. What's driving the strategy is really the incredible developments we're seeing on the technology side that when added to great content and brands provide for more opportunity than we've ever seen before. And more opportunity for the consumer as well, not just to consume more media, but to do it in more places and with more convenience and access and navigation and interoperability. The decisions we're making in terms of what media that we distribute our product are made based on a variety of things. We want to be in a good place on a good platform, where there is good navigation and decent access to revenue. And our brand and our products are in effect showcased well and its reliable for the consumer. We want to be in places that we have growth potential so that the underlying technology or the underlying capital behind the effort is such that the platform's going to be around for a long time. And we're looking, both domestically and internationally, for opportunities to essentially create more competition among distributors. When you have great content, the more out there in terms of the ability to distribute that content to the consumer the better off you are. And then there's another factor or a couple of other factors that are important. One, piracy. There's no question that being available, well priced, well timed to the market is one of the best ways to combat piracy, and we have got to continue to be mindful of that, because the absence of being available in a world where there's great technology and great content can be very dangerous. And then I think it's also important for us to be relevant. When you're on these new platforms you just appear to be more relevant to the consumer, and I think that is both brand enhancing and business enhancing. So I don't know that I'm choosing iOS and Android and then getting into all those details. We might get into a little bit more detail with you next week but I'd be glad to discuss, and will discuss in much more detail our thoughts about what's going on in the marketplace in terms of digital media and changing consumer behavior and all the different opportunities that accompany like Disney, with brands, Disney/Pixar, Marvel, ESPN, ABC, all the opportunities that we're seeing. It's pretty interesting time. And it's important to be out in front and to be experimental, because we haven't discovered yet the silver bullet or the business model that's going to prevail. It probably will be many."

We've been pretty vocal about the fact that the multi-channel or basic -- expanded basic cable service is of great value to the consumer, particularly when you consider substantially increased investment in original programming that's available in all those channels. So you're right now getting a lot more quality and a lot more choice, and we think it's a pretty good consumer proposition. If we can add to that authentication, which is giving the consumer the ability to watch that channel in more places as we did with ESPN so you can turn a laptop on in Los Angeles if you're a Time Warner customer or in New York and watch ESPN, that's a big deal. Because all you're doing is you're creating enhanced value for the package that's being offered and for the consumer and for the distributor. So we are extremely supportive of authentication, and believe that this is just the beginning of a trend that we'll be seeing, just not just for ESPN but for multiple Disney owned so-called cable television properties."

The overall home video marketplace for the industry has softened, continues to soften. We've been relatively well-positioned because of the strength of the brand, the nature of the titles that we put out and as we've said a number of times, the fact that we tend to make movies that people want to own so their kids can watch them a multiple times. We also are library-ing, or managing our libraries very well, so that when we bring certain product out, we create events by bringing them out and defy logic, so to speak, in terms of the marketplace. So Toy Story was a successful title internationally. Certainly the sell through rates, when you consider the conversion and the size of the box office substantially different than the marketplace we saw years back. Interestingly enough, what Toy Story 3 did was it increased sales of Toy Story 1 and 2, which we found very interesting. The library title that I thought was really interesting is we brought Beauty and the Beast back in Blu-ray in the fall, and that was extremely well-received. We bring these out as events and we package them very well in our stores and retail with a variety of different consumer products, and that's been a winning proposition. We've also seen a fair amount of success with some of our direct-to-video titles. And interestingly enough over the last three, four years, they've been fairly steady in terms of performance, and we have not seen the erosion of those kind of titles that we've seen with some of certainly the live-action, the live action titles. In terms of the overall impact of home video to the Movie business, we've been steadily reducing the number of Movie titles that we make in a year. We, as you know, are talking about well under 10 Disney-branded titles a year that will include certainly a Pixar title, and hopefully a Disney animation title per year. Add to that a couple of Marvel titles per year, and then we'll be distributing the DreamWorks titles. We like the level that we're talking about in terms of total investment, and we're going to look as part of that mix to make big blockbusters that have big budgets Because not only we believe they work as movies, but they work as franchises for the company, and it's company wide or business wide events. Pirates is a great example of that. And we're also going to build into that mix relatively inexpensive titles, Disney-branded but much lower budget. I don't want to speak for the whole industry, but I think for our studio, and they know this well, it's extremely wise to take a very eyes-wide-open approach to the trends they're seeing in the marketplace and react accordingly in terms of expense. And then also react accordingly in terms of how the product is brought to marketplace in terms of pricing and windows and nature of the packages and the offering. And we'll get into that a lot more next week."

We also benefited from growth in advertising at our Media Networks, and improved consumer spending in our Parks and Consumer Products businesses. Net income was up 54% to $1.3 billion on a 10% revenue increase. EPS for the quarter, adjusting for comparability, grew 45% to $0.68.
Next week we're holding an investor conference so today I'm going to keep my remarks brief. Our performance again shows the value of our relentless focus on three core strategic priorities: Creating great entertainment, using new technology to enhance the quality and reach of that entertainment and growing our businesses and promising international markets. Nothing epitomizes our commitment to quality, creativity and future growth like the recently christened Disney cruise ship, the Disney Dream. The Dream demonstrates how we successfully built our legacy of great storytelling, technological innovation and first rate service to create a truly amazing guest experience as only we can. The impact on bookings for the entire fleet has been tremendous. 
Animation has always been at the heart of Disney, and this quarter showed how incredibly beneficial strong animated films can be for the company. Tangled, the crowd-pleasing fairytale adventure, is close to $500 million in global box office, with Japan yet to open. And has added Rapunzel to our popular court of Disney Princesses. 
Toy Story 3, already the number one animated movie of all time at the box office, did very well in its home video release, was a key part of the holiday success of our Consumer Products business, and I'm happy to say has been nominated for five Oscars, including Best Picture.
We also are extremely pleased with the performance of our Parks and Resorts. Despite difficult weather conditions in the U.S. and Europe, we enjoyed increases in attendance at spending at our U.S. parks with new attractions coming online at our parks, our new Hawaiian resort opening in August, and the expanded Disney Cruise Line, there will be multiple additional reasons for families to enjoy a great Disney vacation. 
Our Media Networks, led by ESPN, once again had a very solid quarter. The Bowl Championship Series on ESPN was a big success in its first year, with the Auburn Oregon final being the most watched telecast in cable television history. 
Monday Night Football had its highest rated and most viewed season since 2006 when it moved from ABC to ESPN. Disney Channel, with its expanded portfolio of original programming, had its best ever first quarter in terms of total viewership. And ABC, and particularly its own stations, benefited substantially from the continued improvement in advertising rates. 
In sum, we are very pleased with how we've started off the new fiscal year. We've got a strong creative strategy focused on building our brands and franchises, a talented team and a consistent focus on growing our businesses in rapidly changing markets.
And with that, I'll turn things over to Jay."

We delivered strong results in our first quarter, with double-digit growth in overall operating income and margin improvement across all of our businesses. Before we turn to your questions, I'd like to highligh",841,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered strong results in our first quarter, with double-digit growth in overall operating income and margin improvement across all of our businesses. 
Before we turn to your questions, I'd like to highlight the key drivers of our Q1 performance and discuss some of the trends and comparison issues that will influence our results for Q2 and the remainder of the year.
Profits at the Media Networks were up 47%, led by strong growth in advertising and affiliate revenue at cable networks. Ad revenue for ESPN came in 34% above prior year, driven in part by strong demand for NFL programming on the back of another year of extremely strong NFL ratings. In the quarter, ESPN added two BCS games, the Rose and Fiesta bowls. After adjusting for these two BCS games, we estimate that ESPN's ad revenue was up 27%. Thus far in Q2, ESPN ad sales are pacing up double digits versus prior year. 
Affiliate and advertising revenue in Q1 were also up at Disney Channel worldwide. In addition, results benefited from higher equity income from ANE Lifetime driven by improved performance. 
At broadcasting, results benefited from higher advertising at our owned TV stations, cost reduction in use and daytime production and the shift of the Rose Bowl to ESPN. Ad revenue at our TV stations was up 20% from prior Q1, driven by higher political advertising demand. So far in Q2, ad sales pacings at the TV stations are up double digits versus prior year.
At the Networks, scatter CPM pricing in Q1 came in 24% above upfront levels. So far this quarter, scatter pricing for ABC is running over 30% above upfront levels. 
At Studio Entertainment, operating income improved significantly year-over-year, driven by reduced home entertainment distribution and marketing costs. In addition, increased home video units were driven by Toy Story 3's strong Home Entertainment performance and its earlier international release dates compared to last year's release of Up. Results were also helped by lower film write-downs.
Our Parks segment delivered strong double-digit operating income growth, driven primarily by higher guest spending, as well as increased room nights and attendance. Margins grew by 220 basis points, despite increased expenses from labor cost inflation and higher pension and healthcare costs, as well as expenses associated with our newly launched ship, the Disney Dream, and our Disney California Adventure expansion. 
Domestic attendance came in 2% above prior year levels. Higher admission pricing in part due to a reduction in discounting, and higher food and beverage spending helped drive an 8% increase in per capita guest spending. 
Occupancy across our domestic hotels came in four percentage points above prior year levels at 85%. Average room spending was up 4%. Results also improved at our international parks, with higher guest spending and room nights in Paris and Hong Kong. Looking ahead, domestic room reservations for Q2 are currently running 3% above prior year levels. 
At Consumer Products we enjoyed continued strength in our Licensing business, primarily driven by Toy Story merchandise. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue was up 12% year-over-year. Higher results also reflected the inclusion of Marvel licensing and publishing business, and improved performance at our Disney Stores North America.
Operating performance in the Interactive Media segment was in line with prior year. Solid results from our self-published games, particularly Epic Mickey and Toy Story 3, were offset by the consolidation of Playdom. Playdom's results were largely driven by purchase accounting, which will continue to impact results for the remainder of the year. 
We continue to be very pleased with advertising and park trends and remain excited about our product lineup for the remainder of the year. Separate from these trends, however, there are a few comparability issues I want to bring to your attention that will impact our Q2 report results. At Media Networks, ESPN's results will be impacted by the cost of adding three BCS games, as well as airing the Cricket World Cup by our ESPN Star Sports joint venture. Studio Entertainment faces tough comps given last year's release of Alice in Wonderland in Q2, as we have no comparable release planned this quarter. In addition Home Video comparisons will be difficult given that Up was released in many international markets in Q2 of last year. 
I also want to remind you that the timing of the Easter holiday will impact our Parks and Resort results, falling entirely in Q3 this year versus last year when one week of the holiday period fell into Q2. Our Q2 results will also include costs associated with the January launch of our new cruise ship, the Disney Dream.
During Q1, we've continued to repurchase shares. For the fiscal year so far, we've purchased over 28 million shares for approximately $1 billion. Our 2011 is off to a very good start, and we look forward to discussing our strategy and initiatives in more detail with you next week at our Investor Conference.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Lowell for Q&A."

And part of the benefit of that has been felt in the Home Entertainment segment where we really have reduced both the marketing and distribution costs of taking our product to market. So the savings that are there and the improvement were not solely related to film share by any stretch of the imagination. What that annualizes out at is -- I'm not going to get into. There are a different numbers of the releases and different products in the market every year and how we market them. I don't want to make a commitment about how that cost is going to annualize."

And we can't give you a sense for when those are, but there are negotiations going on just about all the time, nor can we tell you the percentage of deals that we've already completed or the amount of revenue that we're bringing in. We may give you some ranges about once all these deals are done, what it might mean in terms of steady-state revenue improvement, but we'll discuss that next week at the Investor Conference. The second question about the Dream, Jay I think mentioned in his opening comments that bookings for all three ships were quite strong. They are running over 80% for the year. The Dream itself is 89% booked for the year. So there's considerable interest in our Cruise business. We believe that the fact that the Dream is so booked, particularly during peak periods has actually driven people whose interest was sparked in part by the addition of the new ship to our other ships at our other itineraries. It's been very positive for us. And we've also been selling basically new cruises to people who have been on the Dream. So we've seen some encouraging reaction to people who are already sailing on the Dream and want to come back. On Shanghai, we've signed multiple agreements with the Shanghai government and our prospective partners for Shanghai Disneyland. We had received, prior to signing those agreements, preliminary approval from the Beijing or the central government, and we're now awaiting a final or formal approval from the Beijing government before we make a formal announcement and actually break ground. And we're not going to speculate when that will be."

I don't want to be explicit about the timing, but I will tell you that from our perspective, the combination of continuing to add great product to our parks around the world, as well as the interest in travel definitely coming back and the sense that we have incredible value in the way we priced our products is manifesting itself in a lot of interest.

And one thing that I think is interesting, and we pointed this out before, if you look back at the early part of the last decade, when we obviously experienced some difficult recession and other significant events like 9/11 and Middle East war, we're much better positioned today than we were then in terms of the mix of value-priced rooms, where back then we had a larger percentage of premium priced rooms and now, we've built and we continue to build. In fact, we're building right now a new value priced resort in Orlando. And so we're more accessible and we're more accessibly priced then we were then, and it doesn't have to do with discounting. It just has to do with the inventory that we currently are making available. I think that's a positive thing."

We fully expect that there will be a lot of people from that area that would be going down to Orlando for instance. But we cannot quantify exactly what it is that we lost from a revenue perspective. By the way in California, we may have made up for some of it once the rain stopped because you get a lot of local attendance particularly during the holiday season when kids are out of school but its just really difficult to quantify. I'll let Jay take a stab at Harry Potter Land. Except I will say that they've built a great property down there, not meant to be an advertisement for the competitor. And I believe that when a competitor puts a good property in the marketplace, it brings more people, rather, to the market. So I think it stimulates attendance to Orlando.

But there was an offset in sort of core underlying consumer product performance because of the increase in film share that gets recognized at the studio. But the fundamental that consumer products were pretty much across-the-board. The licensing comparables were up, the Disney Store revenue has been up, and then Marvel, both the Marvel licensing business and the publishing business being included in the results, all accounted for the increase in overall CP.

I am going to spend a fair amount of time next week talking about our digital media strategy overall, but I don't want to be dismissive of your question. There isn't one company, Apple or any other company for that matter, that's driving our strategy. What's driving the strategy is really the incredible developments we're seeing on the technology side that when added to great content and brands provide for more opportunity than we've ever seen before. And more opportunity for the consumer as well, not just to consume more media, but to do it in more places and with more convenience and access and navigation and interoperability. The decisions we're making in terms of what media that we distribute our product are made based on a variety of things. We want to be in a good place on a good platform, where there is good navigation and decent access to revenue. And our brand and our products are in effect showcased well and its reliable for the consumer. We want to be in places that we have growth potential so that the underlying technology or the underlying capital behind the effort is such that the platform's going to be around for a long time. And we're looking, both domestically and internationally, for opportunities to essentially create more competition among distributors. When you have great content, the more out there in terms of the ability to distribute that content to the consumer the better off you are. And then there's another factor or a couple of other factors that are important. One, piracy. There's no question that being available, well priced, well timed to the market is one of the best ways to combat piracy, and we have got to continue to be mindful of that, because the absence of being available in a world where there's great technology and great content can be very dangerous. And then I think it's also important for us to be relevant. When you're on these new platforms you just appear to be more relevant to the consumer, and I think that is both brand enhancing and business enhancing. So I don't know that I'm choosing iOS and Android and then getting into all those details. We might get into a little bit more detail with you next week but I'd be glad to discuss, and will discuss in much more detail our thoughts about what's going on in the marketplace in terms of digital media and changing consumer behavior and all the different opportunities that accompany like Disney, with brands, Disney/Pixar, Marvel, ESPN, ABC, all the opportunities that we're seeing. It's pretty interesting time. And it's important to be out in front and to be experimental, because we haven't discovered yet the silver bullet or the business model that's going to prevail. It probably will be many."

We've been pretty vocal about the fact that the multi-channel or basic -- expanded basic cable service is of great value to the consumer, particularly when you consider substantially increased investment in original programming that's available in all those channels. So you're right now getting a lot more quality and a lot more choice, and we think it's a pretty good consumer proposition. If we can add to that authentication, which is giving the consumer the ability to watch that channel in more places as we did with ESPN so you can turn a laptop on in Los Angeles if you're a Time Warner customer or in New York and watch ESPN, that's a big deal. Because all you're doing is you're creating enhanced value for the package that's being offered and for the consumer and for the distributor. So we are extremely supportive of authentication, and believe that this is just the beginning of a trend that we'll be seeing, just not just for ESPN but for multiple Disney owned so-called cable television properties."

The overall home video marketplace for the industry has softened, continues to soften. We've been relatively well-positioned because of the strength of the brand, the nature of the titles that we put out and as we've said a number of times, the fact that we tend to make movies that people want to own so their kids can watch them a multiple times. We also are library-ing, or managing our libraries very well, so that when we bring certain product out, we create events by bringing them out and defy logic, so to speak, in terms of the marketplace. So Toy Story was a successful title internationally. Certainly the sell through rates, when you consider the conversion and the size of the box office substantially different than the marketplace we saw years back. Interestingly enough, what Toy Story 3 did was it increased sales of Toy Story 1 and 2, which we found very interesting. The library title that I thought was really interesting is we brought Beauty and the Beast back in Blu-ray in the fall, and that was extremely well-received. We bring these out as events and we package them very well in our stores and retail with a variety of different consumer products, and that's been a winning proposition. We've also seen a fair amount of success with some of our direct-to-video titles. And interestingly enough over the last three, four years, they've been fairly steady in terms of performance, and we have not seen the erosion of those kind of titles that we've seen with some of certainly the live-action, the live action titles. In terms of the overall impact of home video to the Movie business, we've been steadily reducing the number of Movie titles that we make in a year. We, as you know, are talking about well under 10 Disney-branded titles a year that will include certainly a Pixar title, and hopefully a Disney animation title per year. Add to that a couple of Marvel titles per year, and then we'll be distributing the DreamWorks titles. We like the level that we're talking about in terms of total investment, and we're going to look as part of that mix to make big blockbusters that have big budgets Because not only we believe they work as movies, but they work as franchises for the company, and it's company wide or business wide events. Pirates is a great example of that. And we're also going to build into that mix relatively inexpensive titles, Disney-branded but much lower budget. I don't want to speak for the whole industry, but I think for our studio, and they know this well, it's extremely wise to take a very eyes-wide-open approach to the trends they're seeing in the marketplace and react accordingly in terms of expense. And then also react accordingly in terms of how the product is brought to marketplace in terms of pricing and windows and nature of the packages and the offering.

I'm pleased to report we had an excellent first quarter, driven by strong creative content and our unique ability to leverage great entertainment across the many platforms, businesses and markets in which we operate. We also benefited from growth in advertising at our Media Networks, and improved consumer spending at our Parks and Consumer Products businesses. Net income was up 54% to $1.3 billion on a 10% revenue increase. EPS for the quarter, adjusting for comparability, grew 45% to $0.68.
Next week we're holding an investor conference so today I'm going to keep my remarks brief. Our performance again shows the value of our relentless focus on three core strategic priorities: Creating great entertainment, using new technology to enhance the quality and reach of that entertainment and growing our businesses in promising international markets. Nothing epitomizes our commitment to quality, creativity and future growth like the recently christened Disney cruise ship, the Disney Dream. The Dream demonstrates how we successfully build on our legacy of great storytelling, technological innovation and first rate service to create a truly amazing guest experience as only we can. The impact on bookings for the entire fleet has been tremendous. 
Animation has always been at the heart of Disney, and this quarter showed how incredibly beneficial strong animated films can be for the company. Tangled, the crowd-pleasing fairytale adventure, is close to $500 million in global box office, with Japan yet to open. And has added Rapunzel to our popular court of Disney Princesses. 
Toy Story 3, already the number one animated movie of all time at the box office, did very well in its home video release, was a key part of the holiday success of our Consumer Products business, and I'm happy to say has been nominated for five Oscars, including Best Picture.
We also are extremely pleased with the performance of our Parks and Resorts. Despite difficult weather conditions in the U.S. and Europe, we enjoyed increases in attendance and spending at our U.S. parks with new attractions coming online at our parks, our new Hawaiian resort opening in August, and the expanded Disney Cruise Line, there will be multiple additional reasons for families to enjoy a great Disney vacation. 
Our Media Networks, led by ESPN, once again had a very solid quarter. The Bowl Championship Series on ESPN was a big success in its first year, with the Auburn/Oregon final being the most watched telecast in cable television history. 
Monday Night Football had its highest rated and most viewed season since 2006 when it moved from ABC to ESPN. Disney Channel, with its expanded portfolio of original programming, had its best ever first quarter in terms of total viewership. And ABC, and particularly its own stations, benefited substantially from the continued improvement in advertising rates. 
In sum, we are very pleased with how we've started off the new fiscal year. We've got a strong creative strategy focused on building our brands and franchises, a talented team and a consistent focus on growing our businesses in rapidly changing markets.
And with that, I'll turn things over to Jay."

We delivered strong results in our first quarter, with double-digit growth in overall operating income and margin improvement across all of our businesses. Before we turn to your questions, I'd like to highligh",841,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered strong results in our first quarter, with double-digit growth in overall operating income and margin improvement across all of our businesses. 
Before we turn to your questions, I'd like to highlight the key drivers of our Q1 performance and discuss some of the trends and comparison issues that will influence our results for Q2 and the remainder of the year.
Profits at the Media Networks were up 47%, led by strong growth in advertising and affiliate revenue at cable networks. Ad revenue for ESPN came in 34% above prior year, driven in part by strong demand for NFL programming on the back of another year of extremely strong NFL ratings. In the quarter, ESPN added two BCS games, the Rose and Fiesta Bowls. After adjusting for these two BCS games, we estimate that ESPN's ad revenue was up 27%. Thus far in Q2, ESPN's ad sales are pacing up double digits versus prior year. 
Affiliate and advertising revenue in Q1 were also up at Disney Channel worldwide. In addition, results benefited from higher equity income from ANE Lifetime driven by improved performance. 
At broadcasting, results benefited from higher advertising at our owned TV stations, cost reduction in news and daytime production and the shift of the Rose Bowl to ESPN. Ad revenue at our TV stations was up 20% from prior Q1, driven by higher political advertising demand. So far in Q2, ad sales pacings at the TV stations are up double digits versus prior year.
At the Networks, scatter CPM pricing in Q1 came in 24% above upfront levels. So far this quarter, scatter pricing for ABC is running over 30% above upfront levels. 
At Studio Entertainment, operating income improved significantly year-over-year, driven by reduced home entertainment distribution and marketing costs. In addition, increased home video units were driven by Toy Story 3's strong Home Entertainment performance and its earlier international release dates compared to last year's release of Up. Results were also helped by lower film write-downs.
Our Parks segment delivered strong double-digit operating income growth, driven primarily by higher guest spending, as well as increased room nights and attendance. Margins grew by 220 basis points, despite increased expenses from labor cost inflation and higher pension and healthcare costs, as well as expenses associated with our newly launched ship, the Disney Dream, and our Disney California Adventure expansion. 
Domestic attendance came in 2% above prior year levels. Higher admission pricing in part due to a reduction in discounting, and higher food and beverage spending helped drive an 8% increase in per capita guest spending. 
Occupancy across our domestic hotels came in four percentage points above prior year levels at 85%. Average room spending was up 4%. Results also improved at our international parks, with higher guest spending and room nights in Paris and Hong Kong. Looking ahead, domestic room reservations for Q2 are currently running 3% above prior year levels. 
At Consumer Products we enjoyed continued strength in our Licensing business, primarily driven by Toy Story merchandise. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue was up 12% year-over-year. Higher results also reflected the inclusion of Marvel licensing and publishing business, and improved performance at our Disney Stores North America.
Operating performance in the Interactive Media segment was in line with prior year. Solid results from our self-published games, particularly Epic Mickey and Toy Story 3, were offset by the consolidation of Playdom. Playdom's results were largely driven by purchase accounting, which will continue to impact results for the remainder of the year. 
We continue to be very pleased with advertising and park trends and remain excited about our product lineup for the remainder of the year. Separate from these trends, however, there are a few comparability issues I want to bring to your attention that will impact our Q2 report results. At Media Networks, ESPN's results will be impacted by the cost of adding three BCS games, as well as airing the Cricket World Cup by our ESPN Star Sports joint venture. Studio Entertainment faces tough comps given last year's release of Alice in Wonderland in Q2, as we have no comparable release planned this quarter. In addition Home Video comparisons will be difficult given that Up was released in many international markets in Q2 of last year. 
I also want to remind you that the timing of the Easter holiday will impact our Parks and Resort results, falling entirely in Q3 this year versus last year when one week of the holiday period fell into Q2. Our Q2 results will also include costs associated with the January launch of our new cruise ship, the Disney Dream.
During Q1, we've continued to repurchase shares. For the fiscal year so far, we've purchased over 28 million shares for approximately $1 billion. Our 2011 is off to a very good start, and we look forward to discussing our strategy and initiatives in more detail with you next week at our Investor Conference.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Lowell for Q&A."

Relative to the Studio returns, there clearly were particularly in our distribution, Bob and I have talked a lot about how we have reoriented our distribution organization and our marketing organizations to really span all of the channels of a film's release. And part of the benefit of that has been felt in the Home Entertainment segment where we really have reduced both the marketing and distribution costs of taking our product to market. So the savings that are there and the improvement were not solely related to film share by any stretch of the imagination. What that annualizes out at is -- I'm not going to get into. There are different numbers of the releases and different products in the market every year and how we market them. I don't want to make a commitment about how that cost is going to annualize."

We've cut some deals already, Time Warner being I think the most obvious. There will be more deals to come.

And we can't give you a sense for when those are, but there are negotiations going on just about all the time, nor can we tell you the percentage of deals that we've already completed or the amount of revenue that we're bringing in. We may give you some ranges about once all these deals are done, what it might mean in terms of steady-state revenue improvement, but we'll discuss that next week at the Investor Conference. The second question about the Dream, Jay I think mentioned in his opening comments that bookings for all three ships were quite strong. They are running over 80% for the year. The Dream itself is 89% booked for the year. So there's considerable interest in our Cruise business. We believe that the fact that the Dream is so booked, particularly during peak periods has actually driven people whose interest was sparked in part by the addition of the new ship to our other ships and our other itineraries. It's been very positive for us. And we've also been selling basically new cruises to people who have been on the Dream. So we've seen some encouraging reaction to people who are already sailing on the Dream who want to come back. On Shanghai, we've signed multiple agreements with the Shanghai government and our prospective partners for Shanghai Disneyland. We had received, prior to signing those agreements, preliminary approval from the Beijing or the central government, and we're now awaiting a final or formal approval from the Beijing government before we make a formal announcement and actually break ground. And we're not going to speculate when that will be."

I don't want to be explicit about the timing, but I will tell you that from our perspective, the combination of continuing to add great product to our parks around the world, as well as the interest in travel definitely coming back and the sense that we have incredible value in the way we priced our products is manifesting itself in a lot of interest. Bob mentioned what's going on in our Cruise business, just blowing the doors off in terms of demand and interest.

There isn't a significant change in booking window for instance. So you still have an environment that, while less challenged than it was certainly a year ago, it still has its challenges. Another thing that I think is interesting, and we pointed this out before, if you look back at the early part of the last decade, when we obviously experienced some difficult recession and other significant events like 9/11 and Mid East war, we're much better positioned today than we were then in terms of the mix of value-priced rooms, where back then we had a larger percentage of premium priced rooms and now, we've built and we continue to build with, in fact, we're building right now a new value priced resort in Orlando. And so we're more accessible and we're more accessibly priced then we were then, and it doesn't have to do with discounting. It just has to do with the inventory that we currently are making available. I think that's a positive thing."

But we cannot quantify exactly what it is that we lost from a revenue perspective. By the way in California, we may have made up for some of it once the rain stopped because you get a lot of local attendance particularly during the holiday season when kids are out of school but it's just really difficult to quantify. I'll let Jay take a stab at Harry Potter Land. Except I will say that they've built a great property down there, not meant to be an advertisement for the competitor.

I am going to spend a fair amount of time next week talking about our digital media strategy overall, but I don't want to be dismissive of your question. There isn't one company, Apple or any other company for that matter, that's driving our strategy. What's driving the strategy is really the incredible developments we're seeing on the technology side that when added to great content and brands provide for more opportunity than we've ever seen before. And more opportunity for the consumer as well, not just to consume more media, but to do it in more places and with more convenience and access and navigation and interoperability. The decisions we're making in terms of what media that we distribute our product are made based on a variety of things. We want to be in a good place on a good platform, where there is good navigation and decent access to revenue. And our brand and our products are in effect showcased well and its reliable for the consumer. We want to be in places that we believe have growth potential so that the underlying technology or the underlying capital behind the effort is such that the platform's going to be around for a long time. And we're looking, both domestically and internationally, for opportunities to essentially create more competition among distributors. When you have great content, the more out there in terms of your ability to distribute that content to the consumer the better off you are. And then there's another factor or a couple of other factors that are important. One, piracy. There's no question that being available, well priced, well timed to the market is one of the best ways to combat piracy, and we have got to continue to be mindful of that, because the absence of being available in a world where there's great technology and great content can be very dangerous. And then I think it's also important for us to be relevant. When you're on these new platforms you just appear to be more relevant to the consumer, and I think that is both brand enhancing and business enhancing. So I don't know that I'm choosing iOS and Android and then getting into all those details. We might get into a little bit more detail with you next week but I'd be glad to discuss, and will discuss in much more detail our thoughts about what's going on in the marketplace in terms of digital media and changing consumer behavior and all the different opportunities that accompany like Disney, with brands, Disney/Pixar, Marvel, ESPN, ABC, all the opportunities that we're seeing. It's a pretty interesting time. And it's important to be out in front and to be experimental, because we haven't discovered yet the silver bullet or the business model that's going to prevail. It probably will be many."

We've been pretty vocal about the fact that the multi-channel or basic -- expanded basic cable service is of great value to the consumer, particularly when you consider substantially increased investment in original programming that's available in all those channels. So you're right now getting a lot more quality and a lot more choice, and we think it's a pretty good consumer proposition. If we can add to that authentication, which is giving the consumer the ability to watch that channel in more places as we did with ESPN so you can turn a laptop on in Los Angeles if you're a Time Warner customer or in New York and watch ESPN, that's a big deal. Because all you're doing is you're creating enhanced value for the package that's being offered and for the consumer and for the distributor.

The overall home video marketplace for the industry has softened, continues to soften. We've been relatively well-positioned because of the strength of the brand, the nature of the titles that we put out and as we've said a number of times, the fact that we tend to make movies that people want to own so their kids can watch them multiple times. We also are library-ing, or managing our libraries very well, so that when we bring certain product out, we create events by bringing them out and defy logic, so to speak, in terms of the marketplace. So, look, Toy Story was a successful title internationally. Certainly the sell through rates, when you consider the conversion and the size of the box office substantially different than the marketplace we saw years back. Interestingly enough, what Toy Story 3 did was it increased sales of Toy Story 1 and 2, which we found very interesting. The library title that I thought was really interesting is we brought Beauty and the Beast back in Blu-ray in the fall, and that was extremely well-received. We bring these out as events and we package them very well at our stores and at retail with a variety of different consumer products, and that's been a winning proposition. We've also seen a fair amount of success with some of our direct-to-video titles. And interestingly enough over the last three, four years, they've been fairly steady in terms of performance, and we have not seen the erosion of those kind of titles that we've seen with some of the certainly, the live action titles. In terms of the overall impact of home video to the Movie business, we've been steadily reducing the number of Movie titles that we make in a year. We, as you know, are talking about well under 10 Disney-branded titles a year that will include certainly a Pixar title, and hopefully a Disney animation title per year. Add to that a couple of Marvel titles per year, and then we'll be distributing the DreamWorks titles. We like the level that we're talking about in terms of total investment, and we're going to look as part of that mix to make big blockbusters that have big budgets because not only we believe they work as movies, but they work as franchises for the company, and it's company wide or business wide events. Pirates is a great example of that. And we're also going to build into that mix relatively inexpensive titles, Disney-branded but much lower budget. I don't want to speak for the whole industry, but I think for our studio, and they know this well, it's extremely wise to take a very eyes-wide-open approach to the trends they're seeing in the marketplace and react accordingly in terms of expense. And then also react accordingly in terms of how the product is brought to marketplace in terms of pricing and windows and nature of the packages and the offering. And we'll get into that a lot more next week."

We reported Q2 earnings per share of $0.49, up $0.01 from last year. The underlying quality of our earnings was good, but our results were particularly impacted by 4 items which we estimate collectively reduce",1299,"Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. We reported Q2 earnings per share of $0.49, up $0.01 from last year. The underlying quality of our earnings was good, but our results were particularly impacted by 4 items which we estimate collectively reduced operating income by approximately $1170 million versus last year. These items are: first, the impact of the very disappointing performance of Mars Needs Moms and the year-over-year timing difference of key Pixar DVD releases, which together produced results at Studio Entertainment by roughly $90 million; second, an estimated $23 million impact on Parks and Resorts from the Easter calendar shift.; third, the impact of the devastating Japan earthquake, which we estimate reduced operating income at our Parks and Consumer Products businesses by $25 million. And finally, a $34 million impact on Interactive Media results from purchase accounting from the Playdom acquisition. These 4 items collectively reduced EPS by about $0.06.
Now I'll turn to the main drivers of our Q2 performance in our business segments. Media Networks operating income was up 17%, driven by growth in affiliate and advertising revenue at ESPN and Disney Channels, as well as at our Broadcast Network and our TV stations. At ESPN, ad revenue came in 43% above prior year. During the quarter, ESPN added 3 BCS college football games, including the National Championship Game. When adjusting for these, we estimate that ESPN's ad revenue was up by 23%.  In Q2 ESPN recorded lower equity income as a result of higher programming costs at our ESPN Star Sports joint venture due to its airing of the Cricket World Cup. 
At Broadcasting, strong results were driven by increased revenue from advertising and from retransmission fees, as well as higher sales of ABC produced shows. Results were also help to buy a decrease news production cost.
ABC network advertising revenue was up in the second quarter, helped by strong pricing in the marketplace, particularly upset by, partially offset by lower ratings. Q2 scatter CPMs came in 41% above upfront levels. Ad revenue at our TV stations was up 6% in the second quarter.
At Studio Entertainment, operating income was impacted by the timing comparison of key DVD releases and by lower performance of our theatrical slate. As expected, home video results were affected by the difference in the international release timing between Up, which was released in Q2 last year, and Toy Story 3, which was released in most markets in Q1 this year. We estimate this timing difference impacted Q2 operating income by $15 million.
As I mentioned earlier, the Studio results were also impacted by the very disappointing performance of Mars Needs Moms, which reduced Studio operating income by more than $70 million in Q2 driven by both PMA spending on the film and an incremental impairment charge.
At the Parks and Resorts segment, operating results reflected higher costs at Disney Cruise Line and the loss of royalties resulting from the Japan earthquake. In addition, Q2 results across our parks last year included 1 week of the Easter holiday, whereas the holiday period this year falls entirely in Q3.  Underlying trends at our Parks and Resorts were solid. Domestic attendants in Q2 came in flat to prior year levels. We estimate that without the impact of the Easter timing shift, attendance at our domestic parks would have been up 2% versus prior year. Per capita guest spending rose by 6%, driven by higher pricing and lower discounting. Occupancy across our Domestic Hotels came in 1 percentage points above prior year levels at 81%. Per room spending was up 4%.
At our International Parks, higher results in Paris and Hong Kong were offset by the loss of royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort, which was closed for about 3 weeks during Q2 due to the earthquake in Japan. 
Our Consumer Products improved comparable store sales at Disney Stores North America and higher licensing results drove profit growth in the quarter. Merchandise sales from franchised properties Cars and Tangled were strong in Q2. On a comparable basis, Disney branded earned licensing revenue was up 5% year-over-year.
At Interactive Media segment, purchase accounting from the acquisition of Playdom as expected continues to impact results. In the quarter, we recorded $34 million in purchase accounting charges. Segment results also reflected product development spending in social and mobile games and virtual worlds.
Overall, we delivered double-digit growth in operating income and earnings per share to the first half of the year. Now I'd like to highlight the business trends we're seeing so far this quarter, and provide some of the key swing factors that will impact our results for the remainder of the year. At Media, ABC network scatter pricing is running more than 35% above upfront levels. Ad sales at ESPN and at our TV stations are pacing up single digits versus prior year. Both businesses faced top comps in Q3 since they each delivered double-digit ad revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 2010. Also bear in mind that last year's Q3 results at ESPN reflected the benefit of the World Cup and a seven-game Lakers-Celtics NBA Final, while TV station advertising benefited from strong political ad spending. You may recall that last year, ESPN reached most of its key programming commitments in the third quarter. At this time, we do not expect to reach some of these commitments until Q4 this year. We currently expect net affiliate revenue recognition related to program covenant timing to be $228 million lower in Q3 than in prior year. However, we expect Q4 net affiliate revenue recognition to be $245 million higher than in prior year.  Of course, a relatively small number of programming hours could shift some revenue recognition from Q4 to Q3. 
At Parks and Resorts, room reservations at our Domestic Resorts for Q3 are currently running 2.5% below prior-year levels, while booked room rates are running double digits ahead of prior year. The increase in pricing that we're seeing in our business and is consistent with the strategy we articulated to reduce discounting. I will also remind you that the last Q3 Parks and Resorts result included the benefit of a real estate transaction at Disneyland Paris which added about $30 million to operating income on a sales price of approximately $60 million.  We expect the aftermath of the Japan earthquake to continue to impact our business for the remainder of the year. While it's difficult to predict consumer behavior and the pace of infrastructure improvements, we estimate several cents of earnings risk for the remainder of the year.
At our Studio segment, we are excited about are 4 big summer releases, starting with Thor, which opened domestically last Friday, Pirates of the Caribbean 4, coming to theaters May 20, Cars 2 on June 24, and Captain America: The First Avenger to be released on July 22. The performance of these films will be key swing factors for the remainder of the year.
At Interactive Media segment, key game titles in the second half of the year include Cars 2 and Lego Pirates.
Playdom purchase accounting will continue to impact segment results for the remainder of the year.
Last weak, we announced to employees that we are implementing changes to our salary pension plans. We expect these changes will reduce our pension expense by 25% to 30% versus what we would've incurred under our historic program. While the estimated cost savings are dependent on a variety of assumptions, including a discount rate, we currently estimate total savings between $350 million and $400 million over the next 5 years starting in fiscal 2012. 
Finally, we have continued to repurchase shares. For the fiscal year so far, we've repurchased almost 52 million shares for approximately $2 billion.
With that, let me turn the call over to Bob."

I'd like to reiterate that we're pleased with the underlying quality of our earnings this quarter, and our confidence in the trends we are seeing across our segments. The attendance and spending trends at our Parks and Resorts remain encouraging, as do the advertising trends at our Broadcast and Cable Networks. With a wealth of great creative properties coming in the next 6 months, 2011 is shaping up to deliver strong results.
As you know, last month we broke ground on the Shanghai Disney Resort, our 6th resort, and the first in mainland China. This marked a defining moment in the history of the Walt Disney Company. Shanghai Disney resort is our largest foreign investment, and will be a critical component of our growth in China. And our imagineers are deep into the design phase and it opens in approximately 5 years and will combine great Disney storytelling and beloved characters, with authentic cultural touches, tailored specifically for the people of China. In essence, it will be authentically Disney and distinctly Chinese.
At the Studio, we're extremely excited for the May 20 release of Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, the fourth film on our extremely successful, multibillion-dollar franchise. Johnny Depp reprises his iconic role, this time with Penélope Cruz by his side. And just this past weekend, we celebrated the world premiere at Disneyland, home of the original attraction, and the film stars are now in Moscow for our first ever Russian premier of the Pirates film. It will also release in a date in China and most foreign markets.
On June 24, Disney/Pixar's Cars 2 premieres. The Movie directed by John Lasseter will continue to drive a significant consumer products present at the Disney Stores and major retailers, which should sustain through the holiday season. Work is also continuing on Cars Land at Disney California Adventure, which will bring guests into the remarkable world of Radiator Springs when it opens in summer of 2012.
This past week, Thor opened in theaters in the U.S. and in multiple overseas markets, and its current global box office is just over $250 million, which is a strong and important opening. This film, along with this summer's Captain America: The First Avenger, plus Iron Man and the Hulk, is a key component of Marvel's Avengers franchise. Marvel's First Avenger film launches next summer and will be the first Marvel film to be marketed and distributed by Disney.
At ABC, we're currently in the middle of screening Pilots and we're excited about the quality and variety of the shows we're seeing. This crop of Pilots represent the work of a new management team and we're hopeful these new shows will firmly anchor our prime time schedule in the years ahead. All signs are that next week's upfront will be a strong one.
Last month, Disney Channel scored yet another hit with Lemonade Mount, the top original cable movie of 2011, which helped post Disney Channel post-best ever April. Disney Channel's newly branded programming block for preschoolers, Disney Junior continues to flourish with shows like Jake and the Neverland Pirates, which is TV's top series with preschoolers and is facing as Disney Channel's top preschool series of all time.  Disney Channel XD continues to perform very strongly and is delivering record ratings levels in 2011, with double-digit year-over-year growth in key demographics.
ESPN continues to grow in both ratings and reach. In fact, this was ESPN's highest rated Q2 on record. Rating increasing by 10% driven by strong results of the BCS bowl games and ESPN's highest-rated NBA regular season ever.  With its expert coverage of the NFL, the NBA, major league baseball, NASCAR, golf, tennis, and even cricket, ESPN has created integrated digital platforms that keep fans informed and entertained. Additionally, ESPN continues to lead the industry in its efforts to offer consumers more content in more places as evidenced by our recent launch of an authenticated ESPN Realtime Viewing app for Time Warner Cable, Bright House and Verizon subscribers.  And finally lastly, we announced the signing of a landmark 12-year deal with the Pack 12, the televised football, basketball and more, across multiple platforms beginning in 2012. This agreement, which adds significantly to ESPN's leadership position in college sports, is also a huge win for sports fans everywhere.
While the spotlight shine brightly on Shanghai this quarter, work has continued on some other important resorts initiatives. Crews are putting the finishing touches on Aulani, our Resort & Spa in Hawaii, which will ultimates its first guests this August. Construction also continues on the expansion of Fantasyland at Magic Kingdom in Florida, which will more than double the size of 1 of Walt Disney World's most popular lands.
And on the other side of the globe, shipbuilders is Patherburg, Germany continue to make progress on the Disney Fantasy, the sister ship to the Disney Dream, which will begin sailing in the spring of 2012. Disney Cruise Line also announced new 2012 itineraries that will enable us to bring the Disney Cruise experience to more guests and more places and demand for our cruise product remains very high.
I'm also pleased to report the Tokyo Disney Resort is now open following closure due to the March 11 earthquake and tsunami in Japan.
And following its best year ever with record attendance, Hong Kong Disneyland continues to post-strong attendance numbers this year as well. The multiyear expansion effort that will add 3 new theme lands is running ahead of schedule, and we look forward to welcoming guests to the first of these Toy Story Land later this fall.
So as you can see, there's a great creative momentum throughout the company. We are confident that our strategic focus on producing the best content possible will bode well for the rest of 2011.  With our upcoming slate of films this summer, Disney Channel's continued strength and ratings growth, ESPN is ever-expanding sports offerings, new experiences at our parks and resorts and our aggressive exploration of growth opportunities and countries like China, India and Brazil, we are well-positioned to capitalize on the encouraging business trends we're seeing to deliver favorable returns in the years ahead.

And it worked in the second quarter where we had slightly improved in fact the Easter attendance and occupancy rates. And then a pricing, which is really important. The goal remains the same for the third quarter. As Jay mentioned, running very slightly behind the last year, this time bookings-wise about 2.5% of our pricing is up in the mid-single-digits and we feel that's basically in line with where we would like to be starting pricing is up in the double digits right now for the hotels that are reserved on the books. And so with that in mind, we think that the consumer is willing to pay higher prices for good product. That's a good thing. They're still booking late though and I think that's interesting because I think there's an expectation in the market place that there's going to be some discounting and that's probably why we're seeing the trends that we're seeing our. We've said this a few times, we don't really see much of a specific or direct impact from higher gasoline prices, at least that's never been the case. Of course we don't know what happens when pricing gets as high as it could get. But so far, we don't believe that's a factor. And we're going to continue to watch our pricing carefully with an eye toward not diving for volume at the expense of pricing, continue to keep our pricing higher so that we can send the signal that we need to send to the consumer that the economy is stronger than it was a few years ago, and that discounting that we obviously had to implement during the downturn is something of the past."

I think we talked to the Investor Conference about probability at 2013. And it's a work in progress. What we've decided to do at Playdom had somewhat of an impact at least on our revenue this year. And that is that when we look at the marketplace, specifically in social games, we determine that there was a great need to improve the quality of the games. So the games that worked initially which was relatively simple were not only going to continue to work at that level and given not just what we believe the consumer wanted but what the competition was doing, we thought it would be wise to improve the quality of the games that we're going to release. So we took a 5-month hiatus which has not been planned for releasing games to build a higher quality game, and then also to restack our technical capabilities to deal with volume, to deal with scale which we are hoping to achieve. And the results so far have been very good. We released, Playdom released its first real hit gave called Guardians Of Time, which is a top 10, top 7 game right now at Facebook. It's doing extremely well some of the typical measurements which are MA used and DA used and you use a was really interesting is that it's monetizing very well, which is another 1 of our goals. While we believe that volume consumption measured at least by the standards of the creative MA used and DA used support is more important to create games that are more monetizable and that's our goal. To the bigger number of games in the pipeline said that we will in no '11 more in '12, some you in the form of derivative, some that are made from other products like ESPN-branded, Marvel-branded, Disney-branded. And we feel good about the direction of Playdom, particularly with this new hit game in the marketplace. On the disney.com side, we are hopeful to launch a completely redesign of that site in the coming months. We're not making any predictions in terms of breaking even or increasing the revenue at this point. But mostly trying to get right in terms of navigation, user interface, universal registration and then obviously opportunities creating greater entertainment to better monetize mostly with advertising."

The timing of some of the programs that we had and when we announced them last year versus this year has more to do with what I would consider a very mild and not easy to read as to where the quarter will wind up, change in the bookings versus last year. But as Bob mentioned and I did as well, the room rates, I think, there's a definitive signal there that our decrease in discounting and the room rate price increases that we took are definitely sticking.

What ESPN is trying to do is obviously create a must-have product for consumers, and thus a must-have product for distributors who need to keep their consumers happy. And I think they've done a brilliant job of buying sports rights and turning the rights into both profitability and significant brand building, which I think has led to the position that I just described as well, as a bit of a competitive advantage. Between now and when the Olympics rights that are being bid out occur, ESPN has a number of rather large negotiations with distributors to engage in. And so, there are definitely opportunities for ESPN to address its subscription revenue, based on the general program offering that it has, which is both a collection of events, including the Pack 12 or Sports Authority Book and possibly sports that it may buy. So I think it would be wrong to assume that the purchase of an Olympics should only be looked at as a possible generator of incremental advertising revenue. It would definitely generate incremental subscription revenue. I also want to say that while ESPN certainly intends to take a look at the Olympic seriously, ESPN is also demonstrating a great ability to walk away from opportunities that they didn't believe made sense from a bottom line perspective. And it also demonstrated an ability to divest certain rights that they feel weren't driving the value that other rights could have. So it's going to be, continue to be a balance. They're mindful of their profitably, they're mindful of their margins, they're certainly mindful of maintaining a great competitive advantage, and essentially, the must-have status that they've managed to achieve, which is something obviously that's incredibly important for the company overall."

And we knew that it was going to take time to get at some of that value because there were a number of deals in place, both on the distribution front and on the licensing front, that had to essentially wind down or be changed before we fully took advantage of what is clearly a treasure trove of value, both on the character side but also on the executive front. We're pleased with what we see as the potential for Marvel, particularly as we look ahead. We ended up negotiating with Paramount, an earlier exit from the distribution deal on the Studio front, which gives us the ability to distribute The Avengers next year. And I'd say that is our first, really big initiative since the acquisition because not only will we distribute and market it, but we know that Marvel is working really hard with the cooperation of a number of entities at Disney to turn Avengers into a true franchise. The release of Thor was a critical part of that because Thor is a component of The Avengers. And we feel good about the release of that film this year as we feel optimistic about Captain America coming up and when you add to that Iron Man and Hulk, we are going to have a big franchise in our hands. And that's kind of the focus at this point. We're also working on creating a Marvel television block for the Disney XD platform, and there's a show on the air, there's 1 in development, there's also development activity at ABC Family and that ABC and of course as a Consumer Products, we're well-integrated in international markets and starting to approach licensing in a much more coordinated fashion, less so in the United States. But Marvel's done a great job its licensing endeavors in the U.S. and have done an approach in that regard. But we feel great about Marvel, and we feel really good about the quality of the film that they made that was released this past weekend, Thor."

We can only say that if there is a work stoppage of even significant length, the impact our bottom line should be negligible. That in part comes from the belief that ESPN that if there is a loss of NFL games, there will be a mad dash for male demos and other sports notably college football where ESPN has almost 300 games across its multiple platforms, including ABC and the ability to add inventory to those games by changing formats and drive substantially increased CPM rates, which you might even see in the ESPN upfront that reflects a concern by advertisers of possible work stoppage and their inability through the NFL to get access to male demos."

And since no decisions have been made yet by ABC about their schedule, it wouldn't be appropriate for me to say anything more than my enthusiasm that just expressed and optimism."

And we exceeded the conversion rate for the other studios in Q2. We just reported nicely by about 25% actually. And that was primarily because of Tangled, which did very well from a conversion rate perspective. But we continue to believe that this is a business that is undergoing secular change, we've been saying that probably for 2 or 3 years. We continue to believe that's the case. We believe though that our titles tend to be titles that people would prefer to own than to rent. And that's because their kids watch them so many times. That doesn't mean that every one of our titles works. We at times make films that don't convert as well because they're not considered a film that a family must own or they don't convert as well because they're not very good films. And we certainly had our share of those. When we have a decent Disney title, know that it is aimed at essentially the entire family audience. Our conversion rates are really stellar and that was the case with Tangled. As for the Blu-ray, Tuna, we continue to see encouraging results where Blu-ray continues to creep up in terms of percent of total sales, as does the multi-format concept that we're in the marketplace with, with the downloadable file, and ultimately, what I call the streamable file. We're encouraged by the buy rates on those as well."

We reported Q2 earnings per share of $0.49, up $0.01 from last year. The underlying quality of our earnings was good, but our results were particularly impacted by 4 items which we estimate collectively reduced operating income by approximately $170 million versus last year. These items are: first, the impact of the very disappointing performance of Mars Needs Moms and the year-over-year timing difference of key Pixar DVD releases, which together produced results at Studio Entertainment by roughly $90 million; second, an estimated $23 million impact on Parks and Resorts from the Easter calendar shift; third, the impact of the devastating Japan earthquake, which we estimate reduced operating income at our Parks and Consumer Products businesses by $25 million; and finally, a $34 million impact on Interactive Media results from purchase accounting from the Playdom acquisition. These 4 items collectively reduced EPS by about $0.06.
Now I'll turn to the main drivers of our Q2 performance in our business segments. Media Networks operating income was up 17%, driven by growth in affiliate and advertising revenue at ESPN and Disney Channels, as well as at our broadcast network and our TV stations. At ESPN, ad revenue came in 43% above prior year. During the quarter, ESPN added 3 BCS college football games, including the National Championship Game. When adjusting for these, we estimate that ESPN's ad revenue was up by 23%. In Q2, ESPN recorded lower equity income as a result of higher programming costs at our ESPN Star Sports joint venture due to its airing of the Cricket World Cup. 
At Broadcasting, strong results were driven by increased revenue from advertising and from retransmission fees, as well as higher sales of ABC produced shows. Results were also helped by decreased news production costs.
ABC Network advertising revenue was up in the second quarter, helped by strong pricing in the marketplace, particularly offset by low -- partially offset by lower ratings. Q2 scatter CPMs came in 41% above upfront levels. Ad revenue at our TV stations was up 6% in the second quarter.
At Studio Entertainment, operating income was impacted by the timing comparison of key DVD releases and by lower performance of our theatrical slate. As expected, home video results were affected by the difference in the international release timing between UP, which was released in Q2 last year, and Toy Story 3, which was released in most markets in Q1 this year. We estimate this timing difference impacted Q2 operating income by $15 million.
As I mentioned earlier, the Studio results were also impacted by the very disappointing performance of Mars Needs Moms, which reduced Studio operating income by more than $70 million in Q2 driven by both P&A spending on the film and an incremental impairment charge.
At the Parks and Resorts segment, operating results reflected higher costs at Disney Cruise Line and the loss of royalties resulting from the Japan earthquake. In addition, Q2 results across our parks last year included 1 week of the Easter holiday, whereas the holiday period this year falls entirely in Q3. Underlying trends at our Parks and Resorts were solid. Domestic attendance in Q2 came in flat to prior year levels. We estimate that without the impact of the Easter timing shift, attendance at our domestic parks would have been up 2% versus prior year. Per capita guest spending rose by 6%, driven by higher pricing and lower discounting. Occupancy across our Domestic Hotels came in 1 percentage point above prior year levels at 81%. Per room spending was up 4%.
At our International Parks, higher results in Paris and Hong Kong were offset by the loss of royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort, which was closed for about 3 weeks during Q2 due to the earthquake in Japan. 
Our Consumer Products improved comparable store sales at Disney Stores North America and higher licensing results drove profit growth in the quarter. Merchandise sales from franchised properties Cars and Tangled were strong in Q2. On a comparable basis, Disney branded earned licensing revenue was up 5% year-over-year.
At Interactive Media segment, purchase accounting from the acquisition of Playdom as expected, continues to impact results. In the quarter, we recorded $34 million in purchase accounting charges. Segment results also reflected product development spending in social and mobile games and virtual worlds.
Overall, we delivered double-digit growth in operating income and earnings per share to the first half of the year. Now I'd like to highlight the business trends we're seeing so far this quarter, and provide some of the key swing factors that will impact our results for the remainder of the year. At Media, ABC Network's scatter pricing is running more than 35% above upfront levels. Ad sales at ESPN and at our TV stations are pacing up single digits versus prior year. Both businesses faced top comps in Q3 since they each delivered double-digit ad revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 2010. Also bear in mind that last year's Q3 results at ESPN reflected the benefit of the World Cup and a seven-game Lakers-Celtics NBA final, while TV station advertising benefited from strong political ad spending. 
You may recall that last year, ESPN reached most of its key programming commitments in the third quarter. At this time, we do not expect to reach some of these commitments until Q4 this year. We currently expect net affiliate revenue recognition related to program covenant timing to be $228 million lower in Q3 than in prior year. However, we expect Q4 net affiliate revenue recognition to be $245 million, higher than in prior year. Of course, a relatively small number of programming hours could shift some revenue recognition from Q4 to Q3. 
At Parks and Resorts, room reservations at our domestic resorts for Q3 are currently running 2.5% below prior-year levels, while booked room rates are running double digits ahead of prior year. The increase in pricing that we're seeing in our business is consistent with the strategy we articulated to reduce discounting. I will also remind you that the last year's Q3 Parks and Resorts results included the benefit of a real estate transaction at Disneyland Paris, which added about $30 million to operating income on a sales price of approximately $60 million. We expect the aftermath of the Japan earthquake to continue to impact our business for the remainder of the year. While it's difficult to predict consumer behavior and the pace of infrastructure improvements, we estimate several cents of earnings risk for the remainder of the year.
At our Studio segment, we are excited about our 4 big summer releases, starting with Thor, which opened domestically last Friday, Pirates of the Caribbean 4, coming to theaters May 20, Cars 2 on June 24, and Captain America: The First Avenger to be released on July 22. The performance of these films will be key swing factors for the remainder of the year.
At Interactive Media segment, key game titles in the second half of the year include Cars 2 and LEGO Pirates. Playdom purchase accounting will continue to impact segment results for the remainder of the year.
Last weak, we announced to employees that we are implementing changes to our salary pension plans. We expect these changes will reduce our pension expense by 25% to 30% versus what we would've incurred under our historic program. While the estimated cost savings are dependent on a variety of assumptions, including the discount rate, we currently estimate total savings between $350 million and $400 million over the next 5 years starting in fiscal 2012. 
Finally, we have continued to repurchase shares. For the fiscal year so far, we've repurchased almost 52 million shares for approximately $2 billion.
With that, let me turn the call over to Bob."

I'd like to reiterate that we're pleased with the underlying quality of our earnings this quarter, and our confidence in the trends we are seeing across our segments. The attendance and spending trends at our Parks and Resorts remain encouraging, as do the advertising trends at our Broadcast and Cable Networks. With a wealth of great creative properties coming in the next 6 months, 2011 is shaping up to deliver strong results.
As you know, last month we broke ground on the Shanghai Disney Resort, our 6th resort, and the first in mainland China. This marked a defining moment in the history of the Walt Disney Company. Shanghai Disney Resort is our largest foreign investment, and will be a critical component of our growth in China. Our Imagineers are deep into the design phase and it opens in approximately 5 years and will combine great Disney storytelling and beloved characters, with authentic cultural touches, tailored specifically for the people of China. In essence, it will be authentically Disney and distinctly Chinese.
At the Studio, we're extremely excited for the May 20 release of Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, the fourth film and are extremely successful, multibillion-dollar franchise. Johnny Depp reprises his iconic role, this time with Penelope Cruz by his side. And just this past weekend, we celebrated the world premiere at Disneyland, home of the original attraction, and the film stars are now in Moscow for our first ever Russian premier of the Pirates film. It will also release day in day in China and most foreign markets.
On June 24, Disney/Pixar's Cars 2 premieres. The Movie directed by John Lasseter will continue to drive a significant consumer products presence at the Disney Stores and major retailers, which should sustain through the holiday season. Work is also continuing on Cars Land at Disney California Adventure, which will bring guests into the remarkable world of Radiator Springs when it opens in summer of 2012.
This past week, Thor opened in theaters in the U.S. and in multiple overseas markets, and its current global box office is just over $250 million, which is a strong and important opening. This film, along with this summer's Captain America: The First Avenger, plus Iron Man and the Hulk, is a key component of Marvel's Avengers franchise. Marvel's First Avenger film launches next summer and will be the first Marvel film to be marketed and distributed by Disney.
At ABC, we're currently in the middle of screening pilots and we're excited about the quality and the variety of the shows we're seeing. This crop of pilots represents the work of a new management team and we're hopeful these new shows will firmly anchor our primetime schedule in the years ahead. All signs are that next week's upfront will be a strong one.
Last month, Disney Channel scored yet another hit with Lemonade Mouth, the top original cable movie of 2011, which helped Disney Channel post-best ever in April. Disney Channel's newly branded programming block for preschoolers, Disney Junior, continues to flourish with shows like Jake and the Neverland Pirates, which is TV's top series with preschoolers and is pacing as Disney Channel's top preschool series of all time.  Disney Channel XD continues to perform very strongly and is delivering record ratings levels in 2011, with double-digit year-over-year growth in key demographics.
ESPN continues to grow in both ratings and reach. In fact, this was ESPN's highest rated Q2 on record. With rating increasing by 10%, driven by strong results for the BCS ball games and ESPN's highest-rated NBA regular season ever. With its expert coverage of the NFL, the NBA, Major League Baseball, NASCAR, golf, tennis, and even Cricket, ESPN has created integrated digital platforms that keep fans informed and entertained. 
Additionally, ESPN continues to lead the industry in its efforts to offer consumers more content in more places as evidenced by our recent launch of an authenticated ESPN realtime viewing app for Time Warner Cable, Brighthouse and Verizon subscribers.  And finally last week, we announced the signing of a landmark 12-year deal with the Pac-12, the televised football, basketball and more, across multiple platforms beginning in 2012. This agreement, which adds significantly to ESPN's leadership position in college sports, is also a huge win for sports fans everywhere.
While the spotlight shine brightly on Shanghai this quarter, work has continued on some other important parks and resorts initiatives. Crews are putting the finishing touches on Aulani, our Resort & Spa in Hawaii, which will welcome its first guests this August. Construction also continues on the expansion of Fantasyland at Magic Kingdom in Florida, which will more than double the size of 1 of Walt Disney World's most popular lands.
And on the other side of the globe, shipbuilders in Papenburg, Germany continue to make progress on the Disney Fantasy, the sister ship to the Disney Dream, which will begin sailing in the spring of 2012. Disney Cruise Line also announced new 2012 itineraries that will enable us to bring the Disney Cruise experience to more guests and more places and demand for our cruise product remains very high.
I'm also pleased to report the Tokyo Disney Resort is now open following closure due to the March 11 earthquake and tsunami in Japan. And following its best year ever with record attendance, Hong Kong Disneyland continues to post-strong attendance numbers this year as well. The multiyear expansion effort that will add 3 new theme lands is running ahead of schedule, and we look forward to welcoming guests to the first of these Toy Story Land later this fall.
So as you can see, there's a great creative momentum throughout the company. And we're confident that our strategic focus on producing the best content possible will bode well for the rest of 2011. With our upcoming slate of films this summer, Disney Channel's continued creative strength and ratings growth, ESPN's ever-expanding sports offerings, new experiences at our parks and resorts and our aggressive exploration of growth opportunities in countries like China, India and Brazil, we're well-positioned to capitalize on the encouraging business trends we're seeing to deliver favorable returns in the years ahead.

And it worked in the second quarter where we had slightly improved and in fact throughout Easter attendance and occupancy rates. And better pricing, which is really important. The goal remains the same for the third quarter. Where as Jay mentioned, we're running very slightly behind last year. This time bookings-wise, about 2.5%, but our pricing is up in the mid-single-digits. And we feel that's basically in line with where we would like to be -- sorry the pricing is up in the double digits right now, for the hotels that are reserved on the books. And so with that in mind, we think that the consumer is willing to pay higher prices for good product, that's a good thing. They're still booking late though and I think that's interesting because I think there's still an expectation in the market place that there's going to be some discounting, and that's probably why we're seeing the trends that we're seeing. We've said this a few times, we don't really see much of a specific or direct impact from higher gasoline prices, at least that's never been the case. Of course we don't know what happens when pricing gets as high as it could get. But so far, we don't believe that's a factor. And we're going to continue to watch our pricing carefully with an eye toward not diving for volume at the expense of pricing, continue to keep our pricing higher so that we can send the signal that we need to send to the consumer that the economy is stronger than it was a few years ago, and that discounting that we obviously had to implement during the downturn is something of the past."

And that is that when we looked at the marketplace, specifically in social games, we determine that there was a great need to improve the quality of the games. So the games that worked initially which were relatively simple, were not only going to continue to work at that level. And given not just what we believe the consumer wanted, but what the competition was doing, we thought it would be wise to improve the quality of the games that we're going to release. So we took a 5-month hiatus which has not been planned from releasing games, to build a higher quality game, and then also, to restack our technical capabilities to deal with volume, or to deal with scale, which we are hoping to achieve. And the results so far have been very good. We released -- Playdom released its first real hit game called Gardens of Time, which is a top 10 and may even be a top 7 game right now on Facebook. It's doing extremely well in some of the typical measurements which are MAUs and DAUs. But what's really interesting is that it's monetizing very well, which is another 1 of our goals. While we believe that volume consumption measured at least by the standards that have been created in MAUs and DAUs is important, it's more important to create games that are more monetizable and that's our goal. So we got a number of games in the pipeline, some of it will be released in '11, more in '12. Some that are new made from whole cloth, not derivative, some that are made from other products like ESPN-branded, Marvel-branded, Disney-branded. And we feel good about the direction of Playdom, particularly with this new hit game in the marketplace. On the disney.com side, we are hopeful to launch a completely redesign of that site in the coming months. We're not making any predictions in terms of breaking even or increasing the revenue at this point. We're mostly trying to get it right in terms of navigation, user interface, universal registration and then obviously, opportunities whereby creating greater entertainment to better monetize mostly with advertising."

So you don't see a big difference in the Easter swing that we talk about week to week in terms of occupancy. I would say that we're partially into the quarter. The timing of some of the programs that we had and when we announced them last year versus this year, has more to do with what I would consider a very mild and not easy to read as to where the quarter will wind up, change in the bookings versus last year. But as Bob mentioned and I did as well, the room rates, I think, there's a definitive signal there that our decrease in discounting and the room rate price increases that we took are definitely sticking. And what we've got on the books is significantly up to the tune of double digits from where we were in the prior year."

What ESPN has tried to do is obviously create a -- kind of a must-have product for consumers, and thus, a must-have product for distributors who need to keep their consumers happy. And I think they've done a brilliant job of buying sports rights and turning the rights into both profitability and significant brand building, which I think has led to the position that I just described as well, it's a bit of a competitive advantage. Between now and when the Olympics rights that are being bid out occur, ESPN has a number of rather large negotiations with distributors to engage in. And so, there are definitely opportunities for ESPN to address its subscription revenue, based on the general program offering that it has, which is both a collection of events, including the Pac-12 or sports that's already booked and possibly, sports that it may buy. So I think it would be wrong to assume that the purchase of an Olympics should only be looked at as a possible generator of incremental advertising revenue. It would definitely generate incremental subscription revenue. I also want to say that while ESPN certainly intends to take a look at the Olympics seriously, ESPN is also demonstrating a great ability to walk away from opportunities that they didn't believe made sense from a bottom line perspective. And they've also demonstrated an ability to divest certain rights that they feel weren't driving the value that other rights could have. So it's going to be -- continue to be a balance. They're mindful of their profitably, they're mindful of their margins, they're certainly mindful of maintaining a great competitive advantage, and essentially, the must-have status that they've managed to achieve, which is something obviously that's incredibly important for the company overall."

And we knew that it was going to take time to get at some of that value because there were a number of deals in place, both on the distribution front and on the licensing front, that had to essentially wind down or be changed before we fully took advantage of what is clearly a treasure trove of value, both on the character side but also on the executive front. We're pleased with what we see as the potential for Marvel, particularly as we look ahead. We ended up negotiating with Paramount, an earlier exit from the distribution deal on the Studio front, which gives us the ability to distribute The Avengers next year. And I'd say that is our first, really big initiative since the acquisition. Because not only will we distribute and market it, but we know that Marvel is working really hard with the cooperation of a number of entities at Disney to turn Avengers into a true franchise. The release of Thor was a critical part of that because Thor is a component of The Avengers. And we feel good about the release of that film this year as we feel optimistic about Captain America coming up and when you add to that Iron Man and Hulk, we think we're going to have a big franchise at our hands. And that's kind of the focus at this point. We're also working on creating a Marvel television block for the Disney XD platform, and there's a show on the air, there's 1 in development, there's also development activity at ABC Family and an ABC, and of course, there's a Consumer Products side. We're well-integrated in international markets and starting to approach licensing in a much more coordinated fashion, less so in the United States. But Marvel's done a great job its licensing endeavors in the U.S. and it's sort of, ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" approach in that regard. But we feel great about Marvel, and we feel really good about the quality of the film that they made that was released this past weekend, Thor."

We can only say that if there is a work stoppage, even significant length, the impact on our bottom line should be negligible. That in part comes from the belief that ESPN that if there is a loss of NFL games, there will be a mad dash for male demos and other sports notably college football, where ESPN has almost 300 games across its multiple platforms, including ABC and the ability to add inventory to those games by changing formats and drive substantially increased CPM rates, which you might even see in the ESPN upfront that reflects a concern by advertisers of possible work stoppage and their inability through the NFL to get access to male demos."

There are other strategic value. There's other strategic value to ABC. In terms of our ownership of our IP and our success, we clearly had a phenomenal run, with Lost and Desperate Housewives and Grey's Anatomy to name a few. We've had some successes since then. And certainly, Castle is 1 of those and there are some others as well. But clearly, our successes these last few years are not as great as the successes that we saw some -- when it was 5 or 6 years ago. I'm in the middle of so-called pilot season with the ABC folks, screened all their product, and I've seen a fairly wide range of quality shows, both owned and licensed. I'm encouraged by what I've seen in both fronts. I'm hopeful that ABC Studios is going to contribute, not only to ABC's success in terms of its primetime network schedule, but to its future bottom line because the ownership of IP. There's some really strong shows from the studio right now. And since no decisions have been made yet by ABC about their schedule, it wouldn't be appropriate for me to say anything more than my enthusiasm that I just expressed and optimism."

But we continue to believe that this is a business that is undergoing secular change, we've been saying that probably for 2 or 3 years. We continue to believe that's the case. We believe though that our titles tend to be titles that people would prefer to own than to rent. And that's because their kids watch them so many times. That doesn't mean that every one of our titles works. We at times make films that don't convert as well because they're not considered a film that a family must own, or they don't convert as well because they're not very good films. And we've certainly had our share of those. When we have a decent Disney title, know that it is aimed at essentially the entire family audience. Our conversion rates are really stellar and that was the case with Tangled. As to Blu-ray, Tuna, I think we continue to see encouraging results where Blu-ray continues to creep up in terms of percent of total sales, as does -- kind of the multi-format concept that we're in the marketplace with, with the downloadable file, and ultimately, what I'll call the stream-able file.

We reported Q2 earnings per share of $0.49, up $0.01 from last year. The underlying quality of our earnings was good, but our results were particularly impacted by 4 items which we estimate collectively reduce",1299,"Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. We reported Q2 earnings per share of $0.49, up $0.01 from last year. The underlying quality of our earnings was good, but our results were particularly impacted by 4 items which we estimate collectively reduced operating income by approximately $170 million versus last year. These items are: first, the impact of the very disappointing performance of Mars Needs Moms and the year-over-year timing difference of key Pixar DVD releases, which together reduced results at Studio Entertainment by roughly $90 million; second, an estimated $23 million impact on Parks and Resorts from the Easter calendar shift; third, the impact of the devastating Japan earthquake, which we estimate reduced operating income at our Parks and Consumer Products businesses by $25 million; and finally, a $34 million impact on Interactive Media results from purchase accounting from the Playdom acquisition. These 4 items collectively reduced EPS by about $0.06.
Now I'll turn to the main drivers of our Q2 performance in our business segments. Media Networks operating income was up 17%, driven by growth in affiliate and advertising revenue at ESPN and Disney Channels, as well as at our broadcast network and our TV stations. At ESPN, ad revenue came in 43% above prior year. During the quarter, ESPN added 3 BCS college football games, including the National Championship Game. When adjusting for these, we estimate that ESPN's ad revenue was up by 23%. In Q2, ESPN recorded lower equity income as a result of higher programming costs at our ESPN Star Sports joint venture due to its airing of the Cricket World Cup. 
At Broadcasting, strong results were driven by increased revenue from advertising and from retransmission fees, as well as higher sales of ABC produced shows. Results were also helped by decreased news production costs.
ABC Network advertising revenue was up in the second quarter, helped by strong pricing in the marketplace, particularly offset by low -- partially offset by lower ratings. Q2 scatter CPMs came in 41% above upfront levels. Ad revenue at our TV stations was up 6% in the second quarter.
At Studio Entertainment, operating income was impacted by the timing comparison of key DVD releases and by lower performance of our theatrical slate. As expected, home video results were affected by the difference in the international release timing between UP, which was released in Q2 last year, and Toy Story 3, which was released in most markets in Q1 this year. We estimate this timing difference impacted Q2 operating income by $15 million.
As I mentioned earlier, the Studio results were also impacted by the very disappointing performance of Mars Needs Moms, which reduced Studio operating income by more than $70 million in Q2 driven by both P&A spending on the film and an incremental impairment charge.
At the Parks and Resorts segment, operating results reflected higher costs at Disney Cruise Line and the loss of royalties resulting from the Japan earthquake. In addition, Q2 results across our parks last year included 1 week of the Easter holiday, whereas the holiday period this year falls entirely in Q3. Underlying trends at our Parks and Resorts were solid. Domestic attendance in Q2 came in flat to prior year levels. We estimate that without the impact of the Easter timing shift, attendance at our domestic parks would have been up 2% versus prior year. Per capita guest spending rose by 6%, driven by higher pricing and lower discounting. Occupancy across our Domestic Hotels came in 1 percentage point above prior year levels at 81%. Per room spending was up 4%.
At our International Parks, higher results in Paris and Hong Kong were offset by the loss of royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort, which was closed for about 3 weeks during Q2 due to the earthquake in Japan. 
Our Consumer Products improved comparable store sales at Disney Stores North America and higher licensing results drove profit growth in the quarter. Merchandise sales from franchised properties Cars and Tangled were strong in Q2. On a comparable basis, Disney branded earned licensing revenue was up 5% year-over-year.
At Interactive Media segment, purchase accounting from the acquisition of Playdom as expected, continues to impact results. In the quarter, we recorded $34 million in purchase accounting charges. Segment results also reflected product development spending in social and mobile games and virtual worlds.
Overall, we delivered double-digit growth in operating income and earnings per share to the first half of the year. Now I'd like to highlight the business trends we're seeing so far this quarter, and provide some of the key swing factors that will impact our results for the remainder of the year. At Media, ABC Network's scatter pricing is running more than 35% above upfront levels. Ad sales at ESPN and at our TV stations are pacing up single digits versus prior year. Both businesses faced tough comps in Q3 since they each delivered double-digit ad revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 2010. Also bear in mind that last year's Q3 results at ESPN reflected the benefit of the World Cup and a seven-game Lakers-Celtics NBA final, while TV station advertising benefited from strong political ad spending. 
You may recall that last year, ESPN reached most of its key programming commitments in the third quarter. At this time, we do not expect to reach some of these commitments until Q4 this year. We currently expect net affiliate revenue recognition related to program covenant timing to be $228 million lower in Q3 than in prior year. However, we expect Q4 net affiliate revenue recognition to be $245 million, higher than in prior year. Of course, a relatively small number of programming hours could shift some revenue recognition from Q4 to Q3. 
At Parks and Resorts, room reservations at our domestic resorts for Q3 are currently running 2.5% below prior-year levels, while booked room rates are running double digits ahead of prior year. The increase in pricing that we're seeing in our business is consistent with the strategy we articulated to reduce discounting. I will also remind you that the last year's Q3 Parks and Resorts results included the benefit of a real estate transaction at Disneyland Paris, which added about $30 million to operating income on a sales price of approximately $60 million. We expect the aftermath of the Japan earthquake to continue to impact our business for the remainder of the year. While it's difficult to predict consumer behavior and the pace of infrastructure improvements, we estimate several cents of earnings risk for the remainder of the year.
At our Studio segment, we are excited about our 4 big summer releases, starting with Thor, which opened domestically last Friday, Pirates of the Caribbean 4, coming to theaters May 20, Cars 2 on June 24, and Captain America: The First Avenger to be released on July 22. The performance of these films will be key swing factors for the remainder of the year.
At Interactive Media segment, key game titles in the second half of the year include Cars 2 and LEGO Pirates. Playdom purchase accounting will continue to impact segment results for the remainder of the year.
Last week, we announced to employees that we are implementing changes to our salary pension plans. We expect these changes will reduce our pension expense by 25% to 30% versus what we would've incurred under our historic program. While the estimated cost savings are dependent on a variety of assumptions, including the discount rate, we currently estimate total savings between $350 million and $400 million over the next 5 years starting in fiscal 2012. 
Finally, we have continued to repurchase shares. For the fiscal year so far, we've repurchased almost 52 million shares for approximately $2 billion.
With that, let me turn the call over to Bob."

I'd like to reiterate that we're pleased with the underlying quality of our earnings this quarter, and are confident in the trends we are seeing across our segments. The attendance and spending trends at our Parks and Resorts remain encouraging, as do the advertising trends at our Broadcast and Cable Networks. With a wealth of great creative properties coming in the next 6 months, 2011 is shaping up to deliver strong results.
As you know, last month we broke ground on the Shanghai Disney Resort, our 6th resort, and the first in mainland China. This marked a defining moment in the history of the Walt Disney Company. Shanghai Disney Resort is our largest foreign investment, and will be a critical component of our growth in China. Our Imagineers are deep into the design phase and when it opens in approximately 5 years and will combine great Disney storytelling and beloved characters, with authentic cultural touches, tailored specifically for the people of China. In essence, it will be authentically Disney and distinctly Chinese.
At the Studio, we're extremely excited for the May 20 release of Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, the fourth film in our extremely successful, multibillion-dollar franchise. Johnny Depp reprises his iconic role, this time with Penelope Cruz by his side. And just this past weekend, we celebrated the world premiere at Disneyland, home of the original attraction, and the film stars are now in Moscow for our first ever Russian premier of the Pirates film. It will also release day in date in China and most foreign markets.
On June 24, Disney/Pixar's Cars 2 premieres. The Movie directed by John Lasseter will continue to drive a significant consumer products presence at the Disney Stores and major retailers, which should sustain through the holiday season. Work is also continuing on Cars Land at Disney California Adventure, which will bring guests into the remarkable world of Radiator Springs when it opens in summer of 2012.
This past week, Thor opened in theaters in the U.S. and in multiple overseas markets, and its current global box office is just over $250 million, which is a strong and important opening. This film, along with this summer's Captain America: The First Avenger, plus Iron Man and the Hulk, is a key component of Marvel's Avengers franchise. Marvel's First Avenger film launches next summer and will be the first Marvel film to be marketed and distributed by Disney.
At ABC, we're currently in the middle of screening pilots and we're excited about the quality and the variety of the shows we're seeing. This crop of pilots represents the work of a new management team and we're hopeful these new shows will firmly anchor our primetime schedule in the years ahead. All signs are that next week's upfront will be a strong one.
Last month, Disney Channel scored yet another hit with Lemonade Mouth, the top original cable movie of 2011, which helped Disney Channel post best-ever April. Disney Channel's newly branded programming block for preschoolers, Disney Junior, continues to flourish with shows like Jake and the Neverland Pirates, which is TV's top series with preschoolers and is pacing as Disney Channel's top preschool series of all time.  Disney Channel XD continues to perform very strongly and is delivering record ratings levels in 2011, with double-digit year-over-year growth in key demographics.
ESPN continues to grow in both ratings and reach. In fact, this was ESPN's highest rated Q2 on record. With ratings increasing by 10%, driven by strong results for the BCS ball [ph] games and ESPN's highest-rated NBA regular season ever. With its expert coverage of the NFL, the NBA, Major League Baseball, NASCAR, golf, tennis, and even Cricket, ESPN has created integrated digital platforms that keep fans informed and entertained. 
Additionally, ESPN continues to lead the industry in its efforts to offer consumers more content in more places as evidenced by our recent launch of an authenticated ESPN realtime viewing app for Time Warner Cable, Brighthouse and Verizon subscribers.  And finally last week, we announced the signing of a landmark 12-year deal with the Pac-12, the televised football, basketball and more, across multiple platforms beginning in 2012. This agreement, which adds significantly to ESPN's leadership position in college sports, is also a huge win for sports fans everywhere.
While the spotlights shine brightly on Shanghai this quarter, work has continued on some other important parks and resorts initiatives. Crews are putting the finishing touches on Aulani, our Resort & Spa in Hawaii, which will welcome its first guests this August. Construction also continues on the expansion of Fantasyland at Magic Kingdom in Florida, which will more than double the size of 1 of Walt Disney World's most popular lands.
And on the other side of the globe, shipbuilders in Papenburg, Germany continue to make progress on the Disney Fantasy, the sister ship to the Disney Dream, which will begin sailing in the spring of 2012. Disney Cruise Line also announced new 2012 itineraries that will enable us to bring the Disney Cruise experience to more guests and more places and demand for our cruise product remains very high.
I'm also pleased to report the Tokyo Disney Resort is now open following closure due to the March 11 earthquake and tsunami in Japan. And following its best year ever with record attendance, Hong Kong Disneyland continues to post-strong attendance numbers this year as well. The multiyear expansion effort that will add 3 new theme lands is running ahead of schedule, and we look forward to welcoming guests to the first of these Toy Story Land later this fall.
So as you can see, there's a great creative momentum throughout the company. And we're confident that our strategic focus on producing the best content possible will bode well for the rest of 2011. With our upcoming slate of films this summer, Disney Channel's continued creative strength and ratings growth, ESPN's ever-expanding sports offerings, new experiences at our parks and resorts and our aggressive exploration of growth opportunities in countries like China, India and Brazil, we're well-positioned to capitalize on the encouraging business trends we're seeing to deliver favorable returns in the years ahead.

And it worked in the second quarter where we had slightly improved and in fact throughout Easter attendance and occupancy rates. And better pricing, which is really important. The goal remains the same for the third quarter. Whereas Jay mentioned, we're running very slightly behind last year. This time bookings-wise, about 2.5%, but our pricing is up in the mid-single-digits. And we feel that's basically in line with where we would like to be -- sorry the pricing is up in the double digits right now, for the hotels that are reserved on the books. And so with that in mind, we think that the consumer is willing to pay higher prices for good product, that's a good thing. They're still booking late though and I think that's interesting because I think there's still an expectation in the market place that there's going to be some discounting, and that's probably why we're seeing the trends that we're seeing. We've said this a few times, we don't really see much of a specific or direct impact from higher gasoline prices, at least that's never been the case. Of course we don't know what happens when pricing gets as high as it could get. But so far, we don't believe that's a factor. And we're going to continue to watch our pricing carefully with an eye toward not diving for volume at the expense of pricing, continue to keep our pricing higher so that we can send the signal that we need to send to the consumer that the economy is stronger than it was a few years ago, and that discounting that we obviously had to implement during the downturn is something of the past."

I think we talked to the Investor Conference about profitability in 2013. And it's a work in progress. What we've decided to do at Playdom had somewhat of an impact at least on our revenue this year. And that is that when we looked at the marketplace, specifically in social games, we determine that there was a great need to improve the quality of the games. So the games that worked initially which were relatively simple, were not only going to continue to work at that level. And given not just what we believe the consumer wanted, but what the competition was doing, we thought it would be wise to improve the quality of the games that we're going to release. So we took a 5-month hiatus which has not been planned from releasing games, to build a higher quality game, and then also, to restack our technical capabilities to deal with volume, or to deal with scale, which we are hoping to achieve. And the results so far have been very good. We released -- Playdom released its first real hit game called Gardens of Time, which is a top 10 and may even be a top 7 game right now on Facebook. It's doing extremely well in some of the typical measurements which are MAUs and DAUs. But what's really interesting is that it's monetizing very well, which is another 1 of our goals. While we believe that volume consumption measured at least by the standards that have been created in MAUs and DAUs is important, it's more important to create games that are more monetizable and that's our goal. So we got a number of games in the pipeline, some of it will be released in '11, more in '12. Some that are new made from whole cloth, not derivative, some that are made from other products like ESPN-branded, Marvel-branded, Disney-branded. And we feel good about the direction of Playdom, particularly with this new hit game in the marketplace. On the disney.com side, we are hopeful to launch a completely redesign of that site in the coming months. We're not making any predictions in terms of breaking even or increasing the revenue at this point. We're mostly trying to get it right in terms of navigation, user interface, universal registration and then obviously, opportunities whereby creating greater entertainment to better monetize mostly with advertising."

The timing of some of the programs that we had and when we announced them last year versus this year, has more to do with what I would consider a very mild and not easy to read as to where the quarter will wind up, change in the bookings versus last year. But as Bob mentioned and I did as well, the room rates, I think, there's a definitive signal there that our decrease in discounting and the room rate price increases that we took are definitely sticking.

What ESPN has tried to do is obviously create a -- kind of a must-have product for consumers, and thus, a must-have product for distributors who need to keep their consumers happy. And I think they've done a brilliant job of buying sports rights and turning the rights into both profitability and significant brand building, which I think has led to the position that I just described as well a bit of a competitive advantage. Between now and when the Olympics rights that are being bid out occur, ESPN has a number of rather large negotiations with distributors to engage in. And so, there are definitely opportunities for ESPN to address its subscription revenue, based on the general program offering that it has, which is both a collection of events, including the Pac-12 or sports that's already booked and possibly, sports that it may buy. So I think it would be wrong to assume that the purchase of an Olympics should only be looked at as a possible generator of incremental advertising revenue. It would definitely generate incremental subscription revenue. I also want to say that while ESPN certainly intends to take a look at the Olympics seriously, ESPN is also demonstrating a great ability to walk away from opportunities that they didn't believe made sense from a bottom line perspective. And they've also demonstrated an ability to divest certain rights that they feel weren't driving the value that other rights could have. So it's going to be -- continue to be a balance. They're mindful of their profitably, they're mindful of their margins, they're certainly mindful of maintaining a great competitive advantage, and essentially, the must-have status that they've managed to achieve, which is something obviously that's incredibly important for the company overall."

And we knew that it was going to take time to get at some of that value because there were a number of deals in place, both on the distribution front and on the licensing front, that had to essentially wind down or be changed before we fully took advantage of what is clearly a treasure trove of value, both on the character side but also on the executive front. We're pleased with what we see as the potential for Marvel, particularly as we look ahead. We ended up negotiating with Paramount, an earlier exit from the distribution deal on the Studio front, which gives us the ability to distribute The Avengers next year. And I'd say that is our first, really big initiative since the acquisition. Because not only will we distribute and market it, but we know that Marvel is working really hard with the cooperation of a number of entities at Disney to turn Avengers into a true franchise. The release of Thor was a critical part of that because Thor is a component of The Avengers. And we feel good about the release of that film this year as we feel optimistic about Captain America coming up and when you add to that Iron Man and Hulk, we think we're going to have a big franchise on our hands. And that's kind of the focus at this point. We're also working on creating a Marvel television block for the Disney XD platform, and there's a show on the air, there's 1 in development, there's also development activity at ABC Family and at ABC, and of course, there's a Consumer Products side. We're well-integrated in international markets and starting to approach licensing in a much more coordinated fashion, less so in the United States. But Marvel's done a great job on its licensing endeavors in the U.S. and it's sort of, ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" approach in that regard. But we feel great about Marvel, and we feel really good about the quality of the film that they made that was released this past weekend, Thor."

We can only say that if there is a work stoppage, even significant length, the impact on our bottom line should be negligible. That in part comes from the belief that ESPN that if there is a loss of NFL games, there will be a mad dash for mail demos and other sports notably college football, where ESPN has almost 300 games across its multiple platforms, including ABC and the ability to add inventory to those games by changing formats and drive substantially increased CPM rates, which you might even see in the ESPN upfront that reflects a concern by advertisers of possible work stoppage and their inability through the NFL to get access to mail demos."

There are other strategic value. There's other strategic value to ABC. In terms of our ownership of our IP and our success, we clearly had a phenomenal run, with Lost and Desperate Housewives and Grey's Anatomy to name a few. We've had some successes since then. And certainly, Castle is one of those and there are some others as well. But clearly, our successes these last few years are not as great as the successes that we saw some -- when it was 5, 6 years ago. I'm in the middle of so-called pilot season with the ABC folks, screened all their product, and I've seen a fairly wide range of quality shows, both owned and licensed. I'm encouraged by what I've seen in both fronts.

There's some really strong shows from the studio right now. And since no decisions have been made yet by ABC about their schedule, it wouldn't be appropriate for me to say anything more than my enthusiasm that I just expressed and optimism."

And this year time around, in Q1, Toy Story was released in Q1. So that was the major -- the majority of the driver in terms of what you saw affecting our quarter. We also, in prior year, re-released Toy Story 1 and 2 in anticipation of the theatrical release of Toy Story 3 and had that out in the market, which had an impact on the quarter as well. In terms of what we see in the future, I'll turn it over to Bob but we've seen very good results for Tangled. And our conversion, while of course it's impossible for us to avoid the overall secular decline in DVD sales, our conversion still seems to be holding on the right titles for sell through."

And we exceeded the conversion rate for the other studios. In Q2, we just reported nicely by about 25% actually. And that was primarily because of Tangled, which did very well from a conversion rate perspective. But we continue to believe that this is a business that is undergoing secular change, we've been saying that probably for 2 or 3 years. We continue to believe that's the case. We believe though that our titles tend to be titles that people would prefer to own than to rent. And that's because their kids watch them so many times. That doesn't mean that every one of our titles works. We at times make films that don't convert as well because they're not considered a film that a family must own, or they don't convert as well because they're not very good films. And we've certainly had our share of those. When we have a decent Disney title, though, that is aimed at essentially the entire family audience. Our conversion rates are really stellar and that was the case with Tangled. As to Blu-ray, Tuna, I think we continue to see encouraging results where Blu-ray continues to creep up in terms of percent of total sales, as does -- kind of the multi-format concept that we're in the marketplace with, with the downloadable file, and ultimately, what I'll call the stream-able file. And we're encouraged by the buy rates on those as well."

Net income in the quarter was up 11% on a 7% revenue increase. EPS for the quarter adjusted for comparability grow 60% to $0.78. 
Given the economic news of the past week, I'm sure there's interest in what we are seeing, and during the past few days, we haven't seen any change in the pace of activity in our Parks & Resorts, Advertising or Consumer Products businesses. Jay will follow-up with more detail on specific trends in his comments and we of course will continue to closely watch key trends in these areas. 
Over the past few months we had opportunities to meet with a number of investors and analysts. Since we obviously can't meet everyone listening to this call, I want to take a different approach to my comments today and expand a bit on our strategy and discuss some of the opportunities we are most excited about. 
Let me start with ESPN. The growth in our Media Networks segment in Q3 was primarily driven by ESPN. ESPN remains incredibly well-positioned today, given its ability to deliver comprehensive, high-quality coverage of major sports events, the value it provides the fans, advertisers and multichannel operators and it's disciplined approach to programming acquisition. ESPN's long-term commitment to serving sports fans continues to pay off with growth in reach and engagement. Our research shows that each week, almost 107 million people watch listen read or log on to ESPN Branded Media. And the average person now spends 6 hours and 35 minutes with ESPN Branded Media each week. 
The value of sports also continues to be reflected in the advertising marketplace. In this year's upfront, ESPN enjoyed all-time highs in both pricing and total dollars committed, with tremendous strength in our upfront NFL and college football sales. ESPN also continues to provide great value to multi-channel video operators. In Vader Research's 2010 Cable Operator Study, ESPN retained its position as the network with the most perceived value for the 11th consecutive year. And ESPN too placed second in the sixth straight year. So we're very pleased with ESPN's competitive position and the value we provide the fans and all of our partners. So it's certainly clear to us, and I hope clear to you, that with ESPN, the number 1 sports brand, along with Disney, we own 2 of the most powerful brands in media.
Let me also spend a moment on the sports rights acquisition marketplace. John Skipper, ESPN's Head of Content, often says, the next time we're the only bidder for a sports package will be the first time. And we never take competition likely and the fact that competition for television and sports rights has always existed. But our focus has remained unchanged. We have been and we'll continue to be diligent in our bidding and willing to pay fair prices for rights that will benefit and create long-term value for ESPN and the company.
We recently reached 2 new agreements that illustrate this approach. In May, we signed a 12-year deal for multi-platform rights for a wide array of pack 12 conference sports, including football and basketball. This deal strengthened our position as the leader in college sports television. And last month, ESPN reached a 12-year deal to be the exclusive U.S. broadcaster of Wimbledon. Given our investment in technology, ESPN was able to offer Wimbledon the distribution platforms on which to air more than 900 live hours of tennis during the 2-week tournament.  Matches will air on ESPN, ESPN 2 and ESPN 3, and the still this deal will enhance and expand our coverage of Wimbledon and add another blue-chip event to ESPN's great stable of popular and important sports programming. And our recent sports rights negotiations we have obtained long-term deals and in addition to the 2 deals I just mentioned, the past few years we reached a 15 year deal with the SEC and a 12-year deal with the ACC. Long-term deals provide us with greater cost visibility and allow us to build a stronger longer term relationship with fans.
Also in our negotiations, we seek access to broad multiplatform rights, extending from television to online to our authenticated service. This multi-screen, multi-platform approach should also enable more growth, particularly as new platforms and new patterns of consumption emerge. During the past few months, we also pursued deals for the NHL and the Olympics, 2 attractive sports properties. In both cases, we made bids that made economic sense for ESPN, and we exhibited financial diligence and discipline and avoided burdening ESPN with new commitments that would've lowered ESPN's margins.
Now turning to Broadcasting, we delivered earnings growth at our Broadcasting business this quarter, driven in part by affiliate revenue growth at ABC and our own TV stations. We were in the process of negotiating cash retransmission payments for our on-television stations and license fees from our affiliated stations. Our own stations have already reached agreements with several large multi-channel distributors with more to come. And we believe our own TV stations are getting paid per sub cash retransmission rates that are comparable to what other stations groups are earning. We have already completed license agreements with non-owned affiliates, covering more than 60% of our affiliate footprint.  Let me give you some perspective on what this means financially. We now expect annual revenue streams to total between $400 million and $500 million by fiscal 2015. 
At the Studio, we enjoyed strong creative success during the quarter. Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides became the eighth film to earn more than $1 billion in global box office. Over the past few months, Marvel's Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger both opened to strong box office results. Thor has earned almost $450 million in global box office and Captain America is on track to deliver similar results. Both films, along with Iron Man and The Hulk, are key components of Marvel's Avengers franchise. And Marvel's approach, starting with great characters and stories, attracting great filmmakers and producing high-quality films, bodes well for our next film, The Avengers, which are aiming to turn into another great franchise for the company.
Cars 2 opened on June 25, and it's on its way to earning well above $500 million in global box, and Cars remains one of the most important franchises at the company. I'm excited about our upcoming films, and tomorrow The Help from DreamWorks will open and are very encouraged by the early response to this film. This Thanksgiving, The Muppets return to the big screen in a family we believe that will reinvigorate a once great franchise. In December, we will distribute Warhorse, a Stephen Spielberg directed epic from DreamWorks, that is bound to get a lot of attention. And in March, we will release the live action film, John Carter from Andrew Stanton, whose previous films include finding Nemo and WALL-E. In May, we will release The Avengers and finally, in June, Pixar's next original film, Brave, will hit theaters.
Our Disney Channel business remains very strong as well. During the quarter is the channel's ratings were up 10% while Disney XD's ratings were up 24%. And this past Friday, Disney Channel's original Movie, Phineas and Ferb Across the Second Dimension, which is the most recent installment in this franchise debuted to phenomenal success becoming cable TVs number 1 movie of the year in total viewers and the number 1 scripted telecast on all TV this year with kids. Disney Channel now distributes 100 channels around the world. 
And now let me discuss our Parks & Resorts business, specifically our capital investment strategy. We deploy capital in this business with a focus on expanding our markets, providing differentiated guest experiences and creating long-term growth. In order for a project to move forward, it must deliver attractive double-digit returns on invested capital and support our brand and our strategy. 
Fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012 will be peak years for our parks' capital spending, given the timing of a number of projects that were approved independent of each other over the past 5 years. And let me briefly update you on 5 of those projects. 
Next year, we will complete our redesign of California Adventure, with the opening of Cars Land and an entirely new entrance to the park. The expansion and redesign of California Adventure was a must to not only increase length of stay and attract new visitors, but to correct the justified perception problem that the price value relationship for this park was not what it needed to be. World of Color and the Little Mermaid: Ariel's Undersea Adventure, the first 2 attractions to open as part of this project, helped drive record Q3 attendance at the Disneyland Resort and our investment in California Adventure is beginning to generate returns.
This year, we launched the Disney Dream and next year, we will introduce its sister ship, the Disney Fantasy. We have unique competitive position as the creator of and the leading brand in the family cruise market, and we're very encouraged by the Dream's performance thus far and expect this investment to drive mid-teen returns on invested capital.
In Orlando, we are significantly expanding Fantasyland. This is the most popular land at the Magic Kingdom, which is our most popular park around the world. This project will double the size of Fantasyland and enhance the guest experience, particularly during peak periods. This is the first major enhancement we have made to the Magic Kingdom since its 1971 opening. And we expect this initiative will drive higher levels of guest satisfaction, encouraging guess to spend more of their vacation dollars with us. 
In Hong Kong, we are in the midst of creating 3 new themed areas, including Toy Story land. We expect this expansion to perpetuate the upward momentum we have been enjoying in Hong Kong Disneyland. 
And finally, as you know, we recently reached final agreement to build a park in Shanghai, and we believe the economic benefit to the Walt Disney Company in this park will be significant, given the growth we expect in the Chinese economy and leisure travel and entertainment in China. We're optimistic about the return Shanghai Disneyland can generate for the company, and we see it as one of our most exciting and important projects. 
Each of these 5 investments exceeded our stringent hurdle rate requirements and is expected to be accretive. We continue to believe that investment in parks projects like these is an excellent use of the company's capital.
In closing, we're optimistic about our creative pipeline across our businesses and confident our current long-term strategy will create shareholder value. Great brands demonstrate their value through all economic environments. And thus, with Disney, ESPN, Pixar, Marvel and ABC, we remain well-positioned for whatever economic conditions we face in the future. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Jay."
191564,134776590,155447,"Walt Disney Co., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2011",2011-08-09,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll now take a few minutes to discuss our Q3 result in more detail and highlight a number of comparability items that will impact our Q4 results. Media Networks was the largest contributor to the year-over-yea",1192,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll now take a few minutes to discuss our Q3 result in more detail and highlight a number of comparability items that will impact our Q4 results. 
Media Networks was the largest contributor to the year-over-year increase in operating income, driven primarily by ESPN. At Cable Networks, growth in operating income was due to increased affiliate revenue at ESPN and Disney Channel resulting from contractual rate increases, as well as higher equity income. 
During the quarter, ESPN was able to meet by a few hours the same programming commitments that it met in Q3 of last year. As a result, net affiliate revenue recognition related to program covenant timing in Q3 was comparable to the prior year. Thus, the $228 million in deferred revenue we mentioned during our last call was actually recognized in Q3. We estimate that the EPS impact of this timing shift is $0.06.
Year-over-year ad revenue comparisons at ESPN were affected by the impact of the men's Fifa World Cup and Game 7 of the NBA Finals last year. We estimate that ESPN's ad revenue was up 9% if you exclude these items from the prior year. When these items are included in the prior year, ad revenue at ESPN was down 1% compared to last year.
At Broadcasting, operating income growth was driven by lower programming costs and higher ad revenue at the ABC Television Network. At our own TV stations, ad revenue was down 8% as a result of lower political spending in the quarter and the sale of our Flint and Toledo stations. Excluding the effect of these items from the prior year, ad revenue was up 2%.  Thus far in Q4, ABC Network's scatter pricing is running more than 25% above up front levels, with some deals priced well above that level. Ad sales at ESPN and ABC family are pacing up versus prior year. TV station ad sales are pacing down mid-single-digits. I'll remind you that our stations generated approximately $55 million in revenue from political spending in the second half of last year, so station results in Q4 will face a difficult comparison. 
At the Parks & Resorts segment, operating income growth was driven primarily by increased guest spending at our domestic parks and higher passenger cruise days, partially offset by higher operating costs. Results also reflect lower royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort and a prior-year benefit from a real estate transaction at Disneyland Paris. Also keep in mind that operating results this quarter include 2 weeks of the Easter holiday, while last year, 1 week.  While our reported Q3 second segment margins declined by 50 basis points, without the impact of the Easter shift, the Tohoku earthquake and the Disneyland Paris real estate transaction, we estimate that theme park margins would actually have increased by 40 basis points versus the prior year. 
Domestic park attendance was up 2%. After adjusting for the Easter holiday shift, attendance was up 1%. Per capita spending was up 8%, driven by higher admissions, merchandise and food and beverage spending. Average room spending at our domestic hotels was up an impressive 14%. Occupancy at our hotels was about 1 percentage point below prior year levels at 81%. The increase in per room spending that we are seeing is consistent with the strategy we articulated to reduce discounting. As illustrated by our Q3 results, we remain willing to make a short-term trade-off between modestly lower occupancy and significantly higher room pricing, as we believe that a return to normalized pricing levels will drive greater long-term profitability.  So far this quarter, domestic hotel reservations are pacing down 2% versus prior year levels, while booked rates are up mid-single digits. 
Results at our international parks were impacted by lower royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort and a decrease at Disneyland Paris that was primarily due to the real estate transaction. We continue to see improvement at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, driven by higher attendance and guest spending. 
Disney Cruise Line's performance this quarter reflected the successful launch of the Disney Dream, which contributed to operating income in its first full quarter of operation. 
At Studio Entertainment, operating income was down from last year as a result of the lower domestic theatrical performance of Cars 2 compared to Toy Story 3, and lower worldwide theatrical performance of Thor compared to Iron Man 2. While we were pleased with the global box office performance of Pirates for this quarter, its operating results were comparable to those of Alice in Wonderland in Q3 last year, as increased revenue was largely offset by higher marketing and distribution costs, which were incurred in the quarter.
At Consumer Products, operating income was up during the quarter as a result growth of growth in earned revenue for Cars merchandise and higher revenue from our Marvel properties. On a comparable basis, Disney branded earned licensing revenue was up 10% year-over-year.
At Interactive Media, segment lower operating results were driven by the acquisition of Playdom, including $21 million in purchase accounting adjustments. Results at our Console Games business improved during the quarter due to higher unit sales and lower marketing expense, partially offset by the higher cost of sales reflecting fees paid for the developer of LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean.
As Bob commented, our strategic position and strength of our brands gives us reason to remain optimistic about the future. However, I want to identify some comparability issues that will impact our Q4 results. As I mentioned earlier, ESPN achieved many of its key programming commitments in Q3 so revenue recognition related to those commitments in Q4 will be comparable to the prior year. Therefore, the $228 million in deferred revenue recognized in Q3 will not be recognized in Q4. 
Additionally, at Media Networks, we expect to incur higher programming and production costs at ESPN due to contractual increases in rights cost for college football, NFL, Major League baseball, along with costs associated with our new ACC contract and startup cost to the launch of the Longhorn Network. ABC faces a difficult comp in television syndication, given sales of shows in the prior year, including Ugly Betty and My Wife And Kids. In Studio, Cars 2 will continue to face a difficult global box office comparison versus last year's release of Toy Story 3. Additionally, the Q4 home video release of Thor faces a difficult comparison to last year's home video release of Iron Man 2.  We estimate on a combined basis the higher cost of ESPN, lower syndication sales at ABC and challenging Studio comps will impact our Q4 earnings by about $0.07 per share. 
And finally, we significantly increased our pace of share repurchase during the quarter by buying back 35.1 million shares for approximately $1.4 billion. Year-to-date, we've repurchased almost 89 million shares for $3.5 billion. We continue to view the repurchase of our stock as a very attractive use of our capital and we'll continue to return capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchase in a financially prudent manner as part of our overall cash deployment strategy.
Now I'll turn the call over to Lowell for questions."

At the same time, we can offer the multi-channel distributor packages with new elements to the ESPN package that will enable them to sell expanded packages to their customers, which has the affect of really 2 things: one raising more revenue, and two, providing the customer with an even broader array of sports and sports-related material. I mentioned the Wimbledon deal. ESPN's created the technology to offer just about every match, I think maybe every match, that would be played at Wimbledon over a 2-week period of time, and may have an ability to offer that to distributors, which gives distributers an opportunity to offer a broader array of services to their customer.

And as we look at that market, Jessica, we believe that there's some great opportunities for growth for this company as not only the market expands, particularly with new technology, but as it becomes even more hospitable to basically to foreign investment. And so, what we've done is we've actually made an offer to buy out the public, and also buy out our partner, which is going through now basically a process in India, essentially a regulatory process, as well as the typical process that you'd go through if you are essentially tendering shares. Our view on this, by the way, is not only about the long-term prospects for India, but it's pretty consistent with what role M&A plays in our overall capital deployment. I know that Jay talked about this back in February when we had our investor meeting, but we decided to take an even closer look at it since that meeting. And we determined that between fiscal '06 and 2010, we deployed about $13 billion for acquisitions. And we now estimate that 90% of that capital was allocated toward acquisitions that are creating value for the company. What I mean by that is deals which the rate of return exceed the cost of capital. And so we now estimate that the businesses that we acquired for $13 billion represent about $23 billion in enterprise value. So our M&A strategy has clearly worked. By the way, when we look at enterprise value, we're looking into the value to the company in many ways. Pixar, a great example of that, the huge impact that it's had on the Disney brand as a for instance. So we're going to continue to deploy capital in this direction. We like growth in international markets, I mentioned Shanghai earlier. India clearly is another example of a high-growth market that we think investing in at least today's world is a smart move."

And the net result of that is that across the board, our revenue per guest is up at our theme parks, and we continue to see that moving into Q4."

But you are right in your assessment that we'll basically push the window back or make access to the programming more difficult or later, except if customers authenticated as a subscriber. And I think you'll see over the next few years a lot of deals done that enable this. We now have to hope that not only is the technology improves that enables authentication, but that the whole user experience gets better. This is for instance there have been over 2.5 million downloads of the Watch ESPN app. And a lot of people downloaded it. But they were subscribers to services that weren't hadn't cut authentication deals with us yet. But even where there were subscribers to services that had caught authentication deals, the user experience could be better and needs improved so I think this is kind of a developing situation.

Net income in the quarter was up 11% on a 7% revenue increase. EPS for the quarter adjusted for comparability grew 16% to $0.78. 
Given the economic news of the past week, I'm sure there's interest in what we are seeing. And during the past few days, we haven't seen any change in the pace of activity in our Parks and Resorts advertising or consumer products businesses. Jay will follow-up with more detail on specific trends in his comments, and we'll of course continue to closely watch key trends in these areas. 
Over the past few months, we've had opportunities to meet with a number of investors and analysts. Since we obviously can't meet with everyone listening to this call, I want to take a different approach to my comments today and expand a bit on our strategy and discuss some of the opportunities we are most excited about. 
Let me start with ESPN. The growth in our Media Networks segment in Q3 was primarily driven by ESPN. ESPN remains incredibly well positioned today, given its ability to deliver comprehensive, high-quality coverage of major sports events, the value it provides to fans, advertisers and multichannel operators and it's disciplined approach to programming acquisition. 
ESPN's long-term commitment to serving sports fans continues to pay off with growth in reach and engagement. Our research shows that each week, almost 107 million people watch, listen, read or log on to ESPN Branded Media. And the average person now spends 6 hours and 35 minutes with ESPN Branded Media each week. 
The value of sports also continues to be reflected in the advertising marketplace. In this year's upfront, ESPN enjoyed all-time highs in both pricing and total dollars committed, with tremendous strength in our upfront NFL and college football sales. 
ESPN also continues to provide great value to multichannel video operators. In Beta Research's 2010 cable operator study, ESPN retained its position as the network with the most perceived value for the 11th consecutive year. And ESPN too placed second for the sixth straight year. So we're very pleased with ESPN's competitive position and the value we provide to fans and all of our partners. So it's certainly clear to us, and I hope clear to you, that with ESPN, the #1 sports brand, along with Disney, we own 2 of the most powerful brands in media.
Let me also spend a moment on the sports rights acquisition marketplace. John Skipper, ESPN's Head of Content, often says, the next time we're the only bidder for a sports package will be the first time. And we never take competition lightly, and the fact this competition for television sports rights has always existed. But our focus has remained unchanged. We have been and we'll continue to be diligent in our bidding and willing to pay fair prices for rights that will benefit and create long-term value for ESPN and the company.
We recently reached 2 new agreements that illustrate this approach. In May, we signed a 12-year deal for multi-platform rights for a wide array of Pac-12 conference sports, including football and basketball. This deal strengthened our position as the leader in college sports television. And last month, ESPN reached a 12-year deal to be the exclusive U.S. broadcaster of Wimbledon. Given our investment in technology, ESPN was able to offer Wimbledon the distribution platforms on which to air more than 900 live hours of tennis during the 2-week tournament.  Matches will air on ESPN, ESPN2 and ESPN3, and this deal will enhance and expand our coverage of Wimbledon and add another blue-chip event to ESPN's great stable of popular and important sports programming. 
In our recent sports rights negotiations, we have obtained long-term deals, and in addition to the 2 deals I just mentioned, in the past few years we reached a 15-year deal with the SEC and a 12-year deal with the ACC. Long-term deals provide us with greater cost visibility and allow us to build a stronger -- a longer term relationship with fans.
Also in our negotiations, we seek access to broad multi-platform rights, extending from television to online to our authenticated service. This multi-screen, multi-platform approach should also enable more growth, particularly as new platforms and new patterns of consumption emerge. 
During the past few months, we also pursued deals for the NHL and the Olympics, 2 attractive sports properties. In both cases, we made bids that made economic sense for ESPN, and we exhibited financial diligence and discipline and avoided burdening ESPN with new commitments that would have lowered ESPN's margins.
Now turning to Broadcasting. We delivered earnings growth at our Broadcasting business this quarter, driven in part by affiliate revenue growth at ABC and our own TV stations. We are in the process of negotiating cash retransmission payments for our on-television stations and license fees from our affiliated stations. Our own stations have already reached agreements with several large multi-channel distributors with more to come. And we believe our own TV stations are getting paid per sub cash retransmission rates that are comparable to what other station groups are earning. We have already completed license agreements with non-owned affiliates, covering more than 60% of our affiliate footprint.  
Let me give you some perspective on what this means financially. We now expect annual revenue streams to total between $400 million and $500 million by fiscal 2015. 
At the Studio, we enjoyed strong creative success during the quarter. Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides became the eighth film to earn more than $1 billion in global box office. Over the past few months, Marvel's Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger both opened to strong box office results. Thor has earned almost $450 million in global box office and Captain America is on track to deliver similar results. Both films, along with Iron Man and The Hulk, are key components of Marvel's Avengers franchise. And Marvel's approach, starting with great characters and stories, attracting great filmmakers and producing high-quality films, bodes well for our next film, The Avengers, which are aiming to turn into another great franchise for the company.
Cars 2 opened on June 25, and it's on its way to earning well above $500 million in global box, and Cars remains one of the most important franchises of the company. 
I'm excited about our upcoming films, and tomorrow The Help from DreamWorks will open and we're very encouraged by the early response to this film. This Thanksgiving, The Muppets return to the big screen in a family comedy we believe will reinvigorate a once great franchise. In December, we will distribute War Horse, a Steven Spielberg directed epic from DreamWorks that is bound to get a lot of attention. And in March, we will release the live action film, John Carter from Andrew Stanton, whose previous films include Finding Nemo and WALL-E. In May, we will release The Avengers and finally, in June, Pixar's next original film, Brave, will hit theaters.
Our Disney Channel business remains very strong as well. During the third quarter, Disney Channel's ratings were up 10%, while Disney XD's ratings were up 24%. And this past Friday, Disney Channel's original movie, Phineas and Ferb: Across the Second Dimension, which is the most recent installment in this franchise debut to a phenomenal success, becoming cable TV's #1 movie of the year in total viewers and the #1 scripted telecast on all TV this year with kids. Disney Channel now distributes 100 channels around the world. 
And now let me discuss our Parks and Resorts business, specifically our capital investment strategy. We deploy capital in this business with a focus on expanding our markets, providing differentiated guest experiences and creating long-term growth. In order for a project to move forward, it must deliver attractive double-digit returns on invested capital and support our brand and our strategy. 
Fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012 will be peak years for our Parks' capital spending, given the timing of a number of projects that were approved independent of each other over the past 5 years. And let me briefly update you on 5 of those projects. 
Next year, we will complete our redesign of California Adventure, with the opening of Cars Land and an entirely new entrance to the park. The expansion and redesign of California Adventure was a must, to not only increase length of stay and attract new visitors, but to correct the justified perception problem that the price-to-value relationship for this park was not what it needed to be. 
World of Color and the Little Mermaid: Ariel's Undersea Adventure, the 2 first attractions to open as part of this project, helped drive record Q3 attendance at the Disneyland Resort, and our investment in California Adventure is beginning to generate returns.
This year, we launched the Disney Dream and next year, we will introduce its sistership, the Disney Fantasy. We have unique competitive position as the creator of and the leading brand in the family cruise market, and we're very encouraged by the Dream's performance thus far and expect this investment to drive mid-teen returns on invested capital.
In Orlando, we are significantly expanding Fantasyland. This is the most popular land at the Magic Kingdom, which is our most popular park around the world. This project will double the size of Fantasyland and enhance the guest experience, particularly during peak periods. This is the first major enhancement we have made to Magic Kingdom since its 1971 opening. We expect this initiative will drive higher levels of guest satisfaction, encouraging guests to spend more time and more of their vacation dollars with us. 
In Hong Kong, we are in the midst of creating 3 new themed areas, including Toy Story Land. We expect this expansion to perpetuate the upward momentum we have been enjoying in Hong Kong Disneyland. 
And finally, as you know, we recently reached final agreement to build a park in Shanghai, and we believe the economic benefits to the Walt Disney Company of this park will be significant, given the growth we expect in the Chinese economy and leisure travel and entertainment in China. We are optimistic about the return Shanghai Disneyland can generate for the company, and we see it as one of our most exciting and important projects. 
Each of these 5 investments exceeded our stringent hurdle rate requirements and is expected to be accretive. We continue to believe that investment in parks projects like these is an excellent use of the company's capital.
In closing, we are optimistic about our creative pipeline across our businesses and confident our current long-term strategy will create shareholder value. Great brands demonstrate their value through all economic environments. And thus, with Disney, ESPN, Pixar, Marvel and ABC, we remain well positioned for whatever economic conditions we face in the future. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Jay."

I'll now take a few minutes to discuss our Q3 results in more detail and highlight a number of comparability items that will impact our Q4 results. Media Networks was the largest contributor to the year-over-ye",1189,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll now take a few minutes to discuss our Q3 results in more detail and highlight a number of comparability items that will impact our Q4 results. 
Media Networks was the largest contributor to the year-over-year increase in operating income, driven primarily by ESPN. At Cable Networks, growth in operating income was due to increased affiliate revenue at ESPN and Disney Channel resulting from contractual rate increases, as well as higher equity income. 
During the quarter, ESPN was able to meet by a few hours the same programming commitments that it met in Q3 of last year. As a result, net affiliate revenue recognition related to program covenant timing in Q3 was comparable to the prior year. Thus, the $228 million in deferred revenue we mentioned during our last call was actually recognized in Q3. We estimate that the EPS impact of this timing shift is $0.06.
Year-over-year ad revenue comparisons at ESPN were affected by the impact of the men's FIFA World Cup and Game 7 of the NBA Finals last year. We estimate that ESPN's ad revenue was up 9% if you exclude these items from the prior year. When these items are included in the prior year, ad revenue at ESPN was down 1% compared to last year.
At Broadcasting, operating income growth was driven by lower programming costs and higher ad revenue at the ABC Television Network. At our own TV stations, ad revenue was down 8% as a result of lower political spending in the quarter and the sale of our Flint and Toledo stations. Excluding the effect of these items from the prior year, ad revenue was up 2%.  Thus far in Q4, ABC Networks' scatter pricing is running more than 25% above upfront levels, with some deals priced well above that level. 
Ad sales at ESPN and ABC Family are pacing up versus prior year. TV station ad sales are pacing down mid-single-digits. I'll remind you that our stations generated approximately $55 million in revenue from political spending in the second half of last year, so station results in Q4 will face a difficult comparison. 
At the Parks and Resorts segment, operating income growth was driven primarily by increased guest spending at our domestic parks and higher passenger cruise days, partially offset by higher operating costs. Results also reflect lower royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort and a prior year benefit from a real estate transaction at Disneyland Paris. Also keep in mind that operating results this quarter include 2 weeks of the Easter holiday, while last year, one week.  
While our reported Q3 segment margins declined by 50 basis points, without the impact of the Easter shift, the Tohoku earthquake and the Disneyland Paris real estate transaction, we estimate that theme park margins would actually have increased by 40 basis points versus the prior year. 
Domestic park attendance was up 2%. After adjusting for the Easter holiday shift, attendance was up 1%. Per capita spending was up 8%, driven by higher admissions, merchandise and food and beverage spending. Average room spending at our domestic hotels was up, an impressive 14%. Occupancy at our hotels was about 1 percentage point below prior year levels at 81%. The increase in per room spending that we are seeing is consistent with the strategy we articulated to reduce discounting. 
As illustrated by our Q3 results, we remain willing to make a short-term tradeoff between modestly lower occupancy and significantly higher room pricing, as we believe that a return to normalized pricing levels will drive greater long-term profitability.  
So far this quarter, domestic hotel reservations are pacing down 2% versus prior year levels, while booked rates are up mid-single digits. 
Results at our international parks were impacted by lower royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort and a decrease at Disneyland Paris that was primarily due to the real estate transaction. We continue to see improvement at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, driven by higher attendance and guest spending. 
Disney Cruise Line's performance this quarter reflected the successful launch of the Disney Dream, which contributed to operating income in its first full quarter of operation. 
At Studio Entertainment, operating income was down from last year as a result of the lower domestic theatrical performance of Cars 2 compared to Toy Story 3, and lower worldwide theatrical performance of Thor compared to Iron Man 2.  While we were pleased with the global box office performance of Pirates for this quarter, its operating results were comparable to those of Alice in Wonderland in Q3 last year, as increased revenue was largely offset by higher marketing and distribution costs, which were incurred in the quarter.
At Consumer Products, operating income was up during the quarter as a result growth in earned revenue for Cars merchandise and higher revenue from our Marvel properties. On a comparable basis, Disney branded earned licensing revenue was up 10% year-over-year.
At Interactive Media segment, lower operating results were driven by the acquisition of Playdom, including $21 million in purchase accounting adjustments. Results at our console games business improved during the quarter due to higher unit sales and lower marketing expense, partially offset by the higher cost of sales reflecting fees paid for the developer of LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean.
As Bob commented, our strategic position and strength of our brands gives us reason to remain optimistic about the future. However, I want to identify some comparability issues that will impact our Q4 results. 
As I mentioned earlier, ESPN achieved many of its key programming commitments in Q3, so revenue recognition related to those commitments in Q4 will be comparable to the prior year. Therefore, the $228 million in deferred revenue recognized in Q3 will not be recognized in Q4. 
Additionally, at Media Networks, we expect to incur higher programming and production costs at ESPN due to contractual increases in rights cost for college football, NFL, Major League Baseball, along with costs associated with our new ACC contract and startup cost to the launch of the Longhorn Network. 
ABC faces a difficult comp in television syndication, given sales of shows in the prior year, including Ugly Betty and My Wife And Kids.  At Studio, Cars 2 will continue to face a difficult global box office comparison versus last year's release of Toy Story 3. Additionally, the Q4 home video release of Thor faces a difficult comparison to last year's home video release of Iron Man 2.  
We estimate on a combined basis the higher cost of ESPN, lower syndication sales at ABC and challenging studio comps will impact our Q4 earnings by about $0.07 per share. 
And finally, we significantly increased our pace of share repurchase during the quarter by buying back 35.1 million shares for approximately $1.4 billion. Year-to-date, we've repurchased almost 89 million shares for $3.5 billion. We continue to view the repurchase of our stock as a very attractive use of our capital, and we'll continue to return capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchase in a financially prudent manner as part of our overall cash deployment strategy.
Now I'll turn the call over to Lowell for questions."

As I mentioned at the beginning of my comments, so far, in the last few days, we haven't really seen that much of a change. Now we're currently selling basically a shoulder period mostly, which is the fall, where there is some discounting. Anyway, we'll take a look at holiday bookings as the year progresses. It's way too early to predict whether we'd be discounting or not.

At the same time, we can offer the multichannel distributor packages with new elements to the ESPN package that will enable them to sell expanded packages to their customers, which has the affect of really 2 things: one, raising more revenue; and two, providing the customer with an even broader array of sports and sports-related material. I mentioned the Wimbledon deal. ESPN has created the technology to offer just about every match, I think maybe every match, that would be played at Wimbledon over a 2-week period of time, and may have the ability to offer that to distributors, which gives distributors an opportunity to offer a broader array of services to their customer.

And as we look at that market, Jessica, we believe that there's some great opportunities for growth for this company as not only the market expands, particularly with new technology, but as it becomes even more hospitable basically to foreign investment. And so, what we've done is we've actually made an offer to buy out the public, and also buy out our partner, which is going through now basically a process in India, essentially a regulatory process, as well as the typical process that you'd go through if you are essentially tendering shares. Our view on this, by the way, is not only about the long-term prospects for India, but it's pretty consistent with what role M&A plays in our overall capital deployment. I know that Jay talked about this back in February when we had our investor meeting, but we decided to take an even closer look at it since that meeting. And we determined that between fiscal '06 and 2010, we deployed about $13 billion for acquisitions. And we now estimate that 90% of that capital was allocated toward acquisitions that are creating value for the company. What I mean by that is deals, which our rate of return exceed the cost of capital. And so we now estimate that the businesses that we acquired for $13 billion represent about $23 billion in enterprise value. So our M&A strategy has clearly worked. By the way, when we look at enterprise value, we're looking into the value to the company in many ways. Pixar, a great example of that and the huge impact it's had on the Disney brand, as a for instance. So we're going to continue to deploy capital in this direction. We like growth in international markets, I mentioned Shanghai earlier. India clearly is another example of a high-growth market that we think investing in at least in today's world is a smart move."

And I think it's likely that we will make more deals in this space. Our overall approach of late has been to make deals that increase revenue, while at the same time, protect and respect basically the multichannel or the channel distribution value that we seek today. And so, we're looking at deals that are largely library in nature, meaning very little if any content that would be in season, mostly prior season. But also, trying to build into at least some of these deals, some form of authentication, not necessarily in the ones that you described, but in ones that it will allow access to our programming faster or in a more aggressive window, if the customer is a multichannel subscriber. I think it's a means of growing the business. There's clearly a thirst for film and entertainment, in particular branded, high-quality entertainment. And what we're seeing I think stimulated in part by not only higher connectivity speeds, but significant development in mobile technology, particularly tablets. And we're looking at platforms that are emerging that are creating all kinds of new business opportunities for content providers."

And I think you'll see over the next few years a lot of deals done that enable this. We now have to hope that not only is the technology improves that enables authentication, but that the whole user experience gets better. This is a for instance. There have been over 2.5 million downloads of the Watch ESPN app. And a lot of people downloaded it, but they were subscribers to services that hadn't cut authentication deals with us yet. But even where there were subscribers to services that had cut authentication deals, the user experience still could be better. It needs improve. So I think this is kind of a developing situation.

I'm pleased to report that we had a strong third quarter, driven by our Media Networks and Parks and Resorts businesses. Net income in the quarter was up 11% on a 7% revenue increase. EPS for the quarter adjusted for",1840,"Thank you, Lowell, and good afternoon. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong third quarter, driven by our Media Networks and Parks and Resorts businesses. Net income in the quarter was up 11% on a 7% revenue increase. EPS for the quarter adjusted for comparability grew 16% to $0.78. 
Given the economic news of the past week, I'm sure there's interest in what we are seeing. And during the past few days, we haven't seen any change in the pace of activity in our Parks and Resorts, advertising or consumer products businesses. Jay will follow-up with more detail on specific trends in his comments, and we'll of course continue to closely watch key trends in these areas. 
Over the past few months, we've had opportunities to meet with a number of investors and analysts. Since we obviously can't meet with everyone listening to this call, I want to take a different approach to my comments today and expand a bit on our strategy and discuss some of the opportunities we are most excited about. 
Let me start with ESPN. The growth in our Media Networks segment in Q3 was primarily driven by ESPN. ESPN remains incredibly well positioned today, given its ability to deliver comprehensive, high-quality coverage of major sports events, the value it provides to fans, advertisers and multichannel operators and its disciplined approach to programming acquisition. 
ESPN's long-term commitment to serving sports fans continues to pay off with growth in reach and engagement. Our research shows that each week, almost 107 million people watch, listen, read or log on to ESPN Branded Media. And the average person now spends 6 hours and 35 minutes with ESPN Branded Media each week. 
The value of sports also continues to be reflected in the advertising marketplace. In this year's upfront, ESPN enjoyed all-time highs in both pricing and total dollars committed, with tremendous strength in our upfront NFL and college football sales. 
ESPN also continues to provide great value to multichannel video operators. In Beta Research's 2010 cable operator study, ESPN retained its position as the network with the most perceived value for the 11th consecutive year. And ESPN2 placed second for the sixth straight year. So we're very pleased with ESPN's competitive position and the value we provide to fans and all of our partners. So it's certainly clear to us, and I hope clear to you, that with ESPN, the #1 sports brand, along with Disney, we own 2 of the most powerful brands in media.
Let me also spend a moment on the sports rights acquisition marketplace. John Skipper, ESPN's Head of Content, often says, the next time we're the only bidder for a sports package will be the first time. And we never take competition lightly, and the fact is competition for television sports rights has always existed. But our focus has remained unchanged. We have been and we'll continue to be diligent in our bidding and willing to pay fair prices for rights that will benefit and create long-term value for ESPN and the company.
We recently reached 2 new agreements that illustrate this approach. In May, we signed a 12-year deal for multi-platform rights for a wide array of Pac-12 conference sports, including football and basketball. This deal strengthened our position as the leader in college sports television. And last month, ESPN reached a 12-year deal to be the exclusive U.S. broadcaster of Wimbledon. Given our investment in technology, ESPN was able to offer Wimbledon the distribution platforms on which to air more than 900 live hours of tennis during the 2-week tournament.  Matches will air on ESPN, ESPN2 and ESPN3, and this deal will enhance and expand our coverage of Wimbledon and add another blue-chip event to ESPN's great stable of popular and important sports programming. 
In our recent sports rights negotiations, we have obtained long-term deals, and in addition to the 2 deals I just mentioned, in the past few years we reached a 15-year deal with the SEC and a 12-year deal with the ACC. Long-term deals provide us with greater cost visibility and allow us to build a stronger -- a longer term relationship with fans.
Also in our negotiations, we seek access to broad multi-platform rights, extending from television to online to our authenticated service. This multi-screen, multi-platform approach should also enable more growth, particularly as new platforms and new patterns of consumption emerge. 
During the past few months, we also pursued deals for the NHL and the Olympics, 2 attractive sports properties. In both cases, we made bids that made economic sense for ESPN, and we exhibited financial diligence and discipline and avoided burdening ESPN with new commitments that would have lowered ESPN's margins.
Now turning to Broadcasting. We delivered earnings growth at our Broadcasting business this quarter, driven in part by affiliate revenue growth at ABC and our own TV stations. We are in the process of negotiating cash retransmission payments for our own television stations and license fees from our affiliated stations. Our own stations have already reached agreements with several large multi-channel distributors with more to come. And we believe our own TV stations are getting paid per sub cash retransmission rates that are comparable to what other station groups are earning. We have already completed license agreements with non-owned affiliates, covering more than 60% of our affiliate footprint.  
And to give you some perspective on what this means financially. We now expect annual revenue streams to total between $400 million and $500 million by fiscal 2015. 
At the Studio, we enjoyed strong creative success during the quarter. Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides became the eighth film to earn more than $1 billion in global box office. Over the past few months, Marvel's Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger both opened to strong box office results. Thor has earned almost $450 million in global box office and Captain America is on track to deliver similar results. Both films, along with Iron Man and The Hulk, are key components of Marvel's Avengers franchise. And Marvel's approach, starting with great characters and stories, attracting great filmmakers and producing high-quality films, bodes well for our next film, The Avengers, which are aiming to turn into another great franchise for the company.
Cars 2 opened on June 25, and it's on its way to earning well above $500 million in global box, and Cars remains one of the most important franchises of the company. 
I'm excited about our upcoming films, and tomorrow The Help from DreamWorks will open and we're very encouraged by the early response to this film. This Thanksgiving, The Muppets return to the big screen in a family comedy we believe will reinvigorate a once great franchise. In December, we will distribute War Horse, a Steven Spielberg directed epic from DreamWorks that is bound to get a lot of attention. And in March, we will release the live action film, John Carter from Andrew Stanton, whose previous films include Finding Nemo and WALL-E. In May, we will release The Avengers and finally, in June, Pixar's next original film, Brave, will hit theaters.
Our Disney Channel business remains very strong as well. During the third quarter, Disney Channel's ratings were up 10%, while Disney XD's ratings were up 24%. And this past Friday, Disney Channel's original movie, Phineas and Ferb: Across the Second Dimension, which is the most recent installment in this franchise debuted to a phenomenal success, becoming cable TV's #1 movie of the year in total viewers and the #1 scripted telecast on all TV this year with kids. Disney Channel now distributes 100 channels around the world. 
And now let me discuss our Parks and Resorts business, specifically our capital investment strategy. We deploy capital in this business with a focus on expanding our markets, providing differentiated guest experiences and creating long-term growth. In order for a project to move forward, it must deliver attractive double-digit returns on invested capital and support our brand and our strategy. 
Fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012 will be peak years for our Parks' capital spending, given the timing of a number of projects that were approved independent of each other over the past 5 years. And let me briefly update you on 5 of those projects. 
Next year, we will complete our redesign of California Adventure, with the opening of Cars Land and an entirely new entrance to the park. The expansion and redesign of California Adventure was a must, to not only increase length of stay and attract new visitors, but to correct the justified perception problem that the price-to-value relationship for this park was not what it needed to be. 
World of Color and the Little Mermaid: Ariel's Undersea Adventure, the 2 first attractions to open as part of this project, helped drive record Q3 attendance at the Disneyland Resort, and our investment in California Adventure is beginning to generate returns.
This year, we launched the Disney Dream and next year, we will introduce its sistership, the Disney Fantasy. We have unique competitive position as the creator of and the leading brand in the family cruise market, and we're very encouraged by the Dream's performance thus far and expect this investment to drive mid-teen returns on invested capital.
In Orlando, we are significantly expanding Fantasyland. This is the most popular land at the Magic Kingdom, which is our most popular park around the world. This project will double the size of Fantasyland and enhance the guest experience, particularly during peak periods. This is the first major enhancement we have made to Magic Kingdom since its 1971 opening. We expect this initiative will drive higher levels of guest satisfaction, encouraging guests to spend more time and more of their vacation dollars with us. 
In Hong Kong, we are in the midst of creating 3 new themed areas, including Toy Story Land. We expect this expansion to perpetuate the upward momentum we have been enjoying in Hong Kong Disneyland. 
And finally, as you know, we recently reached final agreement to build a park in Shanghai, and we believe the economic benefits to the Walt Disney Company of this park will be significant, given the growth we expect in the Chinese economy and leisure travel and entertainment in China. We are optimistic about the return Shanghai Disneyland can generate for the company, and we see it as one of our most exciting and important projects. 
Each of these 5 investments exceeded our stringent hurdle rate requirements and is expected to be accretive. We continue to believe that investment in parks projects like these is an excellent use of the company's capital.
In closing, we are optimistic about our creative pipeline across our businesses and confident our current long-term strategy will create shareholder value. Great brands demonstrate their value through all economic environments. And thus, with Disney, ESPN, Pixar, Marvel and ABC, we remain well positioned for whatever economic conditions we face in the future. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Jay."
191564,134776590,155620,"Walt Disney Co., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2011",2011-08-09,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll now take a few minutes to discuss our Q3 results in more detail and highlight a number of comparability items that will impact our Q4 results. Media Networks was the largest contributor to the year-over-ye",1190,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll now take a few minutes to discuss our Q3 results in more detail and highlight a number of comparability items that will impact our Q4 results. 
Media Networks was the largest contributor to the year-over-year increase in operating income, driven primarily by ESPN. At Cable Networks, growth in operating income was due to increased affiliate revenue at ESPN and Disney Channel resulting from contractual rate increases, as well as higher equity income. 
During the quarter, ESPN was able to meet by a few hours the same programming commitments that it met in Q3 of last year. As a result, net affiliate revenue recognition related to program covenant timing in Q3 was comparable to the prior year. Thus, the $228 million in deferred revenue we mentioned during our last call was actually recognized in Q3. We estimate that the EPS impact of this timing shift is $0.06.
Year-over-year ad revenue comparisons at ESPN were affected by the impact of the men's FIFA World Cup and Game 7 of the NBA Finals last year. We estimate that ESPN's ad revenue was up 9% if you exclude these items from the prior year. When these items are included in the prior year, ad revenue at ESPN was down 1% compared to last year.
At Broadcasting, operating income growth was driven by lower programming costs and higher ad revenue at the ABC Television Network. At our own TV stations, ad revenue was down 8% as a result of lower political spending in the quarter and the sale of our Flint and Toledo stations. Excluding the effect of these items from the prior year, ad revenue was up 2%.  Thus far in Q4, ABC Networks' scatter pricing is running more than 25% above upfront levels, with some deals priced well above that level. 
Ad sales at ESPN and ABC Family are pacing up versus prior year. TV station ad sales are pacing down mid-single-digits. I'll remind you that our stations generated approximately $55 million in revenue from political spending in the second half of last year, so station results in Q4 will face a difficult comparison. 
At the Parks and Resorts segment, operating income growth was driven primarily by increased guest spending at our domestic parks and higher passenger cruise days, partially offset by higher operating costs. Results also reflect lower royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort and a prior year benefit from a real estate transaction at Disneyland Paris. Also keep in mind that operating results this quarter include 2 weeks of the Easter holiday, while last year, one week.  
While our reported Q3 segment margins declined by 50 basis points, without the impact of the Easter shift, the Tokyo earthquake and the Disneyland Paris real estate transaction, we estimate that theme park margins would actually have increased by 40 basis points versus the prior year. 
Domestic park attendance was up 2%. After adjusting for the Easter holiday shift, attendance was up 1%. Per capita spending was up 8%, driven by higher admissions, merchandise and food and beverage spending. Average room spending at our domestic hotels was up, an impressive 14%. Occupancy at our hotels was about 1 percentage point below prior year levels at 81%. The increase in per room spending that we are seeing is consistent with the strategy we articulated to reduce discounting. 
As illustrated by our Q3 results, we remain willing to make a short-term tradeoff between modestly lower occupancy and significantly higher room pricing, as we believe that a return to normalized pricing levels will drive greater long-term profitability.  
So far this quarter, domestic hotel reservations are pacing down 2% versus prior year levels, while booked rates are up mid-single digits. 
Results at our international parks were impacted by lower royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort and a decrease at Disneyland Paris that was primarily due to the real estate transaction. We continue to see improvement at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, driven by higher attendance and guest spending. 
Disney Cruise Line's performance this quarter reflected the successful launch of the Disney Dream, which contributed to operating income in its first full quarter of operation. 
At Studio Entertainment, operating income was down from last year as a result of the lower domestic theatrical performance of Cars 2 compared to Toy Story 3, and lower worldwide theatrical performance of Thor compared to Iron Man 2.  While we were pleased with the global box office performance of Pirates 4 this quarter, its operating results were comparable to those of Alice in Wonderland in Q3 last year, as increased revenue was largely offset by higher marketing and distribution costs, which were incurred in the quarter.
At Consumer Products, operating income was up during the quarter as a result of growth in earned revenue for Cars merchandise and higher revenue from our Marvel properties. On a comparable basis, Disney branded earned licensing revenue was up 10% year-over-year.
At Interactive Media segment, lower operating results were driven by the acquisition of Playdom, including $21 million in purchase accounting adjustments. Results at our console games business improved during the quarter due to higher unit sales and lower marketing expense, partially offset by the higher cost of sales reflecting fees paid for the developer of LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean.
As Bob commented, our strategic position and strength of our brands gives us reason to remain optimistic about the future. However, I want to identify some comparability issues that will impact our Q4 results. 
As I mentioned earlier, ESPN achieved many of its key programming commitments in Q3, so revenue recognition related to those commitments in Q4 will be comparable to the prior year. Therefore, the $228 million in deferred revenue recognized in Q3 will not be recognized in Q4. 
Additionally, at Media Networks, we expect to incur higher programming and production costs at ESPN due to contractual increases in rights cost for college football, NFL, Major League Baseball, along with costs associated with our new ACC contract and startup cost to the launch of the Longhorn Network. 
ABC faces a difficult comp in television syndication, given sales of shows in the prior year, including Ugly Betty and My Wife And Kids.  At Studio, Cars 2 will continue to face a difficult global box office comparison versus last year's release of Toy Story 3. Additionally, the Q4 home video release of Thor faces a difficult comparison to last year's home video release of Iron Man 2.  
We estimate on a combined basis the higher cost of ESPN, lower syndication sales at ABC and challenging studio comps will impact our Q4 earnings by about $0.07 per share. 
And finally, we significantly increased our pace of share repurchase during the quarter by buying back 35.1 million shares for approximately $1.4 billion. Year-to-date, we've repurchased almost 89 million shares for $3.5 billion. We continue to view the repurchase of our stock as a very attractive use of our capital, and we'll continue to return capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchase in a financially prudent manner as part of our overall cash deployment strategy.
Now I'll turn the call over to Lowell for questions."

So I was just hoping you could give us a little bit more color on what's driving that since I thought it was a fairly fixed cost business. Is that just the impact of pension and other things? Any more color? That would be helpful. And then just secondarily, maybe for Bob, if the economy does weaken domestically, how would you address that in the parks? Would you revisit the promotion strategy that you've implemented back a few years ago? Or would there be a different approach?"

And the list is: the Aulani resort, the things they're coming on in DCA, some spending behind our next-generation work in Florida, and believe it or not, some expenses against the Shanghai project, which of course we won't see revenue on for years and years. So if you actually -- I mentioned 40 basis points, if you actually add back those factors, it's about another 100 basis points in margin growth in the quarter. So I've said for a long time that yes, other things you mentioned like pension and so on are all part of the equation. But we don't see any reason why when these projects are coming in at their long-term revenue versus costs equation that we won't be able to get back to the kinds of margins we've seen historically."

On the second part of your question, if the economy weakens, will we reconsider promotion strategy, yes. At some point, we might. We take a look at what impact a weakening economy has on us. As I mentioned at the beginning of my comments, so far, in the last few days, we haven't really seen that much of a change. Now we're currently selling basically a shoulder period mostly, which is the fall, where there is some discounting. Anyway, we'll take a look at holiday bookings as the year progresses. It's way too early to predict whether we'd be discounting or not. But my gut is based on the trends that we've seen this past year that it's not something I think we'll necessarily have to do quickly."

First for Jay, with interest rates this low, I know you talked about pension cost on your last call, you talked about it becoming a tailwind over the next 5 years. But just given the expectation as of the last month or so, it's kind of hard to get too aggressive on pension plan returns, I would think. Can you just give us a little bit of color on that as you see it? Is it possible that you're going to have make adjustments to your assumptions, including your discount rate? And then a follow-up for Bob."

But pension rates return have been pretty low for a while. We in fact, in the past quarter you'll see in our balance sheet and cash flow statement the reflection of a bit of a buy down of our pension liability because it was so incredibly cheap for us to borrow money that we took advantage of that borrowing to buy down that liability a bit. But I think it's something we'll carefully manage. Obviously the growth in medical and post-retirement medical costs is something that we are keenly aware of, have been dealing with now like a lot of companies for a number of years, but not something that we feel will either get out of control or will we be inclined to let it get out of control in terms of downdraft."

You have the leagues there, your suppliers that I'm sure are cognizant of the value of it and then you've got your distributors who -- you don't want to undermine the relationship you have with your affiliates by offering this content direct to the consumer. But I'm pretty sure that consumer wants more sports streams to devices like iPads and like phones. And so as you look out, as the negotiations that you have with both sides of this, what really needs to happen for more sports -- or live sports to be streamed to mobile devices via ESPN3?"

At the same time, we can offer the multichannel distributor packages with new elements to the ESPN package that will enable them to sell expanded packages to their customers, which has the affect of really 2 things: one, raising more revenue; and two, providing the customer with an even broader array of sports and sports-related material. I mentioned the Wimbledon deal. ESPN has created the technology to offer just about every match, I think maybe every match, that would be played at Wimbledon over a 2-week period of time, and may have the ability to offer that to distributors, which gives distributors an opportunity to offer a broader array of services to their customer. I guess it's a means of my saying that in this case the relationship that we have with the distributors is a very valuable one, and it's one that we aim to respect by both protecting what we currently have and determining or figuring out ways that we can expand on it."

And as we look at that market, Jessica, we believe that there's some great opportunities for growth for this company as not only the market expands, particularly with new technology, but as it becomes even more hospitable basically to foreign investment. And so, what we've done is we've actually made an offer to buy out the public, and also buy out our partner, which is going through now basically a process in India, essentially a regulatory process, as well as the typical process that you'd go through if you are essentially tendering shares. Our view on this, by the way, is not only about the long-term prospects for India, but it's pretty consistent with what role M&A plays in our overall capital deployment. I know that Jay talked about this back in February when we had our investor meeting, but we decided to take an even closer look at it since that meeting. And we determined that between fiscal '06 and 2010, we deployed about $13 billion for acquisitions. And we now estimate that 90% of that capital was allocated toward acquisitions that are creating value for the company. What I mean by that is deals, which our rate of return exceed the cost of capital. And so we now estimate that the businesses that we acquired for $13 billion represent about $23 billion in enterprise value. So our M&A strategy has clearly worked. By the way, when we look at enterprise value, we're looking at the value to the company in many ways. Pixar, a great example of that and the huge impact it's had on the Disney brand, as a for instance. So we're going to continue to deploy capital in this direction. We like growth in international markets, I mentioned Shanghai earlier. India clearly is another example of a high-growth market that we think investing in at least in today's world is a smart move."

And I think it's likely that we will make more deals in this space. Our overall approach of late has been to make deals that increase revenue, while at the same time, protect and respect basically the multichannel or the channel distribution value that we see today. And so, we're looking at deals that are largely library in nature, meaning very little if any content that would be in season, mostly prior season. But also, trying to build into at least some of these deals, some form of authentication, not necessarily in the ones that you described, but in ones that it will allow access to our programming faster or in a more aggressive window, if the customer is a multichannel subscriber. I think it's a means of growing the business. There's clearly a thirst for film and entertainment, in particular branded, high-quality entertainment. And what we're seeing I think stimulated in part by not only higher connectivity speeds, but significant development in mobile technology, particularly tablets. And we're looking at platforms that are emerging that are creating all kinds of new business opportunities for content providers."

And I think you'll see over the next few years a lot of deals done that enable this. We now have to hope that not only is the technology improves that enables authentication, but that the whole user experience gets better. This is a for instance. There have been over 2.5 million downloads of the Watch ESPN app. And a lot of people downloaded it, but they were subscribers to services that hadn't cut authentication deals with us yet. But even where there were subscribers to services that had cut authentication deals, the user experience still could be better. It needs improve. So I think this is kind of a developing situation.

For proud to report that the posted record revenue, net income and earnings per share for the 2011 is clear. Our net income grew by 21% over a year ago on a 7% increase in revenue, and our earnings per share adjusted for comparability were up 23% for the year. I'm also very pleased with our fourth quarter results, which were driven by Media Networks and Parks and Resorts, with net income up 30% and revenue up 7%.  Our EPS for the quarter, adjusted for comparability, grew 31% to $0.59.
Our fiscal 2011 results validate our strategic priorities, demonstrate we can grow our earnings in the near term, while continuing to invest for long-term shareholder value. Given the challenging economic environment this year, I'm particularly proud of our excellent management team, which has consistently delivered on our strategy, creating high-quality content, expanding our platforms and growing our iconic brands and assets worldwide. Disney's collection of strong brands is unparalleled in the media and entertainment space in the U.S. And in 2011, we made significant progress and expanding our footprint in 3 large rapidly developing markets, Russia, China and India. 
Less than 2 weeks ago, we announced the launch of a free-to-air Disney Channel in Russia that will reach 40 million households and 75% of the country's viewers, with signature Disney programming and original Russian content. With a portfolio of 100 Disney Channels around the world, up from 19 a decade ago, Disney Channel serves as an anchor for our growth and is preeminent brand builder. We're extremely excited about this opportunity in Russia.
In China, work has begun on Shanghai Disney Resort, a 963-acre site that will include Shanghai Disneyland, 2 themed hotels and a large retail dining and entertainment venue. The Shanghai resort is a key component of our growth strategy in China.
And in India, we are in the process of acquiring the 50% equity that we don't own in UTV, one of the country's premier media and entertainment companies. Combined with UTV, we will be the leading film Studio, producing both UTV and Disney branded films and will increase the number of cable and satellite channels we own from 3 to 9. The combined UTV and Disney assets will allow us to significantly grow our businesses in India.
We made significant investments in Parks and Resorts in the last 5 years, and many are coming online. Toy Story Playland just opened a great guest reaction of Paris, and we're excited about its opening in Hong Kong next week. Next year, the highly anticipated Cars Land at Disney's California Adventure and Little Mermaid at Disney World's expanded Fantasyland will be completed. Following the success of the Disney Dream earlier this year, we will launch the Disney Fantasy in Spring 2012 and our imagineers and James Cameron already work on the design of our first AVATAR themed land at Walt Disney World Animal Kingdom.
Our long-term investments in Parks and Resorts are aimed at strong returns on capital, as well as strengthening and growing our product in markets we already operate in and expanding our presence globally.
Nothing illustrates our ability to create enduring quality family entertainment better than the rerelease of the Lion king in 3D. Nearly 20 years after its original premiere, it has grossed about $150 million in box office worldwide and was the #1 selling Blu-ray Disc in its first week of release. Over the next 2 years, we will release 4 additional award winning animated films in 3D, Beauty and the Beast, Little Mermaid, Monsters, Inc. and Finding Nemo. And introduce a whole new generation of families in this hallmark theatrical events.
In fiscal 2011, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, the fourth film in our extremely successful franchise, earned more than $1 billion in global box office, 1 of only 10 films to have done so. And we're in early development for another Pirates sequel.
Cars continues to be a great franchise for us in addition to grossing $559 million in global box office. Cars 2 continues to drive very strong performance in our Consumer Product business, which we expect to continue into the holiday season. It has surpassed both Star Wars and Toy Story in retail sales of Movie theme merchandise.
Marvel's Thor and Captain America were among the top 10 non-sequel releases of the year and we're pleased with the performance of both films and the true benefits of our Marvel acquisition should be quite visible in 2012.  First, in May, Thor and Captain America will join Iron Man, the Hulk and Black Widow in Marvel's The Avengers, the first Marvel film to be marketed and distributed by Disney.  The Avengers shows great promise with a record 10 million downloads on iTunes when the trailer debuted and is well on its way to being our next great franchise. Then in July, Sony pictures will release The Amazing Spiderman. We're excited about the film and expect it will drive significant benefits for Spiderman consumer products. 
To that end, we recently completed a transaction with Sony Pictures to simplify our relationship. And in the deal, we purchased Sony Pictures participation in Spiderman merchandising, while at the same time, Sony Pictures purchased from us our participation in Spiderman films. This transaction will allow us to control and fully benefit from all Spiderman merchandising activity, while Sony will continue to produce and distribute Spiderman films. We won't be specific about the economics of this 2-way transaction, but we expect it will drive attractive returns for Disney.
Our upcoming slate of films is rich in variety and potential. On Thanksgiving weekend, The Muppets will hit theaters in what we believe will rebuild another beloved franchise. Dreamworks' War Horse, the Stephen Spielberg directed epic, will be in theaters in December. Early next year, we're looking forward to our live action adventure film, John Carter, directed by Andrew Staton of Finding Nemo and WALL-E. And as I already mentioned, The Avengers will premiere in May. And opening in June, is the highly anticipated Disney-Pixar's Brave, featuring a spirited Scottish girl on a comic medieval adventure.  In November 2012, we will release Record Ralph, the Disney animation feature set in a multidimensional world of video games.
Turning to Cable Net, ESPN posted a record number of viewers for the fourth consecutive year. And remains the leading destination for sports. ESPN.com has captured 70% of fans on mobile sports sites and in September, ESPN.com set a record for its most unique users ever of 52 million. ESPN was able to grow its viewership and expand its content offerings to subscribers while showing discipline and acquiring sports rights. Our recently signed long-term agreements reached for the NFL, Pac-12 and Wimbledon ensure ESPN will continue to offer the broadest array of sports coverage for fans to access wherever they watch the sports.
In fiscal 2011, Disney Channel and ABC Family posted record viewership for their targeted audiences. Disney Channel is now #1 across broadcast and cable, among kids and tweens for total day and prime time. Our Phineas and Ferb TV Movie is the #1 scripted telecast on broadcast and cable for that demographic and the #1 scripted cable show in total viewers.  The Phineas and Ferb series and Movie are also delivering record viewership internationally, and a feature film is planned for release in 2013. Phineas and Ferb is well on its way to becoming a successful franchise for the company.
ABC Family had its fifth consecutive year of growth in this key demographic of 12 to 34 year-olds, up more than 9% in fiscal 2011. ABC Family was home to 3 of the top scripted shows on basic cable this summer, including Switched At Birth, which was the top-rated new cable show among millennial viewers.  At ABC Primetime, we're seeing some very promising signs. ABC has 2 of the top 3 new dramas among 18 to 49 -year-olds and the top 2 drama debuts in ABC owned Once Upon A Time and Revenge.
Our Wednesday night block is posting a second consecutive year of double-digit percentage growth among total viewers in adults 18 to 49, with the ongoing success of Modern Family, the new Strength of The Middle and encouraging results from the new shows Suborgatory. ABC's new hit dramas coupled with our comedy lineup will form the foundation for rebuilt and revitalized schedule in the coming seasons.
As we prepare to relaunch disney.com next fall, we're excited about the deal we recently announced to produce cobranded family-friendly video experiences for disney.com and YouTube that we believe will grow our brand presence online and drive new traffic. At our Game segment, we diversified our strategy and are seeing success with both social and mobile games. Where Is My Water reached the top of the paid apps chart for 3 weeks this fall and Gardens of Time was recently named top online social game by its industry peers. And we'll be launching several new Disney branded Facebook games incorporating Disney IP in 2012.
Lastly, all of our Movie and TV businesses supported by a strong global licensing group and a solid platform in the Disney stores. In addition to these businesses, consumer products is driving publishing business domestically and internationally. And is launching a number of titles for mobile devices and is creating a broad digital strategy.  
This was a great year financially and strategically for the company and we're very excited about 2012 with our upcoming film slate, momentum at ABC Primetime, continued growth at ESPN, the opening of multiple park attractions and the progress we're making to deliver profitability across our digital businesses.  Are confident our strategic focus on game content, innovative uses of technology and global brand and asset growth will position us to deliver long-term shareholder value.
And with that, I will turn it over to Jay Rasulo. Jay?"
191564,140502322,189938,"Walt Disney Co., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 10, 2011",2011-11-10,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our fourth quarter results topping off a very good year for the company. We reported record revenue, net income and earnings per share in fiscal 2011. I'm going to take a few minutes to dis",1646,"Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our fourth quarter results topping off a very good year for the company. We reported record revenue, net income and earnings per share in fiscal 2011. I'm going to take a few minutes to discuss the fourth quarter in more detail, and then highlight some specific fiscal 2012 items.
In Q4, Media Networks was the largest contributor to our performance, driven by growth in operating income at Cable Networks, more specifically, by growth at Worldwide Disney Channel and ESPN, and an increase in equity income. Growth at the Worldwide Disney Channel was the result of increased revenue from the sale of Disney Channel programming, higher affiliate revenue, and increased ad revenue internationally. At ESPN, higher affiliate and Advertising revenue were partially offset by higher programming costs associated with contractual rate increases for college football in the NFL.
Advertising revenue at ESPN was up 4% during the quarter, but up 7% adjusting for the impact of last year's Men's World Cup. This growth is on top of a 19% increase ESPN delivered in Q4 last year. And if you look at the full year, ESPN ad revenue grew 18% in fiscal 2011, and that's following a double digit increase in fiscal 2010. 
The growth in equity income resulted from an increase in any lifetime due to the absence of programming write-offs incurred last year.
During the quarter, ESPN signed a new long-term agreement with the NFL. This deal extends our Monday Night Football rights to the 2,021th season and provides us with 500 hours of incremental programming per year., which we began airing this season.  Extending our NFL partnership further strengthens our sports content portfolio, which continues to make ESPN the #1 destination for sport fans, as well as cable television's most valuable network.
At Broadcasting, Q4 operating income was higher as a result of lower programming write-offs, as well as higher ad revenue at the ABC Television Network. At our own TV stations, ad revenue was down 11%, but excluding political advertising and the recently sold Flint and Toledo stations, ad revenue was up low single digits.
At the ABC network, quarter to date scatter pricing is 25% above upfront levels. ESPN ad sales are pacing up single digits, and ABC Family ad sales are pacing up more than 10%. Given the strength of political spending last year, Q1 TV station ad sales are pacing down, excluding political, TV station ad sales are pacing up.
We are very pleased with our results at Parks and Resorts in the quarter. Operating income was up 33% as a result of higher guest spending at our domestic parks and higher passenger cruise days, partially offset by increased costs. Total segment margins for Q4 were up 220 basis points versus last year and domestic Parks and Resorts margins were up more than that.  For the full year, total segment margins were up 90 basis points.
For the quarter, domestic attendance was up 1% and per capita spending was up 9% on higher ticket prices, food and beverage and merchandise spending.
Average per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 9%, while occupancy was down 2 percentage points to 81%. The increase in per room spending was driven by higher pricing and a reduction of promotional room nights. These results reflect our strategy of continuing to increase pricing to normal levels.
So far this quarter, domestic hotel reservations are pacing in line with prior-year levels, while booked rates are up low single digits. I'll note from this point forward, current year domestic reservations will include all on a hotel rooms, the impact of which is de minimis in Q1 bookings.
Results at our International Resorts were higher due to increased attendance and guest spending at Hong Kong Disneyland and higher guest spending at Disneyland Paris. We are also encouraged by the pace of recovery at the Tokyo Disney Resort, where our royalties from Tokyo were modestly higher this quarter compared to prior year.
At Studio Entertainment, operating income was up for the quarter as the result of lower film cost write-downs and higher domestic theatrical revenues, despite lower results in our International, Theatrical and Worldwide Home Video businesses.  Domestic theatrical results were up in the quarter as a result of Cars 2 and the release of The Lion King 3D, as well as lower prerelease marketing expense compared to last year. Although Cars 2 performed well globally in the quarter, it faced a difficult international box office comparison with the incredibly successful Toy Story 3. Home Entertainment results were down due to lower unit sales of key titles domestically and lower catalog sales internationally. 
At Consumer Products, operating income was up for the quarter, driven by a higher licensing revenue due to sales of Cars merchandise and higher revenue from Marvel properties.  On a comparable basis, current licensing revenue was up 2%.
At Interactive Media segment, operating losses decreased from the prior year due to lower marketing and product development cost in our Console Game business, partially offset by lower result in our social games. Keep in mind social games reflect a full quarter of operations of Playdom compared to the prior year, which only included 1 month of operations. 
I'd now like to turn to fiscal 2012 and provide some color on a few of our businesses that should help with timing and comparability issues for the coming year.  In fiscal 2012, ESPN will once again air 4 BCS games and the Rose Bowl, all of which will take place during fiscal Q2. Last year, 2 of these games, the Rose and Fiesta Bowls, add during fiscal Q1. Our new ACC contract, which began in September of this year, will continue to impact comparisons in fiscal Q1 and Q2, which encompass most of the college football and basketball seasons. Our new exclusive coverage of Wimbledon will begin during the second half of the fiscal year, while our new contract with the Pac-12 conference will begin in fiscal Q4.
We remain hopeful that there will be a quick resolution to the NBA situation. However, our broad portfolio of rights will enable us to effectively program ESPN without the NBA. We have plans in place to replace the majority of live NBA programming hours with coverage of other sports, including college basketball, so the absence of the NBA will not affect our ability to achieve our full year programming commitments. Since many NBA advertisers want to reach male demos, we'll expect a good portion of NBA ad dollars will be reexpressed to other ESPN properties, including college basketball. We expect any reduction in our NBA-related revenue would be more than offset by a reduction in rights costs.
I'd also like to take a moment to address our affiliate contracts with multichannel operators, a subject we've been asked about many times in the past few months. We believe the strength of our cable networks and own television stations positions us well for a series of upcoming negotiations. Our recent agreements with Time Warner Cable and Verizon and Brighthouse Networks are long-term comprehensive and create value for both Disney and our partners. We expect these deals to serve as templates for upcoming negotiations.  Given the timing in our existing contracts, we expect to negotiate new agreements for our Cable Networks an owned TV stations, covering an incremental 75% of multichannel households by the end of calendar 2014.
Now let me turn to Parks and Resorts. The Disney Fantasy will launch at the very end of our fiscal Q2, and thus, the ship will not generate meaningful revenue during the second quarter.  This coming summer, we will open Cars Land, the cornerstone of our expansion at the Disney California Adventure. These projects are part of our continued investment in growth initiatives that we expect will contribute incremental operating income once they are fully ramped up. However, we expect in fiscal 2012 our growth initiatives will contribute $500 million in both incremental revenue and expense. Having said that, we still expect Parks and Resorts margins to expand during 2012.
At Interactive Media we expect the impact of purchase accounting from the Playdom acquisition to decrease from $110 million in fiscal 2011 to approximately $50 million in fiscal 2012, with the majority recognized in the first half of the year we expect consolidated CapEx to be approximately  $500 million higher than in fiscal year '11, with our work on the Shanghai Disney Resort being the largest driver of this increase.
We expect pension and postretirement medical expenses to increase by $50 million in fiscal 2012. If you recall, in May, we announced changes in our salary pension plan that will reduce our expense over the next 5 years by $350 million to $400 million or approximately $75 million per year versus our previous plan. We still expect to realize the savings in fiscal 2012. However, changes in other key assumptions, including a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate more than offset these savings in fiscal 2012.
We continue to increase the pace of our share repurchase -- continued to increase the pace of our share repurchase during the fourth quarter by buying back 58 million shares for about $2 billion, bringing our total share repurchase for fiscal year to 134.7 million shares or approximately $5 billion. During the first fiscal first quarter of our new fiscal year, we have repurchased 12.7 million shares for about $420 million.
2011 was a great year for our company. We delivered strong operating results, expanded operating margins, continued to invest in our core businesses and extended the reach of our brands outside of the U.S. We are very well-positioned to drive growth and returns for our shareholders in fiscal 2012 and in the years to come.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Lowell for questions."

Are they going to support the brand look at a volume are we talking about in terms of number of hours, what will the ratings be? Can we convert to advertising and how can we better serve our customers, which are both the multichannel distributors is and ultimately, end-users are the viewers been a positive example. There's no question that was an expensive deal. And as I was saying, using the word discipline, I was thinking about the cost to us of extending that deal. But what we saw when we did that was first of all, long-term deal that takes us to 2021. That's tremendous certainty. We know we have certainty in terms of the quality of the product and the games and the interest in those from our viewers and our distributors, and advertisers by the way. And we have the ability to program more than 500 more hours of NFL programming kind of annualized. So when we added all of that up and we look at the growth trajectory of those rights, we concluded that if there's anything that creates value for ESPN, it's NFL. So we apply similar logic, the college football and college basketball package we bought represent quality programming, huge local interest in those. You know if you've gone to a college that has a decent sports team, how loyal you tend to be as a viewer, that team, those teams. Again, long-term deals. And the other thing that we've got gained in a lot of these deals is multi-platform capabilities. So it grows, our customer engagement. And that's a big deal. The growth of ESPN.com, which I cited in my earnings comments, the use of smart mobile devices, in some cases, international rights, these are all very, very valuable. Those sports that we did not get interestingly enough, the World Cup and the Olympics there's no question. They're high-quality. They don't occur every year, they occur for a short period of time and we don't believe that we could justify the kind of rights that ultimately others pay for it because it didn't really meet the standards, based on the cost of those rights we're going to amount to, to us that we've adhered to for these other packages."

On the booking window, we, something we watch pretty carefully, I told you 2 quarters ago that these a little elongation of that from 13 weeks to 14 weeks. This quarter, it remained pretty steady at about that 14 weeks between when the rooms are booked or when the vacation is booked or when the guest show up. So not a lot of movement there in this quarter. The fourth question happen to be you had about international visitation, the fourth quarter happened to be a particularly strong quarter for international visitation. I'm told you about 4 many quarters are many years. For our business as a whole, we're looking around 20% of our business, a lot of that driven at Walt Disney World. Walt Disney World was at the high end of the range that we see between 17, 18 and 22, 23. Walt Disney World really over performed in the quarter internationally. And it made the year sort of fall pretty solidly in that 18 to 22 range. So surprisingly, to some extent, as was implied in your question, but we are still seeing very strong international attendance."

You've seen a slight slowdown from the U.K. this quarter, but by and large, overall our international attendance this quarter is up just under 10% from a year ago. Now we're are also being held by growth in attendance from Asia and from Brazil so there's a good kind of global balance and while we're certainly watching what's going on in Europe very carefully, the fact of the matter is that there are other markets that have grown nicely. And that's obviously a good thing for us. On the scatter side, I want to reiterate the fact that advertising for us is about 19% of our total revenue. It doesn't mean it's unimportant, but I just want to put it in perspective. On the ABC front, scatter pricing has been very strong this quarter. I think Jay mentioned in the mid-20% range, 26% over the upfront. But it ahs slowed slightly these last few weeks. That said, the option picks up for the year February and March are running suddenly above where we thought we would be, and we may look at the mix of inventory that we have left, including in some very appealing new programs that I mentioned once upon a time is a very to name a few we feel good about the inventory that we have left and our demographics are strong. We've been quite strong in women 18 to 49 as a for instance. So I'd say a little slowing in the last few weeks, up nicely over the upfront this quarter, and it will wait and see. ESPN front, they have difficult comps from a year ago as was the case in the quarter that we just announced. They ended up, up 18% for the year, which is a tremendous number. They have got great product to sell. They have a male demographic that's clearly in demand, and we also wrote a lot of business in the upfront. Scatter becomes less of an issue for them."

Obviously the strategic rarities that I should live back in '05 when I got the job remain very much in place, starts with making good product. Interestingly enough, that's even more interesting and more compelling today that was back then because the world is offering us even more opportunities to leverage great product. Either because of new technology or a compelling growth in emerging markets. And that's the real value proposition for us. I want nothing more for this company event in a great product and I'd say if I had to go my mind over the remainder of my tenure, which is as brief as they as I think it will suggest, it's improve the quality of our output. Technology is a huge, huge strategic parity for us. I talk about it when I talk about content. Let's use it to distribute more effectively into monetize better. It should also be used to make our product better as well. And we certainly see that when it comes to filmed entertainment, but obviously, that our theme parks. On the international front, we announced 3 big deals disaster, you've heard in my remarks in China, India and Russia. It is imperative for those companies to plant a number of seeds in the emerging world when you look at the remainder of this decade or the next decade, growth from emerging markets is going to outpace growth in the developed world and that's the first time that's happened in 200 years. So that's very important. Sticking to our knitting and doing more of it."

You have to remember though that in those 5 years, and the capital projects that enterprise value the ground, which each have their own growth strategy, each is filling in different parts of the portfolio. When they are back on board, they all need sort of ongoing FF&E maintenance capital to keep them going. So I would say that that 1 building number is low, but certainly, we've been pretty clear about the level is we're spending in fiscal '11 and '12 being at the other end of the spectrum, being very high to cause of the addition of the 2 cruise ships, the Aulani Hotel, the work we're doing at DCA, all the work we're doing at Walt Disney World, has really kind of created a bubble for us that is not our long-term plan. I think that you will hear about longer-term projects, Shanghai, we talked a little bit about as a contributor to 2012 capital expenditures. And that will sort of ramp up over time. Remember that only 43% of that capital is ours. So even though it's a big contributor Chinese government contributes 57% of that and we back that cash out of a financing lower financing line in our P&L. So I can't give you exact specificity on our ongoing capital level, but let's say it will be higher than $1 billion but much lower than the $2.5 million to $3 million we've been at."

That's certainly coming true with yields like the one we mentioned for Netflix and Amazon that we're conversations that with having with a variety of entities, the number of apps that have been downloaded, the use of ESPN.com, the over 230 million lines on Facebook, the YouTube deal, you name it. It's a very interesting time for content owners, and there is a growing list of platforms that are eager to enter into deals for us to enable them to redistribute our content to support their investment in their technology platform. And I think we're only seeing the beginning of the beginning of that. I'd say if anything that I think is profound or interesting is that how well some of the traditional media platforms have held up.  Five years ago, we would've been talking about just how devastating the impact of the DVR would have been on the Advertising business. So we're finding that with roughly 42% penetration of DVRs in the United States, and people who have DVRs watching substantially more TV that the actual increase in ratings and DVR households is pretty interesting, and now that we can sell on a C3 basis, maybe ultimately, we'll be able to sell even on a C7 basis, that's all monetizable. It's not all detrimental to our business model. If anything, you can argue it's actually enhancing it."

We like our year ahead beginning with The Muppets, which has a huge amount of momentum right now. And obviously, The Avengers will factor in big-time for us as a franchise for the company, as a real new Marvel tempo. I know we got a good picture title in Brave and John Carter, which should be a big Movie for us in March. We've done a good job at the Studio of continuing to be very vigilant about the cost structure of that business, particularly as things change in that business. I don't believe that we're necessarily at the end in that regard. We'll continue to monitor that business very carefully. We're trying to bring some production cost down, but we're doing so in part by basically balancing the mix of the movies that we have, making a few tempo films and investing aggressively in those, Avengers is a good example of that; I mentioned Pirates earlier. But also making movies that are substantially lower in cost. The Muppets is actually a good example of that. It's a movie that's going to cost less than $50 million to produce. And I like the balance. In terms of the Lion King and whether we can turn to the library to continue to drive profitability, I mentioned in my remarks, we've named 4 titles that we're bringing out in similar forum, Beauty and the Beast, Little Mermaid, Nemo and Monsters. They're all different circumstances than Lion King was. Lion King had never been released on Blu-ray, for instance, and was a 17-year-old title and was a movie that appealed to just about all demographics. I think the films that we're bringing out are extremely appealing films as well. I'm not sure anyone of them is exactly a Lion King in terms of the circumstances. But we think they'll all enhance the bottom line in a couple of cases enhance basically the brands Disney and Pixar."

By the way reduced slightly, essentially it means is due to the fact that we simply built more value. And I actually believe if you look at the last 10 years, that's proved to be a great strategy because we made our product far more accessible to more people. And it has enabled us to not only grow attendance, but take market share, grow market share, which was obviously very important because as we move people from all property, value-priced hotels on property value priced hotels, we captured a much greater percentage of their vacation spend namely in food and merchandise, and obviously on the hotel side. We are actually going to be opening another very large value-priced hotel, but we're also developing a luxury-priced hotel in the Four Seasons that's relatively modest in size and it's going to open, I think, in 3 years. I actually think that our strategy has worked very well. We look at our bookings on the luxury side and we obviously feel good about that. But we've driven a huge amount of traffic in the value direction. And I think that has really serve as well."

In fact, we believe that there is demand for the categories that are strong advertisers on ESPN, and whether or not be NBA is being broadcast on ESPN and obviously, broadcast elsewhere. Those dollars are going to continue to seek that same male demographic that is going to find its way to sports. And the most logical place for them to find their way will be, probably not shockingly to college basketball as a substitute, and whatever else we have in our huge portfolio of live sporting events that can be broadcast in those NBA game slots. So we expect that those advertising dollars will actually -- the decrease will actually be quite de minimis. But moreover, they will -- if there is some loss, we think that, that loss will be more than offset with not recognizing the rights fees for the NBA for that season. By the way, on balance we'd still prefer to have the NBA season and carry through with our original plan of programming those games. But I do not believe that it will affect us to the negative financially if the season in fact does not end up happening. And in terms of future, I can't imagine, I don't think it's ever good for a sports league to find themselves in this situation. But I think the same argument holds for future years that we have a lock on this demographic with advertisers. They love to advertise on ESPN. We deliver the ratings, our portfolio is incredibly strong, broadly and no reason to believe that we would see a long-term impact of this particular season of the NBA being locked out.

We're proud to report Disney posted record revenue, net income and earnings per share for the 2011 fiscal year. Our net income grew by 21% over a year ago on a 7% increase in revenue, and our earnings per share adjusted for comparability were up 23% for the year. I'm also very pleased with our fourth quarter results, which were driven by Media Networks and Parks and Resorts, with net income up 30% and revenue up 7%.  Our EPS for the quarter, adjusted for comparability, grew 31% to $0.59.
Our fiscal 2011 results validate our strategic priorities and demonstrate we can grow our earnings in the near term while continuing to invest for long-term shareholder value. Given the challenging economic environment this year, I'm particularly proud of our excellent management team, which has consistently delivered on our strategy, creating high-quality content, expanding our platforms and growing our iconic brands and assets worldwide. Disney's collection of strong brands is unparalleled in the media and entertainment space in the U.S. And in 2011, we made significant progress in expanding our footprint in 3 large rapidly developing markets, Russia, China and India. 
Less than 2 weeks ago, we announced the launch of a free-to-air Disney Channel in Russia that will reach 40 million households and 75% of the country's viewers with signature Disney programming and original Russian content. With a portfolio of 100 Disney Channels around the world, up from 19 a decade ago, Disney Channel serves as an anchor for our growth and is a preeminent brand builder. We're extremely excited about this opportunity in Russia.
In China, work has begun on Shanghai Disney Resort, a 963-acre site that will include Shanghai Disneyland, 2 themed hotels and a large retail dining and entertainment venue. The Shanghai Resort is a key component of our growth strategy in China.
And in India, we are in the process of acquiring the 50% equity that we don't own in UTV, one of the country's premier media and entertainment companies. Combined with UTV, we will be the leading film studio, producing both UTV and Disney-branded films, and we'll increase the number of cable and satellite channels we own from 3 to 9. The combined UTV and Disney assets will allow us to significantly grow our businesses in India.
We've made significant investments in Parks and Resorts in the last 5 years and many are coming online. Toy Story Playland just opened a great guest reaction in Paris, and we're excited about its opening in Hong Kong next week. Next year, the highly anticipated Cars Land at Disney's California Adventure and Little Mermaid at Disney World's expanded Fantasyland will be completed. Following the success of the Disney Dream earlier this year, we will launch the Disney Fantasy in Spring 2012 and our Imagineers and James Cameron are already at work on the design of our first Avatar-themed land at Walt Disney World's Animal Kingdom.
Our long-term investments in Parks and Resorts are aimed at strong returns on capital as well as strengthening and growing our product in markets we already operate in and expanding our presence globally.
Nothing illustrates our ability to create enduring quality family entertainment better than the rerelease of the Lion king in 3D. Nearly 20 years after its original premiere, it has grossed about $150 million in box office worldwide and was the #1 selling Blu-ray Disc its first week of release. Over the next 2 years, we will release 4 additional award-winning animated films in 3D, beauty and the Beast, Little Mermaid, Monsters, Inc. and Finding Nemo, and introduce a whole new generation of families to these hallmark theatrical events.
In fiscal 2011, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, the fourth film in our extremely successful franchise, earned more than $1 billion in global box office, 1 of only 10 films to have done so. And we're in early development for another Pirates sequel.
Cars continues to be a great franchise for us and an addition to grossing $559 million in global box office. Cars 2 continues to drive very strong performance in our Consumer Product business, which we expect to continue into the holiday season. It has surpassed both Star Wars and Toy Story in retail sales of movie theme merchandise.
Marvel's Thor and Captain America were among the top 10 non-sequel releases of the year and we are pleased with the performance of both films and the true benefits of our Marvel acquisition should be quite visible in 2012. First, in May, Thor and Captain America will join Iron Man, The Hulk and Black Widow in Marvel's The Avengers, the first Marvel film to be marketed and distributed by Disney. The Avengers shows great promise with a record 10 million downloads on iTunes when the trailer debuted, and it is well on its way to being our next great franchise. Then in July, Sony Pictures will release The Amazing Spiderman. We're excited about the film and expect it will drive significant benefits for Spiderman consumer products. 
To that end, we recently completed a transaction with Sony Pictures to simplify our relationship. And then in the deal, we purchased Sony Pictures' participation in Spiderman merchandising, while at the same time, Sony Pictures purchased from us our participation in Spiderman films. This transaction will allow us to control and fully benefit from all Spiderman merchandising activity, while Sony will continue to produce and distribute Spiderman films. We won't be specific about the economics of this 2-way transaction, but we expect it will drive attractive returns for Disney.
Our upcoming slate of films is rich in variety and potential. On Thanksgiving weekend, The Muppets will hit theaters in what we believe will rebuild another beloved franchise. Dreamworks' War Horse, a Steven Spielberg directed epic, will be in theaters in December. Early next year, we're looking forward to our live action adventure film, John Carter, directed by Andrew Stanton of Finding Nemo and WALL-E. And as I already mentioned, The Avengers will premiere in May. And opening in June is the highly anticipated Disney-Pixar's Brave, featuring a spirited Scottish girl on a comic medieval adventure. In November 2012, we will release Wreck-It Ralph, the Disney animation feature set in a multidimensional world of video games.
Turning to Cable Net, ESPN posted a record number of viewers for the fourth consecutive year and remains the leading destination for sports. ESPN.com has captured 70% of fans on mobile sports sites, and in September, ESPN.com set a record for its most unique users ever of 52 million. ESPN was able to grow its viewership and expand its content offerings to subscribers while showing discipline and acquiring sports rights. Our recently signed long-term agreements reached for the NFL, Pac-12 and Wimbledon ensure ESPN will continue to offer the broadest array of sports coverage for fans to access wherever they watch sports.
In fiscal 2011, Disney Channel and ABC Family posted record viewership for their targeted audiences. Disney Channel is now #1 across broadcast and cable, among kids and tweens for total day and prime time. Our Phineas and Ferb TV Movie is the #1 scripted telecast on broadcast and cable for that demographic and the #1 scripted cable show in total viewers. The Phineas and Ferb series and movie are also delivering record viewership internationally, and a feature film is planned for release in 2013. Phineas and Ferb is well on its way to becoming a successful franchise for the company.
ABC Family had its fifth consecutive year of growth in this key demographic of 12 to 34 year-olds, up more than 9% in fiscal 2011. ABC Family was home to 3 of the top scripted shows on basic cable this summer, including Switched At Birth, which was the top-rated new cable show among millennial viewers.  At ABC Primetime, we're seeing some very promising signs. ABC has 2 of the top 3 new dramas among 18 to 49 year-olds and the top 2 drama debuts with ABC owned Once Upon A Time and Revenge.
Our Wednesday night block is posting its second consecutive year of double-digit percentage growth among total viewers in adults 18 to 49 with the ongoing success of Modern Family, the new Strength of The Middle and encouraging results from the new show, Suburgatory. ABC's new hit dramas coupled with our comedy lineup will form the foundation for rebuilt and revitalized schedule in the coming seasons.
As we prepare to relaunch disney.com next fall, we're excited about the deal we recently announced to produce co-branded family-friendly video experiences for disney.com and YouTube that we believe will grow our brand presence online and drive new traffic. In our Game segment, we've diversified our strategy and are seeing success with both social and mobile games. Where's My Water? reached the top of the paid apps chart for 3 weeks this fall and Gardens of Time was recently named top online social game by its industry peers. And we'll be launching several new Disney-branded Facebook games incorporating Disney IP in 2012.
Lastly, all of our Movie and TV businesses is supported by a strong global licensing group in a solid platform in the Disney stores. In addition to these businesses, consumer products is a driving publishing business domestically and internationally and is launching a number of titles for mobile devices and is creating a broad digital strategy.  
This was a great year financially and strategically for the company, and we're very excited about 2012 with our upcoming film slate, momentum at ABC Primetime, continued growth at ESPN, the opening of multiple park attractions and the progress we're making to deliver profitability across our digital businesses. We're confident our strategic focus on game content, innovative uses of technology and global brand and asset growth will position us to deliver long-term shareholder value.
And with that, I will turn it over to Jay Rasulo. Jay?"
191564,140502322,190069,"Walt Disney Co., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 10, 2011",2011-11-10,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our fourth quarter results topping off a very good year for the company. We reported record revenue, net income and earnings per share in fiscal 2011. I'm going to take a few minutes to dis",1651,"Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our fourth quarter results topping off a very good year for the company. We reported record revenue, net income and earnings per share in fiscal 2011. I'm going to take a few minutes to discuss the fourth quarter in more detail and then highlight some specific fiscal 2012 items.
In Q4, Media Networks was the largest contributor to our performance, driven by growth in operating income at Cable Networks, more specifically by growth at Worldwide Disney Channel and ESPN and an increase in equity income. Growth at the Worldwide Disney Channel was the result of increased revenue from the sale of Disney Channel programming, higher affiliate revenue and increased ad revenue internationally. At ESPN, higher affiliate and advertising revenue were partially offset by higher programming costs associated with contractual rate increases for college football in the NFL.
Advertising revenue at ESPN was up 4% during the quarter but up 7% adjusting for the impact of last year's Men's World Cup. This growth is on top of a 19% increase ESPN delivered in Q4 last year. And if you look at the full year, ESPN ad revenue grew 18% in fiscal 2011, and that's following a double-digit increase in fiscal 2010. The growth in equity income resulted from an increase at A&E Lifetime due to the absence of programming write-offs incurred last year.
During the quarter, ESPN signed a new long-term agreement with the NFL. This deal extends our Monday Night Football rights to the 2,201 season and provides us with 500 hours of incremental programming per year, which we began airing this season.  Extending our NFL partnership further strengthens our sports content portfolio, which continues to make ESPN the #1 destination for sports fans as well as cable television's most valuable network.
At Broadcasting, Q4 operating income was higher as a result of lower programming write-offs as well as higher ad revenue at the ABC Television Network. At our own TV stations, ad revenue was down 11%, but excluding political advertising and the recently sold, Flint and Toledo stations, ad revenue was up low single digits.
At the ABC Network, quarter-to-date scatter pricing is 25% above upfront levels. ESPN ad sales are pacing up single digits, and ABC Family ad sales are pacing up more than 10%. Given the strength of political spending last year, Q1 TV station ad sales are pacing down. Excluding political, TV station ad sales are pacing up.
We are very pleased with our results at Parks and Resorts in the quarter. Operating income was up 33% as a result of higher guest spending at our domestic parks and higher passenger cruise days, partially offset by increased costs. Total segment margins for Q4 were up 220 basis points versus last year and domestic Parks and Resorts margins were up more than that. For the full year, total segment margins were up 90 basis points. For the quarter, domestic attendance was up 1% and per capita spending was up 9% on higher ticket prices, food and beverage and merchandise spending.
Average per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 9%, while occupancy was down 2 percentage points to 81%. The increase in per room spending was driven by higher pricing and a reduction of promotional room nights. These results reflect our strategy of continuing to increase pricing to normal levels.
So far this quarter, domestic hotel reservations are pacing in line with prior year levels, while book rates are up low single digits. I'll note from this point forward, current year domestic reservations will include Aulani hotel rooms, the impact of which is de minimis in Q1 bookings.
Results at our international resorts were higher due to increased attendance and guest spending at Hong Kong Disneyland and higher guest spending at Disneyland Paris. We are also encouraged by the pace of recovery at the Tokyo Disney Resort, where our royalties from Tokyo were modestly higher this quarter compared to prior year.
At Studio Entertainment, operating income was up for the quarter as a result of lower film cost write-downs and higher domestic theatrical revenues despite lower results in our International, Theatrical and Worldwide Home Video businesses. Domestic theatrical results were up in the quarter as a result of Cars 2 and the release of The Lion King 3D as well as lower prerelease marketing expense compared to last year. Although Cars 2 performed well globally in the quarter, it faced a difficult international box office comparison with the incredibly successful Toy Story 3. Home Entertainment results were down due to lower unit sales of key titles domestically and lower catalog sales internationally. 
At Consumer Products, operating income was up for the quarter, driven by a higher licensing revenue due to sales of Cars merchandise and higher revenue from Marvel properties. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue was up 2%.
At the Interactive Media segment, operating losses decreased from the prior year due to lower marketing and product development costs in our Console Game business, partially offset by lower results in our social games. Keep in mind that results -- social games reflect a full quarter of operations of Playdom compared to the prior year, which only included 1 month of operations. 
I'd now like to turn to fiscal 2012 and provide some color on a few of our businesses that should help with timing and comparability issues for the coming year.  In fiscal 2012, ESPN will once again air 4 BCS games and the Rose Bowl, all of which will take place during fiscal Q2. Last year, 2 of these games, the Rose and Fiesta Bowls, add during fiscal Q1. Our new ACC contract, which began in September of this year, will continue to impact comparisons in fiscal Q1 and Q2, which encompass most of the college football and basketball seasons. Our new exclusive coverage of Wimbledon will begin during the second half of the fiscal year, while our new contract with the Pac-12 conference will begin in fiscal Q4.
We remain hopeful that there will be a quick resolution to the NBA situation. However, our broad portfolio of rights will enable us to effectively program ESPN without the NBA. We have plans in place to replace the majority of live NBA programming hours with coverage of other sports, including college basketball, so the absence of the NBA will not affect our ability to achieve our full year programming commitments. Since many NBA advertisers want to reach male demos, we'll expect a good portion of NBA ad dollars will be reexpressed to other ESPN properties, including college basketball. We expect any reduction in our NBA-related revenue would be more than offset by a reduction in rights costs.
I'd also like to take a moment to address our affiliate contracts with multichannel operators, a subject we've been asked about many times in the past few months. We believe the strength of our cable networks and own television stations positions us well for a series of upcoming negotiations. Our recent agreements with Time Warner Cable, Verizon and Bright House Networks are long-term comprehensive and create value for both Disney and our partners. We expect these deals to serve as templates for upcoming negotiations. Given the timing in our existing contracts, we expect to negotiate new agreements for our Cable Networks and owned TV stations, covering an incremental 75% of multichannel households by the end of calendar 2014.
Now let me turn to Parks and Resorts. The Disney Fantasy will launch at the very end of our fiscal Q2, and thus, the ship will not generate meaningful revenue during the second quarter. This coming summer, we will open Cars Land, the corner of our -- cornerstone of our expansion at the Disney California Adventure. These projects are part of our continued investment in growth initiatives that we expect will contribute incremental operating income once they are fully ramped up. However, we expect in fiscal 2012 our growth initiatives will contribute $500 million in both incremental revenue and expense. Having said that, we still expect Parks and Resorts margins to expand during 2012.
At Interactive Media, we expect the impact of purchase accounting from the Playdom acquisition to decrease from $110 million in fiscal 2011 to approximately $50 million in fiscal 2012 with the majority recognized in the first half of the year. We expect consolidated CapEx to be approximately $500 million higher than in fiscal year '11 with our work on the Shanghai Disney Resort being the largest driver of this increase.
We expect pension and postretirement medical expenses to increase by $50 million in fiscal 2012. If you recall, in May, we announced changes in our salary pension plan that will reduce our expense over the next 5 years by $350 million to $400 million or approximately $75 million per year versus our previous plan. We still expect to realize these savings in fiscal 2012. However, changes in other key assumptions, including a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate, more than offset these savings in fiscal 2012.
We continue to increase the pace of our share repurchase -- continued to increase the pace of our share repurchase during the fourth quarter by buying back 58 million shares for about $2 billion, bringing our total share repurchase for fiscal year to 134.7 million shares or approximately $5 billion. During the first fiscal -- first quarter of our new fiscal year, we have repurchased 12.7 million shares for about $420 million.
2011 was a great year for our company. We delivered strong operating results, expanded operating margins, continued to invest in our core businesses and extended the reach of our brands outside of the U.S. We are very well-positioned to drive growth and returns for our shareholders in fiscal 2012 and in the years to come.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Lowell for questions."

The NFL is a good example. There's no question that was an expensive deal. And as I was saying, using the word discipline, I was thinking about the cost of -- to us of extending that deal. But what we saw when we did that was, first of all, long-term deal that takes us to 2021. That's tremendous certainty. We know we have certainty in terms of quality of the product and the games and the interest in those from our viewers and our distributors and advertisers, by the way. And we have the ability to program more than 500 more hours of NFL programming kind of annualized. So when we added all of that up and we looked at the growth trajectory of those rights piece, we concluded that if there's anything that creates value for ESPN, it's the NFL. And so we apply similar logic, the college football and college basketball package that we bought represent quality programming, huge local interest in those. You know if you've gone to a college that has a decent sports team how loyal you tend to be as a viewer, that team, those teams, again, long-term deals. And the other thing that we've got gained in a lot of these deals is multi-platform capabilities. So it grows our customer engagement, and that's a big deal. The growth of ESPN.com, which I cited in my earnings comments, the use of smart mobile devices, in some cases, international rights, these are all very, very valuable. Those that we -- those sports that we did not get interestingly enough, the World Cup and the Olympics, while there's no question, they're high-quality. They don't occur every year. They occur for a short period of time. And we didn't believe that we could justify the kind of rights that ultimately others pay for it because it didn't really meet the standards based on the cost those rights were going to amount to us that we've adhered to for these other packages."

This quarter, it remained pretty steady at about that 14 weeks between when the rooms are booked or when the vacation is booked and when the guests show up. So not a lot of movement there in this quarter. On the other question you had about international visitation, the fourth quarter happened to be a particularly strong quarter for international visitation. I have told you that for many quarters or many years. For our business as a whole, we're looking around 20% of our business, a lot of that driven at Walt Disney World. Walt Disney World was at the high end of the range that we see between 17%, 18% and 22%, 23%. Walt Disney World really over-performed in the quarter internationally. And it made the year sort of fall pretty solidly in that 20% -- 18% to 22% range.

We've seen a slight slowdown from the U.K. this quarter. But by and large, overall, our international attendance this quarter is up, I think, just under 10% from a year ago. Now we're are also being helped by growth in attendance from Asia and from Brazil, so there's a good kind of global balance. And while we're certainly watching what's going on in Europe very carefully, the fact of the matter is that there are other markets that have grown nicely, and that's obviously a good thing for us. On the scatter side, I want to reiterate the fact that advertising for us was about 19% of our total revenue. It doesn't mean it's unimportant, but I just want to put it in perspective. On the ABC front, scatter pricing has been very strong this quarter, I think Jay mentioned in the mid-20% range, 26% over the upfront. But it has slowed slightly these last few weeks. That said, the option tick ups for January, February and March are running slightly above where we thought we would be, and when we look at the mix of inventory that we have left, including in some very appealing new programs that I mentioned, Once Upon a Time, Suburgatory and Revenge name a few, we feel good about the inventory that we have left and our demographics are strong. We've been quite strong in women 18 to 49 as for instance. So I'd say a little slowing in the last few weeks, up nicely over the upfront this quarter, and we'll wait and see. On the ESPN front, they have difficult comps from a year ago as was the case in the quarter that we just announced. They ended up up 18% for the year, which is a tremendous number. They have got a great product to sell. They have a male demographic that's clearly in demand, and they also wrote a lot of business in the upfront. Scatter becomes less of an issue for them."

Interestingly enough, that's even more interesting and more compelling today than it was back then because the world is offering us even more opportunities to leverage great product, either because of new technology or compelling growth in emerging markets. And that's the real value proposition for us. I want nothing more for this company than to make great product. And I'd say if I had to go and mind over the remainder of my tenure, which isn't as brief as, I think, people suggests, it's to improve the quality of our output. Technology is a huge, huge strategic priority for us. I talked about it when I talk about content. Let's use it to distribute more effectively and to monetize better. It should also be used to make our product better as well. And we certainly see that when it comes to filmed entertainment, but obviously, in our theme parks. And then on the international front, we announced 3 big deals this past year. They're in my remarks, in China, India and Russia. It is imperative for those company to plant a number of seeds in the emerging world. When you look at the -- into the remainder of this decade or the next decade, growth from emerging markets is going to outpace growth in the developed world, and that's the first time that's happened in 200 years.

But in general, we see our guests behaving pretty much as they have in the past. And as you can see in aggregate, their spending is increasing at a pretty heavy level. If you look -- step back and look at the overall mix, I would say that our Group business, while it has made leaps and bounds, grow back since the downturn. It's still only about 90% of where it was before we came into the downturn. I think there's a little more opportunity for us there because it's very strong countercyclical programming for us.

And this is one that we -- I get asked often, and I'll try to give you some perspective on it. Five years ago or so, we used to be pretty demonstrative about $1 billion number being sort of a -- an ongoing level without special projects added to it. You have to remember, though, that in those 5 years, in the capital projects that we've put in the ground, which each have their own growth strategy, each is filling in different parts of the portfolio, when they're back on board, they all need sort of ongoing FF&E and maintenance capital to keep them going. So I would say that that that billion dollar number is low. But certainly, we've been pretty clear about the levels we're spending in fiscal '11 and '12 being at the other end of the spectrum, being very high because of the addition of the 2 cruise ships, the Aulani Hotel, the work we're doing at DCA, all the work we're doing at Walt Disney World has really kind of created a bubble for us that is not our long-term plan. I think that you will hear about longer-term projects, Shanghai. We talked a little bit about as a contributor to 2012 capital expenditures, and that will sort of ramp up over time. Remember that only 43% of that capital is ours. So even though it's a big contributor, the Chinese government contributes 57% of that and we back that cash out of a financing -- a lower financing line in our P&L. So I can't give you exact specificity on our ongoing capital level, but let's say it will be higher than $1 billion but much lower than the $2.5 million to $3 million we've been at."

That's certainly coming true with yields like the one we mentioned for Netflix and Amazon and the conversations that we're having with a variety of entities, the number of apps that have been downloaded, the use of ESPN.com, the over 230 million likes on Facebook, the YouTube deal, you name it. It's a very interesting time for content owners, and there is a growing list of platforms that are eager to enter into deals for us to enable them to redistribute our content to support their investment in their technology platform. And I think we're only seeing the beginning of the beginning of that. I'd say if anything that I think is profound or interesting is that -- is how well some of the traditional media platforms have held up. Five years ago, we would've been talking about just how devastating the impact of the DVR would have been on the Advertising business. So we're finding that with roughly 42% penetration of DVRs in the United States and people who have DVRs watching substantially more TV, that the actual increase in ratings and DVR households is pretty interesting. And now that we can sell on a C3 basis, maybe ultimately, we'll be able to sell even on a C7 basis. That's all monetizable. It's not all detrimental to our business model.

And obviously, The Avengers will factor in big time for us as a franchise for the company and as a real new Marvel tempo. I know we got a good Pixar title in Brave and John Carter, which should be a big movie for us in March. We've done a good job at the studio of continuing to be vigilant about the cost structure of that business, particularly as things change in that business. I don't believe that we're necessarily at the end in that regard. We'll continue to monitor that business very carefully. We're trying to bring some production costs down, but we're doing so in part by basically balancing the mix of the movies that we have, making a few tempo films and investing aggressively in those, The Avengers is a good example of that, I mentioned Pirates earlier, but also making movies that are substantially lower in cost. The Muppets is actually a good example of that. It's a movie that's going to cost less than $50 million to produce, and I like the balance. In terms of the Lion King and whether we can turn to the library to continue to drive profitability, I mentioned in my remarks, we've named 4 titles that we're bringing out in similar form, Beauty and the Beast, Little Mermaid, Nemo and Monsters. They're all different circumstances than the Lion King was. Lion King had never been released on Blu-ray, for instance, and it was a 17-year-old title and was a movie that appealed to just about all demographics. I think the films that we're bringing out are extremely appealing films as well.

The sale of shows to Netflix, which were primarily Disney Channel shows, I think, is only one of several drivers of what our operating income was in the quarter. So while it's nice revenue, it's still relatively modest when compared with the revenue that we derive from subscription fees and advertising. The broadcast side, I think what you're seeing is you're seeing a new form of syndication popping up that didn't exist a few years ago, and that's obviously a good thing. And by the way, I really do think we're at the beginning of the beginning. You're going to see a lot more entrants into the marketplace or varying forms of SVOD or Internet-provided or mobile device provided filmed entertainment.

Interestingly enough, in 10 years ago, it was about 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, so we've grown in the value segment, we reduced slightly in the deluxe. By the way, reduced slightly, essentially, it means it's due to the fact that we simply built more value. And I actually believe, if you look at the last 10 years, that's proved to be a great strategy because we made our product far more accessible to more people. And it has enabled us to not only grow attendance but take market share, grow market share, which was obviously very important, because as we move people from off-property, value-priced hotels to on-property value-priced hotels, we captured a much greater percentage of their vacation spend namely in food and merchandise and obviously on the hotel side. We are actually going to be opening another very large value-priced hotel, but we're also developing a luxury-priced hotel. And the Four Seasons, that's relatively modest in size and it's going to open, I think, in 3 years. I actually think that our strategy has worked very well.

In fact, we believe that there is demand for the categories that are strong advertisers on ESPN and whether or not the NBA is being broadcast on ESPN and, obviously, broadcast elsewhere. Those dollars are going to continue to seek that same male demographic that is going to find its way to sports. And the most logical place for them to find their way will be probably not shockingly to college basketball as a substitute and whatever else we have in our huge portfolio of live sporting events that can be broadcast in those NBA game slots. So we expect that those advertising dollars will actually -- the decrease will actually be quite de minimis. But moreover, they will -- if there is some loss, we think that that loss will be more than offset with not recognizing the rights fees for the NBA for that season. We, by the way, on balance would still prefer to have the NBA season and carry through with our original plan of programming those games. But I do not believe that it will affect us to the negative financially if the season, in fact, does not end up happening. And in terms of future, I can't imagine. I don't think it's ever good for a sports league to find themselves in this situation, but I think the same argument holds for future years that we have a lock on this demographic with advertisers. They love to advertise on ESPN. We deliver the ratings, our portfolio is incredibly strong broadly and no reason to believe that we would see a long-term impact of this particular season of the NBA being locked out.

Our net income grew by 21% over a year ago on a 7% increase in revenue, and our earnings per share adjusted for comparability were up 23% for the year. I'm also very pleased with our fourth quarter results, which were driven by Media Networks and Parks and Resorts, with net income up 30% and revenue up 7%.  Our EPS for the quarter, adjusted for comparability, grew 31% to $0.59.
Our fiscal 2011 results validate our strategic priorities and demonstrate we can grow our earnings in the near term while continuing to invest for long-term shareholder value. Given the challenging economic environment this year, I'm particularly proud of our excellent management team, which has consistently delivered on our strategy, creating high-quality content, expanding our platforms and growing our iconic brands and assets worldwide. Disney's collection of strong brands is unparalleled in the media and entertainment space in the U.S. And in 2011, we made significant progress in expanding our footprint in 3 large rapidly developing markets, Russia, China and India. 
Less than 2 weeks ago, we announced the launch of a free-to-air Disney Channel in Russia that will reach 40 million households and 75% of the country's viewers with signature Disney programming and original Russian content. With a portfolio of 100 Disney Channels around the world, up from 19 a decade ago, Disney Channel serves as an anchor for our growth and is a preeminent brand builder. We're extremely excited about this opportunity in Russia.
In China, work has begun on Shanghai Disney Resort, a 963-acre site that will include Shanghai Disneyland, 2 themed hotels and a large retail dining and entertainment venue. The Shanghai Resort is a key component of our growth strategy in China.
And in India, we are in the process of acquiring the 50% equity that we don't own in UTV, one of the country's premier media and entertainment companies. Combined with UTV, we will be the leading film studio, producing both UTV and Disney-branded films, and we'll increase the number of cable and satellite channels we own from 3 to 9. The combined UTV and Disney assets will allow us to significantly grow our businesses in India.
We've made significant investments in Parks and Resorts in the last 5 years and many are coming online. Toy Story Playland just opened a great guest reaction in Paris, and we're excited about its opening in Hong Kong next week. Next year, the highly anticipated Cars Land at Disney's California Adventure and Little Mermaid at Disney World's expanded Fantasyland will be completed. Following the success of the Disney Dream earlier this year, we will launch the Disney Fantasy in Spring 2012 and our Imagineers and James Cameron are already at work on the design of our first Avatar-themed land at Walt Disney World's Animal Kingdom.
Our long-term investments in Parks and Resorts are aimed at strong returns on capital as well as strengthening and growing our product in markets we already operate in and expanding our presence globally.
Nothing illustrates our ability to create enduring quality family entertainment better than the rerelease of the Lion King in 3D. Nearly 20 years after its original premiere, it has grossed about $150 million in box office worldwide and was the #1 selling Blu-ray Disc its first week of release. Over the next 2 years, we will release 4 additional award-winning animated films in 3D, Beauty and the Beast, Little Mermaid, Monsters, Inc. and Finding Nemo, and introduce a whole new generation of families to these hallmark theatrical events.
In fiscal 2011, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, the fourth film in our extremely successful franchise, earned more than $1 billion in global box office, 1 of only 10 films to have done so. And we're in early development for another Pirates sequel.
Cars continues to be a great franchise for us and in addition to grossing $559 million in global box office, Cars 2 continues to drive very strong performance in our Consumer Product business. Which we expect to continue into the holiday season. It has surpassed both Star Wars and Toy Story in retail sales of movie themed merchandise.
Marvel's Thor and Captain America were among the top 10 non-sequel releases of the year and we are pleased with the performance of both films and the true benefits of our Marvel acquisition should be quite visible in 2012. First, in May, Thor and Captain America will join Iron Man, The Hulk and Black Widow in Marvel's The Avengers, the first Marvel film to be marketed and distributed by Disney. The Avengers shows great promise with a record 10 million downloads on iTunes when the trailer debuted, and it is well on its way to being our next great franchise. Then in July, Sony Pictures will release The Amazing Spiderman. We're excited about the film and expect it will drive significant benefits for Spiderman consumer products. 
To that end, we recently completed a transaction with Sony Pictures to simplify our relationship. And in the deal, we purchased Sony Pictures' participation in Spiderman merchandising, while at the same time, Sony Pictures purchased from us our participation in Spiderman films. This transaction will allow us to control and fully benefit from all Spiderman merchandising activity, while Sony will continue to produce and distribute Spiderman films. We won't be specific about the economics of this 2-way transaction, but we expect it will drive attractive returns for Disney.
Our upcoming slate of films is rich in variety and potential. On Thanksgiving weekend, The Muppets will hit theaters in what we believe will rebuild another beloved franchise. Dreamworks' War Horse, a Steven Spielberg directed epic, will be in theaters in December. Early next year, we're looking forward to our live action adventure film, John Carter, directed by Andrew Stanton of Finding Nemo and WALL-E. And as I already mentioned, The Avengers will premiere in May. And opening in June is the highly anticipated Disney-Pixar's Brave, featuring a spirited Scottish girl on a comic medieval adventure. In November 2012, we will release Wreck-It Ralph, the Disney animation feature set in a multidimensional world of video games.
Turning to Cable Net, ESPN posted a record number of viewers for the fourth consecutive year and remains the leading destination for sports. ESPN.com has captured 70% of fans on mobile sports sites, and in September, ESPN.com set a record for its most unique users ever of 52 million. ESPN was able to grow its viewership and expand its content offerings to subscribers while showing discipline and acquiring sports rights. Our recently signed long-term agreements reached for the NFL, Pac-12 and Wimbledon ensure ESPN will continue to offer the broadest array of sports coverage for fans to access wherever they watch sports.
In fiscal 2011, Disney Channel and ABC Family posted record viewership for their targeted audiences. Disney Channel is now #1 across broadcast and cable, among kids and tweens for total day and prime time. Our Phineas and Ferb TV Movie is the #1 scripted telecast on broadcast and cable for that demographic and the #1 scripted cable show in total viewers. The Phineas and Ferb series and movie are also delivering record viewership internationally, and a feature film is planned for release in 2013. Phineas and Ferb is well on its way to becoming a successful franchise for the company.
ABC Family had its fifth consecutive year of growth in this key demographic of 12 to 34 year-olds, up more than 9% in fiscal 2011. ABC Family was home to 3 of the top scripted shows on basic cable this summer, including Switched At Birth, which was the top-rated new cable show among millennial viewers.  At ABC Primetime, we're seeing some very promising signs. ABC has 2 of the top 3 new dramas among 18 to 49 year-olds and the top 2 drama debuts with ABC owned Once Upon A Time and Revenge.
Our Wednesday night block is posting its second consecutive year of double-digit percentage growth among total viewers in adults 18 to 49 with the ongoing success of Modern Family, the new strength of the middle and encouraging results from the new show, Suburgatory. ABC's new hit dramas coupled with our comedy lineup will form the foundation for rebuilt and revitalized schedule in the coming seasons.
As we prepare to relaunch disney.com next fall, we're excited about the deal we recently announced to produce co-branded family-friendly video experiences for disney.com and YouTube that we believe will grow our brand presence online and drive new traffic. In our Game segment, we've diversified our strategy and are seeing success with both social and mobile games. Where's My Water? reached the top of the paid apps chart for 3 weeks this fall and Gardens of Time was recently named top online social game by its industry peers. And we'll be launching several new Disney-branded Facebook games incorporating Disney IP in 2012.
Lastly, all of our Movie and TV businesses is supported by a strong global licensing group in a solid platform in the Disney stores. In addition to these businesses, consumer products is a driving publishing business domestically and internationally and is launching a number of titles for mobile devices and is creating a broad digital strategy.  
This was a great year financially and strategically for the company, and we're very excited about 2012 with our upcoming film slate, momentum at ABC Primetime, continued growth at ESPN, the opening of multiple park attractions and the progress we're making to deliver profitability across our digital businesses. We're confident our strategic focus on great content, innovative uses of technology and global brand and asset growth will position us to deliver long-term shareholder value.
And with that, I will turn it over to Jay Rasulo. Jay?"
191564,140502322,190101,"Walt Disney Co., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 10, 2011",2011-11-10,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our fourth quarter results topping off a very good year for the company. We reported record revenue, net income and earnings per share in fiscal 2011. I'm going to take a few minutes to dis",1651,"Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our fourth quarter results topping off a very good year for the company. We reported record revenue, net income and earnings per share in fiscal 2011. I'm going to take a few minutes to discuss the fourth quarter in more detail and then highlight some specific fiscal 2012 items.
In Q4, Media Networks was the largest contributor to our performance, driven by growth in operating income at Cable Networks, more specifically by growth at Worldwide Disney Channel and ESPN and an increase in equity income. Growth at the Worldwide Disney Channel was the result of increased revenue from the sale of Disney Channel programming, higher affiliate revenue and increased ad revenue internationally. At ESPN, higher affiliate and advertising revenue were partially offset by higher programming costs associated with contractual rate increases for college football and the NFL.
Advertising revenue at ESPN was up 4% during the quarter but up 7% adjusting for the impact of last year's Men's World Cup. This growth is on top of a 19% increase ESPN delivered in Q4 last year. And if you look at the full year, ESPN ad revenue grew 18% in fiscal 2011, and that's following a double-digit increase in fiscal 2010. The growth in equity income resulted from an increase at A&E Lifetime due to the absence of programming write-offs incurred last year.
During the quarter, ESPN signed a new long-term agreement with the NFL. This deal extends our Monday Night Football rights through the 2021 season and provides us with 500 hours of incremental programming per year, which we began airing this season.  Extending our NFL partnership further strengthens our sports content portfolio, which continues to make ESPN the #1 destination for sports fans as well as cable television's most valuable network.
At Broadcasting, Q4 operating income was higher as a result of lower programming write-offs as well as higher ad revenue at the ABC Television Network. At our own TV stations, ad revenue was down 11%, but excluding political advertising and the recently sold, Flint and Toledo stations, ad revenue was up low single digits.
At the ABC Network, quarter-to-date scatter pricing is 25% above upfront levels. ESPN ad sales are pacing up single digits, and ABC Family ad sales are pacing up more than 10%. Given the strength of political spending last year, Q1 TV station ad sales are pacing down. Excluding political, TV station ad sales are pacing up.
We are very pleased with our results at Parks and Resorts in the quarter. Operating income was up 33% as a result of higher guest spending at our domestic parks and higher passenger cruise days, partially offset by increased costs. Total segment margins for Q4 were up 220 basis points versus last year and domestic Parks and Resorts margins were up more than that. For the full year, total segment margins were up 90 basis points. For the quarter, domestic attendance was up 1% and per capita spending was up 9% on higher ticket prices, food and beverage and merchandise spending.
Average per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 9%, while occupancy was down 2 percentage points to 81%. The increase in per room spending was driven by higher pricing and a reduction of promotional room nights. These results reflect our strategy of continuing to increase pricing to normal levels.
So far this quarter, domestic hotel reservations are pacing in line with prior year levels, while book rates are up low single digits. I'll note from this point forward, current year domestic reservations will include Aulani hotel rooms, the impact of which is de minimis in Q1 bookings.
Results at our international resorts were higher due to increased attendance and guest spending at Hong Kong Disneyland and higher guest spending at Disneyland Paris. We are also encouraged by the pace of recovery at the Tokyo Disney Resort, where our royalties from Tokyo were modestly higher this quarter compared to prior year.
At Studio Entertainment, operating income was up for the quarter as a result of lower film cost write-downs and higher domestic theatrical revenues despite lower results in our International, Theatrical and Worldwide Home Video businesses. Domestic theatrical results were up in the quarter as a result of Cars 2 and the release of The Lion King 3D as well as lower prerelease marketing expense compared to last year. Although Cars 2 performed well globally in the quarter, it faced a difficult international box office comparison with the incredibly successful Toy Story 3. Home Entertainment results were down due to lower unit sales of key titles domestically and lower catalog sales internationally. 
At Consumer Products, operating income was up for the quarter, driven by a higher licensing revenue due to sales of Cars merchandise and higher revenue from Marvel properties. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue was up 2%.
At the Interactive Media segment, operating losses decreased from the prior year due to lower marketing and product development costs in our Console Game business, partially offset by lower results in our social games. Keep in mind that results -- social games reflect a full quarter of operations of Playdom compared to the prior year, which only included 1 month of operations. 
I'd now like to turn to fiscal 2012 and provide some color on a few of our businesses that should help with timing and comparability issues for the coming year.  In fiscal 2012, ESPN will once again air 4 BCS games and the Rose Bowl, all of which will take place during fiscal Q2. Last year, 2 of these games, the Rose and Fiesta Bowls, add during fiscal Q1. Our new ACC contract, which began in September of this year, will continue to impact comparisons in fiscal Q1 and Q2, which encompass most of the college football and basketball seasons. Our new exclusive coverage of Wimbledon will begin during the second half of the fiscal year, while our new contract with the Pac-12 conference will begin in fiscal Q4.
We remain hopeful that there will be a quick resolution to the NBA situation. However, our broad portfolio of rights will enable us to effectively program ESPN without the NBA. We have plans in place to replace the majority of live NBA programming hours with coverage of other sports, including college basketball, so the absence of the NBA will not affect our ability to achieve our full year programming commitments. Since many NBA advertisers want to reach male demos, we'll expect a good portion of NBA ad dollars will be reexpressed to other ESPN properties, including college basketball. We expect any reduction in our NBA-related revenue would be more than offset by a reduction in rights costs.
I'd also like to take a moment to address our affiliate contracts with multichannel operators, a subject we've been asked about many times in the past few months. We believe the strength of our cable networks and own television stations positions us well for a series of upcoming negotiations. Our recent agreements with Time Warner Cable, Verizon and Bright House Networks are long-term comprehensive and create value for both Disney and our partners. We expect these deals to serve as templates for upcoming negotiations. Given the timing in our existing contracts, we expect to negotiate new agreements for our Cable Networks and owned TV stations, covering an incremental 75% of multichannel households by the end of calendar 2014.
Now let me turn to Parks and Resorts. The Disney Fantasy will launch at the very end of our fiscal Q2, and thus, the ship will not generate meaningful revenue during the second quarter. This coming summer, we will open Cars Land, the corner of our -- cornerstone of our expansion at the Disney California Adventure. These projects are part of our continued investment in growth initiatives that we expect will contribute incremental operating income once they are fully ramped up. However, we expect in fiscal 2012 our growth initiatives will contribute $500 million in both incremental revenue and expense. Having said that, we still expect Parks and Resorts margins to expand during 2012.
At Interactive Media, we expect the impact of purchase accounting from the Playdom acquisition to decrease from $110 million in fiscal 2011 to approximately $50 million in fiscal 2012 with the majority recognized in the first half of the year. We expect consolidated CapEx to be approximately $500 million higher than in fiscal year '11 with our work on the Shanghai Disney Resort being the largest driver of this increase.
We expect pension and postretirement medical expenses to increase by $50 million in fiscal 2012. If you recall, in May, we announced changes in our salary pension plan that will reduce our expense over the next 5 years by $350 million to $400 million or approximately $75 million per year versus our previous plan. We still expect to realize these savings in fiscal 2012. However, changes in other key assumptions, including a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate, more than offset these savings in fiscal 2012.
We continue to increase the pace of our share repurchase -- continued to increase the pace of our share repurchase during the fourth quarter by buying back 58 million shares for about $2 billion, bringing our total share repurchase for fiscal year to 134.7 million shares or approximately $5 billion. During the first fiscal -- first quarter of our new fiscal year, we have repurchased 12.7 million shares for about $420 million.
2011 was a great year for our company. We delivered strong operating results, expanded operating margins, continued to invest in our core businesses and extended the reach of our brands outside of the U.S. We are very well-positioned to drive growth and returns for our shareholders in fiscal 2012 and in the years to come.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Lowell for questions."

The NFL is a good example. There's no question that was an expensive deal. And as I was saying, using the word discipline, I was thinking about the cost of -- to us of extending that deal. But what we saw when we did that was, first of all, long-term deal that takes us to 2021. That's tremendous certainty. We know we have certainty in terms of quality of the product and the games and the interest in those from our viewers and our distributors and advertisers, by the way. And we have the ability to program more than 500 more hours of NFL programming kind of annualized. So when we added all of that up and we looked at the growth trajectory of those rights fess, we concluded that if there's anything that creates value for ESPN, it's the NFL. And so we apply similar logic, the college football and college basketball package that we bought represent quality programming, huge local interest in those. You know if you've gone to a college that has a decent sports team how loyal you tend to be as a viewer, to that team, those teams, again, long-term deals. And the other thing that we've got gained in a lot of these deals is multi-platform capabilities. So it grows our customer engagement, and that's a big deal. The growth of ESPN.com, which I cited in my earnings comments, the use of smart mobile devices, in some cases, international rights, these are all very, very valuable. Those that we -- those sports that we did not get interestingly enough, the World Cup and the Olympics, while there's no question, they're high-quality. They don't occur every year. They occur for a short period of time. And we didn't believe that we could justify the kind of rights that ultimately others pay for it because it didn't really meet the standards based on the cost those rights were going to amount to, to us that we've adhered to for these other packages."

So not a lot of movement there in this quarter. On the other question you had about international visitation, the fourth quarter happened to be a particularly strong quarter for international visitation. I have told you that for many quarters or many years. For our business as a whole, we're looking around 20% of our business, a lot of that driven at Walt Disney World. Walt Disney World was at the high end of the range that we see between 17%, 18% and 22%, 23%. Walt Disney World really over-performed in the quarter internationally. And it made the year sort of fall pretty solidly in that 20% -- 18% to 22% range. So surprisingly, to some extent as was implied in your question, but we are still seeing very strong international attendance."

We've seen a slight slowdown from the U.K. this quarter. But by and large, overall, our international attendance this quarter is up, I think, just under 10% from a year ago. Now we're are also being helped by growth in attendance from Asia and from Brazil, so there's a good kind of global balance. And while we're certainly watching what's going on in Europe very carefully, the fact of the matter is that there are other markets that have grown nicely, and that's obviously a good thing for us. On the scatter side, I want to reiterate the fact that advertising for us was about 19% of our total revenue. It doesn't mean it's unimportant, but I just want to put it in perspective. On the ABC front, scatter pricing has been very strong this quarter, I think Jay mentioned in the mid-20% range, 26% over the upfront. But it has slowed slightly these last few weeks. That said, the option pick ups for January, February and March are running slightly above where we thought we would be, and when we look at the mix of inventory that we have left, including in some very appealing new programs that I mentioned, Once Upon a Time, Suburgatory and Revenge to  name a few, we feel good about the inventory that we have left and our demographics are strong. We've been quite strong in women 18 to 49 as a for instance. So I'd say a little slowing in the last few weeks, up nicely over the upfront this quarter, and we'll wait and see. On the ESPN front, they have difficult comps from a year ago as was the case in the quarter that we just announced. They ended up up 18% for the year, which is a tremendous number. They have got a great product to sell. They have a male demographic that's clearly in demand, and they also wrote a lot of business in the upfront. Scatter becomes less of an issue for them."

Interestingly enough, that's even more interesting and more compelling today than it was back then because the world is offering us even more opportunities to leverage great product, either because of new technology or compelling growth in emerging markets. And that's the real value proposition for us. I want nothing more for this company than to make great product. And I'd say if I had to go and mind over the remainder of my tenure, which isn't as brief as, I think, people suggests, it's to improve the quality of our output. Technology is a huge, huge strategic priority for us. I talked about it when I talk about content. Let's use it to distribute more effectively and to monetize better. It should also be used to make our product better as well. And we certainly see that when it comes to filmed entertainment, but obviously, in our theme parks. And then on the international front, we announced 3 big deals this past year. They're in my remarks, in China, India and Russia. It is imperative for this company to plant a number of seeds in the emerging world. When you look at the -- into the remainder of this decade or the next decade, growth from emerging markets is going to outpace growth in the developed world, and that's the first time that's happened in 200 years. So that's very important, sticking to our knitting and doing more of it."

I'd say that not shockingly, if you look at the growth in our merchandise sales, it's a little bit slower in the mix than the growth in our RNA and our Food and Beverage sales, mostly because of some great programming on the Food and Beverage side that has kept that variable growing. But in general, we see our guests behaving pretty much as they have in the past. And as you can see in aggregate, their spending is increasing at a pretty heavy level. If you look -- step back and look at the overall mix, I would say that our Group business, while it has made leaps and bounds, growth back since the downturn. It's still only about 90% of where it was before we came into the downturn. I think there's a little more opportunity for us there because it's very strong countercyclical programming for us.

And this is one that we -- I get asked often, and I'll try to give you some perspective on it. Five years ago or so, we used to be pretty demonstrative about $1 billion number being sort of a -- an ongoing level without special projects added to it. You have to remember, though, that in those 5 years, in the capital projects that we've put in the ground, which each have their own growth strategy, each is filling in different parts of the portfolio, when they're back on board, they all need sort of ongoing FF&E and maintenance capital to keep them going. So I would say that, that that billion dollar number is low. But certainly, we've been pretty clear about the levels we're spending in fiscal '11 and '12 being at the other end of the spectrum, being very high because of the addition of the 2 cruise ships, the Aulani Hotel, the work we're doing at DCA, all the work we're doing at Walt Disney World has really kind of created a bubble for us that is not our long-term plan. I think that you will hear about longer-term projects, Shanghai, we talked a little bit about as a contributor to 2012 capital expenditures, and that will sort of ramp up over time. Remember that only 43% of that capital is ours. So even though it's a big contributor, the Chinese government contributes 57% of that and we back that cash out of a financing -- a lower financing line in our P&L. So I can't give you exact specificity on our ongoing capital level, but let's say it will be higher than $1 billion but much lower than the $2.5 billion to $3 billion we've been at."

That's certainly coming true with deals like the one we mentioned for Netflix and Amazon and the conversations that we're having with a variety of entities, the number of apps that have been downloaded, the use of ESPN.com, the over 230 million likes on Facebook, the YouTube deal, you name it. It's a very interesting time for content owners, and there is a growing list of platforms that are eager to enter into deals for us to enable them to redistribute our content to support their investment in their technology platform. And I think we're only seeing the beginning of the beginning of that. I'd say if anything that I think is profound or interesting is that -- is how well some of the traditional media platforms have held up. Five years ago, we would've been talking about just how devastating the impact of the DVR would have been on the Advertising business. So we're finding that with roughly 42% penetration of DVRs in the United States and people who have DVRs watching substantially more TV, that the actual increase in ratings in DVR households is pretty interesting. And now that we can sell on a C3 basis, maybe ultimately, we'll be able to sell even on a C7 basis. That's all monetizable. It's not all detrimental to our business model. If anything you could argue, it's actually enhancing it."

We don't measure revenue that closely in the Movie business because we're more interested in profitability, and we'd rather make fewer more profitable movies than more less profitable movies, obviously. We like our year ahead beginning with The Muppets, which has a huge amount of momentum right now. And obviously, The Avengers will factor in big time for us as a franchise for the company and as a real new Marvel tempo. And then we've got a good Pixar title in Brave and John Carter, which should be a big movie for us in March. We've done a good job at the studio of continuing to be vigilant about the cost structure of that business, particularly as things change in that business. I don't believe that we're necessarily at the end in that regard. We'll continue to monitor that business very carefully. We're trying to bring some production costs down, but we're doing so in part by basically balancing the mix of the movies that we have, making a few tempo films and investing aggressively in those, The Avengers is a good example of that, I mentioned Pirates earlier, but also making movies that are substantially lower in cost. The Muppets is actually a good example of that. It's a movie that's going to cost less than $50 million to produce, and I like the balance. In terms of the Lion King and whether we can turn to the library to continue to drive profitability, I mentioned in my remarks, we've named 4 titles that we're bringing out in similar form, Beauty and the Beast, Little Mermaid, Nemo and Monsters. They're all different circumstances than Lion King was. Lion King had never been released on Blu-ray, for instance, and it was a 17-year-old title and was a movie that appealed to just about all demographics. I think the films that we're bringing out are extremely appealing films as well. I'm not sure any one of them is exactly a Lion King in terms of the circumstances, but we think they'll all enhance the bottom line, in a couple of cases, enhance basically the brands Disney and Pixar."

The broadcast side, I think what you're seeing is you're seeing a new form of syndication popping up that didn't exist a few years ago, and that's obviously a good thing.

Interestingly enough, in 10 years ago, it was about 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, so we've grown in the value segment, we reduced slightly in the deluxe. By the way, reduced slightly, essentially, it means it's due to the fact that we simply built more value. And I actually believe, if you look at the last 10 years, that's proved to be a great strategy because we made our product far more accessible to more people. And it has enabled us to not only grow attendance but take market share, grow market share, which was obviously very important, because as we move people from off-property, value-priced hotels to on-property value-priced hotels, we captured a much greater percentage of their vacation spend namely in food and merchandise and obviously on the hotel side. We are actually going to be opening another very large value-priced hotel, but we're also developing a luxury-priced hotel with Four Seasons, that's relatively modest in size and it's going to open, I think, in 3 years. I actually think that our strategy has worked very well. We look at our bookings on the luxury side, and we obviously feel good about that. But we've driven a huge amount of traffic in the value direction, and I think that is -- really served us well."

And I know you said that the rights cost reduction would more than offset any impact there. So I guess the question is, are you expecting any kind of carryover impact if the lockout should drag on? One way or the other, do you expect that to have any kind of prolonged impact? And is it fair to then think about this as kind of operating income neutral? Or would you actually look to perhaps benefit kind of in some way from this from a financial standpoint?"

In fact, we believe that there is demand for the categories that are strong advertisers on ESPN and whether or not the NBA is being broadcast on ESPN and, obviously, broadcast elsewhere. Those dollars are going to continue to seek that same male demographic that is going to find its way to sports. And the most logical place for them to find their way will be probably not shockingly to college basketball as a substitute and whatever else we have in our huge portfolio of live sporting events that can be broadcast in those NBA game slots. So we expect that those advertising dollars will actually -- the decrease will actually be quite de minimis. But moreover, they will -- if there is some loss, we think that, that loss will be more than offset with not recognizing the rights fees for the NBA for that season. We, by the way, on balance would still prefer to have the NBA season and carry through with our original plan of programming those games. But I do not believe that it will affect us to the negative financially if the season, in fact, does not end up happening. And in terms of future, I can't imagine. I don't think it's ever good for a sports league to find themselves in this situation, but I think the same argument holds for future years that we have a lock on this demographic with advertisers. They love to advertise on ESPN. We deliver the ratings, our portfolio is incredibly strong broadly and no reason to believe that we would see a long-term impact of this particular season of the NBA being locked out. But thanks for the question."

We still believe that the consumer will be better served if, when they buy a digital file, they have an opportunity to access it or play it on multiple platforms, that that's a good thing for the industry. But there are no developments in that regard. The first question was digital opportunities in windowing. I think it's safe to assume that the advent of more and more technology is going to result in more windows. We're already seeing some of that. But I don't want to be specific about which windows, I think, are going to develop first or which ones we're going to take advantage of. But what we're seeing in general in the world in more profound ways than we ever experienced is essentially a giant pop up digital media store. Not being -- that means that, particularly, with smart mobile devices, like the iPad, that suddenly the world is rich in opportunities for content providers to put their content in the hands of people anytime, anywhere. And the anytime, I guess, speaks to the windows, not just when people watch them on their own time, but when we make them available."
