We're proud of the progress we've made in the quarter and in 2010. During the past year, we refocused our business, improved operating efficiency and continued to scale and enhance our world-class infrastructure, all while maintaining a healthy balance sheet and returning approximately $1 billion to our investors. 
We enter 2011 as a leading provider of Internet infrastructure services and believe we are well positioned to help our customers benefit from the continued growth of the Internet and cloud computing. 
I'll comment now on fourth quarter results. In Registry Services, the base of registered names in .com and .net totaled 105.2 million names at the end of December. This represents a 9% year-over-year increase in the base. In the fourth quarter we processed 7.6 million new registrations which is a 4% increase year-over-year. We added 1.75 million net names to the name base in the quarter. 
On the renewal rates side, the Q3 2010 renewal rate were 72.8%. While the rates are not fully much trouble until 45 days at the end of the quarter we believe the renewal rate in the fourth quarter of 2010 will be between 72.5% at 73%. As we look forward to the first quarter, we expect the Q1 net names added to the base to be between 2.3 million to 2.6 million names which reflect the continued growth in Internet usage, online advertising and e-commerce.
           
In addition to the business metrics for Registry Services for the quarter, I also wanted to highlight a couple of developments during the quarter related to our continued technology and thought leadership throughout Internet Infrastructure. First, we successfully implemented DNS .net zone in December and we are on track in April of about in the first quarter. In addition, during the fourth quarter, we made a DNS sec signing service available to the registrars to assist in DNS SEC implementation for the customers. The continued reliability amount of first conference birdies and record in 2010. Last year, we processed over 22 trillion DNS queries all without any unplanned downtime and in the face of well-publicized tax. We continue to be vigilant in anticipation of the growth of Internet usage and the accompanying scale of the tax. 
With regard to that case filed by the Coalition For ICANN Transparency or CFIT against VeriSign, there are no updates. As reported on 23 Earnings Call, the court establish a timeline in October for the litigation. In  accordance with this timeline, there is a hearing scheduled in early February on VeriSign's motion to dismiss the third coming CFIT member in 2010. In March there are summary judgment hearing scheduled on certain social issues with the final summary judgment scheduled for October 2011. The trial date is set for December 5, 2011. 
Beyond the upcoming dates just mentioned, given that this is ongoing litigation, we will not be commenting further other than to reiterate that we continue to feel confident about the case and will defend our position vigorously.
In addition to registry services, I'd also like to briefly address our network intelligence and ability or NIA business. In 2010, our focus was to build a strong team around this business and to start to deliver services to the market that address the growing complexity and importance of reliability and availability of networks. In 2011, we'll be ramping the product roadmap in sales. As we progress through the year, we'll update you on the business which we believe is well-positioned in a fast growing the fragmented market. 
As we look forward to the company in 2011, our focus will be to continue to provide unsurpassed and unparalleled network performance, provide value-added services to the registrars justice selling mornings, position ourselves for to launch the new continue to drive the growth in international names and grow a meaningful business in NIA. We believe that these activities will result to continued growth in shareholder value. We're excited about our future as we feel that with the growth of the Internet, the emergence of more market for domain names, strong trends in online advertising and e-commerce and the growing complexity of managing networks in an era of computing, we are well-positioned for the future.
Thanks for your attention, and I'll now turn the call over to Brian. Brian?"

We hav",958,"Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. As you just heard in Mark's overview, our fourth quarter and 2010 annual results reflect the continued hard work over the past year to successfully refocus the business and drive operational efficiencies. We have continued to invest in our technology and in organic growth while maintaining a healthy balance sheet and returning value to shareholders. During 2010, we generate revenue of $681 million and delivered non-GAAP operating income of $284 million, all while expanding non-GAAP operating margins by approximately 850 basis points. These results drove approximately $266 million in free cash flow for the year.
In the fourth quarter, we paid a $518 million dividend from domestic cash. The cash balance as of year-end following the payout was $2.1 billion, about half of which was onshore. Our financial position is strong as we enter 2011, given our cash balance, low accounts receivable balances and healthy deferred revenue. Giving us predictability and enabling us to continue to organically grow the business will also returning value to shareholders. As we enter 2010, we indicated that we are focused on the following key operating metrics: Revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS growth and free cash flow. 
Let us recap our performance in each of these areas for the fourth quarter and the year.  Revenue of $179 million for the fourth quarter was up 4% from the prior quarter and up 13% year-over-year. 2010 revenue of $681 million was up 10% year-over-year that the high-end of our guidance range. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $663 million, an increase of $9 million or 1% from Q3, and up 13% from the same period in 2009. 
Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses were $100 million, up 2% quarter-over-quarter and down approximately 3% year-over-year, with a $65 million increase in year-over-year revenue. Non-GAAP operating margin for Q4 was 44.3% in the fourth quarter compared to 43.1% in Q3. As mentioned on previous calls. There will be some choppiness in operating margin until the completion of the CSAs in the second quarter of 2011. Fourth quarter margin expansion was driven by our focus on streamlining the business as well as rebranding expense that were shifted to the first quarter of 2011.  Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $54 million, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.31 compared to $0.27 in Q3 and $0.17 in the same period in 2009. 
2010 non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.30 is a 61% increase over 2009. We exit Q4 2010 with a diluted share count of 174 million shares. During the year, we repurchased 16 million shares using approximately $440 million in cash and paid approximately $625 million in a special dividend and contingent interest, returning in excess of $1 billion to our investors.
Operating cash flow on a consolidated basis was $47 million in Q4 and $215 million in 2010, which includes the payout of $109 million in contingent interest to holders of our convertible debentures. 
Free cash flow was negative $1 million in Q4, given a reversal of $35 million in excess tax benefit and $12 million capital expenditures in the quarter. Free cash flow for 2010 was approximately $267 million, given approximately $132 million in excess tax benefits and approximately $81 million capital expenditures.  Note that 2010 capital expenditures included approximately $20 million in spending during the year related to our authentication business. 
To sum up 2010, we're very pleased with our performance. We continue to grow non-GAAP operating income and net income faster than revenue. We have a healthy cash position and a strong cash flow generating capability to our business and continue to be a key benefit of our financial model. 
Before I move onto guidance, I want to touch on the status of the transition of the Authentication Services business to Symantec, as well as our corporate headquarters move to the East Coast.  Progress has been good and we still expect the bulk of the transition to be wrapped up mid-2011, with approximately $5 million in transition services revenue that will hit the other income line in the first half of 2011. Also, the transition of numerous corporate functions and most of the CFO organization specifically for Northern Virginia as a result of the relocation of corporate headquarters is on track and running smoothly. Thanks to the dedication and professionalism of the entire team during this transition. 
Now, let me move on to 2011 guidance.  We anticipate that revenue for 2011 will be in a range of $750 million to $780 million or growth of 10% to 14% year-over-year. Consistent with 2010, we expect non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 78%. Q4 2011 exit non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be at least 46% to 48%. Non-GAAP Other loss net is expected to be $25 million for 2011. We believe that 30% is still a reasonable pro forma tax rate, and we expect to pay approximately 4% in cash taxes in 2011. Our guidance is based on expectations of continued growth and increased operating efficiencies in our business. 
We will now provide guidance on share repurchases, but we indicated when we declared the special tax dividend that we intend to return at least the remaining proceeds from the divestiture of authentication services over the course of the coming year. We will continue to evaluate various alternatives for returning the cash. Currently, we have approximately $1.35 billion authorized by the Board of Directors for share repurchases that does not expire.
In summary, we are excited about the opportunities for the business in 2011, and we believe we are well-positioned to grow our business and deliver value for our shareholders, customers, partners and employees. 
With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, we're ready for the first question"

Operating leverage in the model in their we think it will come from, secondarily headcount. On the operating leverage and the model, I expect G&A to decrease quarter-over-quarter for the remainder of 2011. We had some one-time expenses that occurred in fourth quarter which drove it a little higher and we continue to stream in the business as we move headquarters from the West Coast to the East Coast. There were some duplication cost for the first and second quarter, but most of the transition will be completed and you'll start to see some of the leverage come out of the business here in the second half of the year. On headcount, we've given margin guidance and so, in the headcount, since we have duplication of staff, we don't want to get a quarter by quarter guidance but we said we would be approximately around 1,000 employees once we got everything completed. And so last quarter, we were about 1,100. We're about 1,050 this quarter. We're going to continue to hire in the sales and marketing as we grow the NIA business and we see reductions in G&A that'll offset some of the hirings. So net, net we'll be down to more after that."

We ended at $1.75 million names which is closer to the low end of that. The reason for that being in the lower end is we had two registrars and we deleted about 1,000 names between them right at the end of the originally expect sometime this year. We see things like that court quarter-over-quarter sometime selected the registrars management portfolio so will get them to do that kind of stuff but we pay more attention to the trending of the business. If look at the trends, we see that this fourth quarter we actually had the highest fourth quarter ever in the business and the base of the names continues to trend to more names being previously renewed, with the result of the renewal rate continues to decline.

With the difficulty in going into 2011 talk about what the normalized cash flow would be. You'd have to get into price increase on a number of other factors to tell you what to normalized rate would be. So if you look at 2010 on a full year basis, cash from operations was about $250 million. And you have to add that back the access tax benefit associated with stock options of $130 million. So roughly, we're about $350 million on the business and that does not include the authentication cash flow. And so as we talked about cash flow from operations at Analyst Day and last year, we're right on track with where we thought we would be at. Luckily, going forward, in the first quarter of 2011, it would be very clean and transparent on what it is. Fourth quarter we had a dividend contingent interest, third quarter we had the sale of authentication. And so there's been a lot of puts and takes in the cash flow this year. But I think if you only get cash from operations roughly about $330 million on a non-GAAP basis. Our capital was about $80 million of which $20 million of that was really the authentication business. So you take about $60 million of capital out there to basically get to a free cash flow number."

We're proud of the progress that we made in the quarter and in 2010. During the past year, we refocused our business, improved operating efficiency and continued to scale and enhance our world-class infrastructure, all while maintaining a healthy balance sheet and returning approximately $1 billion to our investors. 
We entered 2011 as a leading provider of Internet infrastructure services, and believe we are well positioned to help our customers benefit from the continued growth of the Internet and cloud computing. 
I'll comment now on fourth quarter results. In Registry Services, the base of registered names in .com and .net totaled 105.2 million names at the end of December. This represents a 9% year-over-year increase in the base. In the fourth quarter, we processed 7.6 million new registrations which is a 4% increase year-over-year. We added 1.75 million net names to the name base in the quarter. 
On the renewal rates side, the Q3 2010 renewal rate were 72.8%. While the renewal rates are not fully much measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe the renewal rate in the fourth quarter of 2010 will be between 72.5% at 73%. As we look forward to the first quarter, we expect the Q1 net names added to the base to be between 2.3 million to 2.6 million names which reflect the continued growth in Internet usage, online advertising and e-commerce.
In addition to the business metrics for Registry Services for the quarter, I also wanted to highlight a couple of developments during the quarter related to our continued technology and thought leadership around Internet Infrastructure. First, we successfully implemented DNSSEC in the .net zone in December, and we are on track with DNSSEC enabled  to .com zone in the first quarter. 
In addition, during the fourth quarter, we made a DNSSEC signing service available to the registrars to assist in DNSSEC implementation for the customers. The continued reliability and availability of our network is a constant strategic priority, and we are proud of our performance record in 2010. Last year, we processed over 22 trillion DNS queries, all without any unplanned downtime and in the face of well-publicized cyber attacks. We continue to be vigilant in anticipation of the growth of Internet usage and the accompanying scale of attacks. 
With regard to the case filed by the Coalition For ICANN Transparency or CFIT against VeriSign, there are no updates. As we reported on the Q3 earnings call, the court established a time line in October for the litigation. In accordance with this time line, there is a hearing scheduled in early February on VeriSign's motion to dismiss the third amended complaint filed by CFIT in November 2010. In March, there's a summary judgment hearing scheduled on certain threshold issues with a final summary judgment hearing scheduled for October 2011. The trial date is set for December 5, 2011. Beyond the upcoming dates just mentioned, given that this is ongoing litigation, we will not be commenting further other than to reiterate that we continue to feel confident about the case and will defend our position vigorously.
In addition to Registry Services, I'd also like to briefly address our network intelligence and availability or NIA business. In 2010, our focus was to build a strong team around this business and to start to deliver services to the market that address the growing complexity and importance of reliability and availability of networks. In 2011, we'll be ramping the product roadmap in sales. As we progress through the year, we'll update you on the business which we believe is well positioned in a fast growing but fragmented market. 
As we look forward to the company in 2011, our focus will be to continue to provide unsurpassed and unparalleled network performance, provide value-added services to the registrars to assist them in selling more names, position ourselves for the launch the new TLDs, continue to drive the growth in international names and grow a meaningful business in NIA. We believe that these activities will result in continued growth in shareholder value. We're excited about our future as we feel that with the growth of the Internet, the emergence of more markets for domain names, strong trends in online advertising and e-commerce and the growing complexity of managing networks in an era of cloud computing, we are well positioned for the future.
Thanks for your attention, and I'll now turn the call over to Brian. Brian?"

We hav",962,"Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. As you just heard in Mark's overview, our fourth quarter and 2010 annual results reflect the continued hard work over the past year to successfully refocus the business and drive operational efficiencies. We have continued to invest in our technology and in organic growth, while maintaining a healthy balance sheet and returning value to shareholders. During 2010, we generate revenue of $681 million and delivered non-GAAP operating income of $284 million, all while expanding non-GAAP operating margins by approximately 850 basis points. These results drove approximately $266 million in free cash flow for the year.
In the fourth quarter, we paid a $518 million dividend from domestic cash. The cash balance as of year-end following the payout was $2.1 billion, about half of which was onshore. Our financial position is strong as we enter 2011, given our cash balance, low accounts receivable balances and healthy deferred revenue. Giving us predictability and enabling us to continue to organically grow the business while also returning value to shareholders. As we enter 2010, we indicated that we are focused on the following key operating metrics: revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS growth and free cash flow. 
Let us recap our performance in each of these areas for the fourth quarter and the year. Revenue of $179 million for the fourth quarter was up 4% from the prior quarter and up 13% year-over-year. 2010 revenue of $681 million was up 10% year-over-year, and at the high-end of our guidance range. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $663 million, an increase of $9 million or 1% from Q3, and up 13% from the same period in 2009. 
Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses were $100 million, up 2% quarter-over-quarter and down approximately 3% year-over-year, with a $65 million increase in year-over-year revenue. Non-GAAP operating margin for Q4 was 44.3% in the fourth quarter compared to 43.1% in Q3. As mentioned on previous calls, there will be some choppiness in operating margin until the completion of the CSAs in the second quarter of 2011. 
Fourth quarter margin expansion was driven by our focus on streamlining the business, as well as rebranding expense that were shifted to the first quarter of 2011. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $54 million, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.31 compared to $0.27 in Q3 and $0.17 in the same period in 2009. 
2010 non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.30 is a 61% increase over 2009. We exit Q4 2010 with a diluted share count of 174 million shares. During the year, we repurchased 16 million shares using approximately $440 million in cash and paid approximately $625 million in a special dividend and contingent interest, returning in excess of $1 billion to our investors.
Operating cash flow on a consolidated basis was $47 million in Q4 and $215 million in 2010, which includes the payout of $109 million in contingent interest to holders of our convertible debentures. 
Free cash flow was negative $1 million in Q4, given a reversal of $35 million excess tax benefits and $12 million in capital expenditures in the quarter. Free cash flow for 2010 was approximately $267 million, given approximately $132 million in excess tax benefits and approximately $81 million capital expenditures. Note that 2010 capital expenditures included approximately $20 million in spending during the year related to our Authentication business. 
To sum up 2010, we're very pleased with our performance. We continue to grow non-GAAP operating income and net income faster than revenue. We have a healthy cash position, and the strong cash flow generating capabilities of our business continue to be a key benefit of our financial model. 
Before I move on to guidance, I want to touch upon the status of the transition of the Authentication Services business to Symantec, as well as our corporate headquarter move to the East Coast.  Progress has been good and we still expect the bulk of the transition to be wrapped up mid-2011, with approximately $5 million in transition services revenue that will hit the other income line in the first half of 2011. Also, the transition of numerous corporate functions and most of the CFO organization, specifically from Mountain View to Northern Virginia as a result of the relocation of corporate headquarters is on track and running smoothly. Thanks to the dedication and professionalism of the entire team during this transition. 
Now, let me move on to 2011 guidance.  We anticipate that revenue for 2011 will be in a range of $750 million to $780 million, or growth of 10% to 14% year-over-year. Consistent with 2010, we expect non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 78%. Q4 2011 exit non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be at least 46% to 48%. Non-GAAP Other loss net is expected to be $25 million for 2011. We believe that 30% is still a reasonable pro forma tax rate, and we expect to pay approximately 4% in cash taxes in 2011. Our guidance is based on expectations of continued growth and increased operating efficiencies in our business. 
We will not provide guidance on share repurchases, but we indicated when we declared the special cash dividend that we intend to return at least the remaining proceeds from the divestiture of authentication services over the course of the coming year. We will continue to evaluate various alternatives for returning the cash. Currently, we have approximately $1.35 billion authorized by the Board of Directors for share repurchases that does not expire.
In summary, we're excited about the opportunities for the business in 2011 and we believe we are well positioned to grow our business and deliver value for our shareholders, customers, partners and employees. 
With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

One is operating leverage in the model and where we think it will come from, and secondarily, headcount. On the operating leverage in the model, I expect G&A to decrease quarter-over-quarter for the remainder of 2011. We had some one-time expenses that occurred in fourth quarter, which drove it a little higher and we'll continue streamlining the business as we move headquarters from the West Coast to the East Coast. There will be some duplication and cost for the first and second quarter, but most of the transition will be completed and you'll start to see some of the leverage come out of business here in the second half of the year. On headcount, we've given margin guidance. And so in the headcount, since we will have duplication of staff, we don't want to get quarter-by-quarter guidance. But we said we'd be approximately around 1,000 employees once we got everything completed. And so last quarter, we're about 1,100. We're about 1,050 this quarter. We're going to continue to hire in the sales and marketing as we grow our NIA business, and we'll see reductions in G&A that will offset some of the hiring.

And that range anticipated seasonality of the holidays, we had a higher expiring base compared to the third quarter and a higher percentage of the first-time expiring names. We ended at $1.75 million names which is closer to the low end of that. The reason for that being at the lower end is that we had two registrars who deleted out about 1,000 names between them right at the end of the year, which we expect it would occur actually sometime this year. We see things like that quarter-over-quarter sometimes relating to the registrars management portfolio. So we'll pay attention to that kind of stuff, but pay more attention to the trending of the business. And if we look at the trends, we see that this fourth quarter, we actually had the highest fourth quarter in U.S. ever in the business. And the base of the names continues to trend to more names being previously renewed, with the result of the renewal rate continues to decline. So we've got a pretty positive view in things.

So we let the space and there's a lot of small players. So we did that with our network in the brand, we've got distinct competitive advantage. More specifically, we're not getting into breaking out any metrics around the business. I can't say that quarter-over-quarter, we signed 400% more contracts quarter-over-quarter to give just one view of things. So we think we've got some good early tracks around that. We haven't named any of the customers. We're probably unlikely to name any accounts simply because people don't just buy, like in Managed DNS, there was their buying the Internet Defense Network which is the DDoS Mitigation and other services.

That's all based into the numbers we've given you by the way. But that there's a cost aspect while throwing the category calls into public interest in order to make the Internet safer. The second piece of that is that as things like DNSSEC get propagated to .net already, .com coming up in the first quarter and other top-level domains that goes, it creates some complexity for folks to manage keys and things around that. So we have service offerings that we'll be rolling out around helping people manage DNSSEC with their own customer base.

So on the renewal rates, the highest renewal rate we've ever seen on this business to date has been about 77% in one quarter. And that was at the very top of the PPC market which makes sense, as the first-time renewal rates then were higher than they are today and up on a more normalized market in the absence of PPC. Right now we're seeing about 72% to 73% renewal rates and that rate has been turning up the last couple of years. The reason for that is the percentage of the base that consist of the names that were previously renewed continues to increase year-over-year, and that renewal rate is much higher than the first-time renewal rate. So overtime, it made sense for the renewal rate to continue to climb. Now for as high as it can go, the obvious upward boundary is the previously renewed rate which has continued to increase the last couple of years. And right now, we took a snapshot of time is between 80% and 81%. It's been as high as 85% historically in the company. So I can't say are going up, but I can say that there's room.

The difficulty in going into 2011 and talk about what the normalized cash flow would be is you got to get into price increase on a number of other factors to tell you what to normalized rate would be. So if you look at 2010 on a full year basis, cash from operations was about $250 million. And you have to add back the excess tax benefit associated with stock options of $130 million. So roughly, we're about $350 million on the business and that does not include the authentication cash flow. And so as we talked about cash flow from operations at Analyst Day in last year, we're right on track with where we thought we would be at. Luckily, going forward, in the first quarter of 2011, it would be very clean and transparent on what it is. Fourth quarter we had a dividend contingent interest, third quarter we had the sale of authentication. And so there's been a lot of puts and takes in the cash flow this year. But I think if you'll only get cash from operations, roughly about $350 million on non-GAAP basis. Our capital was about $80 million of which $20 million of that was related to the Authentication business. So you can take about $60 million of capital out there to basically get to a free cash flow number."

We're proud of the progress that we made in the quarter and in 2010. During the past year, we refocused our business, improved operating efficiency and continued to scale and enhance our world-class infrastructure, all while maintaining a healthy balance sheet and returning approximately $1 billion to our investors. 
We entered 2011 as a leading provider of Internet infrastructure services, and believe we are well positioned to help our customers benefit from the continued growth of the Internet and cloud computing. 
I'll comment now on fourth quarter results. In Registry Services, the base of registered names in .com and .net totaled 105.2 million names at the end of December. This represents a 9% increase year-over-year in the base. In the fourth quarter, we processed 7.6 million new registrations which is a 4% increase year-over-year. We added 1.75 million net names to the name base in the quarter. 
On the renewal rates side, the Q3 2010 renewal rate were 72.8%. While the renewal rates are not fully much measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe the renewal rate in the fourth quarter of 2010 will be between 72.5% at 73%. As we look forward to the first quarter, we expect the Q1 net names added to the base to be between 2.3 million to 2.6 million names which reflect the continued growth in Internet usage, online advertising and e-commerce.
In addition to the business metrics for Registry Services for the quarter, I also wanted to highlight a couple of developments during the quarter related to our continued technology and thought leadership around Internet Infrastructure. First, we successfully implemented DNSSEC in the .net zone in December, and we are on track with DNSSEC enabled  to .com zone in the first quarter. 
In addition, during the fourth quarter, we made a DNSSEC signing service available to the registrars to assist in DNSSEC implementation for the customers. The continued reliability and availability of our network is a constant strategic priority, and we are proud of our performance record in 2010. Last year, we processed over 22 trillion DNS queries, all without any unplanned downtime and in the face of well-publicized cyber attacks. We continue to be vigilant in anticipation of the growth of Internet usage and the accompanying scale of attacks. 
With regard to the case filed by the Coalition For ICANN Transparency or CFIT against VeriSign, there are no updates. As we reported on the Q3 earnings call, the court established a time line in October for the litigation. In accordance with this time line, there is a hearing scheduled in early February on VeriSign's motion to dismiss the third amended complaint filed by CFIT in November 2010. In March, there's a summary judgment hearing scheduled on certain threshold issues with a final summary judgment hearing scheduled for October 2011. The trial date is set for December 5, 2011. Beyond the upcoming dates just mentioned, given that this is ongoing litigation, we will not be commenting further other than to reiterate that we continue to feel confident about the case and will defend our position vigorously.
In addition to Registry Services, I'd also like to briefly address our network intelligence and availability or NIA business. In 2010, our focus was to build a strong team around this business and to start to deliver services to the market that address the growing complexity and importance of reliability and availability of networks. In 2011, we'll be ramping the product roadmap in sales. As we progress through the year, we'll update you on the business which we believe is well positioned in a fast growing but fragmented market. 
As we look forward to the company in 2011, our focus will be to continue to provide unsurpassed and unparalleled network performance, provide value-added services to the registrars to assist them in selling more names, position ourselves for the launch of the new TLDs, continue to drive the growth in international names and grow a meaningful business in NIA. We believe that these activities will result in continued growth in shareholder value. We're excited about our future as we feel that with the growth of the Internet, the emergence of more markets for domain names, strong trends in online advertising and e-commerce and the growing complexity of managing networks in an era of cloud computing, we are well positioned for the future.
Thanks for your attention, and I'll now turn the call over to Brian. Brian?"

We hav",961,"Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. As you just heard in Mark's overview, our fourth quarter and 2010 annual results reflect the continued hard work over the past year to successfully refocus the business and drive operational efficiencies. We have continued to invest in our technology and in organic growth, while maintaining a healthy balance sheet and returning value to shareholders. During 2010, we generate revenue of $681 million and delivered non-GAAP operating income of $284 million, all while expanding non-GAAP operating margins by approximately 850 basis points. These results drove approximately $266 million of free cash flow for the year.
In the fourth quarter, we paid a $518 million dividend from domestic cash. The cash balance as of year-end following the payout was $2.1 billion, about half of which was onshore. Our financial position is strong as we enter 2011, given our cash balance, low accounts receivable balances and healthy deferred revenue. Giving us predictability and enabling us to continue to organically grow the business while also returning value to shareholders. As we enter 2010, we indicated that we are focused on the following key operating metrics: revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS growth and free cash flow. 
Let us recap our performance in each of these areas for the fourth quarter and the year. Revenue of $179 million for the fourth quarter was up 4% from the prior quarter and up 13% year-over-year. 2010 revenue of $681 million was up 10% year-over-year, and at the high-end of our guidance range. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $663 million, an increase of $9 million or 1% from Q3, and up 13% from the same period in 2009. 
Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses were $100 million, up 2% quarter-over-quarter and down approximately 3% year-over-year, with a $65 million increase in year-over-year revenue. Non-GAAP operating margin for Q4 was 44.3% in the fourth quarter compared to 43.1% in Q3. As mentioned on previous calls, there will be some choppiness in operating margin until the completion of the CSAs in the second quarter of 2011. 
Fourth quarter margin expansion was driven by our focus on streamlining the business, as well as rebranding expense that were shifted to the first quarter of 2011. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $54 million, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.31 compared to $0.27 in Q3 and $0.17 in the same period in 2009. 
2010 non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.30 is a 61% increase over 2009. We exit Q4 2010 with a diluted share count of 174 million shares. During the year, we repurchased 16 million shares using approximately $440 million in cash and paid approximately $625 million in a special dividend and contingent interest, returning in excess of $1 billion to our investors.
Operating cash flow on a consolidated basis was $47 million in Q4 and $215 million in 2010, which includes the payout of $109 million in interest to holders of our convertible debentures. 
Free cash flow was negative $1 million in Q4, given a reversal of $35 million excess tax benefits and $12 million in capital expenditures in the quarter. Free cash flow for 2010 was approximately $267 million, given approximately $132 million in excess tax benefits and approximately $81 million capital expenditures. Note that 2010 capital expenditures included approximately $20 million in spending during the year related to our Authentication business. 
To sum up 2010, we're very pleased with our performance. We continue to grow non-GAAP operating income and net income faster than revenue. We have a healthy cash position, and the strong cash flow generating capabilities of our business continue to be a key benefit of our financial model. 
Before I move on to guidance, I want to touch upon the status of the transition of the Authentication Services business to Symantec, as well as our corporate headquarter move to the East Coast.  Progress has been good and we still expect the bulk of the transition to be wrapped up mid-2011, with approximately $5 million in transition services revenue that will hit the other income line in the first half of 2011. Also, the transition of numerous corporate functions and most of the CFO organization, specifically from Mountain View to Northern Virginia as a result of the relocation of corporate headquarters is on track and running smoothly. Thanks to the dedication and professionalism of the entire team during this transition. 
Now, let me move on to 2011 guidance.  We anticipate that revenue for 2011 will be in a range of $750 million to $780 million, or growth of 10% to 14% year-over-year. Consistent with 2010, we expect non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 78%. Q4 2011 exit non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be at least 46% to 48%. Non-GAAP Other loss net is expected to be $25 million for 2011. We believe that 30% is still a reasonable pro forma tax rate, and we expect to pay approximately 4% in cash taxes in 2011. Our guidance is based on expectations of continued growth and increased operating efficiencies in our business. 
We will not provide guidance on share repurchases, but we indicated when we declared the special cash dividend that we intend to return at least the remaining proceeds from the divestiture of authentication services over the course of the coming year. We will continue to evaluate various alternatives for returning the cash. Currently, we have approximately $1.35 billion authorized by the Board of Directors for share repurchases that does not expire.
In summary, we're excited about the opportunities for the business in 2011 and we believe we are well positioned to grow our business and deliver value for our shareholders, customers, partners and employees. 
With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

One is operating leverage in the model and where we think it will come from, and secondarily, headcount. On the operating leverage in the model, I expect G&A to decrease quarter-over-quarter for the remainder of 2011. We had some one-time expenses that occurred in fourth quarter, which drove it a little higher and we'll continue streamlining the business as we move headquarters from the West Coast to the East Coast. There will be some duplication and cost for the first and second quarter, but most of the transition will be completed and you'll start to see some of the leverage come out of business here in the second half of the year. On headcount, we've given margin guidance. And so in the headcount, since we will have duplication of staff, we don't want to give quarter-by-quarter guidance. But we said we'd be approximately around 1,000 employees once we got everything completed. And so last quarter, we're about 1,100. We're about 1,050 this quarter. We're going to continue to hire in the sales and marketing as we grow out the NIA business, and we'll see reductions in G&A that will offset some of the hiring.

And that range anticipated seasonality of the holidays, we had a higher expiring base compared to the third quarter and a higher percentage of the first-time expiring names. We ended at $1.75 million names which is closer to the low end of that. The reason for that being at the lower end is that we had two registrars who deleted out about 1,000 names between them right at the end of the year, which we expected would occur actually sometime this year. We see things like that quarter-over-quarter sometimes relating to the registrars manager and portfolios. So we'll pay attention to that kind of stuff, but pay more attention to the trending of the business. And if we look at the trends, we see that this fourth quarter, we actually had the highest fourth quarter in U.S. ever in the business. And the base of the names continues to trend to more names being previously renewed, with the result that the renewal rate continues to decline. So we've got a pretty positive view in things.

More specifically, we're not getting into breaking out any metrics around the business. I can say that quarter-over-quarter, we signed 400% more contracts quarter-over-quarter to give just one view of things. So we think we've got some good early tracks around that. We haven't named any of the customers. We're probably unlikely to name any accounts simply because people don't just buy, like in Managed DNS, they're buying the Internet Defense Network which is the DDoS Mitigation and other services.

That's all based into the numbers we've given you by the way. But that there's a cost aspect while throwing the category calls into public interest in order to make the Internet safer. The second piece of that is that as things like DNSSEC get propagated to .net already, .com coming up in the first quarter and other top-level domains that goes, it creates some complexity for folks to manage keys and things around that. So we have service offerings that we'll be rolling out around helping people manage DNSSEC for their own customer base.

So on the renewal rates, the highest renewal rate we've ever seen on this business to date has been about 77% in one quarter. And that was at the very top of the PPC market which makes sense, as the first-time renewal rates then were higher than they are today and up on a more normalized market in the absence of PPC. Right now we're seeing about 72% to 73% renewal rates and that rate has been trending up the last couple of years. The reason for that is the percentage of the base that consists of the names that were previously renewed continues to increase year-over-year, and that renewal rate is much higher than the first-time renewal rate. So over time, it made sense for the renewal rate to continue to climb. Now for as high as it can go, the obvious upward boundary is the previously renewed rate which has continued to increase the last couple of years. And right now, we took a snapshot of time is between 80% and 81%. It's been as high as 85% historically in the company. So I can't say are going up, but I can say that there's room. And that if you start to give a look at the things that make up the renewal rate, over the last years it's continued to trend on a positive threshold."

The difficulty in going into 2011 and talk about what the normalized cash flow would be is, you'd have to get into price increase on a number of other factors to tell you what to normalized rate would be. So if you look at 2010 on a full year basis, cash from operations was about $250 million. And you have to add back the excess tax benefit associated with stock options of $130 million. So roughly, we're about $350 million on the business and that does not include the authentication cash flow. And so as we talked about cash flow from operations at Analyst Day in last year, we're right on track with where we thought we would be at. Luckily, going forward, in the first quarter of 2011, it would be very clean and transparent on what it is. Fourth quarter we had a dividend contingent interest, third quarter we had the sale of authentication. And so there's been a lot of puts and takes in the cash flow this year. But I think if you'll only get cash from operations, roughly about $350 million on non-GAAP basis. Our capital was about $80 million of which $20 million of that was related to the Authentication business. So you can take about $60 million of capital out there to basically get to a free cash flow number."

Last year, we bought about $435 million of stock and paid a special dividend of about $500 million before you get to the contingent interest. We chose a special dividend around the fourth quarter as we had decided we wanted to return a significant amount of cash in a timely and rational manner and in advance of any tax code revision. But we also want to keep some flexibility considering the best alternatives for future cash return this year. So as Brian said, we're committed to return at least the second half of what the got in the authorization proceeds. We'll be thinking about the mechanism once we do that and we're always open for communications to shareholders at that point."

We are seeing a combination of a record number of new domain name registrations and strengthening renewal rates. Also we continue to achieve ongoing operating margin expansion through disciplined operations. And our balance sheet remains healthy, which allows us to declare a special dividend and to have repurchased $200 million in shares in the first quarter. As a leading Internet infrastructure provider, our business is being driven by the continued growth in underlying Internet trends such as online advertising, e-commerce, more global Internet users and the paradigm shift to cloud computing. 
We believe we are well positioned to participate in driving and securing that growth as well as to help our customer strengthen the integrity and effectiveness of their Internet services. Before getting into first quarter results, I'd like to comment on the $2.75 per share special dividend that we announced today. As you may recall, in December of last year, when we paid out a $3 special dividend we expressed our intention that we would return to shareholders at least the proceeds from the sale of our Authentication Service business, which was approximately $1.3 billion. 
With the $3 special dividend in December, the $200 million of share repurchases in the first quarter and today's $2.75 special dividend, we have returned an excess of proceeds of that sale to the shareholders. Post this dividend payment of $463 million, as well as the related contingent interest payment of $100 million to holders of our convertible bonds, we have approximately $1.4 billion remaining on the balance sheet. 
Following the first quarter share repurchases, we have approximately $1.2 billion remaining in share repurchase authorization, which has no expiration. Now I'm moving on to first quarter results. In Registry Services, the base of registered names in .com and .net totaled 108 million names at the end of March. This represents a 9% increase year-over-year in the base and an approximately 3% increase quarter-over-quarter. 
In the first quarter, we processed a record 8.3 million new registrations, which is an approximately 3% increase year-over-year. And in the quarter, we added 2.74 million net names to the domain name base. On the renewal rate side, the Q4 2010 renewal rate was 72.7%. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2011 will be between 73.5% and 74%. 
We expect the Q2 net names added to the base to be between 2 million and 2.3 million names, which reflect the continued growth in the underlying drivers of the Internet, as well as seasonality. As many of you are aware, our contract with ICANN for .net comes up for renewal on June 30 this year. On April 11, we announced that ICANN has posted restated renewal terms for the .net registry agreement for public comment. There are no material changes to the terms of the proposed renewal agreement from the existing agreement. ICANN's internal policy call for our common period for the proposed agreement, which we expect will run for approximately 30 days, and we expect the agreement to be renewed by July 1. 
I would also like to highlight that we successfully implemented DNS in the .com zone on March 31 following implementation of DNS in .net in December and the root zone last fall. This is a significant accomplishment for those teams that has been in the works for many years, and it required collaboration with new numerous constituencies in the Internet ecosystem. We're proud of the role we played in this multi-stakeholder initiative. 
With regard to the case filed by the coalition for ICANN transparency or CFIT against VeriSign, the court established a time line for the litigation last October that included a summary judgment hearing this past March on certain threshold issues. That hearing took place on March 11 and the matter is pending with the court. We have no other updates on that motion.
Also as noted in our 8-K filed on February 14, the court dismissed CFIT's third amendment complaint and allowed for CFIT to amend certain allegations. CFIT subsequently filed a fourth amended complaint, and VeriSign filed an answer to that complain on March 8. According to the court schedule, final summary judgment hearing is scheduled for October 2011, and a trial date is set for December 5, 2011. Beyond the dates just mentioned given that this is ongoing litigation, we will not be commenting further other than to reiterate that we continue to feel confident about the case, and we'll defend our position vigorously. 
With regard to our Network Intelligence and Availability business, we continue to make good progress. On March 31, we announced 2 enhancements to our Managed DNS service including the rollout of support for DNS set compliance features, as well as Geo Location. The services strengthen our offering, and we'll continue to strive for leadership position in this fast-growing competitive market. With the first quarter results throughout the good start of the year, and we look forward to updating you on our progress through the year. 
Thanks for your time, and I'll now turn the call over to Brian."

We view the dividend",814,"Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. As Mark said, this was a good quarter for us, and I'm pleased about the progress we made toward our goals. I'd like to add to Mark's comments regarding the $2.75% per share special dividend. We view the dividend as an efficient return to shareholders given our capital position following the sale of Authentication Services. 
From a taxability perspective, which is impacted by the $100 million contingent interest payment to our convertible bondholders, we believe most if not all the dividend would likely be a return of capital to the shareholders, and the remainder would be a qualified dividend as defined under the Internal Revenue Code. Let me quickly recap our performance this quarter on our key operating metrics, which are revenue, preferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS growth and free cash flow. And then I'll discuss progress towards our annual guidance.
Revenue of $180 million for the first quarter was up 2% from the prior quarter and up 12% year-over-year. Deferred third revenue ended the quarter at $699 million, an increase of $36 million or 5% from Q4 and up 13% from the same period in 2010. Deferred revenue has been reported on a continuing operations or Naming Services basis since the second quarter of last year. And as of this quarter, the balance sheet is also a clean comparison.
Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses were $98 million, down 1% quarter-over-quarter and relatively flat year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin for Q1 was 45.9% compared to 44.3% in Q4. We expect continued margin expansion in line with our previously stated intention of achieving a 46% to 48% exit margin fourth quarter of this year. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $55 million resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.32 compared to $0.31 in Q4 and $0.22 in the same period in 2010.
Income related to transition services included as part of our nonoperating income on the P&L was approximately $3.5 million in the first quarter. A quick comment on taxes. We continue to believe a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 30% is reasonable estimate. In 2011, we will pay cash taxes of approximately $40 million, of which $28 million is related to the divestiture of the Authentication Services business. 
We exit Q1 with the diluted share count of 172 million shares. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was approximately 500,000 shares based on average share price during the quarter. Operating cash flow on a consolidated basis was $90 million in first quarter, noting that bonus payments are made in the quarter. Free cash flow was $78 million in Q1, given a $4 million excess tax benefits and $16 million in capital expenditures in the quarter.
Capital expenditures this quarter and include certain infrastructure initiatives as was facilities-related expenditures corresponding to the move of corporate headquarters. We now believe capital expenditures to be closer to 10% of revenue in 2011, given anticipated facilities related to the move of corporate headquarters to our new lease space. 
To sum up, we're pleased with our performance. We continue to grow non-GAAP operating income and net income faster than revenue. We have a healthy cash position and a strong cash flow generation capability of our business continue to be a key benefit of our financial model. 
Before I move on to guidance, I want to touch upon the status of the transition of Authentication Services business to Symantec and corporate functions of these folks. Progress has been good, and we still expect the bulk of the transition to be wrapped up in mid-2011. 
As noted previously, income related to transition services in Q1 was approximately $3.5 million, and we now expect approximately $2 million in Q2 and approximately $2 million in the second half of the year. I would like to thank the entire team for their collaboration this past quarter. I wish our Mountain View colleagues moving on to new opportunities in the Bay Area all the best in your new endeavors. 
With respect to 2011 guidance, revenue for 2011 will be in the range of $756 million to $780 million or growth of 11% to 14%, up from 10% to 14%. Consistent with 2010, we expect non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 78%. Q4 2011 non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be 46% to 48%. Interest expense in nonoperating income net, which are previously referred to as other loss net is still expected to be $25 million for 2011. 
As I mentioned previously, capital expenditures are now expected to be approximately 10% of revenue. Our guidance is based on our forecast expectations of continued growth and increased operating efficiencies. I'm excited about the opportunities for the company. We believe that disciplined execution of opportunities that leverage our competitive advantages will provide a platform for long-term profitable growth. 
With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

We are seeing a combination of a record number of new domain name registrations and strengthening in renewal rates. Also, we continue to achieve ongoing operating margin expansion through disciplined operations. And our balance sheet remains healthy, which allows us to declare a special dividend and to have repurchased $200 million in shares in the first quarter. 
As a leading Internet infrastructure provider, our business is being driven by the continued growth in underlying Internet trends such as online advertising, e-commerce, more global Internet users and the paradigm shift to cloud computing.  We believe we are well positioned to participate in driving and securing that growth as well as to help our customers strengthen the integrity and effectiveness of their Internet services. 
Before getting into first quarter results, I'd like to comment on the $2.75 per share special dividend that we announced today. As you may recall, in December of last year, when we paid out a $3 special dividend, we expressed our intention that we would return to shareholders at least the proceeds from the sale of our Authentication Service business, which was approximately $1.3 billion. 
With the $3 special dividend in December, the $200 million of share repurchases in the first quarter and today's $2.75 special dividend, we have returned an excess to proceeds of that sale to the shareholders. Post this dividend payment of $463 million, as well as the related contingent interest payment of $100 million to holders of our convertible bonds, we have approximately $1.4 billion remaining on the balance sheet.  Following the first quarter share repurchases, we have approximately $1.2 billion remaining in share repurchase authorization, which has no expiration. 
Now I'm moving on to first quarter results. In Registry Services, the base of registered names in .com and .net totaled 108 million names at the end of March. This represents a 9% increase year-over-year in the base and an approximately 3% increase quarter-over-quarter. 
In the first quarter, we processed a record 8.3 million new registrations, which is an approximately 3% increase year-over-year. And in the quarter, we added 2.74 million net names to the domain name base. 
On the renewal rate side, the Q4 2010 renewal rate was 72.7%. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2011 will be between 73.5% and 74%.  We expect the Q2 net names added to the base to be between 2 million and 2.3 million names, which reflect the continued growth in the underlying drivers of the Internet, as well as seasonality. 
As many of you are aware, our contract with ICANN for .net comes up for renewal on June 30 of this year. On April 11, we announced that ICANN had posted the negotiated renewal terms for the .net Registry Agreement for public comment. There are no material changes to the terms of the proposed renewal agreement from the existing agreement. ICANN's internal policies call for a common period for the proposed agreement, which we expect will run for approximately 30 days. And we expect the agreement to be renewed by July 1. 
I would also like to highlight that we successfully implemented DNSSEC in the .com zone on March 31, following implementation of DNSSEC in .net in December and the root zone last fall. This is a significant accomplishment of us teams. It has been in the works for many years, and it required collaboration with numerous constituencies in the Internet ecosystem. We're proud of the role we played in this multi-stakeholder initiative. 
With regard to the case filed by the Coalition for ICANN Transparency or CFIT against VeriSign, the court established a timeline for the litigation last October that included a summary judgment hearing this past March on certain threshold issues. That hearing took place in March 11, and the matter is pending with the court. We have no other updates on that motion.
Also, as noted in our 8-K filed on February 14, the court dismissed CFIT's third amendment complaint and allowed for CFIT to amend certain allegations. CFIT subsequently filed a fourth amended complaint, and VeriSign filed an answer to that complaint on March 8. According to the court schedule, final summary judgment hearing is scheduled for October 2011, and a trial date is set for December 5, 2011. Beyond the dates just mentioned, given that this is ongoing litigation, we will not be commenting further other than to reiterate that we continue to feel confident about the case, and we'll defend our position vigorously. 
With regard to our Network Intelligence and Availability business, we continue to make good progress. On March 31, we announced 2 enhancements to our Managed DNS service, including the rollout of support for DNSSEC compliance features, as well as Geo Location. These services strengthen our offering, and we'll continue to strive for a leadership position in this fast-growing, but bright-end market. With the first quarter results, we're out with a good start to the year, and we look forward to updating you on our progress through the year. 
Thanks for your time. And I'll now turn the call over to Brian."

As Mark said, this was a good quarter for us. And I'm pleased about the progress we made toward our goals. I'd like to add to Mark's comments regarding the $2.75% per share special dividend. We view the divide",821,"Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. As Mark said, this was a good quarter for us. And I'm pleased about the progress we made toward our goals. 
I'd like to add to Mark's comments regarding the $2.75% per share special dividend. We view the dividend as an efficient return to shareholders, given our capital position, following the sale of Authentication Services.  
From a taxability perspective, which is impacted by the $100 million contingent interest payment to our convertible bondholders, we believe most, if not all, the dividend would likely be a return of capital to the shareholders, and the remainder would be a qualified dividend as defined under the Internal Revenue Code. 
Let me quickly recap our performance this quarter on our key operating metrics, which are revenue, preferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS growth and free cash flow. And then I'll discuss progress towards our annual guidance.
Revenue of $180 million for the first quarter was up 2% from a prior quarter and up 12% year-over-year. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $699 million, an increase of $36 million or 5% from Q4 and up 13% from the same period in 2010. Deferred revenue has been reported on a continuing operations or Naming Services basis since the second quarter of last year. And as of this quarter, the balance sheet is also a clean comparison.
Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses were $98 million, down 1% quarter-over-quarter and relatively flat year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin for Q1 was 45.9% compared to 44.3% in Q4. We expect continued margin expansion in line with our previously stated intention of achieving a 46% to 48% exit margin in the fourth quarter of this year. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $55 million, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.32 compared to $0.31 in Q4 and $0.22 in the same period in 2010.
Income related to transition services included as part of our nonoperating income on the P&L was approximately $3.5 million in the first quarter. A quick comment on taxes. We continue to believe a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 30% is reasonable estimate. In 2011, we will pay cash taxes of approximately $40 million, of which $28 million is related to the divestiture of the Authentication Services business. 
We exit Q1 with the diluted share count of 172 million shares. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was approximately 500,000 shares based on the average share price during the quarter. Operating cash flow on a consolidated basis was $90 million in first quarter, noting that bonus payments are made in the quarter. Free cash flow was $78 million in Q1, given a $4 million excess tax benefits and $16 million in capital expenditures in the quarter.
Capital expenditures are on track this quarter and include certain infrastructure initiatives as was facilities-related expenditures corresponding to the move of corporate headquarters. We now believe capital expenditures to be closer to 10% of revenue in 2011, given anticipated facilities spend related to the move of corporate headquarters to our new lease space. 
To sum up, we're pleased with our performance. We continue to grow non-GAAP operating income and net income faster than revenue. We have a healthy cash position, and the strong cash flow generation capabilities of our business continue to be a key benefit of our financial model. 
Before I move on to guidance, I want to touch upon the status of the transition of Authentication Services business to Symantec and corporate functions of these folks. Progress has been good, and we still expect the bulk of the transition to be wrapped up in mid-2011. 
As noted previously, income related to transition services in Q1 was approximately $3.5 million, and we now expect approximately $2 million in Q2 and approximately $2 million in the second half of the year. I would like to thank the entire team for their collaboration this past quarter. I wish our Mountain View colleagues, moving on to new opportunities in the Bay Area, all the best in their new endeavors. 
With respect to 2011 guidance, revenue for 2011 will be in the range of $756 million to $780 million or growth of 11% to 14%, up from 10% to 14%. Consistent with 2010, we expect non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 78%. Q4 2011 exit non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be 46% to 48%. Interest expense in nonoperating income net, which are previously referred to as other loss net is still expected to be $25 million for 2011. 
As I mentioned previously, capital expenditures are now expected to be approximately 10% of revenue. Our guidance is based on our forecast expectations of continued growth and increased operating efficiencies. 
I'm excited about the opportunities for the company. We believe that disciplined execution of opportunities that leverage our competitive advantages will provide a platform for long-term profitable growth. 
With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

As far as the strength behind us, coming off of a bad economy, that certainly has given us a big lift in the last 12 months to the name base and Internet. Online advertising spending is up very, very well in that same period. So on a quarter-over-quarter basis, I saw a staff the other day saying online advertising has reached its highest level of spend ever. So I think those are the drivers and will continue to see those drivers move forward. Seasonality-wise, the first quarter is very strong for us, the strongest quarter. We do see seasonality dropping into the second quarter and the third quarter traditionally and kind of a flat uppish a little bit in the fourth quarter. So we expect that seasonality to continue."

We, primarily, would consider ourselves back-end service providers as a registry as opposed to the front-end marketing engine of those things. But we do know that whatever the go-to market model looks like for that, there's a cost associated with the plan for those, which is about $185,000 registration fee per name."

36216,129456800,119421,"VeriSign Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2011",2011-04-28,"Earnings Calls","VeriSign, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone. We continue to be pleased with the company's performance. We are seeing a combination of a record number of new domain name registrations and strengthening in renewal rates. Also, we continue to achieve ongoing ope",878,"Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone. We continue to be pleased with the company's performance. We are seeing a combination of a record number of new domain name registrations and strengthening in renewal rates. Also, we continue to achieve ongoing operating margin expansion through disciplined operations. And our balance sheet remains healthy, which allows us to declare a special dividend and to have repurchased $200 million in shares in the first quarter. 
As a leading Internet infrastructure provider, our business is being driven by the continued growth in underlying Internet trends such as online advertising, e-commerce, more global Internet users and the paradigm shift to cloud computing.  We believe we are well positioned to participate in driving and securing that growth as well as to help our customers strengthen the integrity and effectiveness of their Internet services. 
Before getting into first quarter results, I'd like to comment on the $2.75 per share special dividend that we announced today. As you may recall, in December of last year, when we paid out a $3 special dividend, we expressed our intention that we would return to shareholders at least the proceeds from the sale of our Authentication Service business, which was approximately $1.3 billion. 
With the $3 special dividend in December, the $200 million of share repurchases in the first quarter and today's $2.75 special dividend, we have returned an excess to proceeds of that sale to the shareholders. Post this dividend payment of $463 million, as well as the related contingent interest payment of $100 million to holders of our convertible bonds, we have approximately $1.4 billion remaining on the balance sheet.  Following the first quarter share repurchases, we have approximately $1.2 billion remaining in share repurchase authorization, which has no expiration. 
Now I'm moving on to first quarter results. In Registry Services, the base of registered names in .com and .net totaled 108 million names at the end of March. This represents a 9% increase year-over-year in the base and an approximately 3% increase quarter-over-quarter. 
In the first quarter, we processed a record 8.3 million new registrations, which is an approximately 3% increase year-over-year. And in the quarter, we added 2.74 million net names to the domain name base. 
On the renewal rate side, the Q4 2010 renewal rate was 72.7%. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2011 will be between 73.5% and 74%.  We expect the Q2 net names added to the base to be between 2 million and 2.3 million names, which reflect the continued growth in the underlying drivers of the Internet, as well as seasonality. 
As many of you are aware, our contract with ICANN for .net comes up for renewal on June 30 of this year. On April 11, we announced that ICANN had posted the negotiated renewal terms for the .net Registry Agreement for public comment. There are no material changes to the terms of the proposed renewal agreement from the existing agreement. ICANN's internal policies call for a comment period for the proposed agreement, which we expect will run for approximately 30 days. And we expect the agreement to be renewed by July 1. 
I would also like to highlight that we successfully implemented DNSSEC in the .com zone on March 31, following implementation of DNSSEC in .net in December and the root zone last fall. This is a significant accomplishment of both teams, that has been in the works for many years, and that required collaboration with numerous constituencies in the Internet ecosystem. We're proud of the role we played in this multi-stakeholder initiative. 
With regard to the case filed by the Coalition for ICANN Transparency or CFIT against VeriSign, the court established a timeline for the litigation last October that included a summary judgment hearing this past March on certain threshold issues. That hearing took place in March 11, and the matter is pending with the court. We have no other updates on that motion.
Also, as noted in our 8-K filed on February 14, the court dismissed CFIT's third amended complaint and allowed for CFIT to amend certain allegations. CFIT subsequently filed a fourth amended complaint, and VeriSign filed an answer to that complaint on March 8. According to the court schedule, final summary judgment hearing is scheduled for October 2011, and a trial date is set for December 5, 2011. Beyond the dates just mentioned, given that this is ongoing litigation, we will not be commenting further other than to reiterate that we continue to feel confident about the case, and we'll defend our position vigorously. 
With regard to our Network Intelligence and Availability business, we continue to make good progress. On March 31, we announced 2 enhancements to our Managed DNS service, including the rollout of support for DNSSEC compliance features, as well as Geo Location. These services strengthen our offering, and we'll continue to strive for a leadership position in this fast-growing, but bright-end market. With the first quarter results, we're off to a good start for the year, and we look forward to updating you on our progress through the year. 
Thanks for your time. And I'll now turn the call over to Brian."

I'd like to add to Mark's comments regarding the $2.75 per share special dividend. We use ta dividend as an efficient return to shareholders, given our capital position, following the sale of Authentication Services.  
From a taxability perspective, which is impacted by the $100 million contingent interest payment to our convertible bondholders, we believe most, if not all, the dividend would likely be a return of capital to the shareholders, and the remainder would be a qualified dividend as defined under the Internal Revenue Code. 
Let me quickly recap our performance this quarter on our key operating metrics, which are revenue, preferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS growth and free cash flow. And then I'll discuss progress towards our annual guidance.
Revenue of $182 million for the first quarter was up 2% from a prior quarter and up 12% year-over-year. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $699 million, an increase of $36 million or 5% from Q4 and up 13% from the same period in 2010. Deferred revenue has been reported on a continuing operations or Naming Services basis since the second quarter of last year. And as of this quarter, the balance sheet is also a clean comparison.
Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses were $98 million, down 1% quarter-over-quarter and relatively flat year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin for Q1 was 45.9% compared to 44.3% in Q4. We expect continued margin expansion in line with our previously stated intention of achieving a 46% to 48% exit margin in the fourth quarter of this year. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $55 million, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.32 compared to $0.31 in Q4 and $0.22 in the same period in 2010.
Income related to transition services included as part of our nonoperating income on the P&L was approximately $3.5 million in the first quarter. A quick comment on taxes. We continue to believe a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 30% is reasonable estimate. In 2011, we will pay cash taxes of approximately $40 million, of which $28 million is related to the divestiture of the Authentication Services business. 
We exit Q1 with the diluted share count of 172 million shares. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was approximately 500,000 shares based on the average share price during the quarter. Operating cash flow on a consolidated basis was $90 million in first quarter, noting that bonus payments are made in the quarter. Free cash flow was $78 million in Q1, given $4 million excess tax benefits and $16 million in capital expenditures in the quarter.
Capital expenditures are on track this quarter and include certain infrastructure initiatives as was facilities-related expenditures corresponding to the move of corporate headquarters. We now believe capital expenditures to be closer to 10% of revenue in 2011, given anticipated facilities spend related to the move of corporate headquarters to our new lease space. 
To sum up, we're pleased with our performance. We continue to grow non-GAAP operating income and net income faster than revenue. We have a healthy cash position, and the strong cash flow generation capabilities of our business continued to be a key benefit of our financial model. 
Before I move on to guidance, I want to touch upon the status of the transition of Authentication Services business to Symantec and corporate functions to the east coast. Progress has been good, and we still expect the bulk of the transition to be wrapped up in mid-2011. 
As noted previously, income related to transition services in Q1 was approximately $3.5 million, and we now expect approximately $2 million in Q2 and approximately $2 million in the second half of the year. I would like to thank the entire team for their collaboration this past quarter. I wish our Mountain View colleagues, moving on to new opportunities in the Bay Area, all the best in their new endeavors. 
With respect to 2011 guidance, revenue for 2011 will be in the range of $756 million to $780 million or growth of 11% to 14%, up from 10% to 14%. Consistent with 2010, we expect non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 78%. Q4 2011 exit non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be 46% to 48%. Interest expense in nonoperating income net, which I previously referred to as other loss net is still expected to be $25 million for 2011. 
As I mentioned previously, capital expenditures are now expected to be approximately 10% of revenue. Our guidance is based on our forecast expectations of continued growth and increased operating efficiencies. 
I'm excited about the opportunities for the company. We believe that disciplined execution of opportunities that leverage our competitive advantages will provide a platform for long-term profitable growth. 
With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

This had some advantages with being timely and tax-advantageous in a way to give proceeds back to their shareholders. We still have $1.4 billion of cash on balance sheet with the remaining share authorization of $1.2 billion, and so we feel like we have good flexibility and a strong balance sheet."

36216,129456800,119636,"VeriSign Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2011",2011-04-28,"Earnings Calls","VeriSign, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone.

We are seeing a combination of a record number of new domain name registrations and strengthening in renewal rates. Also, we continue to achieve ongoing operating margin expansion through disciplined operations. And our balance sheet remains healthy, which allows us to declare a special dividend and to have repurchased $200 million in shares in the first quarter. 
As a leading Internet infrastructure provider, our business is being driven by the continued growth in underlying Internet trends such as online advertising, e-commerce, more global Internet users and the paradigm shift to cloud computing.  We believe we are well positioned to participate in driving and securing that growth as well as to help our customers strengthen the integrity and effectiveness of their Internet services. 
Before getting into first quarter results, I'd like to comment on the $2.75 per share special dividend that we announced today. As you may recall, in December of last year, when we paid out a $3 special dividend, we expressed our intention that we would return to shareholders at least the proceeds from the sale of our Authentication Service business, which was approximately $1.3 billion. 
With the $3 special dividend in December, the $200 million of share repurchases in the first quarter and today's $2.75 special dividend, we have returned an excess to proceeds of that sale to the shareholders. Post this dividend payment of $463 million, as well as the related contingent interest payment of $100 million to holders of our convertible bonds, we have approximately $1.4 billion remaining on the balance sheet.  Following the first quarter share repurchases, we have approximately $1.2 billion remaining in share repurchase authorization, which has no expiration. 
Now I'm moving on to first quarter results. In Registry Services, the base of registered names in .com and .net totaled 108 million names at the end of March. This represents a 9% increase year-over-year in the base and an approximately 3% increase quarter-over-quarter. 
In the first quarter, we processed a record 8.3 million new registrations, which is an approximately 3% increase year-over-year. And in the quarter, we added 2.74 million net names to the domain name base. 
On the renewal rate side, the Q4 2010 renewal rate was 72.7%. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2011 will be between 73.5% and 74%.  We expect the Q2 net names added to the base to be between 2 million and 2.3 million names, which reflect the continued growth in the underlying drivers of the Internet, as well as seasonality. 
As many of you are aware, our contract with ICANN for .net comes up for renewal on June 30 of this year. On April 11, we announced that ICANN had posted the negotiated renewal terms for the .net Registry Agreement for public comment. There are no material changes to the terms of the proposed renewal agreement from the existing agreement. ICANN's internal policies call for a comment period for the proposed agreement, which we expect will run for approximately 30 days. And we expect the agreement to be renewed by July 1. 
I would also like to highlight that we successfully implemented DNSSEC in the .com zone on March 31, following implementation of DNSSEC in .net in December and the root zone last fall. This is a significant accomplishment of both teams, that has been in the works for many years, and that required collaboration with numerous constituencies in the Internet ecosystem. We're proud of the role we played in this multi-stakeholder initiative. 
With regard to the case filed by the Coalition for ICANN Transparency or CFIT against VeriSign, the court established a timeline for the litigation last October that included a summary judgment hearing this past March on certain threshold issues. That hearing took place in March 11, and the matter is pending with the court. We have no other updates on that motion.
Also, as noted in our 8-K filed on February 14, the court dismissed CFIT's third amended complaint and allowed for CFIT to amend certain allegations. CFIT subsequently filed a fourth amended complaint, and VeriSign filed an answer to that complaint on March 8. According to the court schedule, final summary judgment hearing is scheduled for October 2011, and a trial date is set for December 5, 2011. Beyond the dates just mentioned, given that this is ongoing litigation, we will not be commenting further other than to reiterate that we continue to feel confident about the case, and we'll defend our position vigorously. 
With regard to our Network Intelligence and Availability business, we continue to make good progress. On March 31, we announced 2 enhancements to our Managed DNS service, including the rollout of support for DNSSEC compliance features, as well as Geo Location. These services strengthen our offering, and we'll continue to strive for a leadership position in this fast-growing, but bright-end market. With the first quarter results, we're off to a good start for the year, and we look forward to updating you on our progress through the year. 
Thanks for your time. And I'll now turn the call over to Brian."

We use the dividend",821,"Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. As Mark said, this was a good quarter for us. And I'm pleased about the progress we made toward our goals. 
I'd like to add to Mark's comments regarding the $2.75 per share special dividend. We use the dividend as an efficient return to shareholders, given our capital position, following the sale of Authentication Services.  
From a taxability perspective, which is impacted by the $100 million contingent interest payment to our convertible bondholders, we believe most, if not all, the dividend would likely be a return of capital to the shareholders, and the remainder would be a qualified dividend as defined under the Internal Revenue Code. 
Let me quickly recap our performance this quarter on our key operating metrics, which are revenue, preferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS growth and free cash flow. And then I'll discuss progress towards our annual guidance.
Revenue of $182 million for the first quarter was up 2% from a prior quarter and up 12% year-over-year. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $699 million, an increase of $36 million or 5% from Q4 and up 13% from the same period in 2010. Deferred revenue has been reported on a continuing operations or Naming Services basis since the second quarter of last year. And as of this quarter, the balance sheet is also a clean comparison.
Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses were $98 million, down 1% quarter-over-quarter and relatively flat year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin for Q1 was 45.9% compared to 44.3% in Q4. We expect continued margin expansion in line with our previously stated intention of achieving a 46% to 48% exit margin in the fourth quarter of this year. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $55 million, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.32 compared to $0.31 in Q4 and $0.22 in the same period in 2010.
Income related to transition services included as part of our nonoperating income on the P&L was approximately $3.5 million in the first quarter. A quick comment on taxes. We continue to believe a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 30% is reasonable estimate. In 2011, we will pay cash taxes of approximately $40 million, of which $28 million is related to the divestiture of the Authentication Services business. 
We exit Q1 with the diluted share count of 172 million shares. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was approximately 500,000 shares based on the average share price during the quarter. Operating cash flow on a consolidated basis was $90 million in first quarter, noting that bonus payments are made in the quarter. Free cash flow was $78 million in Q1, given $4 million excess tax benefits and $16 million in capital expenditures in the quarter.
Capital expenditures are on track this quarter and include certain infrastructure initiatives as was facilities-related expenditures corresponding to the move of corporate headquarters. We now believe capital expenditures to be closer to 10% of revenue in 2011, given anticipated facilities spend related to the move of corporate headquarters to our new lease space. 
To sum up, we're pleased with our performance. We continue to grow non-GAAP operating income and net income faster than revenue. We have a healthy cash position, and the strong cash flow generation capabilities of our business continued to be a key benefit of our financial model. 
Before I move on to guidance, I want to touch upon the status of the transition of Authentication Services business to Symantec and corporate functions to the east coast. Progress has been good, and we still expect the bulk of the transition to be wrapped up in mid-2011. 
As noted previously, income related to transition services in Q1 was approximately $3.5 million, and we now expect approximately $2 million in Q2 and approximately $2 million in the second half of the year. I would like to thank the entire team for their collaboration this past quarter. I wish our Mountain View colleagues, moving on to new opportunities in the Bay Area, all the best in their new endeavors. 
With respect to 2011 guidance, revenue for 2011 will be in the range of $756 million to $780 million or growth of 11% to 14%, up from 10% to 14%. Consistent with 2010, we expect non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 78%. Q4 2011 exit non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be 46% to 48%. Interest expense in nonoperating income net, which I previously referred to as other loss net is still expected to be $25 million for 2011. 
As I mentioned previously, capital expenditures are now expected to be approximately 10% of revenue. Our guidance is based on our forecast expectations of continued growth and increased operating efficiencies. 
I'm excited about the opportunities for the company. We believe that disciplined execution of opportunities that leverage our competitive advantages will provide a platform for long-term profitable growth. 
With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

And usually, we've seen multiple percentage point higher than that. So that's only one quarter where we're seeing this. I don't want to call anything based on just one quarter worth of data. I did look inside the international piece of it to look at various countries, and we still continue to see some countries growing at very, very healthy rates like China. It grew to about 21%. Yes, 21%. India's got 11%. EMEA as a group has 13%. There were a couple of laggards. Brazil was down about 10%. Australia was down about 5%. So there's still high growth ones in there. There's been some ones that have dropped off a bit in the last quarter. And when we've put that all through the wash, we've got international about 1 percentage point higher growth than domestic.

Second quarter was another quarter for VeriSign and we continue to be pleased with company's performance. In our Naming business, we exceeded 8 million new domain name registrations for the second consecutive quarter. In addition, through continued from operations, we were able to achieve ongoing operating margin expansion. Also, our balance sheet remains healthy which allowed us to repurchase $100 million in shares in the second quarter, leaving us with approximately $1.1 billion under the current share repurchase authorization program. 
Before I get into Q2 results, I want to highlight and comment on few key events from a busy quarter. First on May 11, we announced that VeriSign entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release with the Coalition for ICANN Transparency, or CFIT, which resolved the over five-year long CFIT litigation. As we indicated in the press release and 8-K, under the terms of the agreement, CFIT filed dismissal with prejudice of all claims and the litigation. Further, there was no payment associated with the dismissal and the parties executed into releases from all claims now and in the future related to the litigation. As we've stated in the past, we always believe the case to be without merit. 
Second, on June 20, ICANN announced its Board of Directors have approved the plan to increase the number of generic top-level domains. We view the introduction of new gTLDs as an adjacent growth opportunity. We believe that VeriSign experienced and trusted brand should make us a logical choice to operate the registry for many organizations applying for new gTLDs. ICANN announced that we will begin accepting new applications for new gTLDs on January 12, 2012. 
On June 28, we are pleased to announce that ICANN and VeriSign had renewed VeriSign's contract to serve as the authoritative registry operator for the .net registry for another 6 years. With the steady growth in Internet and the ever increasing demand on the DNS, VeriSign is committed to invest in, scale and enhance our world-class infrastructure that supports .net to ensure continued, secure, stable operation. We are proud to be as an entrusted with the continued responsibility of running .net. 
And lastly, by way of updating the third quarter, on July 14, we announced an increase in the registry domain name fees for .com and .net per our agreements with ICANN. As of January 15, 2012, the registry fee for .com domain names will increase from $7.34 to $7.85. And the registry fee for .net domain names will increase from $4.65 to $5.11. The fee increases will have no direct impact to 2011 revenue since the increases are not effective until January 15, 2012. Continued strong global Internet usage growth, along with increasingly powerful cyber attacks leveled against all parts of the internet's critical infrastructure, have dramatically increased the demands on Internet Infrastructure providers. The volume of DNS queries on VeriSign's global Internet infrastructure has more than doubled in the last 5 years. Future growth is expected to occur in an even faster pace. VeriSign's infrastructure has maintains 100% operational stability for more than a decade due to continued innovation and investment in the infrastructure. I'll comment now on second quarter results.
At registry services, the base of registered names in .com and .net totaled approximately 110 million names at the end of June. This represents an 8% increase year-over-year in the base and an approximately 2% increase quarter-over-quarter. In the quarter, we added 1.95 million net names to domain name base. In the second quarter, we processed 8.1 million new registrations, which is approximately 2% increase year-over-year. This is the company's second-largest quarter in the history of registrations. On the renewal rate side, the Q1 2011 renewal rate was 73.8%. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal for the second quarter of 2011 will be approximately 73.5%. We expect the Q3 net names added to the base to be between 1.8 million and 2.1 million names, which reflects the continuous growth in the underlying of the internet, as well as seasonality.
With regard to our NIA business, we have ramped up our sales efforts, saw positive tracks in the market, and again exceeded our plan bookings metrics during the second quarter. Additionally, our product roadmaps of offerings and enhancements has allowed us to deliver services to the market that addresses the growing complexity of managing networks in an era of cloud computing. We believe we're well-positioned for a leadership role in this fast-growing but fragmented market. With the second quarter behind us, we've capped a solid first half of 2011 and look forward to updating you on our third-quarter Earnings Call. Thanks for your attention and I'll now turn the call over to Brian."

As Mike said, this was another solid quarter for us, and I'm pleased about the progress we have made towards our goals. Let me quickly recap of our performance this quarter on our key operating metrics which are",769,"Thanks, Mark. And good afternoon, everyone. As Mike said, this was another solid quarter for us, and I'm pleased about the progress we have made towards our goals. Let me quickly recap of our performance this quarter on our key operating metrics which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS growth and free cash flow, and then I'll discuss progress towards our annual guidance.
Revenue of $109 million for the second quarter was up 5% from the prior quarter and up 13% year-over-year. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $714 million, an increase of $15 million or 2% from 1Q and up 11% in the same period in 2010. Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses were $92 million, down 7% quarter-over-quarter and down 8% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin for Q2 was 51.7%, compared to 45.9% in Q1. Second quarter margin expansion was driven primarily by the $6 million nonrecurring recruit expense reversal taken during the quarter, which increased operating margin by 3.1%. Additionally, we realized cost savings through streamlining business as we have completed our divestitures. We have achieved these savings in G&A support services and we realized them faster than expected. Based on the progress to date, we expect fourth quarter 2011 exit non-GAAP operating margin to be at least 48%. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $65 million, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.38 compared to $0.32 in Q1, and $0.23 in the same period in 2010. Non-GAAP earnings per share for the second quarter of 2011 include the $6 million recurring recruite expense reversal which increased diluted earnings by $0.02 per share. Income related transition services included as part of nonoperating income in the P&L was approximately $2.3 million in the second quarter. 
A quick comment on taxes, we continue to believe in non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 30% is a reasonable estimate. In 2011, we expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $40 million, $28 million of which is related to the divestiture of Authentication Services. We exit Q2 with a diluted share count of $170 million shares. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was approximately $1 million shares of business an average share price during the quarter. Operating cash flow on a consolidated basis was $13 million in the second quarter, noting that the contingent interest payment totaling $100 million was paid on May 18, 2011. Free cash flow was negative $4 million in Q2, given a $3 million decrease in excess tax benefits, and $14 million in capital expenditures in the quarter. We still believe capital will be approximately 10% revenue in 2011, given anticipated facilities that relates to the move our corporate headquarters. 
As a quick housekeeping item, we've now included unrealized gain loss on contingent interest derivative on convertible debentures as a non-GAAP item. You'll announce this item on a reconciliation statement with first quarter showing $250,000 loss while Q2 showed a $700,000 gain. 
To sum up, we're pleased with our performance. We continue to grow non-GAAP operating income and net income with a healthy cash position and a strong cash generating capabilities our business continues to be a key benefit of our financial model. We're pleased to report on a stance of transitional Authentication Services to Symantec and corporate function to the East Coast. Progress has been on track with the bulk of the transition ramped up. I would like to thank both the East Coast and West Coast employees for their hard work and dedication and making us a successful transition. As noted previously, income related to transition services in Q2 was approximately $2.3 million. We now expect approximately $2 million in the second half of the year. Let's move on to guidance.
2011 guidance. We have tightened revenue for 2011 will be in the range of $765 million to $775 million or growth of 12% to 14%. We now expect non-GAAP gross margin approximately 79%, Q4 exit non-GAAP operating margin as mentioned earlier, is expected to be at least 48%. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net, which are previously referred to as other loss, net, is still expected to be $25 million for 2011. As I mentioned previously, capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 10% of revenue. Our guidance is based on expectations of continued growth and increased operating efficiencies in our businesses and in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expenses.
I am excited about the opportunities for the company. We believe that disciplined execution opportunities that leverage our competitive advantages will  provide platform for long-term profitable growth. I'll now turn the call back to Jim. Jim?"

We relocated our headquarters from California to Virginia. Throughout what was at times, a very challenging restructuring, we maintained a perfect operational record. And in just the last 6 months, we've favorably settled a long-standing lawsuit with renewed.net and expanded our core business with our NIEE. Mark led the company through much of this transition and its contributions to our success are significant and appreciated by the board and employees.

As I said in my prepared remarks, we report an operating margin of 51.7% for the second quarter, the one-time expense reversal $6 million added 3.1%, so if you adjust for this operating margin, our normalized basis would've been 48.6%. The increase in the second quarter was attributed to a couple of things. We had a slower ramp and new hires anticipated. And we achieved across-the-board G&A savings. And then finally, we really completed the transition from the West Coast to the East Coast. We only have a few employees remaining on the West Coast that we're transitioning and the last will because notified on August. So I think from a margin perspective we've taken out most of the excess, if you will. We did increase our operating exit run rate guidance within the year to say at least 48% from 46%, 48%, we will continue to try to extract savings out of the business. On the cash side, I guess first, let's step back and one of the things that we said earlier was that over the course of 2011, as we would return the remaining proceeds from the Authentication Services divestiture, if you look from Q4 to this quarter, we paid about $1 billion in special dividends, $200 million in contingent interest, and have done about $350 million of buybacks. So we've returned about $105 billion, which is in excess of proceeds to be received from Symantec. We've just have over $1 billion remaining on the buy back authorization. If you look at the balance sheet, about a little over $300 million is domestic, about $1.1 billion is international, and we're committed to returning value to shareholders and we'll evaluating quarterly of the most effective way of achieving it."

So what that namespace and what that opportunity represents from that perspective is just really, really difficult to identify. We just simply can't tell you. I think the best way to think about this is that the market is going to emerge in the wake is yet undetermined. And that to be the longest operating registry with the longest record of uptime and availability and reliability are best positioned to exploit that market. That's the best offering we have essentially the premier service provider to what will undoubtedly be a number of people who have no registry experience. ICANN has also said that one of the most important things about the top-level domain is that the operation has to be demonstrably secure. It needs reliability and security first and foremost and so I think that bodes well for our opportunity, but I think it's just virtually impossible for us to predict what that market might look like, how big it might grow and what direction it might take.

Second quarter was another quarter for VeriSign, and we continue to be pleased with the company's performance. In our Naming business, we exceeded 8 million new domain name registrations for the second consecutive quarter. In addition, through continued disciplined operations, we were able to achieve ongoing operating margin expansion. Also, our balance sheet remains healthy, which allowed us to repurchase $100 million in shares in the second quarter, leaving us with approximately $1.1 billion under the current share repurchase authorization program. 
Before I get into Q2 results, I want to highlight and comment on a few key events from a busy quarter. First, on May 11, we announced that VeriSign entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release with the Coalition for ICANN Transparency, or CFIT, which resolved the over 5-year long CFIT litigation. As we indicated in the press release and 8-K, under the terms of the agreement, CFIT filed a dismissal with prejudice of all claims in the litigation. Further, there was no payment associated with the dismissal, and the parties executed mutual releases from all claims now and in the future related to the litigation. As we've stated in the past, we always believe the case to be without merit. 
Second, on June 20, ICANN announced that its Board of Directors had approved their plan to increase the number of generic top-level domains. We view the introduction of new gTLDs as an adjacent growth opportunity. We believe that VeriSign's experienced and trusted brand should make us a logical choice to operate the registry for many organizations applying for new gTLDs. ICANN announced they will begin accepting applications for new gTLDs on January 12, 2012. 
On June 28, we were pleased to announce that ICANN and VeriSign had renewed VeriSign's contract to serve as the authoritative registry operator for the .net registry for another 6 years. With the steady growth of the Internet and the ever-increasing demand on the DNS, VeriSign is committed to invest in, scale and enhance our world-class infrastructure that supports .net to ensure its continued, secure, stable operation. We are proud that we have been entrusted with the continued responsibility of running .net. 
And lastly, by way of updating the third quarter, on July 14, we announced an increase in registry domain name fees for .com and .net per our agreements with ICANN. As of January 15, 2012, the registry fee for .com domain names will increase from $7.34 to $7.85, and the registry fee for .net domain names will increase from $4.65 to $5.11. The fee increases will have no direct impact to 2011 revenue since the increases are not effective until January 15, 2012. 
Continued strong global Internet usage growth, along with increasingly powerful cyber attacks, leveled against all parts of the Internet's critical infrastructure, have dramatically increased the demands on Internet infrastructure providers. The volume of DNS queries on VeriSign's global Internet infrastructure has more than doubled in the last 5 years. Future growth is expected to occur in an even faster pace. VeriSign's infrastructure has maintained 100% operational stability for more than a decade due to continued innovation and investment in the infrastructure. 
I'll comment now on second quarter results. At registry services, the base of registered names in .com and .net totaled approximately 110 million names at the end of June. This represents an 8% increase year-over-year in the base and an approximately 2% increase quarter-over-quarter. In the quarter, we added 1.95 million net names to the domain name base. In the second quarter, we processed 8.1 million new registrations, which is in approximately 2% increase year-over-year. This is the company's second largest quarter in our history of new registrations. 
On the renewal rate side, the Q1 2011 renewal rate was 73.8%. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2011 will be approximately 73.5%. We expect the Q3 net names added to the base to be between 1.8 million and 2.1 million names, which reflects the continued growth in the underlying drivers of the Internet, as well as seasonality.
With regard to our NIA business, we have ramped up our sales efforts, saw positive traction in the market, and again exceeded our planned bookings metrics during the second quarter. Additionally, our product roadmap of offerings and enhancements has allowed us to deliver services to the market that addresses the growing complexity of managing networks in an era of cloud computing. We believe we're well positioned for a leadership role in this fast growing but fragmented market. With the second quarter behind us, we've capped a solid first half of 2011 and look forward to updating you on our third quarter earnings call. 
Thanks for your attention, and I'll now turn the call over to Brian."

As Mark said, this was another solid quarter for us, and I'm pleased about the progress we have made towards our goals. Let me quickly recap our performance this quarter on our key operating metrics which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS growth and free cash flow, and then I'll discuss progress towards our annual guidance.
Revenue of $190 million for the second quarter was up 5% from the prior quarter and up 13% year-over-year. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $714 million, an increase of $15 million or 2% from 1Q and up 11% from the same period in 2010. 
Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses were $92 million, down 7% quarter-over-quarter and down 8% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin for Q2 was 51.7% compared to 45.9% in Q1. Second quarter margin expansion was driven primarily by the $6 million nonrecurring accrued expense reversal taken during the quarter, which increased operating margin by 3.1%. 
Additionally, we realized cost savings through streamlining our business as we have completed our divestitures. We have achieved these savings in G&A support services and we realized them faster than expected. Based on the progress to date, we expect fourth quarter 2011 exit non-GAAP operating margin to be at least 48%. 
Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $65 million, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.38 compared to $0.32 in Q1 and $0.23 in the same period in 2010. Non-GAAP earnings per share for the second quarter of 2011 include a $6 million recurring accrued expense reversal, which increased diluted earnings by $0.02 per share. Income-related transition services, included as part of nonoperating income on the P&L, was approximately $2.3 million in the second quarter. 
A quick comment on taxes. We continue to believe a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 30% is a reasonable estimate. In 2011, we expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $40 million, $28 million of which is related to the divestiture of Authentication Services. 
We exit Q2 with a diluted share count of 170 million shares. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was approximately 1 million shares based on the average share price during the quarter. 
Operating cash flow on a consolidated basis was $13 million in the second quarter, noting that the contingent interest payment totaling $100 million was paid on May 18, 2011. Free cash flow was negative $4 million in Q2, given a $3 million decrease in excess tax benefits and $14 million in capital expenditures in the quarter. We still believe capital will be approximately 10% of revenue in 2011, given anticipated facility spend related to the move of our corporate headquarters. 
As a quick housekeeping item, we've now included unrealized gain loss on contingent interest derivative on convertible debentures as a non-GAAP item. You will now see this item on our reconciliation statement, with first quarter showing a $250,000 loss, while Q2 showed a $700,000 gain. 
To sum up, we're pleased with our performance. We continue to grow non-GAAP operating income and net income. With a healthy cash position and a strong cash flow generating capabilities, our business continue to be a key benefit of our financial model. 
We're pleased to report on the status of transitional Authentication Service business to Symantec and corporate functions to the East Coast. Progress has been on track with the bulk of the transition wrapped up. I would like to thank both the East Coast and West Coast employees for their hard work and dedication and making this a successful transition. As noted previously, income related to transition services in Q2 was approximately $2.3 million. We now expect approximately $2 million in the second half of the year. 
Let's move on to guidance, 2011 guidance. We have tightened the revenue for 2011. We'll be in the range of $765 million to $775 million or growth of 12% to 14%. We now expect non-GAAP gross margin approximately 79%. Q4 exit non-GAAP operating margin, as mentioned earlier, is expected to be at least 48%. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income, net, which are previously referred to as other loss, net, is still expected to be $25 million for 2011. As I mentioned previously, capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 10% of revenue. 
Our guidance is based on expectations of continued growth and increased operating efficiencies in our businesses, in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expenses.
I am excited about the opportunities for the company. We believe the disciplined execution opportunities that leverage our competitive advantages will provide a platform for long-term profitable growth. 
I'll now turn the call back to Jim. Jim?"

Mark's departure comes at the end of a major 4-year restructuring for the company. We've gone from over 5,000 people to just over 1,000. We operate 15 offices internationally versus more than 80, 4 years ago. We divested a number of businesses, including our Authentication unit, and returned billions of dollars of our shareholders. We relocated our headquarters from California to Virginia. 
Throughout what was, at times, a very challenging restructuring, we maintained a perfect operational record. And in just the last 6 months, we favorably settled the long-standing CFIT lawsuit, we've renewed .net and expanded our core business with our NIA units. 
Mark led the company through much of this transition and his contributions to our success are significant and appreciated by the board and employees. Mark leaves VeriSign a stronger company with a stable and growing revenue base and an experienced management team that delivers network performance and reliability the world has come to expect, plus focused and disciplined financial management that continues to deliver profitability and shareholder returns.

As I said in my prepared remarks, we reported an operating margin of 51.7% for the second quarter, the onetime expense reversal $6 million added 3.1%. So if you adjust for this operating margin on a normalized basis, it would've been 48.6%. The increase in the second quarter was attributed to a couple of things. We had a slower ramp in new hires than anticipated, and we achieved across-the-board G&A savings. And then finally, we really completed the transition from the West Coast to the East Coast. We only have a few employees remaining on the West Coast that we're transitioning, and the last employee is being notified on August 3. So I think from a margin perspective, we've taken out most of the excess, if you will. We did increase our operating exit run rate guidance within a year to, say, it'd be at least 48% from 46%, 48%. So we will continue to try to extract savings out of the business. On the cash side, yes, I guess, first, let's step back. And one of the things that we said earlier was that over the course of the -- of 2011, as we would return the remaining proceeds from the Authentication Services divestiture, if you look from Q4 to this quarter, we paid about $1 billion in special dividends, $200 million in contingent interest and have done about $315 million of buybacks. So we've returned about $1.5 billion, which is in excess of proceeds that we received from Symantec. We have just have over $1 billion remaining on the buyback authorization. If you look at the balance sheet, about a little over $300 million is domestic, about $1.1 billion is international. And we're committed to returning value to shareholders, and we'll evaluate quarterly on the most effective way of achieving it."

Therefore, the international growth that we report versus domestic growth is getting a little cloudier. However, international continues to be very important and is still growing. So for instance, China grew 16% year-over-year, EMEA grew about 13% year-over-year and India has grown about 11% year-over-year."

Again, we don't know how many new gTLD operators will come into the business primarily to sell domain names. So what that name space and what that opportunity represents from that perspective is just really, really difficult to identify. We just simply can't tell you. I think the best way to think about this is that it's a market that's going to emerge in a way that's yet undetermined. And that we, as the longest operating registry with the longest record of uptime and availability and reliability, are best positioned to exploit that market. That's the best offering we have, to be essentially the premier service provider, to what will undoubtedly be a number of people who have no registry experience. ICANN has also said that one of the most important things about a top-level domain is that the operation has to be demonstrably secure. It needs reliability and security, first and foremost, and so I think that bodes well for our opportunity. But I think it's just virtually impossible for us to predict what that market might look like, how big it might grow and what direction it might take. So I hope that answered that question."

Second quarter was another quarter for VeriSign, and we continue to be pleased with the company's performance. In our Naming business, we exceeded 8 million new domain name registrations for the second consecutive quarter. In addition, through continued disciplined operations, we were able to achieve ongoing operating margin expansion. Also, our balance sheet remains healthy, which allowed us to repurchase $100 million in shares in the second quarter, leaving us with approximately $1.1 billion under the current share repurchase authorization program. 
Before I get into Q2 results, I want to highlight and comment on a few key events from a busy quarter. First, on May 11, we announced that VeriSign entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release with the Coalition for ICANN Transparency, or CFIT, which resolved the over 5-year long CFIT litigation. As we indicated in the press release and 8-K, under the terms of the agreement, CFIT filed a dismissal with prejudice of all claims in the litigation. Further, there was no payment associated with the dismissal, and the parties executed mutual releases from all claims now and in the future related to the litigation. As we've stated in the past, we always believe the case to be without merit. 
Second, on June 20, ICANN announced that its Board of Directors had approved their plan to increase the number of generic top-level domains. We view the introduction of new gTLDs as an adjacent growth opportunity. We believe that VeriSign's experienced and trusted brand should make us a logical choice to operate the registry for many organizations applying for new gTLDs. ICANN announced they will begin accepting applications for new gTLDs on January 12, 2012. 
On June 28, we were pleased to announce that ICANN and VeriSign had renewed VeriSign's contract to serve as the authoritative registry operator for the .net registry for another 6 years. With the steady growth of the Internet and the ever-increasing demand on the DNS, VeriSign is committed to invest in, scale and enhance our world-class infrastructure that supports .net to ensure its continued, secure, stable operation. We are proud that we have been entrusted with the continued responsibility of running .net. 
And lastly, by way of update in the third quarter, on July 14, we announced an increase in registry domain name fees for .com and .net per our agreements with ICANN. As of January 15, 2012, the registry fee for .com domain names will increase from $7.34 to $7.85, and the registry fee for .net domain names will increase from $4.65 to $5.11. The fee increases will have no direct impact to 2011 revenue since the increases are not effective until January 15, 2012. 
Continued strong global Internet usage growth, along with increasingly powerful cyber attacks, leveled against all parts of the Internet's critical infrastructure, have dramatically increased the demands on Internet infrastructure providers. The volume of DNS queries on VeriSign's global Internet infrastructure has more than doubled in the last 5 years. Future growth is expected to occur in an even faster pace. VeriSign's infrastructure has maintained 100% operational stability for more than a decade due to continued innovation and investment in the infrastructure. 
I'll comment now on second quarter results. At Registry Services, the base of registered names in .com and .net totaled approximately 110 million names at the end of June. This represents an 8% increase year-over-year in the base and an approximately 2% increase quarter-over-quarter. In the quarter, we added 1.95 million net names to the domain name base. In the second quarter, we processed 8.1 million new registrations, which is in approximately 2% increase year-over-year. This is the company's second largest quarter in our history for new registrations. 
On the renewal rate side, the Q1 2011 renewal rate was 73.8%. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2011 will be approximately 73.5%. We expect the Q3 net names added to the base to be between 1.8 million and 2.1 million names, which reflects the continued growth in the underlying drivers of the Internet, as well as seasonality.
With regard to our NIA business, we have ramped up our sales efforts, saw positive traction in the market, and again exceeded our planned bookings metrics during the second quarter. Additionally, our product roadmap of offerings and enhancements has allowed us to deliver services to the market that addresses the growing complexity of managing networks in an era of cloud computing. We believe we're well positioned for a leadership role in this fast growing but fragmented market. With the second quarter behind us, we've capped a solid first half of 2011 and look forward to updating you on our third quarter earnings call. 
Thanks for your attention, and I'll now turn the call over to Brian."

As Mark said, this was another solid quarter for us, and I'm pleased about the progress we have made towards our goals. Let me quickly recap our performance this quarter on our key operating metrics which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS growth and free cash flow, and then I'll discuss progress towards our annual guidance.
Revenue of $190 million for the second quarter was up 5% from the prior quarter and up 13% year-over-year. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $714 million, an increase of $15 million or 2% from 1Q and up 11% from the same period in 2010. 
Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses were $92 million, down 7% quarter-over-quarter and down 8% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin for Q2 was 51.7% compared to 45.9% in Q1. Second quarter margin expansion was driven primarily by the $6 million nonrecurring accrued expense reversal taken during the quarter, which increased operating margin by 3.1%. 
Additionally, we realized cost savings through streamlining our business as we have completed our divestitures. We have achieved these savings in G&A support services and we realized them faster than expected. Based on the progress to date, we expect fourth quarter 2011 exit non-GAAP operating margin to be at least 48%. 
Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $65 million, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.38 compared to $0.32 in Q1 and $0.23 in the same period in 2010. Non-GAAP earnings per share for the second quarter of 2011 includes a $6 million recurring accrued expense reversal, which increased diluted earnings by $0.02 per share. Income-related transition services, included as part of nonoperating income on the P&L, was approximately $2.3 million in the second quarter. 
A quick comment on taxes. We continue to believe a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 30% is a reasonable estimate. In 2011, we expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $40 million, $28 million of which is related to the divestiture of Authentication Services. 
We exit Q2 with a diluted share count of 170 million shares. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was approximately 1 million shares based on the average share price during the quarter. 
Operating cash flow on a consolidated basis was $13 million in the second quarter, noting that the contingent interest payment totaling $100 million was paid on May 18, 2011. Free cash flow was negative $4 million in Q2, given a $3 million decrease in excess tax benefits and $14 million in capital expenditures in the quarter. We still believe capital will be approximately 10% of revenue in 2011, given anticipated facility spend related to the move of our corporate headquarters. 
As a quick housekeeping item, we've now included unrealized gain loss on contingent interest derivative on convertible debentures as a non-GAAP item. You will now see this item on our reconciliation statement, with first quarter showing a $250,000 loss, while Q2 showed a $700,000 gain. 
To sum up, we're pleased with our performance. We continue to grow non-GAAP operating income and net income. We have a healthy cash position and a strong cash flow generating capabilities of our business continue to be a key benefit of our financial model. 
We're pleased to report on the status of transitional Authentication Service business to Symantec and corporate functions to the East Coast. Progress has been on track with the bulk of the transition wrapped up. I would like to thank both the East Coast and West Coast employees for their hard work and dedication and making this a successful transition. As noted previously, income related to transition services in Q2 was approximately $2.3 million. We now expect approximately $2 million in the second half of the year. 
Let's move on to guidance, 2011 guidance. We have tightened the revenue for 2011. We'll be in the range of $765 million to $775 million or growth of 12% to 14%. We now expect non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 79%. Q4 exit non-GAAP operating margin, as mentioned earlier, is expected to be at least 48%. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income, net, which are previously referred to as other loss, net, is still expected to be $25 million for 2011. As I mentioned previously, capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 10% of revenue. 
Our guidance is based on expectations of continued growth and increased operating efficiencies in our businesses, in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expenses.
I am excited about the opportunities for the company. We believe the disciplined execution opportunities that leverage our competitive advantages will provide a platform for long-term profitable growth. 
I'll now turn the call back to Jim. Jim?"

Mark's departure comes at the end of a major 4-year restructuring for the company. We've gone from over 5,000 people to just over 1,000. We operate 15 offices internationally versus more than 80, 4 years ago. We divested a number of businesses, including our Authentication unit, and returned billions of dollars of our shareholders. We relocated our headquarters from California to Virginia. 
Throughout what was, at times, a very challenging restructuring, we maintained a perfect operational record. And in just the last 6 months, we favorably settled the long-standing CFIT lawsuit, we've renewed .net and expanded our core business with our NIA units. 
Mark led the company through much of this transition and his contributions to our success are significant and appreciated by the board and employees. Mark leaves VeriSign a stronger company with a stable and growing revenue base and an experienced management team that delivers network performance and reliability the world has come to expect, plus focused and disciplined financial management that continues to deliver profitability and shareholder returns.

As I said in my prepared remarks, we reported an operating margin of 51.7% for the second quarter, the onetime expense reversal $6 million added 3.1%. So if you adjust for this operating margin on a normalized basis, it would've been 48.6%. The increase in the second quarter was attributed to a couple of things. We had a slower ramp in new hires than anticipated, and we achieved across-the-board G&A savings. And then finally, we really completed the transition from the West Coast to the East Coast. We only have a few employees remaining on the West Coast that we're transitioning, and the last employee is being notified on August 3. So I think from a margin perspective, we've taken out most of the excess, if you will. We did increase our operating exit run rate guidance at the end of the year to, say, it'd be at least 48% from 46%, 48%. So we will continue to try to extract savings out of the business. On the cash side, yes, I guess, first, let's step back. And one of the things that we said earlier was that over the course of the -- of 2011, is we would return the remaining proceeds from the Authentication Services divestiture, if you look from Q4 to this quarter, we paid about $1 billion in special dividends, $200 million in contingent interest and have done about $315 million of buybacks. So we've returned about $1.5 billion, which is in excess of proceeds that we received from Symantec. We have just have over $1 billion remaining on the buyback authorization. If you look at the balance sheet, about a little over $300 million is domestic, about $1.1 billion is international. And we're committed to returning value to shareholders, and we'll evaluate quarterly on the most effective way of achieving it."

Because the names don't switch until they're renewed, it's becoming difficult for us to track this activity. Therefore, the international growth that we report versus domestic growth is getting a little cloudier. However, international continues to be very important and is still growing. So for instance, China grew 16% year-over-year, EMEA grew about 13% year-over-year and India has grown about 11% year-over-year."

So what that name space and what that opportunity represents from that perspective is just really, really difficult to identify. We just simply can't tell you. I think the best way to think about this is that it's a market that's going to emerge in a way that's yet undetermined. And that we, as the longest operating registry with the longest record of uptime and availability and reliability, are best positioned to exploit that market. That's the best offering we have, to be essentially the premier service provider, to what will undoubtedly be a number of people who have no registry experience. ICANN has also said that one of the most important things about a top-level domain is that the operation has to be demonstrably secure. It needs reliability and security, first and foremost, and so I think that bodes well for our opportunity. But I think it's just virtually impossible for us to predict what that market might look like, how big it might grow and what direction it might take. So I hope that answered that question."

The third quarter was another solid quarter for VeriSign. In our Naming business, the place of registered names in .com and .net totaled approximately $112 million at the end of September. In our NIA business,",413,"Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. The third quarter was another solid quarter for VeriSign. In our Naming business, the place of registered names in .com and .net totaled approximately $112 million at the end of September. In our NIA business, we again saw a strong bookings growth. Also our strong balance sheet allowed us to repurchase 235 million in shares in the third quarter leaving us with approximately 831 million under the current share repurchases program authorization. 
I'll comment now on third quarter operating highlights.
As I mentioned previously, in our Naming business, the base of registered names in .com and .net totaled approximately $112 million at the end of September. This represents an 8% increase year-over-year in the base and an approximately 2% increase quarter-over-quarter. 
In the third quarter, we added $1.994 million, $1,994,000 net names to the domain name base, and we processed $7.9 million new registrations, which is an increase of approximately 5% year-over-year in our largest third quarter on record for new registrations. The Q2 2011 renewal rate was 73.1%. Our renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days at the end of the quarter. We believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2011 will be approximately 73.4%.
We expect the Q4 net names added to the base to be between $1.8 million and $2.1 million names, which reflects the continued growth and the underlying drivers of Internet growth, as well as seasonality. 
With regard to our NIA business, the team performed very well and exceeded target bookings for the third quarter. We continue to study this fast growing and evolving market for the best ways we might leverage our core strengths and optimize our offerings to scale for long-term success with an emphasis on quality of revenue. 
Finally, before turning the call over to John. Let me address our management changes. As you know, since August 1 of this year, I've assumed the responsibility of full-time CEO of the company. As you saw on our press release there is no change to my status and the company will not be conducting a search for a new CEO. However, we will be conducting a CFO search. Until we complete that search, John Calys is in that interim role. He's been at VeriSign for nearly a year ago and has been a successful Financial Operating Executive in other public companies as well.

Let me recap our performance this quarter on our key operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS growt",625,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. This was another solid quarter for us as Jim explained. 
Let me recap our performance this quarter on our key operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS growth and free cash flow. Then I will discuss progress towards our annual guidance for 2011. 
Revenue of $197 million for the third quarter was up 4% from the prior quarter and 14% year-over-year. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $723 million, an increase of $9 million from Q2, an 11% increase from the same period in 2010. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for Q3 was 50.1%, compared to 51.7% in Q2 which was benefited by 3.1% as a result of a $6 million non-recurring expense reversal. 
Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses were $98 million, up 7% sequentially and flat year-over-year. The third quarter operating margin expansion was driven by a revenue growth and through realizing the efficiencies in our business. 
Based on the progress to date, we expect fourth quarter 2011 exit non-GAAP operating margin to be at least 50%.
Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $64 million, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.39, compared to $0.38 in Q2 and $0.28 for the same period in 2010. 
Income related to transition services included as a part of non-operating income on the P&L was approximately $1.3 million in the third quarter and we expect approximately $1.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2011.
With respect to taxes, we think a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 30% remains a reasonable estimate. In 2011, we expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $34 million, $28 million of which is related to the divestiture of the Authentication Services business. 
We exit third quarter with a diluted share count of 164 million shares, compared to 170 million shares at the end of the second quarter. 
Operating cash flow on a consolidated basis was $108 million in the third quarter. Free cash flow was a positive $75 million in Q3, given a $1 million increase in excess tax benefits and $34 million in capital expenditures in the quarter. 
Related to capital expenditures, as we said in September 2010, we signed a long-term lease to move our corporate headquarters to Weston, Virginia. During third quarter 2011, VeriSign exercised its right of first refusal to purchase these corporate headquarters. 
During the third quarter, the company made an $11.8 million ESCROW payment and we expect to close the property purchase on November 15, 2011. 
We think capital expenditures excluding the purchase of Weston Building will be about 10% of revenue in 2011. 
Also, we are exploring a range of options to finance the purchase of Weston property. To reiterate, we saw a solid performance in Q3, we've grown non-GAAP operating income and net income. We have a strong balance sheet and expect strong cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.
With respect to 2011 guidance, revenue for 2011 should be in the range of $770 million to $775 million, representing growth of 13% to 14%, that's changed from $765 million to $775 million range given during the July earnings call. 
Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be about 79%. Q4 2011 exit non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be at least 50%. We said at least 48% on the July call. Non-GAAP interested expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is still expected to be $25 million for 2011. 
Capital expenditures are expected to be 10% of revenue, excluding the Weston property purchase. Our guidance is based on expectations of continued growth and increased operating efficiencies in our businesses in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense. 
I will now turn the call back to Jim."

In addition to that, I think other important parts of the consideration for the Board were my relationship with the management team. About 3 years ago, when I came in as CEO, I worked with very much of the management team that's here today. For 3 years, I've actually been Executive Chairman, I've been mostly behind the scenes, and maybe wasn't a hands-on, but since August 1 when I returned as CEO, I think it would be fair to say that I've been very much hands-on. I think my background and tendencies are more in strategy and technology so I would prefer to spend more of my time there, so I think you can look for the CFO hire and other management hires that we make to be complementary and support that desire of going to spend more time in those areas."

A lot of you aware that not all of you are, so let me just say it again that what we just done is completed a 4-year restructuring that the Board put into motion in 2007. While the Board decided then that we wanted to change direction, we wanted to divest our non-core businesses, focus on our core businesses and look for opportunities in core adjacencies. We've done that and as Chairman, I do speak for the Board, but the Board collectively is what initiated that move. And we, I believe, have been very successful in doing that. We also omitted to return excess cash to the shareholders and just again just bit of some historical info for those who aren't familiar with the company's history, the company was formally and legally formed in April of 1995 . It took $10 million in seat money from some strategic investors that took roughly -- later on took tens of millions from venture capital it did $150 million strategic ground to an IPO in January of '98 raising a substantial amount of money. That's a secondary that was done later raised hundreds of millions but obviously billions of dollars of revenue netting many, many million of dollars of profits were reinvested in the business and acquisitions. When we did the divestiture program, we said we would return excess cash to the shareholders and I believe we delivered on that, including what I think was a very disciplined approach to analyzing and offer to purchase our Authentication business, which as you know we've closed in August 2010. The sale of that business $1.28 billion also generated excess cash that we returned to the shareholders. So that strategy executed by the Board, directed by the Board now completed, it was followed then by call it a transition period where we provided transition services to the acquiring parties of our divest businesses. We are for all practical purposes now at the end of that. So we're exactly where we wanted it to be. So I would say that the philosophy of the Board and I think as Chairman, one of my responsibilities is to speak for the Board is that we did that and now, here I am as a member of the Board back in management. So I think if I could put it this way, I think we told you what we're going to do, but we walk the walk as well and we did what we said we would do and return it. I think we have a great opportunity going forward, but if you look back on share repurchases and how we've used cash, of course, we utilized extraordinary dividend when we thought that was appropriate and good for our shareholders and we used share repurchases when we thought that was appropriate. We do on a quarterly basis like every company responsibly analyze our cash needs and how we're going to use that cash and with cash available, we look for the best ways to return that cash to the shareholders. I think you're going to expect that no different in the future, we'll continue to do exactly that."

It's generally seems to be a bit of what I would say a process that does have some red tape associated with it, some approvals that are required.

So tracking analyzing the movement understanding what other influences there are anomaly that changes advertising policies, I think by google impacting all.

I think there's a different way to look at VeriSign's growth opportunities and we're starting to do that now as a management team. I think that there are a lot of core adjacencies that we really need to fully explore that with yield growth opportunities that collectively can be very exciting. But have the special property called the quality of revenue that I like to use, which I think it's really important. I think all of you understand of course that VeriSign is a company that has a quality of revenue that's makes it very different for most other companies. And so I think this responsibility is ours to look for core growth and core adjacencies that can yield that. I think there are a lot of those. The Internet is evolving very quickly. We've talked for years about monetizing our data streams or looking at ways we can actually do that, that are very creative and I think maybe worth looking at investing in. These are very, very modest investments that don't really change much of the way that we view use of cash and other things. There are strategic opportunities in the IPv4 to IPv6 transition, NIA is doing well as I mentioned earlier and there's some ways I think we can offer expanded services that we haven't considered before so we want to do a very aggressive job of exploring those. And we often mentioned that ICANN's new gTLD program is something we believe will be an opportunity for us. We do plan as we've said to apply to operate some of the new gTLDs, international growth is another area, internationalized domain names, both in the new gTLD program and under our existing programs, our area that's of interest to us and they're actually quite a few more that we're looking at. So this is an incredible, an exciting opportunity to really be creative and look for sensible growth where it makes sense, right in our core and adjacent to it. Again, quality of the revenue is the key."

In our NIA business, we",413,"Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. The third quarter was another solid quarter for VeriSign. In our Naming business, the base of registered names in .com and .net totaled approximately 112 million at the end of September. In our NIA business, we again saw a strong bookings growth. Also, our strong balance sheet allowed us to repurchase 235 million in shares in the third quarter, leaving us with approximately 831 million under the current share repurchase program authorization. I'll comment now on third quarter operating highlights.
As I've mentioned previously, in our Naming business, the base of registered names in .com and .net totaled approximately 112 million at the end of September. This represents an 8% increase year-over-year in the base and an approximately 2% increase quarter-over-quarter. 
In the third quarter, we added 1.994 million, 1,994,000, net names to the domain name base, and we processed 7.9 million new registrations, which is an increase of approximately 5% year-over-year and our largest third quarter on record for new registrations. The Q2 2011 renewal rate was 73.1%. Our renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter. We believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2011 will be approximately 73.4%.
We expect the Q4 net names added to the base to be between 1.8 million and 2.1 million names, which reflects the continued growth and the underlying drivers of Internet growth as well as seasonality. 
With regard to our NIA business, the team performed very well and exceeded target bookings for the third quarter. We continue to study this fast-growing and evolving market for the best ways we might leverage our core strengths and optimize our offerings to scale for long-term success with an emphasis on quality of revenue. 
Finally, before turning the call over to John, let me address our management changes. As you know, since August 1 of this year, I have assumed the responsibility of full-time CEO of the company. As you saw in our press release, there is no change to my status and the company will not be conducting a search for a new CEO. However, we will be conducting a CFO search. Until we complete that search, John Calys is in that interim role. He's been at VeriSign for nearly a year now and has been a successful Financial Operating Executive in other public companies as well.

36216,141271882,179708,"VeriSign, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2011",2011-10-27,"Earnings Calls","VeriSign, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. This was another solid quarter for us, as Jim explained. Let me recap our performance this quarter on our key operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS growth",629,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. This was another solid quarter for us, as Jim explained. Let me recap our performance this quarter on our key operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS growth and free cash flow. Then I will discuss progress towards our annual guidance for 2011. 
Revenue of $197 million for the third quarter was up 4% from the prior quarter and 14% year-over-year. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $723 million, an increase of $9 million from Q2 and 11% increase from the same period in 2010. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for Q3 was 50.1% compared to 51.7% in Q2, which was benefited by 3.1% as a result of a $6 million nonrecurring expense reversal. Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses were $98 million, up 7% sequentially and flat year-over-year. The third quarter operating margin expansion was driven by a revenue growth and through realizing efficiencies in our business. Based on the progress to date, we expect fourth quarter 2011 exit non-GAAP operating margin to be at least 50%. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $64 million, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.39 compared to $0.38 in Q2 and $0.28 for the same period in 2010. 
Income related to transition services included as a part of nonoperating income on the P&L was approximately $1.3 million in the third quarter and we expect approximately $1.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2011.
With respect to taxes, we think a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 30% remains a reasonable estimate. In 2011, we expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $34 million, $28 million of which is related to the divestiture of the Authentication Services business. We exit third quarter with a diluted share count of 164 million shares compared to 170 million shares at the end of second quarter. 
Operating cash flow on a consolidated basis was $108 million in the third quarter. Free cash flow was a positive $75 million in Q3 given a $1 million increase in excess tax benefits and $34 million in capital expenditures in the quarter. 
Related to capital expenditures, as we said in September 2010, we signed a long-term lease to move our corporate headquarters to Reston, Virginia. During third quarter 2011, VeriSign exercised its right of first refusal to purchase those -- these corporate headquarters. 
During the third quarter, the company made an $11.8 million escrow payment and we expect to close the property purchase on November 15, 2011. We think capital expenditures, excluding the purchase of the Reston building, will be about 10% of revenue in 2011. 
Also, we are exploring a range of options to finance the purchase of the Reston property. To reiterate, we saw a solid performance in Q3, we have grown non-GAAP operating income and net income, we have a strong balance sheet and expect strong cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.
And with respect to 2011 guidance, revenue for 2011 should be in the range of $770 million to $775 million, representing growth of 13% to 14%. That's changed from $765 million to $775 million range given during the July earnings call. 
Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be about 79%. Q4 2011 exit non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be at least 50%. We said at least 48% on the July call. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is still expected to be $25 million for 2011. 
Capital expenditures are expected to be 10% of revenue, excluding the Reston property purchase. Our guidance is based on expectations of continued growth and increased operating efficiencies in our businesses in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense. 
I will now turn the call back to Jim."

So my relationships with people in the ICANN community to go back more than 25 years in my long history in sort of the technical space, particularly as it relates to Internet infrastructure, the standard of the company and security technology, I think, were key qualifiers. In addition to that, I think other important parts of the considerations for the Board were my relationship with the management team. Three years ago, when I came in as CEO, I worked with very much of the management team that's here today. For 3 years, I've actually been the Executive Chairman. I've been mostly behind the scenes and maybe wasn't a hands-on. But since August 1 when I returned as CEO, I think it will be fair to say that I've been very much hands-on. I think my background and tendencies are more in strategy and technology, so I would prefer to spend more of my time there. So I think you can look for the CFO hire and other management hires that we make to be complementary and support that desire. We're going to spend more times in those areas."

A lot of you are aware, just maybe not all of you are, so let me just say it again that what we've just done is completed a 4-year restructuring that the Board put into motion in 2007. The Board decided then that we wanted to change direction, we wanted to divest our noncore businesses, focus on our core businesses and look for opportunities in core adjacencies. We've done that. And as Chairman, I do speak for the Board, but the Board collectively is what initiated that move. And we, I believe, have been very successful in doing that. We also committed to return excess cash to the shareholders. And just, again, as a bit of some historical info for those who aren't familiar with the company's history, now the company was formally and legally formed in April of 1995. It took $10 million in the saved money from some strategic investors that took roughly -- later on it took tens of millions from venture capitalists that did $150 million strategic ground prior to an IPO in January of '98, raising a substantial amount of money. That is a secondary that was done later raised hundreds of millions of dollars. And obviously, billions of dollars of revenue netting many, many millions of dollars of profits were reinvested in the business and acquisitions. When we did the divestiture program, we said we would return excess cash to the shareholders. And I believe we delivered on that, including what I think was a very disciplined approach to analyzing an offer to purchase our Authentication business, which, as you know, we closed in August 2010. The sale of that business for $18.28 billion also generated excess cash that we returned to the shareholders. So that strategy executed by the Board, directed by the Board, now completed, was followed then by, call it, a transition period where we provide the transition services to the acquiring parties of our divest businesses. We are for all practical purposes now at the end of that, so we're exactly where we wanted to be. So I would say that the philosophy of the Board, and I think as Chairman, one of my responsibilities is to speak for the Board is that we did that and now here I am as a member of the Board back in management. So I think if I can put it this way, I think we told you what we're going to do, but we walk the walk as well, and we did what we said we would do and return it. And I think we have a great opportunity going forward. But if you look back on share repurchase and how we've used cash, of course, we utilized extraordinary dividends when we thought that was appropriate and good for our shareholders and we used share repurchase when we thought that was appropriate. We do on a quarterly basis, like every company, responsibly analyze our cash needs and how we're going to use that cash. And with the cash available, we look for the best ways to return that cash to the shareholders. I think you can expect nothing different in the future. We'll continue to do exactly that."

But let me just say, first of all, that there's a natural evolution here that we watch closely. The base of banks is growing larger. The longer a name is in our zone and the more often it's renewed, the higher the renewal rate for that particular name. So even though, for example, in 2011, in Q1, we have the highest number of absolute net new ads in the history of the company and we have the highest Q2 of any Q2 in the company's history and the highest number of net new adds for this Q3 of any Q3 in the company's history. Despite those, the ratio of net new adds to the base of names obviously changes every quarter as you grow. So tracking the renewal rate and sort of making projections and understanding and interpreting it, I'm learning, is an extremely tricky business.

The number of net new adds, there are -- with the record number, for example, of net new adds in Q2 and Q3 for the quarter is, of course, historically, what that means is that the -- we also had good growth in 2010.

I think that there are a lot of core adjacencies that we really need to fully explore that with yield growth opportunities that collectively can be very exciting but have the special property, called the quality of revenue, that I like to use, which I think it's really important. I think all of you understand, of course, that VeriSign is a company that has a quality of revenue that makes it very different from most other companies. And so I think the -- this responsibility is ours to look for core growth and core adjacencies that can yield that. I think there are a lot of those. The Internet is evolving very quickly. We talked for years about monetizing our data streams or looking at ways that we can actually do that that are very creative and I think maybe very worth looking at investing in. These are very, very modest investments that don't really change much of the way that we view use of cash and other things. There are strategic opportunities in the IPv4 to IPv6 transition. NIA is doing well as I mentioned earlier. And there are some ways, I think, we can offer expanded services that really haven't been considered before, so we want to do a very aggressive job of exploring those. And we've often mentioned ICANN's new gTLD program is something that we believe will be an opportunity for us. We do plan, as we've said, to apply to operate some of the new gTLDs. International growth is another area, internationalized domain names, both in the new gTLD program and under our existing programs, are an area that's of interest to us and there are actually quite a few more that we're looking at. So this is an incredible, an exciting opportunity, to really be creative and look for sensible growth where it makes sense right in our core and adjacent to it. Again, quality of the revenue is the key."

In our Naming business, the base of registered names in .com and .net totaled approximately 112 million at the end of September. In our NIA business, we again saw a strong bookings growth. Also, our strong balance sheet allowed us to repurchase 235 million in shares in the third quarter, leaving us with approximately 831 million under the current share repurchase program authorization. I'll comment now on third quarter operating highlights.
As I've mentioned previously, in our Naming business, the base of registered names in .com and .net totaled approximately 112 million at the end of September. This represents an 8% increase year-over-year in the base and an approximately 2% increase quarter-over-quarter. 
In the third quarter, we added 1.994 million, 1,994,000, net names to the domain name base, and we processed 7.9 million new registrations, which is an increase of approximately 5% year-over-year and our largest third quarter on record for new registrations. The Q2 2011 renewal rate was 73.1%. Our renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter. We believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2011 will be approximately 73.4%.
We expect the Q4 net names added to the base to be between 1.8 million and 2.1 million names, which reflects the continued growth and the underlying drivers of Internet growth as well as seasonality. 
With regard to our NIA business, the team performed very well and exceeded target bookings for the third quarter. We continue to study this fast-growing and evolving market for the best ways we might leverage our core strengths and optimize our offerings to scale for long-term success with an emphasis on quality of revenue. 
Finally, before turning the call over to John, let me address our management changes. As you know, since August 1 of this year, I have assumed the responsibility of full-time CEO of the company. As you saw in our press release, there is no change to my status and the company will not be conducting a search for a new CEO. However, we will be conducting a CFO search. Until we complete that search, John Calys is in that interim role. He's been at VeriSign for nearly a year now and has been a successful Financial Operating Executive in other public companies as well.
Thanks for your attention, and now I'll turn the call over to John."

This was another solid quarter for us, as Jim explained. Let me recap our performance this quarter on our key operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS growth",629,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. This was another solid quarter for us, as Jim explained. Let me recap our performance this quarter on our key operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS growth and free cash flow. Then I will discuss progress towards our annual guidance for 2011. 
Revenue of $197 million for the third quarter was up 4% from the prior quarter and 14% year-over-year. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $723 million, an increase of $9 million from Q2 and 11% increase from the same period in 2010. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for Q3 was 50.1% compared to 51.7% in Q2, which was benefited by 3.1% as a result of a $6 million nonrecurring expense reversal. Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses were $98 million, up 7% sequentially and flat year-over-year. The third quarter operating margin expansion was driven by a revenue growth and through realizing efficiencies in our business. Based on the progress to date, we expect fourth quarter 2011 exit non-GAAP operating margin to be at least 50%. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $64 million, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.39 compared to $0.38 in Q2 and $0.28 for the same period in 2010. 
Income related to transition services included as a part of nonoperating income on the P&L was approximately $1.3 million in the third quarter and we expect approximately $1.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2011.
With respect to taxes, we think a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 30% remains a reasonable estimate. In 2011, we expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $34 million, $28 million of which is related to the divestiture of the Authentication Services business. We exit third quarter with a diluted share count of 164 million shares compared to 170 million shares at the end of second quarter. 
Operating cash flow on a consolidated basis was $108 million in the third quarter. Free cash flow was a positive $75 million in Q3 given a $1 million increase in excess tax benefits and $34 million in capital expenditures in the quarter. 
Related to capital expenditures, as we said in September 2010, we signed a long-term lease to move our corporate headquarters to Reston, Virginia. During third quarter 2011, VeriSign exercised its right of first refusal to purchase those -- these corporate headquarters. 
During the third quarter, the company made an $11.8 million escrow payment and we expect to close the property purchase on November 15, 2011. We think capital expenditures, excluding the purchase of the Reston building, will be about 10% of revenue in 2011. 
Also, we are exploring a range of options to finance the purchase of the Reston property. To reiterate, we saw a solid performance in Q3, we have grown non-GAAP operating income and net income, we have a strong balance sheet and expect strong cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.
And with respect to 2011 guidance, revenue for 2011 should be in the range of $770 million to $775 million, representing growth of 13% to 14%. That's changed from $765 million to $775 million range given during the July earnings call. 
Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be about 79%. Q4 2011 exit non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be at least 50%. We said at least 48% on the July call. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is still expected to be $25 million for 2011. 
Capital expenditures are expected to be 10% of revenue, excluding the Reston property purchase. Our guidance is based on expectations of continued growth and increased operating efficiencies in our businesses in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense. 
I will now turn the call back to Jim."

So my relationships with people in the ICANN community to go back more than 25 years and my long history in sort of the technical space, particularly as it relates to Internet infrastructure, the standard of the company and security technology, I think, were key qualifiers. In addition to that, I think other important parts of the considerations for the Board were my relationship with the management team. Three years ago, when I came in as CEO, I worked with very much of the management team that's here today. For 3 years, I've actually been the Executive Chairman. I've been mostly behind the scenes and maybe wasn't hands-on. But since August 1 when I returned as CEO, I think it will be fair to say that I've been very much hands-on. I think my background and tendencies are more in strategy and technology, so I would prefer to spend more of my time there.

First of all, I know a lot of you are aware of this, maybe not all of you are, so let me just say it again that what we've just done is completed a 4-year restructuring that the Board put into motion in 2007. The Board decided then that we wanted to change direction, we wanted to divest our noncore businesses, focus on our core businesses and look for opportunities in core adjacencies. We've done that. And as Chairman, I do speak for the Board, but the Board collectively is what initiated that move. And we, I believe, have been very successful in doing that. We also committed to return excess cash to the shareholders. And just, again, as a bit of some historical info for those who aren't familiar with the company's history, now the company was formally and legally formed in April of 1995. It took $10 million in seed money from some strategic investors, it took roughly -- later on it took tens of millions from venture capitalists that did $150 million strategic ground prior to an IPO in January of '98, raising a substantial amount of money. That and a secondary that was done later raised hundreds of millions of dollars. And obviously, billions of dollars of revenue netting many, many millions of dollars of profits were reinvested in the business and acquisitions. When we did the divestiture program, we said we would return excess cash to the shareholders. And I believe we delivered on that, including what I think was a very disciplined approach to analyzing an offer to purchase our Authentication business, which, as you know, we closed in August 2010. The sale of that business for $1.28 billion also generated excess cash that we returned to the shareholders. So that strategy executed by the Board, directed by the Board, now completed, was followed then by, call it, a transition period where we provide the transition services to the acquiring parties of our divest businesses. We are for all practical purposes now at the end of that, so we're exactly where we wanted to be. So I would say that the philosophy of the Board, and I think as Chairman, one of my responsibilities is to speak for the Board is that we did that and now here I am as a member of the Board back in management. So I think if I can put it this way, I think we told you what we were going to do, but we walked the walk as well, and we did what we said we would do and return it. And I think we have a great opportunity going forward. But if you look back on share repurchase and how we've used cash, of course, we utilized extraordinary dividends when we thought that was appropriate and good for our shareholders and we used share repurchase when we thought that was appropriate. We do on a quarterly basis, like every company, responsibly analyze our cash needs and how we're going to use that cash. And with the cash available, we look for the best ways to return that cash to the shareholders. I think you can expect nothing different in the future. We'll continue to do exactly that."

I think there's a different way to look at VeriSign's growth opportunities, and we're starting to do that now as a management team. I think that there are a lot of core adjacencies that we really need to fully explore that would yield growth opportunities that collectively can be very exciting but have the special property, called the quality of revenue, that I like to use, which I think it's really important. I think all of you understand, of course, that VeriSign is a company that has a quality of revenue that makes it very different from most other companies. And so I think the -- the responsibility is ours to look for core growth and core adjacencies that can yield that. I think there are a lot of those. The Internet is evolving very quickly. We talked for years about monetizing our data streams. We're looking at ways that we can actually do that, that are very creative and I think maybe very worth looking at investing in. These are very, very modest investments that don't really change much of the way that we view use of cash and other things. There are strategic opportunities in the IPv4 to IPv6 transition. NIA is doing well as I mentioned earlier. And there are some ways, I think, we can offer expanded services that really haven't been considered before, so we want to do a very aggressive job of exploring those. And we've often mentioned ICANN's new gTLD program is something that we believe will be an opportunity for us. We do plan, as we've said, to apply to operate some of the new gTLDs. International growth is another area, internationalized domain names, both in the new gTLD program and under our existing programs, are an area that's of interest to us and there are actually quite a few more that we're looking at. So this is an incredible, an exciting opportunity, to really be creative and look for sensible growth where it makes sense right in our core and adjacent to it. Again, quality of revenue is the key."
