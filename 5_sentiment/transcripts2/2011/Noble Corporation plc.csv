Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. With me in Geneva are Tom Mitchell, our CFO, and Roger Hunt, our Senior Vice President of Marketing and Contracts.I’d like to start off today by thanking our employees for turning in anoth",2565,"Thanks, Lee. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. With me in Geneva are Tom Mitchell, our CFO, and Roger Hunt, our Senior Vice President of Marketing and Contracts.
I’d like to start off today by thanking our employees for turning in another year of impressive results. Advancing the safety culture and maintaining a focus on operational integrity are not always the easiest things to do especially when you’re already in a leadership position. However, our worldwide efforts in these areas continue to increase awareness and drive results to the point that we turned in our second-best ever safety performance in our 90-year history, coming in right behind 2009’s record-breaking results.
Furthermore, I’m pleased to see that our overall potential severity rate continues to follow a downward trend. And while four of our seven operating divisions have extended their record-breaking results last year, more work lies ahead of us in 2011 and beyond as we journey towards creating a truly accident-free environment.
With respect to 2010, the best thing I can say is we’re glad it’s over. We had some wins last year, including our acquisition with Frontier, our agreements with Shell, and the announcements about our newbuild jackups. But we certainly faced our share of challenges, including the fallout from Macondo, both in the U.S. and abroad, continuing uncertainty in Mexico and some construction challenges.
I’d like to talk about some of these issues today. Going into 2010, about 30% of our budget’s revenue was projected to come out of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. So when the Macondo event occurred, we were exposed. When the government imposed a moratorium, a tragic situation was compounded by economic uncertainty.
In the wake of what was believed to be a six-month moratorium and because of where we were on the Frontier deal, we moved quickly to try and preserve our backlog, sustain our workforce, and protect our future earnings. We sincerely appreciate those customers who worked with us and who continue to work with us.
While these events have had a significant overall impact on our company, our two biggest disappointments coming out of this, other than the now three-month-old permatorium, have been the cancelation of the Noble Jim Day contract and the controversy that arose on the Noble Homer Ferrington. In both cases, the dialogue at the time led us to believe that the situations would be resolved satisfactorily in due course. So perhaps we’re guilty of being too optimistic for too long.
I will tell you that our relationship with Exxon Mobil remains strong and I believe we will ultimately prevail in our claim for payment on the Ferrington. With regard to Marathon, we’re considering our options and I can’t predict how that dispute will ultimately work out.
I will tell you that the Noble Jim Day is one of the finest rigs I’ve ever seen and it befits its namesake. Furthermore, the rig is completely ready to go to work, having received its certificate of compliance from the Coast Guard, a COC on the BOP system, and a positive third-party fitness report all before January the 1st.
In the wake of all of these events, we’ve reevaluated the way Noble has historically viewed political risk in the U.S. and the likelihood of force majeure claims and we’ve reconsidered our long-standing approach to our contract philosophy in these particular areas, and I believe we’ll be in a stronger position moving forward.
Moving on, in Mexico, there has been a broad concern for more than a year that Pemex was moving to replace older rigs with new rods. To date, they haven’t been very successful in finding contractors willing to import rigs under their terms; however, we expect this effort to continue. Nevertheless, we have consistently reported to you what Pemex has said to us and that is that they want our rigs to stay in Mexico.
We still believe this to be the case, but delays continue. No one is more frustrated over this than we are, so we’ve elected to move some rigs out in order to more efficiently and cost-effectively stack the rigs while we wait, and in some case, we were actually paid demobilization fees to do so.
Today, tenders for seven rigs without restrictions are out and we understand there are more coming shortly, but there’s no doubt that we’re in the mercy of Pemex’s schedule. We continue to believe that our future in Mexico is bright and that we’ll put most, if not all, of our rigs back to work by April or May. But that could slip again, and until they run the process, we’ll have some idle time. I can tell you that we’re doing everything we can to cut costs, and we’re marketing some of the rigs in other areas.
Next, I think it’s worth taking a look back at the Frontier and Shell deals. We are very pleased to have completed these transactions over the summer, and in spite of some of the units now being idle and some construction delays (inaudible) we’re still happy with these agreements that doubled our backlog and provided a good long-term base of earnings.
In our economics, we anticipated we might see time on both the Duchess and the Seillean (inaudible) payroll, so this is really not a surprise. We’re bidding those units for work, and if successful, we’ll improve our original expectations. But we didn’t do these deals for those units and we don’t really consider them to be long-term core assets.
I’ve told some of you that we think these agreements will never be worse than good and we continue to believe this has a lot potential upside that could make them great.
Shell, post deal, has continued to work with us in the spirit of our far-reaching agreement and we could not be happier with this relationship.
On the Bullys, there has been some market noise about these rigs and we would like to clarify exactly where we are. It’s true that prior to our acquisition of the rigs, the project teams failed to fully account for the effects of excess weight or how much stuff you add to the ships, particularly up high. In order to restore the vessels to their desired operating capability, we need to fix this. We’ve worked with naval architects to design spansets to attach to each hole of each vessel to ensure that we can meet the operational requirements and maintain proper motion characteristics.
The spansets have been engineered and weight testing on the models had gone very well. These modifications being made with the full support of Shell had caused us to slip the shipyard date on the Bully 1 by about eight weeks. However, we don’t currently anticipate any impact on the Bully 2 schedule, as the sponsors are not in the critical path for that vessel’s delivery.
Completion on Bully 1 is around 46% complete including the (inaudible) equipment and is proceeding very well. We can answer more questions in Q&A, if you want, but two points I want to make are, one, Shell continues to be fully involved with these rigs and maintains a 50% ownership position and they are as anxious as we are to get them delivered and on the payroll. And two, the weight issue on the Bullys does not have any impact at all on the Globetrotters. Those ships are of completely different design and we have very good quality control on those yards. Globetrotter 1 is right on schedule and due to leave Holland later this quarter - I’m sorry, due to leave for Holland later this quarter.
Moving on to some more positive notes, we made quite a few announcements this last month. The jackup newbuilds, rigswaps and deepwater newbuilds and we’d like to talk a little about our rationale. I believe we’ve been clear over the past several years about our top priority for capital allocation. The management team and board believe the best use of capital is to add units to the fleet. At good returns, they will deliver long-term earnings growth. Beyond that, we evaluate how best to return capital to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends.
There are essentially three ways to add rigs. The first has been to buy older units or (inaudible) and upgrade them either moderately or significantly. Historically, the vast majority of our growth offshore has been executed in this way and it served us all very well over many years. But to a large extent and in the current environment, we think this strategy has run its course.
The second way is to buy iron. We work hard trying to acquire speculative newbuilds, and as you know, we’ve looked at lots of them. We had hoped for some time that we would have opportunities at the right price, but for a variety of reasons, it hadn’t worked out.
Major M&A activity appears to be challenged right now just because evaluations are out of whack. So the final path has been to build new, and as you know, we recently initiated an additional phase of new construction.
I think some of the challenges we’ve faced with significant upgrades over the past several years have detracted from what we’ve actually done to reshape this fleet.
In 2005, this company had only 12 floaters and 40 jackups. Only four of those floaters were dynamically positioned. We hadn’t built a rig from the keel up in many, many years. Today, we’re significantly different with the Frontier transaction, and last week’s announcement of two ultra-deepwater drill ships from Hyundai, we’ll have 26 floaters. We have fixed price options for two more; 14 of the 26 are DP and 12 are ultra-deepwater, capable of operating at water depths greater than 7500 feet.
The revenue makes us go from 60% jackups to more than 60% deepwater. The rigs we’re building from the keel up, including the Globetrotters, are all with known shipyards and contracted in a way to incentivize on-time delivery. A newbuild has much more certain outcome than a significant upgrade.
We’ve been very happy with what we’ve built with the Noble Dave Beard, the Noble Danny Adkins, and the Noble Jim Day. But the Globetrotters, the Hyundai ships, and the new jackups are all much more predictable projects. So our confidence in projected construction time is much, much greater.
Some of you raised concerns about our older units, including the Mod semis and the drillships in Brazil. We continue to believe that most of our units are viable in today’s environment, and can deliver good cash flow returns. But some of them may not be considered as core going forward. And we believe the agreement we just announced to swap the Phoenix for the Muravlenko and securing the five and a half year commitment on one of the ships is an innovative way to meet the customers’ needs for two important customers and to help modernize the fleet.
This is an example of what a great relationship with good customers can do. We undertook to do reliability upgrades on our older ships because they needed it. Downtime has been too high, and although our bonus revenue in Brazil is up year on year, we haven’t been able to capture as much of the bonus as we would have liked.
Because of timing constraints, the Muravlenko was not going to be actually upgraded until 2013, and the contract only ran until 2015. Furthermore, Petrobras’ view of the world seems to have changed somewhat since we originally made the deal three years ago, so it was likely that the 16-3/4-inch BOP on the Muravlenko would have to be changed before further extension beyond the 2015 contract termination on the current contract could have been re-negotiated.
The Muravlenko is the only rig in our fleet which still has a 16-3/4 BOP. And it happened that Petrobras voiced concern about the reliability of the Muravlenko and only the Muravlenko in advance of its upgrade. I say only the Muravlenko because I attended the meeting in Brazil when this discussion took place and they fully supported our plans on the other two ships. About the same time, Shell said it might be interested in a break on the Phoenix contract.
Collectively, we saw Petrobras’ internal concerns about performance and will deliver an (inaudible) greatly enhanced rig which will improve their uptime, our revenue performance, and our bonus potential. Shell needs some break, Petrobras’ needs are met and we get a new rig.
While we did give up about 500 million in backlog on the Phoenix, and we’ll see an impact in 2011 and 2012 earnings, we added about 900 million of backlog on the newbuild, added an asset that will be around for 30 years or more, and avoided at least $150 million of CapEx remaining on the current Muravlenko upgrade, plus an additional feature upgrade and CapEx for BOP upgrade.
In general, we’re headed down the road reshaping the floater fleet and that’s a path that can’t be accomplished overnight, but we’re well on our way toward moving the fleet toward higher technology or keeping our focus on returns. Likewise, we started work on reshaping the jackup fleet.
We delivered three high-specification units in the last cycle and we’ve been asked to construct two very high-end units with options for four more. At the same time, we’re considering opportunities to divest of some of our older units to the extent there’s buyers out there.
We continue to like the jackup business particularly the higher end of the business where units like our two newbuilds with 2.5 million pounds of hook load and 30% more (inaudible) load than some of the competition can earn a premium.
The two JU-2000 N units will be among only a dozen rigs who will have greater than two million pounds of hook load capacity.
As I said, 2010 was a tough year and it looks like at least the first half of 2011 could be challenging as well. We don’t know exactly when the Gulf is going to get back to normal, so we’ve made a deal to move at least one of our semis out and there could be more. Roger will touch on this in his discussion. But right now, it feels more like we’re headed out of the storm and into it, and if you’ve got the luxury to look past 2011 this company has found, there are some good things happening.
We have three drill ships coming out of the yard this year and going on payroll. We have multiple opportunities for the Jim Day. We should put some of the rigs back to work in Mexico, and even with the dispute, the Ferrington should be back on the payroll by the beginning of the second quarter.
The upgrade on Leo Segerius will commence shortly and deliver a rig with greatly improved reliability for Petrobras and much improved revenue performance for us. Also I believe we’ll see some units go back to work in the Gulf.
Our backlog is at 12.7 billion, we’re strong and our operations are focused. Some of you have been critical and perhaps we’ve earned some of the criticism this year, but we’re focused now and we believe we can deliver.
With that, I’ll turn the call over to Tom to review the numbers.

Today, we’ll run a bit of time going through our fourth quarter and full year results, and then I’ll review the guidance for 2011.Last night, we reported fourth quarter net income of 99 million or $0.39 per fully diluted share on t",1470,"Thank you, David. Today, we’ll run a bit of time going through our fourth quarter and full year results, and then I’ll review the guidance for 2011.
Last night, we reported fourth quarter net income of 99 million or $0.39 per fully diluted share on total revenues of 644 million. For the 12 months ending December 31, 2010, our net income was 773 million or $3.02 per fully diluted share on total revenues of 2.8 billion.
Our acquisition of Frontier in July makes direct quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year comparison difficult, but to give you a frame of reference, fourth quarter of 2009 earnings per share were $1.72 and the full year 2009 earnings were 6.42.
As you can see from the numbers in the Macondo incident, the second quarter of 2010 has had a tremendous negative impact on operations and profitability throughout the remainder of the year.
Contract drilling services revenues increased quarter on quarter by 5% to 614 million. Average daily revenues for the fourth quarter of about a 141,000 were up 11% from the previous quarter. Relative to the third quarter, the revenue increase was primarily driven by demobilization fees that was on the Duchess, Seillean (inaudible) and also in Mexico, as David mentioned.
Fewer days in the shipyard, the Noble Therald Martin rolling from a day rate of 114 to 270,000 and revenues on the Amos Runner, which was working in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (inaudible). Offsetting these increases were rigs rolling to lower rates in the North Sea, in the Middle East and an increase in the number of stack days primarily in Mexico and in the North Sea.
Our contract drilling services cost for the fourth quarter were 332 million, up 5% from the third quarter 2010. On a per-operating-day basis, fourth quarter 2010 cost were about 76,000, an increase of around 11% over third quarter cost, primarily driven by fewer operating days and the addition of floater rigs to the fleet; that includes the Noble Jim Day.
The main drivers of the increased absolute cost were raises in Brazil and in West Africa. Importation fees in Brazil, inspections on equipment in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and a full quarter of cost on the Frontier assets.
Our contract drilling margins were 46% for the fourth quarter, flat with the third quarter, and 56% for the full year; that compares to 71% for 2009.
Depreciation for the fourth quarter came in at 154 million, up from the third quarter of 143 million. Four-year depreciation was 540 million, which is at the bottom of the guidance. The increase in depreciation quarter on quarter was primarily due to a full quarter from the Frontier rigs.
At 21 million SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter, we’re down about 19% from 25 million the previous quarter. For the full year, they were 92 million which is within the range that we provided. Our fourth quarter tax rate was 14.2%, a little bit lower than anticipated, which brought our full year rate to 15.6, which is in line with the guidance of 16% that we gave last call.
Capital spending for the fourth quarter came in at 537 million, bringing the total for 2010 to 1.4 billion. These figures include 80 million in the fourth quarter for the down payment on a two new JU-3000 N jackups we announced just before Christmas, and a second milestone payment of about 79 million on the Globetrotter 2.
It also includes the fully consolidated spending for the two Bully joint ventures. Capitalized interest for the year was about 83 million. During the fourth quarter, we did not repurchase any share, so our full year sharing purchases remained at 6.1 million, at an average price per share of $35.96. That’s a total for the year of $219 million.
The number of shares remaining on our current board-approved repurchase authorization is 6.8 million shares.
Now, I would like to direct your attention forward with the review of the various components of our 2011 guidance. As a reminder, our budget will be formally discussed with our board next week, so this is preliminary.
We issued a fleet status report on January 18th which gave you an idea of planned shipyard and some known off-contract days for 2011. All in, we identified about 1,649 days, including actual downtime as of the 18th.
Before turning to the details of 2011 guidance, let me give you a few reminders about how a fleet status report works. First, timing and the length of planned shipyards days are subject to, among other things, changes in our schedule as well as our customer’s schedules. Second, we do not forecast stack days. We’ll let you know if a rig is cold stacked or warm or temporarily stacked, and we assume you will make your own judgments in your modeling about if or when these units would return to work.
And finally, we do not forecast unplanned downtime, though we do tell you our actual idle shipyard and operational downtime days for a given quarter as of the date of the fleet status report.
So in addition to planned shipyard time and any potential idle or stack time you model, you should assume an average of about 3% operational downtime across the fleet. A little bit lower on the jackups and a bit higher on the floaters, particularly in Brazil. Ensuring that these kinds of figures are in your models will help avoid the prices later in the year as we come out with the actuals. These kinds of estimate should also be built into your 2012 beyond expectations.
Now, let’s focus in on the components of our guidance. For the full year, 2011, our contract drilling service costs are expected to come in just below 1.3 billion. That’s an increase of around 100 million over 2010.
While our costs are up on an absolute basis, we’re not seeing very much in the way of general inflation yet, perhaps a couple of percent. Rather, our increases mainly reflect the following: new rigs entering the fleet including the Noble Jim Day and Bully 1, start-up costs on Globetrotter 1 and both Bullys, and a full year of Frontier rigs as well as the Noble Dave Beard.
For the first quarter contract, billing costs are expected to be in the range of 290 million to 300 million. We expect the demand to move upward by about 20 million each successive quarter. However, we have a number of rigs idle right now, and if we’re able to put the rigs back to work earlier than we budgeted, you can see higher costs along with higher revenues.
Depreciation will be up this year both in account for a full year of Frontier and as a result of the newbuilds entering service. For the full year, we estimate something in the range of 615 million to 635 million. We expect that in the first quarter, we’ll run in the range of 150 million to 160 million, with the second and third quarters in the same range, and the fourth quarter moving a little bit beyond the top of that range.
SG&A is expected to be flat in 2011, falling in a range of 90 million to 100 million with costs spread evenly across the quarters. Interest expense, and again this is net of capitalized interest, will be about 50 to 60 million for the year.
We’re currently forecasting our effective tax rate for the year to be around 22%. Any increase in utilization, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico and Mexico, would drive that rate down.
Finally our capital expenditures are expected to be around 2.1 billion in 2011. The breakout is as follows: we anticipate spending about 1.1 billion on our newbuild program, including about 230 million on Globetrotter 1, 110 million on Globetrotter 2, about 325 million gross total on the Bullys, about 90 million on the two jackups, and around 325 million on the new drillships.
Remaining CapEx in 2012 and beyond for the newbuild program totals right around 1.5 billion. And that’s weighted more towards 2013 as the rigs are finished and comes delivery.
We intend to spend about 540 million on major projects, BOP remediation work, riser, inventory, contract-specific work and other projects. We’ll spend 225 million or so on sustaining capital and the next piece is about 120 million on the reliability upgrades for the Eason and the Segerius drillships in Brazil.
Finally, capitalized interest should run right around 120 million for the year.
Capital spending throughout the year is expected to be front-end loaded, with the first and second quarters coming in around 1.3 billion, and the latter two quarters coming in right around 800 million.
That concludes my remarks and I’ll turn it over to Roger to talk about the market.

Let me begin by updating you on the backlog specifics. At December 31, the value of the backlog was approximately 12.7 billion, which breaks down to 11.4 billion for floating units and 1.3 for our jackups. Ab",1359,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning to everybody. Let me begin by updating you on the backlog specifics. At December 31, the value of the backlog was approximately 12.7 billion, which breaks down to 11.4 billion for floating units and 1.3 for our jackups. About 53% of our days for 2011 are already booked and 31% are booked for 2012.
As David mentioned, 2010 was a difficult year. And two of Noble’s major market areas, the U.S. Gulf and Mexico, we experienced significant disruptions that are carrying out to 2011. In the Gulf, despite the absence of an official moratorium and a resumption of work to two of our rigs, we simply cannot predict when a return to normal might occur or what the new normal might look like.
We expect to see additional units leave the Gulf region, which may at some point impact the broader deepwater market. However, the global deepwater segment has so far continued to be relatively stable. There are a number of opportunities across all water depths in various other regions of the world and rates to mid, deep, and also deepwater are generally flat.
On the jackup front, activity and rates have been pretty consistent with what we saw over in the third quarter of 2010, with the obvious exception of Mexico, where a number of our units have rolled up contract, and in the North Sea, where we’re seeing the usual winter slowdown.
Let’s talk about some specific details of different regions, starting in the U.S. Gulf. The first hurdle is operator’s compliance with NTL-06 and 10. NTL-10 seems to be the bigger holdup with questions around what both surface and subsea containment devices need to look like to win approval from BOEM.
However, despite recent negative press reports, we do believe our customers are working diligently to comply, and perhaps we might see a few rigs back to work drilling new oil mid to late in the year.
The Jim Day is currently idle. However, with the 1,250-ton hook load and 12,000 feet water depth grading, it is one of the most capable semis in the industry. The rig is generating a lot of customer interest both in the Gulf and other regions, and we’re confident this rig will be contracted before too long.
With respect to our other Gulf of Mexico floaters, we’re looking forward to putting the Jim Thompson, which has received its certificate of compliance back to work. The driller is still undergoing upgrade and we’re looking for opportunities, mainly outside the Gulf, for the Paul Romano. The Lorris Bouzigard is cold stacked.
In the meantime, there is life after the Gulf of Mexico and that would be in Brazil. We are pleased to report that we have an LOI with Shell to move the Noble Clyde Boudreaux there for one year primary term at a rate of 290,000 and a mobilization fee of 6 million. We’re expecting units to leave the Gulf shortly and be in a position to commence operations in Brazil by mid-April.
Also, as previously announced, the Phoenix will be mobilizing to Brazil for Petrobras later this year where we expect it to remain through 2015.
In Mexico, David has already mentioned seven outstanding tenders for units without age restrictions. We’re expecting about seven more opportunities to be published shortly. The bidding environment in Mexico (inaudible) the least challenging, and with the addition of some new contract clauses such as five-day cancellation options as day rate cap has become even more so. We have seven of our 12 units idle, and we could see 10 more units idle before the new work is scheduled to begin.
Having said that, we believe the fundamentals are still sound. Mexico desperately needs rigs, and with Noble delivering more than 98% uptime over the past few years, we are Pemex’s most efficient driller. We believe we will return rigs to Pemex and expect our situation to be clear by the end of the first quarter.
In the North Sea, we have continued to enjoy high utilization as commodity prices have encouraged the operators to maintain activity level. Although the winter will be oversupplied, we believe we will see an uptake in utilization and possibly a modest increase in rates for the spring and summer. The rate increase will depend, of course, on how competitors behave with respect to currently stacked rigs as well as rigs operating in lower utilization areas that could return to the North Sea.
In the Mediterranean, the Homer Ferrington is returning to work and we expect to begin a (inaudible) for Repsol at the end of the first quarter.
In Nigeria, there is no meaningful update. The Duchess is warm stacked and we are working to export the unit from Nigeria.
Several of our jackups require new temporary import permits and the timing of those is always a bit uncertain. We do see pent-up demand, however, for both shallow and deepwater work in Nigeria, but much is on hold due to political uncertainty.
We also see a number of tenders in Angola, the Ivory Coast, and even some opportunities in Eastern Africa.
Business in the Middle East and India is picking up. In the Middle East, we see interest from a number of operators, including Aramco, Total, Rak Gas, and DPE. We’re in the final stages of preparing a Roger Lewis to go to work in Saudi Arabia. Scott Marks is on a heavy lift from the North Sea bringing into the Middle East where it will join the Lewis, also in Saudi Arabia. There are still 16 or so jackups stacked in the Middle East, so that may keep day rates from rising quickly.
In India, ONGC continues to actively look for jackups but at low rates. Some of the recent active sales in that market may prevent day rates from increasing in the near term, but we could see utilization improve.
Finally, in the Far East, we have responded to a number of recent inquiries in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Australia for jackups and floaters, and we continue to watch the region closely for opportunities to expand our presence.
Let me switch to some comments on newbuild. First, it’s clear to us that we’ve entered the next newbuild cycle. In the short period between today’s call and our last calls, there have been announcement of 12 new floaters and 20 new jackups, along with options for approximately the same number of rigs, many of which are likely to be exercised.
Much of these orders have been from conventional drilling contractors but not all. It is our view that if the shipyard (inaudible) is available in 2013 and 2014, it is likely to going to be taken.
Second, we’ve talked on previous calls about operator showing a preference for newer units, even though the capabilities of the older units may match the drilling program. We expect this trend will continue.
As David has noted, Noble is participating in this newbuild cycle, recently announced projects of building very high-spec floaters and jackups. On the floater side, our outlook for long-term demand is robust enough to feel very comfortable with our order for two new drill ships from Hyundai. The design of these rigs makes them two of the most capable exploration and development tools in the industry, a view that has been reinforced by the award of an LOI from Shell for a long-term contract on the first unit.
We’ve also elected to build two new jackups. These rigs represent a significant enhancement to our proven design by responding to our customer’s long-term need and assigning the project’s execution to a proven designer and shipyard. The result is the JU-3000 N and we are confident this class of jackups will yield good return for our shareholders in the years to come.
With everything that’s going on, both at Noble and in the industry, we look forward to an exciting market but one which may not be much moving in day rates during 2011, absence in strengthening of the global economy and sustained commodity prices.
And with that, I’ll turn the call back to Lee.

Our relationship with Petrobras is very good and so we think the strength of our backlog is very, very good.
With all of the ship we have under construction, the two Bullys, the two Globetrotters, and now the two Hyundai ships, for us, they’re all under contract, so we only have one spec newbuild, so clearly I think that from a cash flow perspective or balance sheet perspective, we could handle it. The question is going to be what we see in the marketplace as we go through the next few months and see what the opportunities look like and see how confident we are and the one we’ve got that’s available, and we will see the marketplace. But we like the prices, we like the fact that the last newbuild cycle and some of the current speculative builds that might be developed for sale or $800 million or better, these are very high-quality units.
There’s some innovations on there that we like and these are very well laid out. We like the design and we like the price. We undertook Globetrotters because of the pricing scenario and the timing. The prices of these ships have come down and so we’re very comfortable with the price and we like where we are. So I can’t answer if we will or if we won’t. We like the price and we like the long-term view, the macroview of this business.

I guess our view is ultimately Petrobras will facilitate construction locally, whether it’s the full 28 or some lesser numbers, who knows. But it’s going to take a long time to bring those to market. I’ve seen interviews that somewhere between 10 to 20 additional units will be required over the next couple of years to fill the void placed on their published programs. So, in short, I think we’re going to see Petrobras as a very active customer for ultra-deepwater rigs for the foreseeable future.

This was really was and when the Phoenix was up and running, Shell, they’re big buoys, they said they could use a gap or they’d deploy it someplace else, and they looked at other places to deploy it. They had opportunities for it in other places, I think. But when we attended the meeting with Petrobras, they voiced concerns.
The issue on the Muravlenko was just you don’t want a rig in the shipyard in Brazil over Christmas and Carnival. And so you got to be able to sequentially do the upgrades so that you don’t fall over the end of the year ‘cause nothing happens. And so this rig is not going to make it in the shipyard till 2013 and there was almost no time left on the contract, post upgrade, and then with the 16-3/4 BOP and Petrobras’ now desire to high grade the whole fleet in anticipation of this result, we were faced with another upgrade, another major upgrade on the rig that was going to get very little benefit of this very expensive upgrade.
So when Shell said, ""Gee, if we could find a home, we might be interested,"" the light goes on and Roger and his guys jumped on it very quickly, and we were able to facilitate a swap. As it turns out it’s a perfect solution.

The uptime on both of those rigs has been fine, and when we went down there and talked to them, we talked specifically about, ""Are you talking about the program or are you talking about the rig?"" And this was a very focused conversation on the Muravlenko.
So there aren’t really concerns about the other two in Petrobras’ mind or ours. Those upgrades are all headed down the road. I want to say that the module for the Segerius was shipped here very quickly and Petrobras is satisfied that what we’re doing is appropriate and that they’ll get the reliability they want. So there’s never really been a real issue on the other two.

291385,126969879,126050,"Noble Corp., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2011",2011-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Noble Corporation plc","Executives","Thanks, Lee.  Good morning and thanks for joining us today.  With me today in Geneva are Tom Mitchell, our CFO, and Roger Hunt, our Senior Vice President of Marketing and Contracts.  Today’s call marks two important milestones:  first, on Friday, Apri",1511,"Thanks, Lee.  Good morning and thanks for joining us today.  With me today in Geneva are Tom Mitchell, our CFO, and Roger Hunt, our Senior Vice President of Marketing and Contracts.  
Today’s call marks two important milestones:  first, on Friday, April 1 Noble turned 90 years old.  From very modest origins as a land drilling company, Noble has been on a continuous path of fleet enhancement and has now evolved into one of the largest and most formidable offshore drilling contractors in the industry.  This is a company with an incredible legacy that has always been focused on creating shareholder value, running the safest and most efficient operations possible, and protecting the health and safety of both the employees and the environment.  As we continue to enrich our fleet, I want to thank everyone who has contributed to making Noble what it is today.  It’s likely none of us will be around in another 90 years but I believe that we are laying the foundations today that future shareholders and company leaders will look back on with pride.
The second milestone is that we are now one year removed from Macondo.  While we are continuing to suffer from the continuing effects of the moratorium and the permitorium, we are finally beginning to see some real signs of improvement.  Not only are some rigs starting to return to work in the U.S. but we’ve also seen improvement in our utilization elsewhere in the world, and the environment continues to look promising.  
Furthermore, our fleet enhancement program is well underway and we are creating real earnings power for the future.  This year alone, we plan to deliver three ships, but our growth doesn’t stop just there.  Last December, we launched the latest phase of our fleet renewal efforts with the announcement of two high-spec heavy duty harsh environment JU3000N jackups.  We quickly followed that in January with the announcement of two high specification ultradeep water drill ships.  As you know, our agreements with the shipyards include a series of options for additional rigs, four for the jackups and two for the ships.  During the first quarter, we exercised half of the options - two jackups and one ship - at attractive pricing that we believe will deliver strong returns.  
All in all, Noble has committed to more than $2.7 billion of new build spending in the last five months, all with well-established yards using proven designs with very attractive financing and payment terms, and the assets we’re adding are at the top end of the technology curve.  For example, our jackups have 2.5 million pound hook loads, nearly 15 million pounds of variable deck load, and quarters that can hold up to 150 people.  As you look at both the existing assets and those under construction, there are only a handful of rigs of this capability anywhere in the world.  The ships are also going to be some of the most capable units in existence.  Dual-derrick rigs with 2.5 million pound load paths, these ships will be capable of carrying two complete BOP stacks and of handling multiple Christmas trees, making them ideal tools for exploration and development.
Combined with the two Bully rigs and the two globetrotters already under construction, Noble is adding 11 rigs to its fleet; and we still have two jackup options and one floater option remaining, all still at attractive prices.
The transformation of our floating fleet over the past five years is remarkable.  In 2005, we had 12 floaters, four of which were DP.  With the acquisition of Frontier and the new build program, we’re headed towards 27 rigs.  Fifteen of these units are DP and the quality of these assets is exceptional.  Even the older assets we acquired from Frontier are in very good condition and some, like the Noble Discover, are unique.  That particular rig is one of the few existing Arctic-class rigs around, and it’s the asset that Shell has targeted for drilling in Alaska as soon as they are able to secure permits.
On the jackup side, we’re just getting started.  The four new rigs under construction combined with the three JU2000Es we built during the last cycle will help lower the average age of our jackup fleet.  Overall, our jackup fleet is in excellent condition; however, from a strategic standpoint, it’s time to take a hard look at the fleet and see if there are some assets that may not be core going forward.  We’re very early on in our efforts, so we’re not at a point where we want to set expectations on timing or how many units could ultimately be involved, but we believe the quality of the fleet and the maintenance we’ve consistently performed over the operating life of these assets could make them some of the more attractive units in the marketplace.
For Noble, this is a purely strategic question.  Our current jackup utilization is fairly high and rising, so it’s not an operational imperative that we have to do something.  The issue for us is what do we want this fleet to look like in five years.  I will say that with the quality of our rigs and our rising utilization, executing a deal or deals can be challenging because of customer issues, so we’ll have to see how this develops in the months ahead.
On other fronts, a couple of catalysts that we were expecting have been realized since our last call.  First, you’ll recall that the contract for the Noble Jim Day had recently been cancelled.  While we expressed optimism last quarter that we would secure contracts soon, we were extremely pleased by the number of opportunities that presented themselves and as quickly as they came forward.  Some of these were outside the U.S., but we ultimately accepted a short-term contract with Shell in the U.S. Gulf which includes a period of standby but also ensures that, permit or no, the rig is contracted to earn $485,000 per day no later than August 1.  If it’s operating, we’ll be eligible for up to a 15% performance bonus potentially including the earn day rate up into the 550s.  
The Gulf is moving in the right direction, and we think the Jim Day contract is an expression of optimism in the operating community.  The Noble Jim Thompson is already back to work drilling an exploration well, and we’re hopeful we could see additional permits for some of our other units in the coming weeks.
In Mexico, events have finally unfolded in our favor.  For some time, we’ve been reporting that Pemex would publish tenders for legacy jackups, and while it’s taken longer than we would have liked, we now have nine of our rigs committed, one rig in the bidding process, and the final two rigs with fast-track tender opportunities that were published Tuesday.  By midsummer, we think we could have all 12 of our jackups in Mexico back on contract.  In addition, we believe that Pemex is interested in keeping the Noble Max Smith for their deepwater exploration program, and we are engaged in a dialogue for a 20% extension on that rig, which would keep it busy until January of 2012.
Finally, our new build projects are coming along nicely.  I want to remind everyone again about the analyst day in Singapore that we’ll be hosting in mid-May.  We’ll begin with a dinner with management on May 17, and that will include a guest speaker from PFC Energy who will discuss their views on the ongoing events in the Middle East and North Africa.  You’ll also have an opportunity to tour the Keppel yard to see firsthand the progress that we’re making on the Bully rigs, and then we’ll get to experience a steel-cutting ceremony for the first jackups we’ll be building in Jurong.  Bully 1 is almost 98% complete and about 78% commissioned.  The unit entered the dry dock last week to begin the installation of the (inaudible) and is still on target for July delivery.  Likewise, Bully 2 is on schedule for an October delivery, and Globetrotter 1 is about to commence sea trials in China prior to leaving for Holland in May when the drilling equipment will be installed.  So our plans to deliver three new build drill ships, all fully contracted before year-end, are still on track.
2010 was a rough year for us but we’ve turned a corner.  While a few catalysts have been realized and the stock has performed well so far, we think the market is headed in the right direction and we still have room to run in the valuation department.  We’re really just getting back to pre-Macondo stock price levels and that was before the Frontier acquisition, which doubled our backlog, before the new build announcements which are reshaping the fleet, and before the improvement in both day rates and utilization for our jackups.  If you look at our story, you’ll see a combination of value and growth, and we believe that we’re reward our long-term investors.
With that, I’ll turn the call over to Tom to review the numbers.

291385,126969879,126050,"Noble Corp., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2011",2011-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Noble Corporation plc","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning.  I think our results are fairly straightforward this quarter, so let me review those quickly and then we’ll turn to an updated guidance for you.  Last night, we reported first quarter net income of 54 million or $0.2",1029,"Thank you, David, and good morning.  I think our results are fairly straightforward this quarter, so let me review those quickly and then we’ll turn to an updated guidance for you.  Last night, we reported first quarter net income of 54 million or $0.21 per fully diluted share on total (audio interference) of 579 million.  These results include a net gain of 20 million or about $0.06 per share associated with the substitution of the Phoenix for the Noble Muravlenko in Brazil.  We had anticipated when we announced that that the substitution in January, that the net gain would be 15 million; but charges related to the cancellation of the reliability upgrade project on the Muravlenko were a little bit less than we had originally expected.  We footnoted the components of the gain on the income statement, which is included in the press release.
Contract drilling services revenues decreased 12% quarter-on-quarter to 543 million; however, average daily revenues of approximately 150,300 for the first quarter were up 7% from the previous quarter.  Non-operating time across the fleet accounted for most of the decline in absolute revenues.  In Mexico, a number of rigs rolled off contract as predicted on the fleet status, increasing the stack time by about 300 days.  We are of course pleased to have reported that some of these units are back to work on contract, and others are expected to commence work for Pemex shortly.
With respect to Brazil, the Noble Leo Segerius entered the shipyard in early February to begin its reliability upgrade, and the Noble Clyde Boudreaux underwent contract preparations for its one-year commitment with Shell before being transported on a heavy-lift vessel to Brazil.  Temporary import permit issues sidelined the Noble Ed Noble in Nigeria, where we also stacked the Noble Duchess and had some shipyard time on the Noble Percy John.  Unfortunately, we experienced a fire on the John during some maintenance that will keep the rig out of service during the repair period.  The John was scheduled to resume working for Exxon Mobile shortly, and we’re in the process of discussing a rig substitution for them so that it won’t impact our program.  Finally, we had several rigs, including the Noble Julie Robertson in the North Sea and the Noble Scott Marks in the Middle East in the shipyard during the quarter, preparing for upcoming contracts.  
Offsetting these non-operating days was a return to work by the Noble Homer Farrington, commencement of the Noble Roger Lewis contract, increases in stand-by rates on the rigs under contract to Shell in the U.S. Gulf, and the commencement of the Noble Jim Day contract with Shell.  Our operational downtime for the rigs working during the quarter was 3.8%.
Our contract drilling services costs for the first quarter were 306 million.  That is down 8% from the fourth quarter 2010; however, this was about 6 million above the top of the guidance we gave you in January and is largely tied to activity in Mexico.  First, we made the decision to demobilize certain rigs back to the Gulf of Mexico when their contracts were finished, and those demobilization costs were not in our original numbers; but they are largely offset by mob revenues.  Second, we ramped up our activity back on those rigs earlier than anticipated as contracting activity in Mexico increased more rapidly than we had planned.
DD&A for the first quarter came in at 158 million.  That’s up marginally from the fourth quarter’s 154 million and it’s within the range that we gave you.  SG&A expenses of 24 million were up compared to the 21 million in the fourth quarter, and the increase is related almost entirely to the settlement costs under the non-prosecution agreement reached with Nigerian authorities that’s related to our recently concluded U.S. FCPA investigation.  
Our tax rate was 22%, as expected.  Capital spending during the quarter was 614 million, up from 537 million almost entirely as a result of expenditures on our additional new build commitments announced during the quarter, which totaled around 252 million for the three drill ships and two jackups.  Capitalized interest for the quarter was about $27 million.
Now we’ll update you on our current expectations for capital and expenses for the remainder of 2011.  Our contract drilling services costs are now expected to come in a little over 1.3 billion as we put rigs back to work sooner than we had originally budgeted.  Obviously, that’s a great thing from a revenue standpoint but it does increase our expenses as well.  Our outlook for the second quarter contract drilling costs is that they will fall between 325 million to 335 million.  This increase is consistent with our expectation from January that the cost span was expected to move upward by about 20 million each successive quarter this year.
DD&A for the full year is estimated to be in the range of 630 million to 640 million with our second quarter figure expected to be in the range of between 155 million and 165 million.  SG&A is still expected to fall in the range of 90 million to 100 million with costs split about evenly across the quarters.  Interest expense net of capitalized interest will remain in the range of 50 million to 60 million which we gave on the last earnings call.
Finally, we’re still forecasting our effective tax rate for the year to be around 22%.  The rate could be affected by continuing changes in revenue in the Gulf of Mexico, but we’re going to keep it here for now.  Capital expenditures are expected to be around 2.5 billion in 2011.  That’s up from 2.1 billion on the last call with the increase reflecting the additional new builds we committed to since that time.  Of the total, we expect capitalized interest to be around 120 million for the year.
We obviously have a lot going on with our new build program with significant outlays stretching out over the next three years.  To help with your modeling, I wanted to give you a feel for our current CAPEX expectations for the new build program only, excluding capitalized interest.  Currently, we expect new build CAPEX in 2012 and beyond to total about 2.3 billion with around 900 million of that in 2012.
That concludes my remarks, and I’ll turn it over to Roger to talk about the market.

As usual, I’ll begin by updating you on our backlog statistics.  At March 31, the value of our backlog was approximately 15.1 billion, which breaks out as 11.8 for floating units and 1.3 for our jackups.",1027,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning to everybody.  As usual, I’ll begin by updating you on our backlog statistics.  At March 31, the value of our backlog was approximately 15.1 billion, which breaks out as 11.8 for floating units and 1.3 for our jackups.  Overall, we feel much more positive about the market today than we did on our last call.  The increase in oil price from the mid-80s to over $100 a barrel, driven by geopolitical events in the Middle East and North Africa as well as the unfortunate tragedy in Japan, has in turn incentivized our customer base to increase activity.  In addition, a number of predicted contracting events have come to fruition during the quarter.
In Mexico, we have been awarded contracts to seven of our jackups and extensions on an additional two.  That means that 75% of our fleet is either working or expected to return to work shortly.  There is also a two-year opportunity outstanding for which we believe the Roy Butler will be well-suited.  If successful, the rig would come off its current extension, be legged up to 300 foot capability, and be ready to commence the new contract in August.  As for the final two rigs available in Mexico, the Eddie Paul and Sam Noble, Pemex published four fast-track tenders on Tuesday, two of which are targeting these units.  If we are successful, they would be employed through year-end and are well positioned to bid on longer term work.  With a little luck, our fleet will be fully employed by mid to late summer.
We believe there is reason to be optimistic longer term in Mexico.  Recently, Carlos Morales Gil, head of exploration and production at Pemex, stated publicly that the company intends to operate around 40 jackups, which clearly signifies an intention to add new supply.  And last week, Pemex published tenders for one 1,000-foot semi, six 300-foot jackups, two of which have the 10-year age restriction, and three 350-foot jackups, none of which have an age restriction.  We think we have a good indication that Pemex’s plans will not only create opportunities for rigs to mobilize to Mexico from outside the western hemisphere, it will lead to day rates moving higher both in Mexico and in other areas as demand tightens.  
One such area might well be the Middle East, where Noble is approaching full employment of its jackup fleet.  It has been well publicized that Saudi Aramco intends to ramp up its activity level both onshore and off, and we are all awaiting the results of an ongoing 11-rig jackup tender.  As you know, the Roger Lewis recently commenced its three-year contract focused on drilling high pressure gas wells for Aramco, and the Scott Marks is expected to begin its contract in July; so Saudi is growing in terms of its importance for us.
We’ve bid a number of units into the current oil rig tender and believe that we are very well positioned to secure some of this long-term work.  We also believe there are times that Aramco could take more than 11 rigs.  This, combined with the increasing activity by other operators, could tighten supply in the region where the current industry utilization rate is about 74% and Noble’s current utilization is about 86%.  
Another area where Noble is essentially 100% contracted through the end of 2011 is the North Sea.  Despite the recent implementation of a tax increase in the U.K., we continue to see growing interest from customers both there and throughout the rest of the region.  We believe that we’ll see day rates increase and shortly break 100,000, and we are poised to begin adding to our 2012 contracted days.  
The only area where we are seeing difficult conditions for jackups is Nigeria.  On our most recent fleet status report, we disclosed that we were unable to come to terms on a contract with a customer with whom we had a letter of intent.  It had nothing to do with commercial or technical issues; rather, it was our ability to meet newly imposed local content laws in Nigeria that would have required Noble to assume more risk than we felt prudent.  Although we believe Nigeria is a hydrocarbon-rich country with significant potential opportunity, we anticipate these difficulties will continue particularly as Nigeria works through its election season.  We also disclosed that we experienced a fire aboard the Percy Johns, which has taken the rig out of service; but we are currently in the process of discussing a rig swap with our customer and expect to have that concluded shortly.
Turning to the deepwater, we are certainly feeling more positive now that we have commenced drilling an exploration well on the Jim Thompson.  This is a significant milestone with respect to putting the Gulf of Mexico fleet back to work, and we believe we’ll see more of our rigs return to work in the next several months, whether performing workovers, P&As, sidetracks, or drilling new wells.  We are optimistic about day rates for ultradeep water assets, and we believe that the recent 1,500 meter tender in Brazil is a very good example that contractors are maintaining discipline around the bidding process and that rate expectations on our side have not diminished.  We are not at all concerned that this particular tender was cancelled as there is a 3,000 meter tender still outstanding and we expect a second 3,000 meter tender to commence shortly.
Day rates on the 1,500 meter tender were in the mid to upper 400,000s, and those rates combined with other recent fixtures suggest to us that day rates for ultradeep water rigs are not only stable but may be starting to rise.  Overall, both Noble and the industry are in a better place than when we conducted our fourth quarter call.  While activity in the Gulf is nowhere close to pre-Macondo levels, it is moving in the right direction.  Jackup activity is strong, and it’s our view that the quality of Noble’s fleet and relationships will continue to serve us well.
I’ll be happy to address any specific questions, so let me turn the call back over to Lee.  Thank you.

When you look at the specifications and the contract requirements that Pemex is attaching to the new tenders, then the physical impediment for getting a rig into Mexico is greater than it was on past bids.  So I think all of that is going to add up to—there’s probably not a lot of jackups in the Gulf of Mexico that comply with Pemex specifications, whether it has an age restriction or not.  So yes, I think there is a view that you’ll see rigs move from other sectors into Mexico, which will have a resultant positive effect on those markets.

So we don’t have the problem that some of these other folks have that they have a bunch of issues with their jackups, so for us it’s purely strategic.  And so we’re going to take our time, we’re going to take a long view of it.  The fact that, as Roger pointed out, our utilization is improving and is high, there are customer issues and employee issues around talking about this too much.  So no, I don’t want to say too much more about it.  
We run, I think, the best operation out there.  We have the best safety culture out there.  We’re doing dramatic things with our floater fleet.  We’re starting to work on the jackup fleet.  We recognize that some of the other existing assets are getting a little long in the tooth and the question for us is where do we want this fleet to go in the next five to ten years?  And so we acknowledge that that’s something that some investors are concerned about, so we’re going to take a look at it and see what the best way forward for us is.  And beyond that, we’re going to have to let you know as the process develops.

If you take a look at the 300-foot index right now that ODS publishes, I think it’s just—it shows that the rates have moved from something like 79,000 to over 100, so a 25% gain quarter to quarter.  So we like a lot what we’re seeing in this market; and as I said in the prepared remarks, you’re going to see a lot of award activity and there’s going to be more of it in Mexico.  I think us and others will probably have an opportunity to be bidding, quote, free-market rates as opposed to rate caps.  Not sure if that will prevail much longer in Mexico.  You’re going to see a lot of awards in the Middle East.  You’re going to see rates in the North Sea start to move quite nicely.  We’re noticing that the tendering activity in the North Sea, I think I can say fairly that the rate of tenders for 2012, i.e. for the next spring/summer season, we’re seeing more than we’ve seen in the last couple years.  So all of these places—and particularly in Southeast Asia, there’s going to be a lot of tender activity.  So I think you’ll see rates on all classes of jackups move.
Shall we see it in the floating market?  I think on the ultradeep water fixtures, there’s reason to believe that the numbers that you’ve seen recently in Brazil and in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere, we would hope that those numbers may actually start to increase.  In lesser water depth capabilities, and interestingly enough particularly in some areas where moored rigs may be available, I don’t think it’s near term; but medium to long term, I think you’re going to see some possible rate increases to there.  I saw a statistic here recently where 42 out of 74 discoveries in 2010 were in water depths of less than 4,500 feet.  So you know, there is life, as David said, in the moored area.
Long answer.  Not sure if I answered your question.

That’s why our utilization is so high and that’s why our utilization is climbing.  The fleet’s in good shape and we operate the rigs in a place where they’re very well suited.  The question for us is what can you do to them?  As this company was built, as this fleet was built over the last 15 years, the practice was to go out and buy existing hulls and spend a lot of money on them and do the necessary upgrades on the front end and then maintain them so that they were taken up to a level of specification at the top of the market at the time they were acquired and maintained at that level.  The fact is, as Roger correctly points out, the specification of what the operators see available now has outrun the existing fleet, and so we, having taking much of our existing rigs to their technical limit, while they are in great shape, they’re not going to operate at the highest end.  So the question for us is where do we think the demand is going to develop over the next five to 10 years, what is our availability to be able to participate at the top end of that, and once we identify the assets what is the cleanest and best way for the shareholders to extricate those assets from the fleet.  And so that’s—I mean, that’s a non-answer to a good question, but we’re so early in the process and this is a complex issue, and it’s becoming more complex and more complicated just by virtue of the fact that we keep putting rigs to work.  So, you know, it’s hard to bid a rig and then turn around the next day and tell the customer that you just bid the rig to that, oh, by the way, we’re fixed to sell it.  
So this is not something we’ll do in the next two weeks.  This is something that may take some time, and we’re going to take our time and do a good, strategic evaluation of our fleet.

I’ve inspected a lot of rigs in my history, and some intimately; but I would argue that our fleet on the margin is top class for what it is.  I mean, again, the way this fleet was built, we didn’t build a lot of rigs from the keel up for a long time.  We acquired a lot of rigs and spent a good bit of CAPEX on it at those times.  I mean, I can remember when Jim was CEO and I was on another side of the fence and looking over, and looking at Noble spending 20 to $30 million to buy an asset and spending 20 to $30 million to upgrade it, and they upgraded it to a very high specification at the time.  And those rigs have been maintained to that specification.  So what we have is in top-notch condition.  I’m not embarrassed to take anybody to any rig we’ve got.  The fleet is in very good shape.
How that compares with the rest of the world, I don’t have a clue except that we can look at what we spend and compare it to what we could see in other published data and what we hear from customers, so I think our fleet would be very attractive in the open market to people who want to enter that part of the business.

I think that the prospects in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico are good.  Interestingly, there are number of one and two-well operators who are historically active operators in the Gulf of Mexico who may have one or two wells they want to drill, and as they sit today they don’t necessarily have a rig available and so there’s actually a good bit of dialogue with smaller operators, or other operators, I would say, who are not properly rigged about opportunities for those rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.  So I can’t put odds on whether or not the Runner and the Romano stay in the Gulf of Mexico.  I would say that my view is that they are more likely—my view today is that they have a better opportunity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico than my view would have been last quarter.  I still think the odds are probably pretty close to evenly split whether they go to work domestically in the U.S. or internationally, outside of the U.S.  Which one they’d get first, I think that’s still a good question.  But as the permit process becomes more clearly defined and as more permits are coming out, you know, the BOEM has now said that they’re no longer going to put out press releases on new permits because it’s becoming rope for them.  You know, the excitement’s dying but the permits are still flowing.  So I think as operators see the permits coming, I think the opportunities for our rigs in the Gulf are actually pretty good.  So we’ll just have to see how it continues to develop.

As you heard from the forward-looking statement, we are joined today by Jeff Chastain, our new Vice President of Investor Relations and we’re delighted to have a player of Jeff’s caliber and experience join the Noble team. He brings with him a wealth of experience and knowledge and we are certain that we all will benefit from his expertise. So Jeff, thanks for coming and welcome to the fight.
This was a frustrating quarter for us in terms of downtime. We experienced a good bit of downtime from premature failure of equipment related to subsea systems. I would like to touch on a couple of those more significant items right now. On the Noble Danny Adkins, we suffered an internal seal failure on depth compensated accumulator bottles on the BOP stack. This failure would precluded the dead man circuit from operating correctly and the bottle had to be replaced.  Spare bottles also failed and the final repair involved engaging the manufacturer to provide a newly designed and more appropriate solution, installing the newly provided bottle and then demonstrating to BOEM that the repair was complete. The second event was a result of a quality assurance failure by the manufacturer of the lower flange of a newly fabricated slip joint for the Noble Clyde Boudreaux.
In this case, we had to oversee the re-manufacturer and installation of a new flange at an appropriate on-shore facility before the slip joint could be reconstructed and redeployed offshore. Downtime in the Noble Dave Beard was a result of two separate rise or leakage issues involving faulty coatings and worn out rig seals. Most of these failures were equipment related to manufacturing and we have had numerous discussions at all levels with the executives and staff of these organizations.  Unfortunately even though these events significantly reduced our revenue, our recourse is very limited.
The good news is that these are separate, unrelated events that we have remedied and are not symptomatic of unknown or unsolvable issues.  That said, giving the complexity of new kit and recognizing the inevitable change in a post-Macando world, I think it is likely the industry will begin to experience a decline in tolerance for even the most benign subsea issues, even on equipment that may have multiple layers of redundancy.  
The result is likely to be more extra downtime in the future worldwide. In some cases the cost of that downtime may be borne by the operator and in some cases by the contractor.  How we adjust to the new reality will be more clearly to find as the exact application of rules and expectations becomes clear in the months and years ahead.  Greater complexity and lower tolerance for anomalies are part of our new reality and we must all be prepared to deal with it.  Noble’s intention is to lead the way in this regard which is why we are investing so heavily in subsea spares, training personnel and systems.
Now, let me also touch briefly on our new builds.  We had an outstanding Investor Day in Singapore in May where we showed off the Noble Bully 1, house and equipment and attended the steel-cutting ceremony for the first of JU3000 in jackups.  We told you we delivered three drill ships this year, the Bully 1, the Bully 2 and Globetrotter and we will. 
However, if you saw on our last week status, we slipped the Bully 5 about three weeks and the Globetrotter by about a month.  The Bully 1 delay arose as a result of re-dry dock the ship to replace thruster seals that were thought to be rolled during our initial installation which was performed by the yard and according to manufacturer’s instructions at that time.  Later the manufacturer recommended replacing the seals using a newly developed procedure.  We could have ignored the recommendation and taken a chance of having a seal problem sometime in the future. But we chose to deal with that issue now and since the Bully 2 schedule is dependant on Bully 1 we will also see that same three week delay ship on that route.
Today, Bully 1 is more than 99% complete and more than 90% commissioned. It is at anchorage offshore Singapore finishing up the commissioning of our marine safety systems before conducting integration tests and then setting sail for the US Gulf in about a month, for the customer acceptance testing will be completed. As for Globetrotter 1, its departure from SDX in China was a little later than expected primarily due to slower than anticipated cable pulling and terminations.
Monsoon weather off the Indian coast also slowed us down a little once we are in transit, but the rig has now arrived at the Huisman facility in Schiedam, Holland, where Huisman has been constructing and commissioning the multi-purpose tower, drill board and other equipment. In early August the yard will set the drilling package on the ship in a single heavy lift and complete the commissioning. We expect to christen the rig October 1st to be offshore to Europe in December for sea trials and to transit to the Gulf of Mexico for acceptance testing by Shell at year end. Again none of these delays will impact our promise to deliver all three ships this year.
Now, let’s talk about some good news. Over the quarter, the business environment has continued to improve both for us and the industry. With our successes in Mexico and Saudi Arabia, our jackup fleet is currently 90% contracted compared to a worldwide industry utilization rate of about 75%. We have also seen rates start to move forward again with the North Sea being a good example, rates there have crossed $100,000 a day and tendering activity in the region is very strong.
In the US and Gulf of Mexico despite the environmental lawsuit levied against BOEM permits are continuing to trickle out, but confidence in the process is improving. The Noble team today is now operating in full rates and we are optimistic about our customer receiving a permit from the Noble driller just about any day now which means that the four rigs committed to Shell would all be on contract at full rate.
We also believe we are making progress on deals that could be possible take either or both Noble Paul Romano and the Noble Amos Runner out of U.S. Gulf before the end of this summer. If these opportunities don’t materialize, we are seeing increased interest from operators in the Gulf as the backlog of prospects grows and impaired to resume drilling activity increases.
Noble story is about the ongoing transformation of the fleet, as we move ourselves up the technology. As you know, we have 11 units currently under construction, seven ships and four jackups, all are extremely high quality and higher specification. In addition, we have options for one more ship and two more jackups that we believe are well priced versus today’s shipyard cost.
With our currently committed newbuilds, by 2014 we will have one of the newest and higher specification floater fleets in the industry with a total of 27 units, 15 of those will be DP. I am not sure we can really emphasize the network step change that is from where we were just in 2006, when we had only 12 floaters, only four of which were DP.
On the jackup front, we clearly have more to do and we are examining our options which possibly include moving some of the [closed deck] rigs out of the fleet, as well as continuing to have rigs at the top of the complexity curve.
To be sure, this was a frustrating quarter for us with the long-term pieces still untapped. Furthermore, the market for us is looking better and we believe our plans for the company are sound and very well timed to provide great returns in the years ahead.
With that, let me turn over to Tom to run through the numbers.

291385,137068271,144117,"Noble Corp., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2011",2011-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Noble Corporation plc","Executives","Thank you, David and good morning to everyone. I plan to cover some specific details on the quarter, including some insights regarding contract drilling service revenues and costs and I’ll close with updated guidance for the third quarter and full-year",1173,"Thank you, David and good morning to everyone. I plan to cover some specific details on the quarter, including some insights regarding contract drilling service revenues and costs and I’ll close with updated guidance for the third quarter and full-year 2011.
Noble recorded net income of $54 million or $0.21 per diluted share on total revenues of $628 million for the second quarter of 2011. Earnings for the second quarter matched those for the first quarter of 2011.
Results for the second quarter included a tax benefit of $9 million or $0.04 per diluted share while the first quarter results included a one-time after tax net gain of $0.06 per diluted share resulting from the swap of the drillship Noble Phoenix for the drillship Noble Muravlenko in Brazil. 
Highlights from the second quarter included a $47 million increase in contract drilling service revenues to $590 million that's up 9% compared to the first quarter of 2011. The revenue improvement was driven by 592 day increase in operating days to rigs return to work adding in excess of $85 million in additional revenues.
Rigs contributing to the additional revenues included the Noble Homer Ferrington which is now operating under farmout agreement in the Eastern Med. The Noble Clyde Boudreaux which began a one year assignment in Brazil. The fix jackups returning to active status in Mexico, the Noble Jim Day although at a reduced dayrate for the full quarter in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
Shipyard programs on several jackups were also completed including the Noble Julie Robertson in the North Sea, the Noble Roger Lewis and the Nobel David Tinsley in the Middle East. The increase in operating days in the second quarter resulted in a very nice improvement at average fleet utilization which rose to 70% among the in-service rigs, that's up from 61% in the first quarter.
The measure includes average second quarter utilization for our semisubmersibles of 85%, up from 69% in the first quarter and average jackup utilization of 71% compared to 62% in the previous quarter.
Revenues in the second quarter also benefited from dayrate improvement on several rig led by the Noble Jim Thompson which enables our dayrate adjust to a full operating rate of 360,000 before bonus. The revenue increase was partly offset by an increase in operational downtime which was responsible for an estimated $43 million reduction in revenues in the quarter. David has already provided the detailed explanation on the matter.
The good news is four of the five rigs which experienced the out of service events returned to service prior to the completion of the quarter. Also causing a quarter-to-quarter revenue decrease were demobilization revenues earned in the first quarter on the drillship Noble Phoenix and several jackups operating in Mexico which were not matched in the second quarter along with reduced incentive bonus revenue from our contracts in Brazil.
Average dayrate declined in the second quarter to 140,300 from 150,300 in the first quarter due in part to the return-to-service of the six jackup rigs in Mexico at dayrates that were below the overall fleet average.
Contract drilling service cost in the second quarter increased $30 million from the first quarter to $337 million, slightly ahead at the top of the range of the guidance provided on the last call. The increase reflects the contract preparation and the startup cost incurred and applied to the drill which began operations in Brazil that accounts for about $12 million for the 30 and activity-based costs reflecting the return of jackups to work in Mexico which accounts for about 10 million of the 30 increase. The company has now all 12 of its jackups in the region committed. Also we saw an increase in labor expenses falling in the pay increase given to offshore workers that was effective in April.
Finally, the out-of-service events resulted in higher repair and maintenance costs and we incurred startup costs associated with the continuing ironing and training improves or newbuild assets that will be added to the fleet over the next six to 12 months.
Depreciation and amortization for the second quarter increased by $1 million to $163 million reflecting the addition of the new assets and other normal capital expenditures. SG&A expense declined $2 million in the quarter to $22 million as the level in the first quarter included a $2 million settlement payment associated with the conclusion of our FCPA investigation.
Interest expense net of the amount capitalized decreased $4 million in the second quarter to $15 million reflecting the payoff of Bully-joint venture credit facilities an increased capitalization of interest as construction progress levels associated with the 11 rig capital expansion program increased. Capitalized interest in the quarter was $29 million.
Our effective tax rate in the second quarter declined to 15% compared to 22% in the first quarter and our guidance of 22%. The decline was due primarily to the settlement during the quarter of two discrete tax items which totaled $9 million.
Finally, capital spending during the quarter was $815 million bringing the spending through June 30, 2011 to $1.4 billion. Like the first quarter of 2011 a substantial portion of the spending in the quarter was the result of expenditures on our newbuild projects.
Now, I’ll update you on our current expectations for capital and expenses for the remainder of 2011. Our contract drilling services top guidance remains a little over $1.3 billion for 2011. Our expectation for the third quarter of contract drilling cost is a range of $345 million to $355 million consistent with our guidance since early 2011 with the guided cost spend was estimated to move upward by about $20 million each successive quarter driven primarily by higher anticipated fleet activity.
DD&A for the full quarter is estimated to be in the range of $640 to $650 million with our third quarter figure expected to come in between $160 and $165 million.  SG&A is still expected to fall in a range of $90 to $100 million. For the remainder of the year cost in the third quarter show the slightly higher than the fourth quarter cost.
Interest expense net of capitalized interest should remain in the range of $50 to $60 million for the year with the third quarter below the $15 million seen in the second quarter due to higher capitalized interest.
Finally, our effective tax rate should remain in the low 20% range, although we did experienced a rate of 15% in the second quarter due to the benefit of settling the discrete items that I discussed.  I can’t roll out other matters from quarter-to-quarter that can cause volatility in the rate such as changes in the geographic source of our revenue or further tax settlements or assessments, but we do feel that the low 20% range is good. Capital expenditures are expected to be around $0.5 billion in 2011 consistent with our previous guidance.
That concludes my remarks and I will turn it over to Roger to address the current status and opportunities in the market.

Following the review of the company’s backlog statistics I will make some brief comments on the opportunities and challenges we see developing in our areas of operation.At the conclusion of the second quarter, backlog",1087,"Thank you, Tom and good morning.  Following the review of the company’s backlog statistics I will make some brief comments on the opportunities and challenges we see developing in our areas of operation.
At the conclusion of the second quarter, backlog stood at approximately $15 billion, essentially unchanged from the backlog at the end of the first quarter. Our floating rates accounted for approximately $11.4 billion of the backlog while jackups made 1.6. Our backlog [extends in 2023] and represents visible revenues on ore around 1.5 to 2 billion per year through 2015. Prospects for backlog growth are improving as we evaluate the remaining half of 2011.
We continue to witness improving conditions around the globe for floating rigs, especially deep water rigs and jackups with utilization and day rate improvements more apparent than was visible early in the year and in the deep order sector there are several indicators that customer demand is building. 
First, in the Gulf of Mexico, customers have been successful in receiving permits that allows for continuation of drilling in the region. The issuance of permits in the Gulf is a critical component of global supply and demand for rigs. The region represents a world class hydrocarbon play and we believe customers in the Gulf both large and small are gaining a little more confidence with a review of the award process. 
Having said that the process is complex and we realize that many customers made delayed recommitments until a predictable and reliable permitting process exists. In the mean time we believe that attractive current prospects continue to build creating a level of pent-up demand. Additionally, given the departure of quality rigs from the region and the possibility of further departures some of our customers have begun to express concern over the ability to secure a rig, as David mentioned.  We are seeing increased interest in moored rigs especially in our EVAs for drilling programs both within and outside the Gulf.
Second, recent contracts of deep water rigs indicates that day rates are firming. They’re on the mid to high 400 levels despite the continuing influx of new supply. We believe a series of awards will be made over the ensuing months, that will account for all of the deepwater availability in 2011, and several rigs coming into the market in 2012.
Third, and the number of rigs find that opportunity appears to be evaporating as customers exploration and development needs over the next 12 to 24 months, are more clearly defined. This creates an interesting challenge for those customers with near-term one and two well requirements. For us exploration success has been strong over the past 24 months, especially in Brazil where Petrobras, a major driver of long-term rig demand continues to be active in the market. Their latest tender is seeking one more 1,200 meter and one or more 1,500 meter rigs.
Petrobras is considering both dynamically positioned and moored units to address needs to late 2012 and beyond. It’s bids are due on August the 3rd.
Finally, the timing of the rigs availability in the market is gaining increased attention from customers. For example the near-term availability at the deepwater semi Jim Day, post it’s current contract is attracting a growing level of interest in the rig.
Additionally, we believe the unique combination of Noble’s reputation, and the high level of specification on the Jim Day, has a lot to do with the demand.
Shifting to the jackup sector. Prospects for the jackup sector also are improving. In Mexico where Noble operates 12 rigs, we’ve sent six to work during the second quarter and received commitments on two more, Sam Noble and the Roy Butler, that commit the rigs into and beyond late 2012.
Recall that early in January of this year, that Noble had only four jackups under contract in Mexico. Today, all 12 units are contracted or committed with 10 booked into and beyond late 2011.
Pemex rig needs continue to be defined and represented an impressive opportunity. At present there are tenders outstanding to 20 rigs representing almost 17,000 rig days of demand or 46 rig years. However Pemex experienced small response to recent tenders, so it will be interesting to see how contractors respond or not to the current round of bids. Having said that, its an important positive development for the sector and in particular an important opportunity for Noble.
In the Middle East region Noble is moving past 90% utilization of its fleet, compared to 70% only a few months ago. During the past quarter Aramco awarded contracts for the Joe Beall and Gene Hosue for three year durations at day rates of 81,000 on each rig. We now have four rigs contracted to Aramco providing an excellent base for operating efficiencies and additional growth. Prospects in the Middle East remain promising with Aramco continuing to bid for additional jackups.
In the North Sea where Noble is the largest jackup operator with eight rigs the company has enjoyed a 100% utilization of its fleet for the past several months. Strong fundamentals in the region are compelling customers to commit to programs in 2012 as evidenced by recent contract awards for the Byron Welliver and Lynda Bossler with rates ranging from the low 90s to the low 100s. With these contracts we now have five or eight jackups in the North Sea contracted into 2012 or beyond and with the remaining three units contracted into late 2011.
Finally in Nigeria we completed a rig swap in the second quarter following a fire on the Percy Johns that occurred while a rig was completing a scheduled shipyard program. The Lloyd Noble will replace the damaged rig during the repair period following which Pecy Johns will go back on location to complete the contract which runs into mid 2012. Three of the companies five rigs in the region remain on contract with one unit in the shipyard for a scheduled regulatory inspection, an upgrade and another cold-stacked. While uncertainties created by the new petroleum act and the local content requirements in Nigeria present significant challenges, there have been some promising fixtures in other West African countries at rates above and some cases well-above 100,000.
In closing, we remain confident of gradual improvement and utilization and day rates through 2011 for both floating rigs and jackups. As operators move forward with exploration and development programs and like ad continue oil price stability. That concludes my prepared remarks and I will the turn the call back to Jeff.

I think a lot of it does have to do with what Pemex does in some of their current contract standards and these rate caps.  All 20 of those bids, for your information do have a rate cap on it.  I believe that something like 60, 80, 83 to a 100 for the 250, 300, 350 respectively and there is one in there at for a 350 close to 1000 jackup at a 124. On the last two bids for 350 foot rigs effectively against our incumbent rigs, we can share with you so we chose not to bid. And I might expect that others will take the same position.
So I am not sure how long in this kind of a market that the rate cap will survive. There are other conditions in terms of very tight delivery windows and severe penalties for being late or termination right. And just for relatively high cost of doing business in that part of the world, from a contract administration and penalty perspective. All of that is going to make it a little difficult for Pemex to prosecute. Our current rig count is around 24. It is good news, it is up from 14 from six months ago. We hit the numbers anywhere from up to as many as 40 additional rigs over the next period, 3, 12 to 18 months. So I think a lot of this is going to be function of whether this contract is willing to accept the terms and my guess there are going to have to make some changes.

It is a little bit above the third option, but still we think based on the specification of that haul, we think that it is very, very well price based on if we went to yard today, both from an equipment perspective and from an FX perspective we think we are in good shape. 
On the jackups, we have the first two committed at 220, the second two committed at 235. We have options that go out till the end of the year that as you know are indexed and so we are updating that index regularly, so we have kind of an everyday view of what we think the current pricing is. I will tell you that just anecdotally what the yard indicated, had we built those rigs, at the peak of the last new build cycle say two years ago, two and half years ago, in 2008. Those probably would have been shipyard priced at around 280. 
So we think we are still well in the range of what a good price of those rigs will be on a relative basis and given where we see the market for those rigs, we think we are very well priced currently on those. But again those options aren’t due till the end of the year. We will have a discussion with our Board at the next Board meeting and we will table the drill ship option in earnest and we will have a good lively discussion about how we feel about the jackups and then we will let you know. But we do have those options and frankly we think that (inaudible) does for the fleet I think we will be very well positioned.

There is a growing confidence in the process, there is now a lot of evidence and you don't see it in terms of how much rolling out of the door, but there is starting to develop this kind of underlying current, we did get the wells drilled when Roger spoke about the Gulf of Mexico and opportunities there, there is a growing wave of excitement from operators on how are they going to get the work done and so there's a god bit of dialogue going on and there's confidence building.

For that particular piece of equipments, the flange on the slip joints wasn’t made up, it was just a manufacturing follow up.
So those are not part of a post-Macondo world. The commentary on the post-Macondo world is I think is just notionally to give you guys guidance that as the rules and as the tolerance or and not only, keep in mind that BOP stack has multiple control functions and have built-in redundancy. In the past we would have continued to operate based on the capability of the redundancy circuitry and we would have continued to operate in many environments and many circumstances that in the future we may not be.
And so I’m just cautioning you and whether other contractors do or don’t, I’m just cautioning you that as we move through the next and I’ve said months and years ahead as we more clearly define what the rules and expectations are, I think it’s reasonable to assume that we as an industry are going to have more data. Again, that’s the operator is going to bear some of that and we will bear some of it. The ultimate saddle for this is going to ride on the backs of the consumer because ultimately this is going to cost more to drill these wells. That’s what I’m saying.

We are just trying to guide you to the notion that in the future we think the industry is going to see more downturn.  That’s the purpose of this.
How we would model it, we don’t have enough data yet and enough experience operating in this regime to be able to predict it so how you model it is you know, we are entering our budget process now and this is a conversation we are having internally in terms of how we are going to budget and how we intend to model it, I cant give you any guidance on how we should do it.
I hope we that don’t see this; I hope that we get a good enough handle on the preventative of this that we don’t have additional downtime, but I think its prudent to assume that we will and exactly how it manifest itself and how it looks; we just don’t have enough, there is just not enough days in good hard operation of the rigs, we have to predict that.
In terms of attrition, no I don’t think this has anything to do. I don’t think this will lead to attrition, its just - you know in the past when you have an A plus and a B plus and a blue pod and A plus and AB plus on yellow pod you get so much redundancy built into a subsea system and if you’ve got a red light on one bus, on one function on one side of a non-executable function you keep drilling. If its open function on the blue pod on a third set of rams and you don’t have that size of pipe in the hole, you just keep going.
If it’s a critical function like unlatching or closing sheer rims of course you deal with it. But we don’t know what tolerance there is going to be from the new regulatory authorities going forward.

So you know that depends on the strength of the market. You know, one of the things you see as you continue to build rigs, one of the things we see specifically having more so on the jackups, is the delta between the low spec and the high spec is getting much wider than it was in the past. That’s one of the reason, we are still excited about the JU 3000 in jackups is because the delta between even some of the newbuild rigs that are not high spec, delta between those rigs and our rigs is dramatic.
On the floaters, the delta is dramatic and it has been for a while, but there is nothing that comes out of Macondo that makes floaters technically obsolete. So our view is clearly there is going to be enough demand to absorb the newbuild capacity that’s coming in and the options, I don’t see that that’s a real issue going forward.

An operator has to make his permanent rigs specific, so there is a chicken and egg issue here where he has the customer of kind of concerned about the process but actually with the process they have to in some cases make a rig commitment. So that is an element of what we are seeing right now and that is directing some attention to our EVA’s. When you take a look around to see what rigs have left the Gulf of Mexico under the past 10 to 12 month you know there is realization if a customer wants to draw up a program here till late 2011 or 2012 they better move smartly. So Gulf of Mexico is an interesting area we will also be looking at Mediterranean, West Africa and Brazil.

We were both, you know, well into in the early parts of 2012 but on other hand we also like the fact that we have got quite a bit of availability in entering 2012.  So, no reason to think that story will not continue.  Yes, there are rigs that can handle the North Sea but not a lot of movement in that direction.
Mexico was spoken about.  I think the story in Saudi is still unfolding. Probably as recently as about 12 months ago there were 20 jackups, plus or minus.  Now we count that as probably around 30 of Aramco contracted.  So they have had a 30% increase in the 12 months period.  They are into market again.  You know, the last time they did 10 and took 16. So Aramco is still quite active and there are some other small operators in the Gulf area that are trying to respond to commodity crisis and drill short-term programs. We are up to 90% in the Middle East and we would hope to keep it at that level. South East Asia behaved nicely but it has been stable. The newer rigs seem to be continuing to earn around though the 130 range.
And West Africa I guess it has been may be a bit of sneaky uptick of over the past period you have seen a couple of rigs moving into the sector and as mentioned in the prepared remarks the prices have been at a 100 or better and I think you will continue to see a little more active there.

But we’ve added so many at the top, if we exercise our option on our next ship we’ll have 28 floaters, 16 of those are going to be DP, so that will be a very high performing, high returned generating suite of assets we believe.
So, its hard to imagine how far we brought this fleet in a very short time from 12 motors 4 DP rigs just a few years ago what we are headed to now. So we have done a good job on that side with it will be a very high spec. On the Jack up side, we talked in the past about what we are looking at from the Jack up fleet, we are still looking at, we are still evaluating processes to see with the best to way to if we decided to best to some with the best way to do.

Good morning and thank you for joining us on the call today.

Good morning and thank you for joining us on the call today.  With me in addition to Jeff are Dennis Lubojacky, our Vice President and Controller; and Roger Hunt, our Senior Vice President of Marketing and Contracts is in Geneva with us today.  Dennis is stepping in for Tom Mitchell who, as we previously announced, has left the company and that was effective October 10th to pursue another opportunity.  Our search for Tom’s replacement is well underway and we hope to have his successor identified by the end of the year.
I’ll begin today with some brief comments on our Q3 results which were significantly better than Q2 and update you on our ongoing fleet transformation efforts.  I’ll then ask Dennis to cover the detailed financial highlights for the quarter and then Roger will follow with a discussion on what has become a very active market for both the jack-up and floating rig sectors.  I’ll then make some closing comments before we take your questions.
We began to see a meaningful pickup in client demands for offshore units all over the world during Q2 as we noted on our last call back in July.  This improvement in inquiries and activity persisted through Q3 and continues today with a steady flow of new contract rewards throughout the fleet.   During Q3 we finalized discussions and secured 21 contracts on five floating units and 15 jack-ups, adding approximately $655 million in fleet backlog, which given the current burn rate per day kept the total backlog number as of September 30th at about $12.8 billion or basically flat with the June 30 numbers.  
Since the conclusion of Q3 we’ve added an estimated $395 million to backlog following the award of seven contracts including contracts for a previously stacked jack-up and a drillship, further indications of an improving business climate.  Our financial results for Q3 reflect the higher activity as well as an improvement in average daily revenues, the latter driven primarily by the return of all five active semisubmersibles in the US Gulf of Mexico to their full operating rates, a condition we’ve not experienced since the deep water drilling moratorium was mandated back in 2010.  
Improvements in Q3 results were partially offset by downtime in the fleet, a frustrating occurrence that we are continuing to work very hard to correct.  The downtime included unpaid repair days on three rigs in Brazil and two in our US Gulf of Mexico division.  Each instance was a separate unrelated event that had to be identified and resolved.  With few exceptions the downtime was due to required repairs on the subsea control system or the top drive drilling systems. 
We are attacking this issue on many fronts.  We are partnering with certain suppliers including NOB to improve communications between parties and jointly tackle reliability issues.  Further we’ve identified and are following programs of optimal cycle counts for certain subsea components prior to their replacement and we’ve upgraded other components with more robust alternatives.  Additionally our worldwide subsea facility is now up and running so we are warehousing more spares, training more people and working smarter. Finally, we’re taking a more active role during equipment refurbishment programs to reinforce the quality assurance control processes. Clearly our Operations Team is being proactive in this area and we’re making progress.  This will remain a top priority to the company and it will get better.
In addition to the improvement in quarter-over-quarter financial results, Q3 was noteworthy for the achievements relating to our fleet enhancement efforts.  During the quarter and into early October we exercised options with the [Jerong Shipyard] in Singapore for the construction of a fifth and sixth [Dijae 3000N] high specification jack-up at a cost of $245 million per rig.  Both units are expected to be delivered from the shipyard by the second half of 2014.  We also exercised the option for a fourth drillship with Hyundai Heavy Industries, or HHI, in Korea.  The estimated cost for this turnkey project is estimated to be $630 million excluding capitalized interest.  And again, we expect to deliver this rig in the second half of 2014.
As for the projects in progress, we delivered the drillship Noble Bully I from the [Keppler Yard] in Singapore and the rig is currently in transit to the US Gulf of Mexico where final commissioning and client acceptance will take place over the remainder of the quarter.  The drillship Noble Bully II left the dock at the [Keppler Yard] and is currently testing thrusters before it begins sea trials later this month.  And as we noted in our October 6th fleet status report, we will keep the rig in Singapore to execute a larger portion of commissioning at the yard prior to the rig’s departure to Brazil.  We now expect to depart Singapore in December.
Additionally we dedicated the drillship Noble Globetrotter 1 at the [Houseman Yard] in Holland earlier this month, following the installation of the rig’s multipurpose tower in August.  The rig is currently expected to be completed in Holland in December and will then depart for sea trials in the US Gulf of Mexico.  We remain on schedule to deliver these three initial drillship projects by the end of 2011 and we’re excited about the unique sophisticated technology that these rigs bring to the industry.
With that, I’ll turn the call over to Dennis Lubojacky to review the Q3 financial results.  Dennis?

Today I will discuss the significant drivers behind the Q3 revenue improvement compared to the Q2 results and our operating cost experience, and I will close with updated guidance for Q4 and full year 2011.
Noble reported earnings of $135 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, on total revenues of $738 million for Q3.  Results for Q3 included a tax benefit of $0.04 per diluted share relating to certain discreet tax matters.  You may recall that our Q2 results also included a $0.04 benefit due to certain discreet tax matters.  
Highlights from Q3 include a $115 million increase in contract drilling service revenues to $705 million, up 20% compared to Q2.  The revenue improvement was driven primarily by two events.  First, day rates on the Danny Atkins, the Noble Jim Day and the Noble Driller returned to their full operating level in the US Gulf of Mexico for all or a substantial portion of the quarter after operating under standby rates in the prior quarter, adding $54 million.  Also we experienced a 442-day increase in operating days in the quarter as the rigs returned to work primarily in Mexico and the Middle East, adding an additional $52 million.  The increase in operating days in Q3 resulted in improvement in average fleet utilization to 77%, up from 70% in Q2.  The measure includes average Q3 utilization for semisubmersibles of 84%, slightly below 85% in Q2; and average jack-up utilization of 82%, up from the previous quarter of 71%.
As David mentioned, we experienced significant downtime on five floating units in the quarter, all of which have returned to their contractual day rates.  Average day rates increased in Q3 to $151,800 from $143,000 in Q2 due primarily to the US Gulf of Mexico rigs returning to full day rate.  Contract drilling services in Q3 increased $22 million or 6% from Q2 to $359 million, slightly above the top of the range of guidance provided on the last call.  The increase reflects the ramp-up costs incurred on rigs returning to work in Mexico and the Middle East for $8 million, including mobilization costs of $4 million.  Also we saw an increase in operating expenses on the Noble Phoenix in preparation for its substitution for Noble Muravlenko in Q1 2012 in Brazil.  That accounted for about $5 million.  Finally, we continued to experience startup costs associated with the continued hiring and training of crews for new build assets that will be added to the fleet over the next six months and that amounted to about $2 million.
Depreciation and amortization for Q3 increased $3 million to $166 million reflecting capital projects on various rigs.  SG&A expense increased $6 million in the quarter to $27 million, slightly above our guidance.  Interest expense net of amounts capitalized decreased $3 million in Q3 to $11 million as a result of increased capitalized interest on our new build capital program.  Capitalized interest in the quarter was $32 million compared to $29 million in Q2.  
Our effective tax rate in Q3 declined to 12% as compared to 15% in Q2 and our previously full-year guidance in the low 20% range.  The decline was primarily due to certain discreet tax items mentioned earlier.  Without these discreet items the tax rate would have been approximately 19% in Q3.
Finally, capital spending including capitalized interest during Q3 was $559 million, bringing spending through September 30th, 2011, to approximately $2 billion.  Year-to-date we have spent approximately $1.3 billion for our new build projects, $463 million for major repairs, $156 million for sustaining capital expenditures and capitalized interest of $88 million.  
Turning my attention to guidance, we’re currently in the budgeting process and our initial guidance on 2012 will be available when we report Q4 2011 results.  Q4 contract drilling costs are expected to range from $370 million to $380 million, and consistent with our previous guidance it’s driven primarily by higher anticipated fleet activity as we continue to prepare our new build rigs for service and as new contracts commence in Egypt for the Noble Paul Romano and in Saudi Arabia with the commencement of activities on the Noble Gene House and the Noble Joe Beall.  
Depreciation and amortization for the full year is estimated to be in the range of $655 million to $660 million with our Q4 figure expected to come in between $170 million and $175 million.  SG&A is still expected to fall in the range of $90 million to $100 million.  Costs in Q4 should be slightly lower than Q3.  Interest expense net of capitalized interest should remain in the range of $50 million to $60 million in the year with Q4 flat with Q3. 
We are lowering our full-year effective tax rate from the low 20% to the range of 17% to 20%.  We did experience a rate of 12% in Q3 due to the benefits of discreet tax items, and I cannot rule out other matters from quarter to quarter that could cause volatility in the rate such as changes in the geographic source for revenues or tax assessments or settlements.  We anticipate our full-year 2011 annual capital spend to be about $2.7 billion, which is an increase of approximately $200 million over Q2 guidance due to the recent exercise of options for the construction of two additional high-specification jack-ups and a fourth ultra deepwater drillship.
That concludes my remarks, and I will turn it over to Roger to provide commentary on the offshore market.

We have been very busy with marketing efforts in our operating regions as well as regions we’re looking to penetrate. As David mentioned we’ve had success with 21 contract signings during Q3 and into October, including the relocation of one semi and the reactivation of a previously stacked drillship and jack-up rig.  I’ll spend my time today covering some facts regarding our impressive contract backlog, highlight some of our recent contracting success, address the current state of the ultra deepwater sector given the acceleration in contract awards witnessed during the second half of the year, and review the opportunities we see developing around our regions of operation.
A contract backlog of approximately $12.8 billion at September 30, 2011, is composed of floating rig contracts totaling an estimated $11.2 billion and jack-up rig contracts of $1.6 billion.  The backlog continues to represent visible revenues of approximately $1.5 billion to over $2.5 billion for each of the next four years, providing a significant base to seek future contracts on our three drillships under construction with Hyundai in Korea, and six high-spec jack-up new builds at the [Jerong Yard] in Singapore.  Clearly this revenue visibility affords us a nice flexibility as we run our global operations and investigate alternatives for further fleet enhancement.
During Q3 we secured contracts or contract extensions for several of our conventionally more deep water semis, including the Amos Runner and Max Smith in the Gulf of Mexico, and the Homer Ferrington and Paul Romano in the Eastern Med.  The Romano, which has been idle since June, 2010, is expected to commence an initial six-month drilling assignment in Egypt in November of this year.  Day rates for these units range from $325,000 to $380,000.  We were also successful in securing a three-year contract for the drillship Duchess at a day rate of $180,000 for drilling offshore India.  The rig is expected to commence the program during March of 2012 following a period of reactivation.
In the standard jack-up rig sector we achieved notable fixtures in most of our active regions.  In the North Sea we added approximately 56 rig months of backlog at day rates ranging from $113,000 to $125, 000.  In West Africa Tommy Craighead was awarded a seven-month program at $100,000 per day.  The day rates associated with these fixtures represent meaningful improvement from previous levels.  In Mexico we added approximately 1500 additional days of backlog at slightly higher rates and in the Middle East we will reactivate the Dick Favor for an initial 90-day contract at a day rate of $95,000.  The increase in contract activity is as good as we’ve seen it since early 2010.  
We’re also witnessing increased demand from customers for ultra deepwater drilling rigs.  If we turn the clock back to this call in 2010, we saw 17 ultra deepwater rigs under construction scheduled for delivery in 2011 and without contracts.  Today, only two of these 17 units are officially without a contract and we see operators committing on units with deliveries in 2012.  This is an impressive turn of events to say the least.  Since the end of Q2 2011 we’ve seen approximately 20 contract announcements covering ultra deepwater rig needs in multiple geographies, and during the past month we saw fixtures on four new builds with two of them above $500,000 per day.  The average term of these fixtures was over two years each.  
The long-term need for ultra deepwater rigs has been driven by a number of important factors.  First, the crude oil price remains resilient even in the toughest macroeconomic environment, averaging $93 per barrel over the past year and over $85 per barrel since August of 2011.  Next, we continue to witness successful exploration drilling results.  According to ODS, through September we have seen 15 announced discoveries during 2011 in deepwater, defined as 4000 feet and greater, with an average water depth of 6500 feet.  Given three months left in the year, we can see the fourth straight year of 20 or more announced discoveries following 27 in 2010, 28 in ’09 and 32 in ’08.  
These discoveries are occurring in an expanding number of geographic locations.  In 2011 there were discoveries in eight different locations including Australia, Brazil, French Guiana, Ghana, India, Mauritania, Mexico, Mozambique and the US Gulf of Mexico.  This compares to only five different locations in 2008 when there was concentration in Angola, Brazil and the Gulf of Mexico.  In addition, new offshore areas are opening for exploration as various countries obtain a better understanding of the hydrocarbon potential.  Finally, the drilling success is supporting a continuing shift toward development drilling which typically requires multi-year commitments to rigs.
As the ultra deepwater sector improves we believe Noble is well positioned with near- and long-term availability including the semis Jim Day in the Gulf of Mexico, which is expected to be available in late January, 2012, and the Clyde Boudreaux with an expected availability date in April of 2012.  Our three un-contracted drillships under construction in the Hyundai yard have delivery dates in 2013 and 2014, and we’ve began a dialog with customers regarding some of these units.
Before I close this morning I’d like to quickly cover some of our regional markets and how we see those regions developing.  In Mexico we achieved 85% utilization for Q3 versus 65% for the previous quarter.  As of today we have 11 of 12 jack-ups in the region under contract.  Half of our fleet is contracted through 2012 with two rigs booked into Q3 2014 while the other half will come off contract at the end of this year.  This tends to suggest a dilemma - i.e., is the glass half full or half empty?  However, considering Pemex’s urgent need for additional rig capacity and their current tendering activity combined with our solid reputation in the region, we believe we are positioned for upside; i.e., we do see the glass as half full.  Regarding the semi Max Smith, we believe Pemex has a significant program to support a floater for several more years.  We expect the tender to be processed by the end of December; however, we’re also monitoring prospects for this rig in other regions.
We are pleased to report that we continue to receive considerable support from our customer base in the North Sea.  Since announcing extensions two weeks ago on the Lynda Bossler for six months at $125,000, and on the George Sauvageau for twelve months at $115,000, we have been awarded an additional four months on the Lynda Bossler at $115,000, twelve months on the Ronald Hoope at $113,000, and ten months on the Piet van Ede at $113,000 per day.  We believe this speaks well on two key demand drivers: our customers place high value on the reliability of Noble’s service in the North Sea and they are optimistic about their longer-term programs. On the floater side we can report on a five-month extension to the Ton van Langeveld from mid-2012 at a rate of $247,500.
With the reactivation of the Dick Favor all 14 of Noble’s jack-ups in the Middle East are under contract, with six units contracted into 2014.  We made a decision in 2010 to place some jack-ups in the region into accommodation mode to avoid stacking during the weak market conditions.  We have seen two of these units, the Gene House and the Joe Beall move back into drilling mode under long-term contracts with Aramco.  We may see similar opportunities on the remaining three units during 2012.  Additional tenders are expected from Aramco in the near term for a variety of drilling needs.  As for our six [JU-3000] high spec jack-ups under construction, we continue to identify and pursue prospects in the UK and Danish sectors of the North Sea as well as key locations in the Middle East, Asia and Australia, and West Africa.  
Lastly, some news on Alaska.  While Alaska may not represent a major revenue source for Noble at this time, we are excited about our potential commencement of drilling operations in the [Bofet] and the [Chuckchee] Seas.  We are working closely with Shell to prepare the drillship Discoverer for Arctic operations and to upgrade the Shell-owned semi [Colluck] in Seattle for next year’s summer drilling season.  We can also report that we’ve reached agreement with Shell to extend the current contract from December 2011 for a term of two years at a base rate of $240,000 per day.  It is widely reported that Shell has invested heavily in preparing to drill in Alaska and we are honored at the prospect of playing an important role in their exploration campaign.  
In summary, utilization and day rates are improving across the mobile offshore drilling fleet.  Ultra deepwater has once again crossed the $500,000 per day threshold and could move higher in 2012.  Tightness in the ultra deepwater segment is leading to opportunities for deepwater rigs such as our Paul Romano, Amos Runner and Max Smith.  More standard jack-ups are going back to work around the world and Noble is well positioned to benefit from further rate increases.  With that I’ll pass the call back to David.

As I noted earlier we are making tremendous progress toward the transformation of the Noble fleet.  Our 14 shipyard projects consisting of eight dynamically positioned drillships and six high specification jack-ups have begun to exit the yards.  Very soon we will be down to five drillships and six jack-ups projects in progress with all but one of these projects consolidated into one of two top-tier shipyards with excellent histories of project execution, and by the end of 2014 we’re projected to have 16 dynamically positioned semisubmersible drillships in the fleet, up from just 4 five years ago.
Three of our eight drillships under construction and all six of our jack-ups new builds are all currently without contracts.  We view this capacity as a huge positive.  As Roger indicated, client demand for the timely availability of high specification units is building as evidenced by the high number of contract awards for the ultra deepwater units since the end of Q2 2011, and the rapidly depleting ultra deepwater capacity available for 2012.  I believe Noble is in a great position with the opportunity to offer these new high specification jack-ups and drillships as well as certain existing rigs such as Roger mentioned on the Jim Day and the Clyde Boudreaux, at a time when availability of the industry’s current and future high specification units is increasingly secured by contracts.  
The combination of these factors should provide Noble with an earnings and cash flow growth profile over the next three to four years that is among the industry’s best.  And with that I’ll turn it back to Jeff.

We started consolidating our subsea efforts and building a subsea capability about three years ago and it’s now fully up and running.  A lot of things we’re seeing, one of the issues we saw on the top drive was a top drive that had been freshly shopped during the moratorium and we brought it out, and we had a seal failure and a gearbox drained.  And you know, it takes time.  Those units are not on the shelf - you’ve got to take them down, rig them down, send them in and re-shop them.  It was just a foul-up in the manufacturer’s shop. 
So we’re doing a lot of things. I mean we work closely with suppliers.  We’re watching closer what they do.  We’re more involved and we’re kind of getting ourselves wired for running more sophisticated equipment flat out all over the place.  We’re spared up; our downtime will improve.  It’s frustrating right now, it was really frustrating Q2 and it’s frustrating now but with what we’re doing it will get better.

If we’re patient this year pricing’s going to come our way.”  And as it turns out there’s been quite a bit of discipline on the supply side from a pricing perspective and I think if you look at the most recent bid to Petrobras for the 1500-meter bid, I think only one number of all of the bids for a 6000-foot job was below $500,000.  So I think there’s quite a bit of discipline on the supply side.  Having said that, there’s still 2.3 units coming to the market every month, either new build or coming off contract so there’s still quite a bit of supply coming to the market but the rate of pickup right now, it seems to be matching it.

Globetrotter II, which is the only non-Hyundai or [Jerong Yard] is actually ahead of schedule at the shipyard in China and so we feel very good about where we are right now.  Shipyard pricing is coming up some.  We exercised our fourth option in Hyundai at $630 million which is an all-in number but it was a very attractive shipyard price.  I think those prices are coming up a little bit.  I think for us, we will probably focus on execution more in the months ahead as we move through.  You know, we’re still doing this fleet evaluation to see which rigs we think are key, core assets going forward and so we’ve got a lot going on right now.  
We are heavily focused right now on a number of projects, not only the new builds but getting the [Colluck] ready and the Discoverer both for Alaska next year, finishing our drillship upgrades.  So I think right now we’re going to work hard one execution, get the projects in good shape; get everything done that we want to do fleet-wide and then we’ll take another look at it probably sometime next year on what we think the market looks like for future opportunities.

I think there was only $20,000 to $30,000 a day.  So I think that that’s a great indicator.  I think how many rigs they’ll take? It could be as little as two and as many as five.
I guess I’ll make a comment that you know, it’s reinforcing to me that contractors are pricing the way they’re pricing it, and part of it is that OPEX in Brazil is increasing.  It’s got a labor market plus the strong currency that you know, is escalating.  So we need to be paid more for our services.

Frontier was kind of a unique opportunity specifically because of their primary sponsorship with Shell and Shell’s desire to do a major long-term alliance with us.  But when we look at $85 oil, which is what the average price is right now, even in this global economic bust that we’ve got going on right now the oil price is high enough to support basically any kind of offshore drilling activity anywhere in the world, so that gives everybody hope.  
What drove us to the shipyard was the value in the yards versus the value in the market that we could put those kinds of assets in the fleet for, and I think that’s probably still the case even though the shipyard prices are starting to come up.  I think you’ll see shipyard prices and equipment prices continue to move up but we’ve seen no slack in the ask of existing assets, assets that we might want to put in the fleet.  We’ve seen no slack in what these guys are willing to take for those assets so that’s really what drove us to the yard anyway.

We have downtime provisions in our contracts.  In some cases they’re better than others and in some cases we build up a bank, but the fact is if you’re working in 10,000 feet of water it takes you a long enough time to [trick the stack up] and get it where you can work on it that effectively you’re going to outrun your downtime bank.  So the right answer is do what we’re doing and try to build up to prevent the downtime and not deal with it after the fact. So I would expect that over time our revenue performance is going to improve in this respect just from those efforts.

Every well in the Gulf of Mexico’s different so it’s kind of hard to be able to quantify exactly what that means but most of the estimates I’ve seen are if you drill in the same well today that you were drilling two years ago, you’re arguably 15% to 20% longer just in time, and that cost really at this point accrues to the operator, not the contractor.

Good morning and thank you for joining us on the call today. With me in addition to Jeff are Dennis Lubojacky, our Vice President and Controller; and Roger Hunt, our Senior Vice President of Marketing and Contracts is in Geneva with us today",903,"Thanks, Jeff. Good morning and thank you for joining us on the call today. With me in addition to Jeff are Dennis Lubojacky, our Vice President and Controller; and Roger Hunt, our Senior Vice President of Marketing and Contracts is in Geneva with us today.  Dennis is stepping in for Tom Mitchell who, as we previously announced, has left the company and that was effective October 10th to pursue another opportunity. Our search for Tom’s replacement is well underway and we hope to have his successor identified by the end of the year.
I’ll begin today with some brief comments on our Q3 results which were significantly better than Q2 and update you on our ongoing fleet transformation efforts.  I’ll then ask Dennis to cover the detailed financial highlights for the quarter and then Roger will follow with a discussion on what has become a very active market for both the jack-up and floating rig sectors. I’ll then make some closing comments before we take your questions.
We began to see a meaningful pickup in client demands for offshore units all over the world during Q2 as we noted on our last call back in July.  This improvement in inquiries and activity persisted through Q3 and continues today with a steady flow of new contract rewards throughout the fleet.  During Q3 we finalized discussions and secured 21 contracts on five floating units and 15 jack-ups, adding approximately $655 million in fleet backlog, which given the current burn rate per day kept the total backlog number as of September 30th at about $12.8 billion or basically flat with the June 30 numbers.  
Since the conclusion of Q3 we’ve added an estimated $395 million to backlog following the award of seven contracts including contracts for a previously stacked jack-up and a drillship, further indications of an improving business climate. Our financial results for Q3 reflect the higher activity as well as an improvement in average daily revenues, the latter driven primarily by the return of all five active semisubmersibles in the US Gulf of Mexico to their full operating rates, a condition we’ve not experienced since the deep water drilling moratorium was mandated back in 2010.  
Improvements in Q3 results were partially offset by downtime in the fleet, a frustrating occurrence that we are continuing to work very hard to correct. The downtime included unpaid repair days on three rigs in Brazil and two in our US Gulf of Mexico division. Each instance was a separate unrelated event that had to be identified and resolved. With few exceptions the downtime was due to required repairs on the subsea control system or the top drive drilling systems. 
We are attacking this issue on many fronts. We are partnering with certain suppliers including NOB to improve communications between parties and jointly tackle reliability issues. Further we’ve identified and are following programs of optimal cycle counts for certain subsea components prior to their replacement and we’ve upgraded other components with more robust alternatives. Additionally our worldwide subsea facility is now up and running so we are warehousing more spares, training more people and working smarter. Finally, we’re taking a more active role during equipment refurbishment programs to reinforce the quality assurance control processes. Clearly our Operations Team is being proactive in this area and we’re making progress. This will remain a top priority of the company and it will get better.
In addition to the improvement in quarter-over-quarter financial results, the third quarter was noteworthy for the achievements relating to our fleet enhancement efforts. During the quarter and into early October we exercised options with the Jurong Shipyard in Singapore for the construction of a fifth and sixth JU3000N high specification jack-up at a cost of $245 million per rig. Both units are expected to be delivered from the shipyard by the second half of 2014. We also exercised the option for a fourth drillship with Hyundai Heavy Industries, or HHI, in Korea. The estimated cost for this turnkey project is estimated to be $630 million excluding capitalized interest. And again, we expect to deliver this rig in the second half of 2014.
As for the projects in progress, we delivered the drillship Noble Bully I from the Keppel yard in Singapore and the rig is currently in transit to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico where final commissioning and client acceptance will take place over the remainder of the quarter. The drillship Noble Bully II left the dock at the Keppel yard and is currently testing thrusters before it begins sea trials later this month.  And as we noted in our October 6th fleet status report, we will keep the rig in Singapore to execute a larger portion of commissioning at the yard prior to the rig’s departure to Brazil. We now expect to depart Singapore in December.
Additionally we dedicated the drillship Noble Globetrotter 1 at the Huisman yard in Holland earlier this month, following the installation of the rig’s multipurpose tower in August. The rig is currently expected to be completed in Holland in December and will then depart for sea trials in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We remain on schedule to deliver these 3 initial drillship projects by the end of 2011 and we’re excited about the unique sophisticated technology that these rigs bring to the industry.
With that, I’ll turn the call over to Dennis Lubojacky to review the Q3 financial results.  Dennis?"
291385,141489503,207234,"Noble Corp., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2011",2011-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Noble Corporation plc","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning to everyone. Today I will discuss the significant drivers behind the Q3 revenue improvement compared to the Q2 results and our operating cost experience, and I will close with updated guidance for Q4 and full year 2011.",952,"Thank you, David, and good morning to everyone. Today I will discuss the significant drivers behind the Q3 revenue improvement compared to the Q2 results and our operating cost experience, and I will close with updated guidance for Q4 and full year 2011.
Noble reported earnings of $135 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, on total revenues of $738 million for Q3. Results for Q3 included a tax benefit of $0.04 per diluted share relating to certain discreet tax matters. You may recall that our Q2 results also included a $0.04 benefit due to certain discreet tax matters.  
Highlights from Q3 include a $115 million increase in contract drilling service revenues to $705 million, up 20% compared to Q2. The revenue improvement was driven primarily by 2 events. First, day rates on the Danny Atkins, the Noble Jim Day and the Noble Driller returned to their full operating level in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for all or a substantial portion of the quarter after operating under standby rates in the prior quarter, adding $54 million. Also we experienced a 442-day increase in operating days in the quarter as the rigs returned to work primarily in Mexico and the Middle East, adding an additional $52 million. The increase in operating days in the third quarter resulted in improvement in average fleet utilization to 77%, up from 70% in the second quarter. The measure includes average third quarter utilization for semisubmersibles of 84%, slightly below 85% in the second quarter, and average jack-up utilization of 82%, up from the previous quarter of 71%.
As David mentioned, we experienced significant downtime on 5 floating units in the quarter, all of which have returned to their contractual day rates. Average day rates increased in Q3 to $151,800 from $143,000 in Q2 due primarily to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico rigs returning to full day rate. Contract drilling services in third quarter increased $22 million or 6% from the second quarter to $359 million, slightly above the top of the range of guidance provided on the last call. The increase reflects the ramp-up costs incurred on rigs returning to work in Mexico and the Middle East for $8 million, including mobilization costs of $4 million.  Also we saw an increase in operating expenses on the Noble Phoenix in preparation for its substitution for Noble Muravlenko in Q1 2012 in Brazil. That accounted for about $5 million. Finally, we continued to experience startup costs associated with the continued hiring and training of crews for new build assets that will be added to the fleet over the next 6 months and that amounted to about $2 million.
Depreciation and amortization for the third quarter increased $3 million to $166 million reflecting capital projects on various rigs. SG&A expense increased $6 million in the quarter to $27 million, slightly above our guidance. Interest expense net of amounts capitalized decreased $3 million in the third quarter to $11 million as a result of increased capitalized interest on our new build capital program. Capitalized interest in the quarter was $32 million compared to $29 million in the second quarter.  
Our effective tax rate in the third quarter declined to 12% as compared to 15% in the second quarter and our previously full-year guidance in the low 20% range. The decline was primarily due to certain discreet tax items mentioned earlier. Without these discreet items the tax rate would have been approximately 19% in the third quarter.
Finally, capital spending including capitalized interest during the third quarter was $559 million, bringing spending through September 30th, 2011, to approximately $2 billion. Year-to-date we have spent approximately $1.3 billion for our new build projects, $463 million for major repairs, $156 million for sustaining capital expenditures and capitalized interest of $88 million.  
Turning my attention to guidance, we’re currently in the budgeting process and our initial guidance on 2012 will be available when we report fourth quarter 2011 results. Fourth quarter contract drilling costs are expected to range from $370 million to $380 million, and consistent with our previous guidance is driven primarily by higher anticipated fleet activity as we continue to prepare our new build rigs for service and as new contracts commence in Egypt for the Noble Paul Romano and in Saudi Arabia with the commencement of activities on the Noble Gene House and the Noble Joe Beall.  
Depreciation and amortization for the full year is estimated to be in the range of $655 million to $660 million with our Q4 figure expected to come in between $170 million and $175 million. SG&A is still expected to fall in the range of $90 million to $100 million. Costs in the fourth quarter should be slightly lower than the third quarter. Interest expense net of capitalized interest should remain in the range of $50 million to $60 million in the year with the fourth quarter flat with the third quarter. 
We are lowering our full-year effective tax rate from the low 20% to the range of 17% to 20%. We did experience a rate of 12% in third quarter due to the benefits of discreet tax items, and I cannot rule out other matters from quarter to quarter that could cause volatility in the rate such as changes in the geographic source for revenues or tax assessments or settlements. We anticipate our full-year 2011 annual capital spend to be about $2.7 billion, which is an increase of approximately $200 million over second quarter guidance due to the recent exercise of options for the construction of 2 additional high-specification jack-ups and a fourth ultra deepwater drillship.
That concludes my remarks, and I will turn it over to Roger to provide commentary on the offshore market."

As David mentioned we’ve had success with 21 contract signings during the third quarte",1536,"Thank you, Dennis, and good morning everybody. We have been very busy with marketing efforts in our operating regions as well as regions we’re looking to penetrate. As David mentioned we’ve had success with 21 contract signings during the third quarter and into October, including the relocation of one semi and the reactivation of a previously stacked drillship and jack-up rig. I’ll spend my time today covering some facts regarding our impressive contract backlog, highlight some of our recent contracting success, address the current state of the ultra deepwater sector given the acceleration in contract awards witnessed during the second half of the year, and review the opportunities we see developing around our regions of operation.
A contract backlog of approximately $12.8 billion at September 30, 2011, is composed of floating rig contracts totaling an estimated $11.2 billion and jack-up rig contracts of $1.6 billion. The backlog continues to represent visible revenues of approximately $1.5 billion to over $2.5 billion for each of the next 4 years, providing a significant base to seek future contracts on our 3 drillships under construction with Hyundai in Korea, and 6 high-spec jack-up new builds at the Jurong yard in Singapore. Clearly this revenue visibility affords us a nice flexibility as we run our global operations and investigate alternatives for further fleet enhancement.
During the third quarter we secured contracts or contract extensions for several of our conventionally more deep water semis, including the Amos Runner and Max Smith in the Gulf of Mexico, and the Homer Ferrington and Paul Romano in the Eastern Med. The Romano, which has been idle since June, 2010, is expected to commence an initial 6 month drilling assignment in Egypt in November of this year. Day rates for these units range from $325,000 to $380,000. We were also successful in securing a 3 year contract for the drillship Duchess at a day rate of $180,000 for drilling offshore India. The rig is expected to commence the program during March of 2012 following a period of reactivation.
In the standard jack-up rig sector we achieved notable fixtures in most of our active regions. In the North Sea we added approximately 56 rig months of backlog at day rates ranging from $113,000 to $125,000. In West Africa Tommy Craighead was awarded a 7 month program at $100,000 per day. The day rates associated with these fixtures represent meaningful improvement from previous levels. In Mexico we added approximately 1500 additional days of backlog at slightly higher rates and in the Middle East we will reactivate the Dick Favor for an initial 90-day contract at a day rate of $95,000. The increase in contract activity is as good as we’ve seen it since early 2010.  
We’re also witnessing increased demand from customers for ultra deepwater drilling rigs. If we turn the clock back to this call in 2010, we saw 17 ultra deepwater rigs under construction scheduled for delivery in 2011 and without contracts. Today, only 2 of these 17 units are officially without a contract and we see operators committing on units with deliveries in 2012. This is an impressive turn of events to say the least. Since the end of Q2 2011 we’ve seen approximately 20 contract announcements covering ultra deepwater rig needs in multiple geographies, and during the past month we saw fixtures on 4 new builds with 2 of them above $500,000 per day. The average term of these fixtures was over 2 years each.  
The long-term need for ultra deepwater rigs has been driven by a number of important factors. First, the crude oil price remains resilient even in the toughest macroeconomic environment, averaging $93 per barrel over the past year and over $85 per barrel since August of 2011. Next, we continue to witness successful exploration drilling results. According to ODS, through September we have seen 15 announced discoveries during 2011 in deepwater, defined as 4000 feet and greater, with an average water depth of 6500 feet. Given 3 months left in the year, we can see the fourth straight year of 20 or more announced discoveries following 27 in 2010, 28 in ’09 and 32 in ’08.  
These discoveries are occurring in an expanding number of geographic locations.  In 2011 there were discoveries in eight different locations including Australia, Brazil, French Guiana, Ghana, India, Mauritania, Mexico, Mozambique and the US Gulf of Mexico.  This compares to only 5 different locations in 2008 when there was concentration in Angola, Brazil and the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, new offshore areas are opening for exploration as various countries obtain a better understanding of the hydrocarbon potential. Finally, the drilling success is supporting a continuing shift toward development drilling which typically requires multi-year commitments to rigs.
As the ultra deepwater sector improves we believe Noble is well positioned with near- and long-term availability including the semis Jim Day in the Gulf of Mexico, which is expected to be available in late January 2012, and the Clyde Boudreaux with an expected availability date in April of 2012. Our 3 un-contracted drillships under construction in the Hyundai yard have delivery dates in 2013 and 2014, and we’ve began a dialog with customers regarding some of these units.
Before I close this morning I’d like to quickly cover some of our regional markets and how we see those regions developing. In Mexico we achieved 85% utilization for the third quarter versus 65% for the previous quarter. As of today we have 11 of 12 jack-ups in the region under contract. Half of our fleet is contracted through 2012 with 2 rigs booked into Q3 2014 while the other half will come off contract at the end of this year. This tends to suggest a dilemma, i.e. is the glass half full or half empty? However, considering Pemex’s urgent need for additional rig capacity and their current tendering activity combined with our solid reputation in the region, we believe we are positioned for upside, i.e. we do see the glass as half full. Regarding the semi Max Smith, we believe Pemex has a significant program to support a floater for several more years. Expect the tender to be processed by the end of December; however we’re also monitoring prospects for this rig in other regions.
We are pleased to report that we continue to receive considerable support from our customer base in the North Sea. Since announcing extensions 2 weeks ago on the Lynda Bossler for 6 months at $125,000, and on the George Sauvageau for 12 months at $115,000, we have been awarded an additional 4 months on the Lynda Bossler at $115,000, 12 months on the Ronald Hoope at $113,000, and 10 months on the Piet van Ede at $113,000 per day. We believe this speaks well on 2 key demand drivers: our customers place high value on the reliability of Noble’s service in the North Sea, and they are optimistic about their longer-term programs. On the floater side we can report on a 5 month extension to the Ton van Langeveld from mid-2012 at a rate of $247,500.
With the reactivation of the Dick Favor all 14 of Noble’s jack-ups in the Middle East are under contract, with 6 units contracted into 2014. We made a decision in 2010 to place some jack-ups in the region into accommodation mode to avoid stacking during the weak market conditions. We have seen 2 of these units, the Gene House and the Joe Beall move back into drilling mode under long-term contracts with Aramco. We may see similar opportunities on the remaining three units during 2012. Additional tenders are expected from Aramco in the near term for a variety of drilling needs. As for our 6 JU3000N high spec jack-ups under construction, we continue to identify and pursue prospects in the UK and Danish sectors of the North Sea as well as key locations in the Middle East, Asia and Australia, and West Africa.  
Lastly, some news on Alaska. While Alaska may not represent a major revenue source for Noble at this time, we are excited about our potential commencement of drilling operations in the Beaufort and the Chukchi Seas. We are working closely with Shell to prepare the drillship Discoverer for Arctic operations and to upgrade the Shell-owned semi Colluck [ph] in Seattle for next year’s summer drilling season. We can also report that we’ve reached agreement with Shell to extend the current contract from December 2011 for a term of 2 years at a base rate of $240,000 per day. It is widely reported that Shell has invested heavily in preparing to drill in Alaska and we are honored at the prospect of playing an important role in their exploration campaign.  
In summary, utilization and day rates are improving across the mobile offshore drilling fleet. Ultra deepwater has once again crossed the $500,000 per day threshold and could move higher in 2012. Tightness in the ultra deepwater segment is leading to opportunities for deepwater rigs such as our Paul Romano, Amos Runner and Max Smith.  More standard jack-ups are going back to work around the world and Noble is well positioned to benefit from further rate increases. With that I’ll pass the call back to David."

As I noted earlier we are making tremendous progress toward the transformation of the Noble fleet. Our 14 shipyard projects consisting of 8 dynamically positioned drillships and 6 high specification jack-ups have begun to exit the yards. Very soon we will be down to 5 drillships and 6 jack-ups projects in progress with all but 1 of these projects consolidated into 1 of 2 top-tier shipyards with excellent histories of project execution, and by the end of 2014 we’re projected to have 16 dynamically positioned semisubmersible drillships in the fleet, up from just 4 five years ago.
3 of our 8 drillships under construction and all 6 of our jack-ups new builds are all currently without contracts. We view this capacity as a huge positive. As Roger indicated, client demand for the timely availability of high specification units is building as evidenced by the high number of contract awards for the ultra deepwater units since the end of the second quarter 2011, and the rapidly depleting ultra deepwater capacity available for 2012. I believe Noble is in a great position with the opportunity to offer these new high specification jack-ups and drillships as well as certain existing rigs such as Roger mentioned on the Jim Day and the Clyde Boudreaux, at a time when availability of the industry’s current and future high specification units is increasingly secured by contracts.  
The combination of these factors should provide Noble with an earnings and cash flow growth profile over the next 3 to 4 years that is among the industry’s best. And with that I’ll turn it back to Jeff."

A lot of things we’re seeing, 1 of the issues we saw on the top drive was a top drive that had been freshly shopped during the moratorium and we brought it out, and we had a seal failure and a gearbox drained. And you know it takes time. Those units are not on the shelf. You’ve got to take them down, rig them down, send them in and re-shop them. It was just a foul-up in the manufacturer’s shop. So we’re doing a lot of things. I mean we work closely with suppliers. We’re watching closer what they do. We’re more involved and we’re kind of getting ourselves wired for running more sophisticated equipment flat out all over the place. We’re spared up. Our downtime will improve.

The expectation was we just couldn’t keep up and the fact is we have and then some.

Frontier was kind of a unique opportunity specifically because of their primary sponsorship with Shell and Shell’s desire to do a major long-term alliance with us. But when we look at $85 oil, which is what the average price is right now, even in this global economic bust that we’ve got going on right now the oil is high enough to support basically any kind of offshore drilling activity anywhere in the world, so that gives everybody hope. What drove us to the shipyard was the value in the yards versus the value in the market that we could put those kinds of assets in the fleet for, and I think that’s probably still the case even though the shipyard prices are starting to come up. I think you’ll see shipyard prices and equipment prices continue to move up but we’ve seen no slack in the ask of existing assets -- assets that we might want to put in the fleet. We’ve seen no slack in what these guys are willing to take for those assets so that’s really what drove us to the yard anyway."

The regulatory issues right now that are slowing down drilling operations really go to operators’ processes and we’re effectively on full rate there.  So I don’t know that it’s really regulatory issues that’s slowing us down. It’s just equipment repair periods.
We have downtime provisions in our contracts. In some cases they’re better than others and in some cases we build up a bank, but the fact is if you’re working in 10,000 feet of water it takes you a long enough time to trick the stack up and get it where you can work on it that effectively you’re going to outrun your downtime bank. So the right answer is do what we’re doing and try to build up to prevent the downtime and not deal with it after the fact.

Dennis is stepping in for Tom Mitchell who, as we previously announced, has left the company and that was effective October 10th to pursue another opportunity. Our search for Tom’s replacement is well underway and we hope to have his successor identified by the end of the year.
I’ll begin today with some brief comments on our Q3 results which were significantly better than Q2 and update you on our ongoing fleet transformation efforts.  I’ll then ask Dennis to cover the detailed financial highlights for the quarter and then Roger will follow with a discussion on what has become a very active market for both the jack-up and floating rig sectors. I’ll then make some closing comments before we take your questions.
We began to see a meaningful pickup in client demands for offshore units all over the world during Q2 as we noted on our last call back in July.  This improvement in inquiries and activity persisted through Q3 and continues today with a steady flow of new contract rewards throughout the fleet.  During Q3 we finalized discussions and secured 21 contracts on five floating units and 15 jack-ups, adding approximately $655 million in fleet backlog, which given the current burn rate per day kept the total backlog number as of September 30th at about $12.8 billion or basically flat with the June 30 numbers.  
Since the conclusion of Q3 we’ve added an estimated $395 million to backlog following the award of seven contracts including contracts for a previously stacked jack-up and a drillship, further indications of an improving business climate. Our financial results for Q3 reflect the higher activity as well as an improvement in average daily revenues, the latter driven primarily by the return of all five active semisubmersibles in the US Gulf of Mexico to their full operating rates, a condition we’ve not experienced since the deep water drilling moratorium was mandated back in 2010.  
Improvements in Q3 results were partially offset by downtime in the fleet, a frustrating occurrence that we are continuing to work very hard to correct. The downtime included unpaid repair days on three rigs in Brazil and two in our US Gulf of Mexico division. Each instance was a separate unrelated event that had to be identified and resolved. With few exceptions the downtime was due to required repairs on the subsea control system or the top drive drilling systems. 
We are attacking this issue on many fronts. We are partnering with certain suppliers including NOB to improve communications between parties and jointly tackle reliability issues. Further we’ve identified and are following programs of optimal cycle counts for certain subsea components prior to their replacement and we’ve upgraded other components with more robust alternatives. Additionally our worldwide subsea facility is now up and running so we are warehousing more spares, training more people and working smarter. Finally, we’re taking a more active role during equipment refurbishment programs to reinforce the quality assurance control processes. Clearly our Operations Team is being proactive in this area and we’re making progress. This will remain a top priority of the company and it will get better.
In addition to the improvement in quarter-over-quarter financial results, the third quarter was noteworthy for the achievements relating to our fleet enhancement efforts. During the quarter and into early October we exercised options with the Jurong Shipyard in Singapore for the construction of a fifth and sixth JU3000N high specification jack-up at a cost of $245 million per rig. Both units are expected to be delivered from the shipyard by the second half of 2014. We also exercised the option for a fourth drillship with Hyundai Heavy Industries, or HHI, in Korea. The estimated cost for this turnkey project is estimated to be $630 million excluding capitalized interest. And again, we expect to deliver this rig in the second half of 2014.
As for the projects in progress, we delivered the drillship Noble Bully I from the Keppel yard in Singapore and the rig is currently in transit to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico where final commissioning and client acceptance will take place over the remainder of the quarter. The drillship Noble Bully II left the dock at the Keppel yard and is currently testing thrusters before it begins sea trials later this month.  And as we noted in our October 6th fleet status report, we will keep the rig in Singapore to execute a larger portion of commissioning at the yard prior to the rig’s departure to Brazil. We now expect to depart Singapore in December.
Additionally we dedicated the drillship Noble Globetrotter 1 at the Huisman yard in Holland earlier this month, following the installation of the rig’s multipurpose tower in August. The rig is currently expected to be completed in Holland in December and will then depart for sea trials in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We remain on schedule to deliver these 3 initial drillship projects by the end of 2011 and we’re excited about the unique sophisticated technology that these rigs bring to the industry.
With that, I’ll turn the call over to Dennis Lubojacky to review the Q3 financial results.  Dennis?"
291385,141489503,207835,"Noble Corp., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2011",2011-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Noble Corporation plc","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning to everyone. Today I will discuss the significant drivers behind the Q3 revenue improvement compared to the Q2 results and our operating cost experience, and I will close with updated guidance for Q4 and full year 2011.",952,"Thank you, David, and good morning to everyone. Today I will discuss the significant drivers behind the Q3 revenue improvement compared to the Q2 results and our operating cost experience, and I will close with updated guidance for Q4 and full year 2011.
Noble reported earnings of $135 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, on total revenues of $738 million for Q3. Results for Q3 included a tax benefit of $0.04 per diluted share relating to certain discreet tax matters. You may recall that our Q2 results also included a $0.04 benefit due to certain discreet tax matters.  
Highlights from Q3 include a $115 million increase in contract drilling service revenues to $705 million, up 20% compared to Q2. The revenue improvement was driven primarily by 2 events. First, day rates on the Danny Atkins, the Noble Jim Day and the Noble Driller returned to their full operating level in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for all or a substantial portion of the quarter after operating under standby rates in the prior quarter, adding $54 million. Also we experienced a 442-day increase in operating days in the quarter as the rigs returned to work primarily in Mexico and the Middle East, adding an additional $52 million. The increase in operating days in the third quarter resulted in improvement in average fleet utilization to 77%, up from 70% in the second quarter. The measure includes average third quarter utilization for semisubmersibles of 84%, slightly below 85% in the second quarter, and average jack-up utilization of 82%, up from the previous quarter of 71%.
As David mentioned, we experienced significant downtime on 5 floating units in the quarter, all of which have returned to their contractual day rates. Average day rates increased in Q3 to $151,800 from $143,000 in Q2 due primarily to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico rigs returning to full day rate. Contract drilling services in third quarter increased $22 million or 6% from the second quarter to $359 million, slightly above the top of the range of guidance provided on the last call. The increase reflects the ramp-up costs incurred on rigs returning to work in Mexico and the Middle East for $8 million, including mobilization costs of $4 million.  Also we saw an increase in operating expenses on the Noble Phoenix in preparation for its substitution for Noble Muravlenko in Q1 2012 in Brazil. That accounted for about $5 million. Finally, we continued to experience startup costs associated with the continued hiring and training of crews for new build assets that will be added to the fleet over the next 6 months and that amounted to about $2 million.
Depreciation and amortization for the third quarter increased $3 million to $166 million reflecting capital projects on various rigs. SG&A expense increased $6 million in the quarter to $27 million, slightly above our guidance. Interest expense net of amounts capitalized decreased $3 million in the third quarter to $11 million as a result of increased capitalized interest on our new build capital program. Capitalized interest in the quarter was $32 million compared to $29 million in the second quarter.  
Our effective tax rate in the third quarter declined to 12% as compared to 15% in the second quarter and our previously full-year guidance in the low 20% range. The decline was primarily due to certain discreet tax items mentioned earlier. Without these discreet items the tax rate would have been approximately 19% in the third quarter.
Finally, capital spending including capitalized interest during the third quarter was $559 million, bringing spending through September 30th, 2011, to approximately $2 billion. Year-to-date we have spent approximately $1.3 billion for our new build projects, $463 million for major repairs, $156 million for sustaining capital expenditures and capitalized interest of $88 million.  
Turning my attention to guidance, we’re currently in the budgeting process and our initial guidance on 2012 will be available when we report fourth quarter 2011 results. Fourth quarter contract drilling costs are expected to range from $370 million to $380 million, and consistent with our previous guidance is driven primarily by higher anticipated fleet activity as we continue to prepare our new build rigs for service and as new contracts commence in Egypt for the Noble Paul Romano and in Saudi Arabia with the commencement of activities on the Noble Gene House and the Noble Joe Beall.  
Depreciation and amortization for the full year is estimated to be in the range of $655 million to $660 million with our Q4 figure expected to come in between $170 million and $175 million. SG&A is still expected to fall in the range of $90 million to $100 million. Costs in the fourth quarter should be slightly lower than the third quarter. Interest expense net of capitalized interest should remain in the range of $50 million to $60 million in the year with the fourth quarter flat with the third quarter. 
We are lowering our full-year effective tax rate from the low 20% to the range of 17% to 20%. We did experience a rate of 12% in third quarter due to the benefits of discreet tax items, and I cannot rule out other matters from quarter to quarter that could cause volatility in the rate such as changes in the geographic source for revenues or tax assessments or settlements. We anticipate our full-year 2011 annual capital spend to be about $2.7 billion, which is an increase of approximately $200 million over second quarter guidance due to the recent exercise of options for the construction of 2 additional high-specification jack-ups and a fourth ultra deepwater drillship.
That concludes my remarks, and I will turn it over to Roger to provide commentary on the offshore market."

We have been very busy with marketing efforts in our operating regions as well as regions we’re looking to penetrate. As David mentioned we’ve had success with 21 contract signings during the third quarter and into October, including the relocation of one semi and the reactivation of a previously stacked drillship and jack-up rig. I’ll spend my time today covering some facts regarding our impressive contract backlog, highlight some of our recent contracting success, address the current state of the ultra deepwater sector given the acceleration in contract awards witnessed during the second half of the year, and review the opportunities we see developing around our regions of operation.
A contract backlog of approximately $12.8 billion at September 30, 2011, is composed of floating rig contracts totaling an estimated $11.2 billion and jack-up rig contracts of $1.6 billion. The backlog continues to represent visible revenues of approximately $1.5 billion to over $2.5 billion for each of the next 4 years, providing a significant base to seek future contracts on our 3 drillships under construction with Hyundai in Korea, and 6 high-spec jack-up new builds at the Jurong yard in Singapore. Clearly this revenue visibility affords us a nice flexibility as we run our global operations and investigate alternatives for further fleet enhancement.
During the third quarter we secured contracts or contract extensions for several of our conventionally more deep water semis, including the Amos Runner and Max Smith in the Gulf of Mexico, and the Homer Ferrington and Paul Romano in the Eastern Med. The Romano, which has been idle since June, 2010, is expected to commence an initial 6 month drilling assignment in Egypt in November of this year. Day rates for these units range from $325,000 to $380,000. We were also successful in securing a 3 year contract for the drillship Duchess at a day rate of $180,000 for drilling offshore India. The rig is expected to commence the program during March of 2012 following a period of reactivation.
In the standard jack-up rig sector we achieved notable fixtures in most of our active regions. In the North Sea we added approximately 56 rig months of backlog at day rates ranging from $113,000 to $125,000. In West Africa Tommy Craighead was awarded a 7 month program at $100,000 per day. The day rates associated with these fixtures represent meaningful improvement from previous levels. In Mexico we added approximately 1500 additional days of backlog at slightly higher rates and in the Middle East we will reactivate the Dick Favor for an initial 90-day contract at a day rate of $95,000. The increase in contract activity is as good as we’ve seen it since early 2010.  
We’re also witnessing increased demand from customers for ultra deepwater drilling rigs. If we turn the clock back to this call in 2010, we saw 17 ultra deepwater rigs under construction scheduled for delivery in 2011 and without contracts. Today, only 2 of these 17 units are officially without a contract and we see operators committing on units with deliveries in 2012. This is an impressive turn of events to say the least. Since the end of Q2 2011 we’ve seen approximately 20 contract announcements covering ultra deepwater rig needs in multiple geographies, and during the past month we saw fixtures on 4 new builds with 2 of them above $500,000 per day. The average term of these fixtures was over 2 years each.  
The long-term need for ultra deepwater rigs has been driven by a number of important factors. First, the crude oil price remains resilient even in the toughest macroeconomic environment, averaging $93 per barrel over the past year and over $85 per barrel since August of 2011. Next, we continue to witness successful exploration drilling results. According to ODS, through September we have seen 15 announced discoveries during 2011 in deepwater, defined as 4000 feet and greater, with an average water depth of 6500 feet. Given 3 months left in the year, we can see the fourth straight year of 20 or more announced discoveries following 27 in 2010, 28 in ’09 and 32 in ’08.  
These discoveries are occurring in an expanding number of geographic locations.  In 2011 there were discoveries in eight different locations including Australia, Brazil, French Guiana, Ghana, India, Mauritania, Mexico, Mozambique and the US Gulf of Mexico.  This compares to only 5 different locations in 2008 when there was concentration in Angola, Brazil and the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, new offshore areas are opening for exploration as various countries obtain a better understanding of the hydrocarbon potential. Finally, the drilling success is supporting a continuing shift toward development drilling which typically requires multi-year commitments to rigs.
As the ultra deepwater sector improves we believe Noble is well positioned with near- and long-term availability including the semis Jim Day in the Gulf of Mexico, which is expected to be available in late January 2012, and the Clyde Boudreaux with an expected availability date in April of 2012. Our 3 un-contracted drillships under construction in the Hyundai yard have delivery dates in 2013 and 2014, and we’ve began a dialog with customers regarding some of these units.
Before I close this morning I’d like to quickly cover some of our regional markets and how we see those regions developing. In Mexico we achieved 85% utilization for the third quarter versus 65% for the previous quarter. As of today we have 11 of 12 jack-ups in the region under contract. Half of our fleet is contracted through 2012 with 2 rigs booked into Q3 2014 while the other half will come off contract at the end of this year. This tends to suggest a dilemma, i.e. is the glass half full or half empty? However, considering Pemex’s urgent need for additional rig capacity and their current tendering activity combined with our solid reputation in the region, we believe we are positioned for upside, i.e. we do see the glass as half full. Regarding the semi Max Smith, we believe Pemex has a significant program to support a floater for several more years. Expect the tender to be processed by the end of December; however we’re also monitoring prospects for this rig in other regions.
We are pleased to report that we continue to receive considerable support from our customer base in the North Sea. Since announcing extensions 2 weeks ago on the Lynda Bossler for 6 months at $125,000, and on the George Sauvageau for 12 months at $115,000, we have been awarded an additional 4 months on the Lynda Bossler at $115,000, 12 months on the Ronald Hoope at $113,000, and 10 months on the Piet van Ede at $113,000 per day. We believe this speaks well on 2 key demand drivers: our customers place high value on the reliability of Noble’s service in the North Sea, and they are optimistic about their longer-term programs. On the floater side we can report on a 5 month extension to the Ton van Langeveld from mid-2012 at a rate of $247,500.
With the reactivation of the Dick Favor all 14 of Noble’s jack-ups in the Middle East are under contract, with 6 units contracted into 2014. We made a decision in 2010 to place some jack-ups in the region into accommodation mode to avoid stacking during the weak market conditions. We have seen 2 of these units, the Gene House and the Joe Beall move back into drilling mode under long-term contracts with Aramco. We may see similar opportunities on the remaining three units during 2012. Additional tenders are expected from Aramco in the near term for a variety of drilling needs. As for our 6 JU3000N high spec jack-ups under construction, we continue to identify and pursue prospects in the UK and Danish sectors of the North Sea as well as key locations in the Middle East, Asia and Australia, and West Africa.  
Lastly, some news on Alaska. While Alaska may not represent a major revenue source for Noble at this time, we are excited about our potential commencement of drilling operations in the Beaufort and the Chukchi Seas. We are working closely with Shell to prepare the drillship Discoverer for Arctic operations and to upgrade the Shell-owned semi Colluck [ph] in Seattle for next year’s summer drilling season. We can also report that we’ve reached agreement with Shell to extend the current contract from December 2011 for a term of 2 years at a base rate of $240,000 per day. It is widely reported that Shell has invested heavily in preparing to drill in Alaska and we are honored at the prospect of playing an important role in their exploration campaign.  
In summary, utilization and day rates are improving across the mobile offshore drilling fleet. Ultra deepwater has once again crossed the $500,000 per day threshold and could move higher in 2012. Tightness in the ultra deepwater segment is leading to opportunities for deepwater rigs such as our Paul Romano, Amos Runner and Max Smith.  More standard jack-ups are going back to work around the world and Noble is well positioned to benefit from further rate increases. With that I’ll pass the call back to David."

As I noted earlier we are making tremendous progress toward the transformation of the Noble fleet. Our 14 shipyard projects consisting of 8 dynamically positioned drillships and 6 high specification jack-ups have begun to exit the yards. Very soon we will be down to 5 drillships and 6 jack-ups projects in progress with all but 1 of these projects consolidated into 1 of 2 top-tier shipyards with excellent histories of project execution, and by the end of 2014 we’re projected to have 16 dynamically positioned semisubmersible drillships in the fleet, up from just 4 five years ago.
3 of our 8 drillships under construction and all 6 of our jack-ups new builds are all currently without contracts. We view this capacity as a huge positive. As Roger indicated, client demand for the timely availability of high specification units is building as evidenced by the high number of contract awards for the ultra deepwater units since the end of the second quarter 2011, and the rapidly depleting ultra deepwater capacity available for 2012. I believe Noble is in a great position with the opportunity to offer these new high specification jack-ups and drillships as well as certain existing rigs such as Roger mentioned on the Jim Day and the Clyde Boudreaux, at a time when availability of the industry’s current and future high specification units is increasingly secured by contracts.  
The combination of these factors should provide Noble with an earnings and cash flow growth profile over the next 3 to 4 years that is among the industry’s best. And with that I’ll turn it back to Jeff."

I mean did you see demand above and beyond what Shell could possibly require and kind of almost using their demand as a safety net? I hate to characterize it like that but was it, or were the construction costs just too good to pass up? I guess what I’m trying to get at here is how critical this relationship has been and will be going forward."

We are a huge part of their not only deepwater capability but global drilling capability.

We have no intention of being an extension of Shell or being a one-trick pony. We’ve got other opportunities out there. Clearly Shell is a big piece of our business and with our acquisition of Frontier last year and the contracting of the 2 Globetrotter rigs and then later the HHI ship, that backlog is 1 of the things that’s providing the fuel for us to be able to drive this transformation. But while they’re interrelated they’re not interdependent. We certainly appreciate Shell. We’ve got a great relationship with them. We have a very frank and open dialog with those guys which I think both sides appreciate but we’re not building a fleet for Shell. We’re building a fleet for Noble shareholders and our relationship with Shell is important but they’re not dependent on one another."

I wanted to circle back on some of the deepwater commentary and what seems like an acceleration in the market. 1 thing that seems a bit striking is we’ve seen higher rates but it also seems like operators have gone from a situation where they could contract a rig 1 or 2 months in advance and now it’s more like they’re contracting rigs in some cases 8, 9 months in advance, and it seems like the availability is really tightening for 2012.

So I think there’s quite a bit of discipline on the supply side.

Frontier was kind of a unique opportunity specifically because of their primary sponsorship with Shell and Shell’s desire to do a major long-term alliance with us. But when we look at $85 oil, which is what the average price is right now, even in this global economic bust that we’ve got going on right now the oil is high enough to support basically any kind of offshore drilling activity anywhere in the world, so that gives everybody hope. What drove us to the shipyard was the value in the yards versus the value in the market that we could put those kinds of assets in the fleet for, and I think that’s probably still the case even though the shipyard prices are starting to come up. I think you’ll see shipyard prices and equipment prices continue to move up but we’ve seen no slack in the ask of existing assets -- assets that we might want to put in the fleet.

In the deepwater Gulf, 1 of the changes that we’ll see if we’re not seeing it happen already is increased downtime due to regulatory inspections and just a generally slower drilling environment. Can you provide some color on your ability to cover some of the lost rig time with a standby rate? Are customers willing to accept a standby rate for regulatory inspections in particular? And if so, what level of rate do you think is achievable?"

So that is going to be a recurring issue going forward and we’ll try to take that offline. The regulatory issues right now that are slowing down drilling operations really go to operators’ processes and we’re effectively on full rate there.  So I don’t know that it’s really regulatory issues that’s slowing us down. It’s just equipment repair periods.
We have downtime provisions in our contracts. In some cases they’re better than others and in some cases we build up a bank, but the fact is if you’re working in 10,000 feet of water it takes you a long enough time to trick the stack up and get it where you can work on it that effectively you’re going to outrun your downtime bank. So the right answer is do what we’re doing and try to build up to prevent the downtime and not deal with it after the fact. So I would expect that over time our revenue performance is going to improve in this respect just from those efforts."

Every well in the Gulf of Mexico’s different so it’s kind of hard to be able to kind of quantify exactly what that means but most of the estimates I’ve seen are if you drill in the same well today that you were drilling 2 years ago, you’re arguably 15% to 20% longer just in time, and that cost really at this point accrues to the operator, not the contractor."

There’s a lot of optimism on behalf of the customer. It’s not so much a question of “Is there a resource?” It’s accessing it. And if and when they do that it really is going to be a question of what is the appropriate asset to develop to drill up and develop these prospects, and it’s likely to look very different to what we’re using today. So given our position we think we’re going to have an interesting opportunity to participate in that whole technology evolution for drilling in that section of the Arctic, so we like that position."
