Joining me on the call are Brian Roberts, Michael Angelakis, Steve Burke and Neil Smit.
As we did in the third quarter call, Brian and Michael will make formal remarks, and Steve and Neil will also be available for Q&A. As you know, we closed the NBC Universal transaction on January 28. And as a result, today's call will only cover Comcast results for the fourth quarter and full year 2010. Beginning in the first quarter, NBC Universal's results will be consolidated in Comcast financial statements. So we are not providing 2010 pro forma results today. We plan to provide quarterly and full year 2010 pro forma results on both a consolidated basis and by segment when we announce first quarter results on May 4. We hope that level of detail will provide a good basis for comparison as we begin to report 2011 results on a consolidated basis.
So to begin, let me, as always, refer you to Slide #2, which contains our Safe Harbor disclaimer and remind you that this conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties.
In addition, in this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our 8-K for the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP.

I'm delighted to begin this first call of the year with really only positive news. Today, we're reporting strong results for 2010. We have successfully completed the NBC Universal transaction and really everyth",1006,"Thanks, Marlene, and good morning, everyone. I'm delighted to begin this first call of the year with really only positive news. Today, we're reporting strong results for 2010. We have successfully completed the NBC Universal transaction and really everything you will hear on this call points to an exciting new beginning for our company.
Our financial and operating performance accelerated throughout 2010, and we finished the year with real strength in financial and customer results in the fourth quarter. Our Cable and Programming teams achieved these results as they worked through a year-long regulatory approval process for NBC Universal, which is now complete with conditions that we believe will allow us to effectively execute on our plans for growth and innovation. Therefore, we're beginning 2011 in a wonderful position. We have strong financial and operating momentum. We're starting to execute on the many unique opportunities that are available to Comcast now that NBC Universal is part of our company. 
So let me briefly review the results. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenues increased 7% and operating cash flow increased 9%. We generated free cash flow of $1.1 billion for the quarter, up 46% and $5.4 billion for the year, an increase of 22%. This was the third consecutive year with growth in free cash flow above 20%, showing our real and consistent focus on free cash flow generation and an effective and disciplined approach to expense and capital management.
Combined with these solid financial results, we also saw real strength in customer metrics. In the fourth quarter, we had fewer video losses than in the third quarter and in last year's fourth quarter despite having a larger competitive footprint than a year ago. We also had strong growth in Voice and High-Speed Internet net additions. In fact, 2010 marks the fifth year in a row where we added more than 1 million High-Speed Internet customers. this strong momentum in Cable also demonstrates that the investments we have been making in technology for our XFINITY products combined with our focus on enhancing the customer experience are paying off. 
Our key technical initiatives, All-Digital and DOCSIS 3.0, are nearing completion, with All-Digital in 75% of our markets and DOCSIS 3.0 deployed in more than 85% of our footprint. We've also put in place a library server infrastructure, which we call our Content Delivery Network for OnDemand in the majority of our markets. All of this means we're delivering better products to our customers where high-def and foreign-language programming up to 25,000 OnDemand choices, better guides, improved DVR functionality, more interactivity, as well as higher speeds for our High-Speed Internet customers.
We're also quickly leveraging these investments and taking advantage of technology advances in IP technology and new devices to continue to enhance the experience that provides our customers more choices and more ways to enjoy our services. Online, with XFINITY TV.com, which gives you access to 150,000 entertainment choices at home or on the go with tablets and mobile devices with our XFINITY TV app, which just for the iPad alone had been downloaded more than 1 million times since we launched it in mid-November. The app now combines the functionality of a remote, a TV guide and a mobile video player with Play Now, a streaming feature that initially gives customers access to 3,000 hours of movies and TV content. And later this year, we plan to expand to include live programming.
Our XFINITY platform gives us the capability to build new products and features and to deliver more innovation to our customers. It also positions us to innovate faster than ever before and enables us to have new growth opportunities like Business Services and in advertising and in content. 
Now that we have completed the NBC Universal transaction, we are in a special position with a strategic mix of assets and a unique opportunity to build value for our shareholders, both near term with assets like the Cable networks and longer term, with Universal Films and NBC broadcast network. Our investments in NBC Universal is structured to provide solid returns. The financing was completed on terms that are better than we originally anticipated, and NBC Universal has good momentum going into 2011.
With scale in both distribution and content, we believe we can drive product leadership and innovation even faster. Reflecting all of this confidence and optimism in the future of our businesses, today we are pleased to announce 19% increase in our planned annual dividend to $0.45 per share, and we're accelerating our share repurchases in 2011 by 75% to $2.1 billion.
So we really do start 2011 on a positive note. We have a strong foundation with increasingly diverse revenue streams, strong subscription businesses and opportunities to build new businesses. And our competitive position has never been better. Now it's really all about execution in order to maintain our financial and operating momentum and to drive profitable and sustainable growth. 
Under Neil Smit's leadership for over a year now, we are speeding up innovation and really moving forward with the customer experience. We have reinforced our focus on first call resolution for our customers and online self-service. And as a result, repeat service calls are down by 15%, and online transactions have increased by 20%. At the same time, customer awareness of our customer guarantee increased by 10 points last year. When taken together, these steps are driving higher customer satisfaction, as well as increased efficiencies in our Cable businesses.
At NBC Universal, Steve Burke is focused first on maintaining the strong performance and momentum of the Cable channels, which drive most of the profitability of NBC Universal. We're also integrating the Comcast networks into NBC Universal's wonderful group of cable properties. And beginning to execute on the many new opportunities to come out of this combination. Across the board, we are focused on execution and on building value at each and every one of our businesses. 
Let me now pass to Michael to cover the fourth quarter and 2010 results in more detail."

Let me begin by briefly reviewing our consolidated results starting on Slide 5. We are pleased to report solid full year 2010 and fourth quarter results, which reflect a consistent focus on profitable growth and underscores the effective execution in our Residential, Commercial, Programming and Advertising businesses. We are particularly pleased with our fourth quarter results, which showed real momentum and a balanced approach to financial and customer metrics in our Cable Operations. 
For the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue increased 7.2% to $9.7 billion, and operating cash flow grew 9% to $3.7 billion, resulting in consolidated operating cash flow margin of 38.2% versus 37.6% in 2009. When adjusted for NBC transaction costs, the operating cash flow growth was 9.1%, and our margin was 38.5%.
For the full year, consolidated revenue increased 6.1% to $37.9 billion, and operating cash flow grew 6.4% to $14.6 billion, resulting in a consolidated operating cash flow margin of 38.5%. Again, when adjusted for NBC U transaction costs, 2010 operating cash flow growth was 6.9%, and our margin was 38.7%. Given the economic and competitive environment we're facing, we are pleased with these financial results. 
Cable Advertising recovered this past year, and the business benefited from the 25.9% increase in revenues to $1.8 billion. This improvement was led by renewed strength in automotive and also political revenue, which added over $180 million to 2010's results. 
Shifting to our Programming segment, this business also benefited from a healthy advertising market with revenue growth of 11.8% and operating cash flow growth of 20.6%. 
Please refer to Slide 6. We also remain very focused on free cash flow, free cash flow per share and earnings per share as important metrics in evaluating the strength of the company. In each of these key metrics, our performance in the fourth quarter and during 2010 was very strong and reflects solid progress related to our continued focus on return on invested capital and on execution.
During the fourth quarter, we generated consolidated free cash flow of $1.1 billion, an increase of 46% compared to last year, primarily the result of higher consolidated operating cash flow, lower capital expenditures and changes in operating assets and liabilities. For the fourth quarter, free cash flow per share increased 48% to $0.40 per share. For the full year of 2010, our free cash flow increased 22% to $5.4 billion, and free cash flow per share increased 25% to $1.91 per share. Excluding total NBC Universal-related costs and other non-recurring items, EPS for the fourth quarter grew 20.7% to $0.35 per share. For the full year again, excluding total NBC Universal costs and other non-recurring items, earnings per share grew 18% to $1.31 per share. Please refer to Table 4 in the press release for more details on these items.
Let's turn to Slide 7 to review the Cable division's results. For the fourth quarter, Cable revenue increased 6.9% to $9.2 billion, reflecting growth in our Residential business and continued strength in Business Services and Cable Advertising. As Brian previously mentioned, we experienced real strength in our customer metrics in the fourth quarter when compared to 2009 and in prior quarters. We added 414,000 total Video, High-Speed Internet and Voice customers during the fourth quarter, and we had fewer Video losses than in the prior quarter as well as compared to last year, signaling that the impact of the digital transition is now behind us.
In addition, we saw strong growth in our High-Speed Internet additions as we continue to take share with product superiority, and we added healthy levels of Voice customers as we Voice editions with our Triple Play offers. We continue to manage the business for profitable growth, and we've been effective during 2010 in driving recurring revenue. Total revenue per Video customer increased 11% to over $133 per month in the fourth quarter, reflecting strong ARPU management, the higher contribution from Comcast Business Services and an increasing number of customers taking multiple products. At the end of the fourth quarter, 33% of our Video customers took all three services compared to 28% at the end of 2009.
For the fourth quarter, total Video revenue increased 2.1%. Video revenue continues to strengthen, reflecting rate adjustments and increasing number of our customers taking higher levels of digital and Advanced Services and an increase in pay revenue. This quarter, we added 228,000 advanced service customers who subscribe to high-def and/or DVR services. We now have 10.1 million advanced service customers equal to 51% of our digital customer base and 44% of all Video customers. 
High-Speed Internet revenue increased a healthy 10.7% during the quarter, reflecting rate adjustments, continued growth in our customer base and an increasing number of customers taking higher-speed services. Today, 23% of our residential High-Speed Internet customers take the higher speed tier above our flagship service. We added 292,000 High-Speed Internet customers in the fourth quarter and 1.1 million in 2010. This compares to 247,000 for the fourth quarter of 2009 and 1 million for all of 2009. Our penetration continues to trend upward and is now at 33%.
Voice revenue also posted strong growth, increasing 11.8% for the quarter, reflecting continued growth in our residential customer base as we successfully bundle with the Triple Play and benefit from a growing contribution from Business Services. We added 257,000 total Voice customers in the fourth quarter and added 988,000 Voice customers during 2010 compared to 1.1 million last year. Over the last 12 months, our penetration has increased 160 basis points and is now at 17.3%.
We also had another strong performance in Business Services, with revenue increasing 53.5% to $365 million in the quarter to 53.1% to $1.3 billion for 2010. This business' margins are improving and we expect the momentum in the small end of the business market continue. As I have mentioned previously, we are in the early stages of targeting medium-sized businesses and have invested in this effort during 2010. We remain very enthusiastic about the growth opportunities to serve midsized businesses and to also expand our cell backhaul efforts. 
As I mentioned, Cable Advertising performed well as fourth quarter revenue increased to 29.3%. This improvement was, again, led by strength in automotive, as well as higher political revenue. Excluding the impact of political, core Cable Advertising revenue increased 10.2% this quarter to 16.4% for the full year.
Please refer to Slide 8, and let's review our Cable division's operating cash flow results. Fourth quarter Cable operating cash flow increased 8.7% to $3.8 billion. Our Cable operating cash flow margin increased to 41.2%, a 70 basis point improvement compared to last year's fourth quarter. For 2010, Cable operating cash flow increased 6.4% to $14.6 billion, and our Cable operating cash flow margin increased to 40.7% from 40.4%. Total expenses in our Cable segment increased 5.6%, reflecting higher video Programming and marketing expenses, as well as continued investment to expand our capabilities in Business Services. 
Programming expenses increased 5.9% this quarter and 5.6% for all of 2010, reflecting an increasing number of our customers taking higher levels of our digital services, the addition of new Programming and contract resets. As we enter new contracts, we are also receiving more value in our Programming contracts, particularly with more OnDemand Programming and increasing availability of content across multiple platforms. As we look to 2011, we expect Programming expenses to grow at a slightly higher rate than in 2010 due in part to higher sports-related costs.
Marketing expenses increased 24.2% this quarter and 17.4% for the year as a result of continued investment in direct sales in our retail channels and in higher overall advertising and media spend, including our XFINITY branding. Our XFINITY brand is now launched in 84% of our footprint, and awareness of XFINITY now exceeds 90%. Among non-customers, we have seen consideration levels that is potential customers willing to evaluate and consider our brand for purchase grow by over 36% since the launch of XFINITY one year ago. In addition, among our current customers, we have seen our ratings were being technologically advanced grow by more than 40%, and our scores for having good value for money increased by 30%. Our marketing investment is yielding positive results, driving connect activity improving our competitive positioning in the market.
We also remain very focused on expense management throughout the entire enterprise. We are constantly evaluating our cost structure to gain efficiencies. In the fourth quarter, we realized improvements in network costs and reduced our direct costs for High-Speed Internet and Voice businesses. In addition, customer service and technical expenses were relatively flat for the year as we benefited from a number of efficiency initiatives, which resulted in lower activity levels and increasing call automation and customer self service. 
Please refer to Slide 9 to review our capital expenditures. In the fourth quarter, capital expenditures decreased $77 million to $1.5 billion, representing 15.8% of total revenue, continuing our trend of decreasing capital intensity, lower equipment pricing and strong return on invested capital. Fourth quarter CapEx reflects meaningful investments to support growth in Business Services and to expand our efforts in midsized businesses such as Metro-E and cell backhaul. We have now deployed almost 17 million Digital Adapters since the inception of the All-Digital project, including 1.9 million during the fourth quarter and 10.7 million during 2010. Our All-Digital project has freed up bandwidth for DOCSIS 3.0, as well as enabled our new Content Delivery Network for OnDemand. And as Brian mentioned, All-Digital is providing significant product enhancements for our customers.
We're generating incremental revenue from a reduction in best of service and higher take rates for Advanced Services and pay-per-view. All-Digital is also helping to drive operating efficiencies, which reduced truck rolls and higher utilization of self installations. As a result, the All-Digital project is providing double-digit returns, while generating significant strategic and operating benefits for the company. 
Another high-return capital investment area is our deployment for advanced digital boxes. We have articulated the investment returns for this area before. In the fourth quarter, we deployed 781,000 advanced high-def and/or DVR set tops. For the full year of 2010, capital expenditures decreased 3% to $5 billion, equal to 13.1% of revenue and again, reflects decreased capital intensity. In addition, consistent with prior years, our growth-oriented CapEx represents approximately 71% of total Cable  capital expenditures.
With regard to 2011, we anticipate our capital intensity to moderate further as Cable capital expenditures are expected to be lower as a percentage of Cable revenue when compared to 2010. This further reduction in CapEx should occur even as we aggressively invest internally in strategic opportunities, which we believe have attractive risk adjusted returns and represent future organic growth. 
Please refer to Slide 10. Now let me provide an update on the NBC Universal transaction, which we view as strategically and financially attractive and consistent with our capital allocation strategy. The transaction is transformative to our content assets as we now have scale in both content and distribution. The transaction has been structured to yield strong double-digit returns, maintain Comcast's conservative balance sheet and strong investment grade ratings and allow us to accelerate our return of capital to shareholders. 
As you know, we closed the transaction on January 28. At closing, we funded $6.2 billion in cash and also contributed our national Programming networks, regional sports and news networks and several digital assets. The structure produces significant tax benefits associated with tax depreciation and amortization deductions that afford Comcast tax benefits similar to an asset purchase. The resulting tax benefits may exceed our previous estimate of $1.5 billion on a net present value basis. 
In the last year, we raised $13.1 billion of new attractively priced debt to fund this transaction, including $9.1 billion at NBC U and $4 billion at Comcast Corporation. At closing, our consolidated leverage is approximately 2.4x. And as we have said in the past, we remain comfortable with our debt to operating cash flow leverage target between 2.0x to 2.5x. 
We will consolidate NBC Universal, but we'll manage Comcast Cable and NBC Universal as two separate balance sheets and two separate pools of cash flow generation and funding capacity. Comcast Cable, which includes the Cable business and our corporate operations will continue to allocate its free cash flow generation to reinvestment in its businesses and to return capital to shareholders. NBC Universal will retain its free cash flow and debt capacity for reinvestment in its businesses and to fund future redemptions by GE. 
While day one integration went smoothly and we are just beginning to operate these businesses, NBC Universal starts 2011 with good momentum. We are very excited about the opportunities. And as Marlene mentioned, we'll provide more details in transparency for NBC Universal in its operating segments with the first quarter results on May 4. 
Please refer to Slide 11. As we review 2010 and begin 2011, we have a consistent financial strategy that is balanced and discipline. Our first priority remains to profitably invest in the operating and strategic needs of our businesses. And we will continue to deploy capital when it provides attractive risk-adjusted returns, enhances our competitive position and delivers sustainable organic growth. In terms of external investments, we expect our focus to be on execution and on the integration of NBC Universal. We remain extremely disciplined focusing on opportunities that extend our services and add features that allow us to build new complementary and profitable revenue streams.
In 2010, we returned approximately 42% of our consolidated free cash flow to shareholders or $2.3 billion, including dividend payments totaling $1.1 billion and share repurchases totaling $1.2 billion. With today's announcement, our return of capital is increasing 45% to $3.3 billion during 2011, representing approximately 60% of our last 12 months' free cash flow and approximately 90% of our last 12 months' net income. That incorporates the 19% increase in our planned annual dividend to $0.45 per share and acceleration by 75% in our share repurchases to $2.1 billion for this year. When you combine all these elements together, we feel very good about our financial strength, our current operating momentum and opportunities in 2011. We have a terrific mix of assets, and we're looking forward to executing on the opportunities to build value for our shareholders. 
Now let me turn it over to Marlene for Q&A."

The Cable channels are in fantastic shape, have been growing double digits. There you just want to make sure we continue to make the right investments and continue the growth. The biggest opportunity I think over the next few years, and we certainly don't expect to see anything in the next year but if you go out three, four, five years at the NBC network where we have some real strength in NBC news and some real weakness with prime time, and we think we can make progress and we're doing a variety of things, putting a variety of things in place to get that progress. But I don't think we're going to see anything for a while. And then very excited about opportunities like Telemundo. You mentioned international.

I'm delighted to begin this first call of the year with really only positive news. Today, we're reporting strong results for 2010. We have successfully completed the NBC Universal transaction and really everyth",1008,"Thanks, Marlene, and good morning, everyone. I'm delighted to begin this first call of the year with really only positive news. Today, we're reporting strong results for 2010. We have successfully completed the NBC Universal transaction and really everything you will hear on this call points to an exciting new beginning for our company.
Our financial and operating performance accelerated throughout 2010, and we finished the year with real strength in financial and customer results in the fourth quarter. Our Cable and Programming teams achieved these results as they worked through a year-long regulatory approval process for NBC Universal, which is now complete with conditions that we believe will allow us to effectively execute on our plans for growth and innovation. Therefore, we're beginning 2011 in a wonderful position. We have strong financial and operating momentum. We're starting to execute on the many unique opportunities that are available to Comcast now that NBC Universal is part of our company. 
So let me briefly review the results. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenues increased 7% and operating cash flow increased 9%. We generated free cash flow of $1.1 billion for the quarter, up 46% and $5.4 billion for the year, an increase of 22%. This was the third consecutive year with growth in free cash flow above 20%, showing our real and consistent focus on free cash flow generation and an effective and disciplined approach to expense and capital management.
Combined with these solid financial results, we also saw real strength in customer metrics. In the fourth quarter, we had fewer video losses than in the third quarter and in last year's fourth quarter despite having a larger competitive footprint than a year ago. We also had strong growth in Voice and High-Speed Internet net additions. In fact, 2010 marks the fifth year in a row where we added more than 1 million High-Speed Internet customers. This strong momentum in Cable also demonstrates that the investments we have been making in technology for our XFINITY products combined with our focus on enhancing the customer experience are paying off. 
Our key technical initiatives, All-Digital and DOCSIS 3.0, are nearing completion, with All-Digital in 75% of our markets and DOCSIS 3.0 deployed in more than 85% of our footprint. We've also put in place a library server infrastructure, which we call our content delivery network for On Demand in the majority of our markets. All of this means we're delivering better products to our customers where high-def and foreign-language programming up to 25,000 On Demand choices, better guides, improved DVR functionality, more interactivity, as well as higher speeds for our High-Speed Internet customers.
We're also quickly leveraging these investments and taking advantage of technology advances in IP technology and new devices to continue to enhance the experience that provides our customers more choices and more ways to enjoy our services, online with xfinityTV.com, which gives you access to 150,000 entertainment choices, at home or on the go with tablets and mobile devices with our Xfinity TV app, which just for the iPad alone has been downloaded more than 1 million times since we'd launched it in mid-November. The app now combines the functionality of a remote, a TV guide and a mobile video player with play now, a streaming feature that initially gives customers access to 3,000 hours of movies and TV content. And later this year, we do plan to expand to include live programming.
Our XFINITY platform gives us the capability to build new products and features and to deliver more innovation to our customers. It also positions us to innovate faster than ever before and enables us to have new growth opportunities like Business Services and in advertising and in content. 
Now that we have completed the NBC Universal transaction, we are in a special position with a strategic mix of assets and a unique opportunity to build value for our shareholders, both near term with assets like the Cable networks, and longer term with Universal Films and NBC broadcast network. Our investment in NBC Universal is structured to provide solid returns. The financing was completed on terms that are better than we originally anticipated, and NBC Universal has good momentum going into 2011.
With scale in both distribution and content, we believe we can drive product leadership and innovation even faster. Reflecting all of this confidence and optimism in the future of our businesses, today we are pleased to announce 19% increase in our planned annual dividend to $0.45 per share. And we're accelerating our share repurchases in 2011 by 75% to $2.1 billion.
So we really do start 2011 on a positive note. We have a strong foundation with increasingly diverse revenue streams, strong subscription businesses and opportunities to build new businesses. And our competitive position has never been better. Now it's really all about execution in order to maintain our financial and operating momentum and to drive profitable and sustainable growth. 
Under Neil Smit's leadership for over a year now, we are speeding up innovation and really moving forward with the customer experience. We have reinforced our focus on first call resolution for our customers and online self-service. And as a result, repeat service calls are down by 15%, and online transactions have increased by 20%. At the same time, customer awareness of our customer guarantee increased by 10 points last year. When taken together, these steps are driving higher customer satisfaction, as well as increased efficiencies in our Cable businesses.
At NBC Universal, Steve Burke is focused first on maintaining the strong performance and momentum of the Cable channels, which drive most of the profitability of NBC Universal. We're also integrating the Comcast networks into NBC Universal's wonderful group of cable properties and beginning to execute on the many new opportunities to come out of this combination. Across the board, we are focused on execution and on building value in each and every one of our businesses. 
Let me now pass to Michael to cover the fourth quarter and 2010 results in more detail."

Let me begin by briefly reviewing our consolidated results starting on Slide 5. We are pleased to report solid full year 2010 and fourth quarter results, which reflect a consistent focus on profitable growth and underscores the effective execution in our Residential, Commercial, Programming and Advertising businesses. We are particularly pleased with our fourth quarter results, which showed real momentum and a balanced approach to financial and customer metrics in our Cable Operations. 
For the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue increased 7.2% to $9.7 billion, and operating cash flow grew 9% to $3.7 billion, resulting in consolidated operating cash flow margin of 38.2% versus 37.6% in 2009. When adjusted for NBC U transaction costs, the operating cash flow growth was 9.1%, and our margin was 38.5%.
For the full year, consolidated revenue increased 6.1% to $37.9 billion, and operating cash flow grew 6.4% to $14.6 billion, resulting in a consolidated operating cash flow margin of 38.5%. Again, when adjusted for NBC U transaction costs, 2010 operating cash flow growth was 6.9%, and our margin was 38.7%. Given the economic and competitive environment we're facing, we are pleased with these financial results. 
Cable Advertising recovered this past year, and the business benefited from the 25.9% increase in revenues to $1.8 billion. This improvement was led by renewed strength in automotive and also political revenue, which added over $180 million to 2010's results. 
Shifting to our Programming segment, this business also benefited from a healthy advertising market with revenue growth of 11.8% and operating cash flow growth of 20.6%. 
Please refer to Slide 6. We also remain very focused on free cash flow, free cash flow per share and earnings per share as important metrics in evaluating the strength of the company. In each of these key metrics, our performance in the fourth quarter and during 2010 was very strong and reflects solid progress related to our continued focus on return on invested capital and on execution.
During the fourth quarter, we generated consolidated free cash flow of $1.1 billion, an increase of 46% compared to last year, primarily the result of higher consolidated operating cash flow, lower capital expenditures and changes in operating assets and liabilities. For the fourth quarter, free cash flow per share increased 48% to $0.40 per share. For the full year of 2010, our free cash flow increased 22% to $5.4 billion, and free cash flow per share increased 25% to $1.91 per share. Excluding total NBC Universal-related costs and other non-recurring items, EPS for the fourth quarter grew 20.7% to $0.35 per share. For the full year, again, excluding total NBC Universal costs and other non-recurring items, earnings per share grew 18% to $1.31 per share. Please refer to Table 4 in the press release for more details on these items.
Let's turn to Slide 7 to review the Cable division's results. For the fourth quarter, Cable revenue increased 6.9% to $9.2 billion, reflecting growth in our Residential business and continued strength in Business Services and Cable Advertising. As Brian previously mentioned, we experienced real strength in our customer metrics in the fourth quarter when compared to 2009 and in prior quarters. We added 414,000 total Video, High-Speed Internet and Voice customers during the fourth quarter. And we had fewer Video losses than in the prior quarter as well as compared to last year, signaling that the impact of the digital transition is now behind us.
In addition, we saw a strong growth in our High-Speed Internet additions as we continue to take share with product superiority, and we added healthy levels of Voice customers as we drove Voice additions with our Triple Play offers. We continue to manage the business for profitable growth, and we've been effective during 2010 in driving recurring revenue. Total revenue per Video customer increased 11% to over $133 per month in the fourth quarter, reflecting strong ARPU management, the higher contribution from Comcast Business Services and an increasing number of customers taking multiple products. At the end of the fourth quarter, 33% of our Video customers took all three services compared to 28% at the end of 2009.
For the fourth quarter, total Video revenue increased 2.1%. Video revenue continues to strengthen, reflecting rate adjustments and increasing number of our customers taking higher levels of digital and advanced services and increase in pay revenue. This quarter, we added 228,000 Advanced Service customers who subscribe to high-def and/or DVR services. We now have 10.1 million Advanced Service customers equal to 51% of our digital customer base and 44% of all Video customers. 
High-Speed Internet revenue increased a healthy 10.7% during the quarter, reflecting rate adjustments, continued growth in our customer base and an increasing number of customers taking higher-speed services. Today, 23% of our residential High-Speed Internet customers take the higher speed tier above our flagship service. We added 292,000 High-Speed Internet customers in the fourth quarter and 1.1 million in 2010. This compares to 247,000 for the fourth quarter of 2009 and 1 million for all of 2009. Our penetration continues to trend upward and is now at 33%.
Voice revenue also posted strong growth, increasing 11.8% for the quarter, reflecting continued growth in our residential customer base as we successfully bundle with the Triple Play and benefit from a growing contribution from Business Services. We added 257,000 total Voice customers in the fourth quarter and added 988,000 Voice customers during 2010 compared to 1.1 million last year. Over the last 12 months, our penetration has increased 160 basis points and is now at 17.3%.
We also had another strong performance in Business Services, with revenue increasing 53.5% to $365 million in the quarter and 53.1% to $1.3 billion for 2010. This business' margins are improving, and we expect the momentum in the small end of business market continue. As I have mentioned previously, we are in the early stages of targeting medium-sized businesses and have invested in this effort during 2010. We remain very enthusiastic about the growth opportunities to serve midsized businesses and to also expand our cell backhaul efforts. 
As I mentioned, Cable Advertising performed well as fourth quarter revenue increased to 29.3%. This improvement was, again, led by strength in automotive, as well as higher political revenue. Excluding the impact of political, core Cable Advertising revenue increased 10.2% this quarter and 16.4% for the full year.
Please refer to Slide 8, and let's review our Cable division's operating cash flow results. Fourth quarter Cable operating cash flow increased 8.7% to $3.8 billion. Our Cable operating cash flow margin increased to 41.2%, a 70 basis point improvement compared to last year's fourth quarter. For 2010, Cable operating cash flow increased 6.4% to $14.6 billion, and our Cable operating cash flow margin increased to 40.7% from 40.4%. Total expenses in our Cable segment increased 5.6%, reflecting higher video programming and marketing expenses, as well as continued investment to expand our capabilities in Business Services. 
Programming expenses increased 5.9% this quarter and 5.6% for all of 2010, reflecting an increasing number of our customers taking higher levels of our digital services, the addition of new programming and contract resets. As we enter new contracts, we are also receiving more value in our programming contracts, particularly with more On Demand Programming and increasing availability of content across multiple platforms. As we look to 2011, we expect programming expenses to grow at a slightly higher rate than in 2010 due in part to higher sports-related costs.
Marketing expenses increased 24.2% this quarter and 17.4% for the year, as a result of continued investment in direct sales, in our retail channels and in higher overall advertising and media spend, including our XFINITY branding. Our XFINITY brand is now launched in 84% of our footprint, and awareness of XFINITY now exceeds 90%. Among non-customers, we have seen consideration levels, that is potential customers willing to evaluate and consider our brand for purchase, grow by over 36% since the launch of the XFINITY one year ago. In addition, among our current customers, we have seen our ratings for being technologically advanced grow by more than 40%, and our scores for having good value for money increased by 30%. Our marketing investment is yielding positive results, driving connect activity and improving our competitive positioning in the market.
We also remain very focused on expense management throughout the entire enterprise. We are constantly evaluating our cost structure to gain efficiencies. In the fourth quarter, we realized improvements in network costs and reduced our direct costs for High-Speed Internet and Voice businesses. In addition, customer service and technical expenses were relatively flat for the year as we benefited from a number of efficiency initiatives, which resulted in lower activity levels and increasing call automation and customer self service. 
Please refer to Slide 9 to review our capital expenditures. In the fourth quarter, capital expenditures decreased $77 million to $1.5 billion, representing 15.8% of total revenue, continuing our trend of decreasing capital intensity, lower equipment pricing and strong return on invested capital. Fourth quarter CapEx reflects meaningful investments to support growth in Business Services and to expand our efforts in midsized businesses such as Metro-E and cell backhaul. We have now deployed almost 17 million digital adapters since the inception of the All-Digital project, including 1.9 million during the fourth quarter and 10.7 million during 2010. Our All-Digital project has freed up bandwidth for DOCSIS 3.0, as well as enabled our new content delivery network for On Demand. And as Brian mentioned, All-Digital is providing significant product enhancements for our customers.
We're generating incremental revenue from a reduction in theft of service and higher take rates for advanced services and pay-per-view. All-Digital is also helping to drive operating efficiencies with reduced truck rolls and higher utilization of self installation. As a result, the All-Digital project is providing double-digit returns, while generating significant strategic and operating benefits for the company. 
Another high-return capital investment area is our deployment of advanced digital boxes. We have articulated the investment returns for this area before. In the fourth quarter, we deployed 781,000 advanced high-def and/or DVR set tops. For the full year of 2010, capital expenditures decreased 3% to $5 billion, equal to 13.1% of revenue and, again, reflects decreased capital intensity. In addition, consistent with prior years, our growth-oriented CapEx represents approximately 71% of total Cable  capital expenditures.
With regard to 2011, we anticipate our capital intensity to moderate further as Cable capital expenditures are expected to be lower as a percentage of Cable revenue when compared to 2010. This further reduction in CapEx should occur even as we aggressively invest internally in strategic opportunities, which we believe have attractive risk adjusted returns and represent future organic growth. 
Please refer to Slide 10. Now let me provide an update on the NBC Universal transaction, which we view as strategically and financially attractive and consistent with our capital allocation strategy. The transaction is transformative to our content assets as we now have scale in both content and distribution. The transaction has been structured to yield strong double-digit returns, maintain Comcast's conservative balance sheet and strong investment grade ratings and allow us to accelerate our return of capital to shareholders. 
As you know, we closed the transaction on January 28. At closing, we funded $6.2 billion in cash and also contributed our national Programming networks, regional sports and news networks and several digital assets. The structure produces significant tax benefits associated with tax depreciation and amortization deductions that afford Comcast tax benefits similar to an asset purchase. The resulting tax benefits may exceed our previous estimate of $1.5 billion on a net present value basis. 
In the last year, we raised $13.1 billion of new attractively priced debt to fund this transaction, including $9.1 billion at NBC U and $4 billion at Comcast Corporation. At closing, our consolidated leverage is approximately 2.4x. And as we have said in the past, we remain comfortable with our debt to operating cash flow leverage target between 2.0x to 2.5x. 
We will consolidate NBC Universal, but we'll manage Comcast Cable and NBC Universal as two separate balance sheets and two separate pools of cash flow generation and funding capacity. Comcast Cable, which includes the Cable business and our corporate operations will continue to allocate its free cash flow generation to reinvestment in its businesses and to return capital to shareholders. NBC Universal will retain its free cash flow and debt capacity for reinvestment in its businesses and to fund future redemptions by GE. 
While day one integration went smoothly, and we are just beginning to operate these businesses, NBC Universal starts 2011 with good momentum. We are very excited about the opportunities. And as Marlene mentioned, we'll provide more details and transparency for NBC Universal and its operating segments with the first quarter results on May 4. 
Please refer to Slide 11. As we review 2010 and begin 2011, we have a consistent financial strategy that is balanced and disciplined. Our first priority remains to profitably invest in the operating and strategic needs of our businesses. And we will continue to deploy capital when it provides attractive risk-adjusted returns, enhances our competitive position and delivers sustainable organic growth. In terms of external investment, we expect our focus to be on execution and on the integration of NBC Universal. We remain extremely disciplined focusing on opportunities that extend our services and add features that allow us to build new complementary and profitable revenue streams.
In 2010, we returned approximately 42% of our consolidated free cash flow to shareholders or $2.3 billion, including dividend payments totaling $1.1 billion and share repurchases totaling $1.2 billion. With today's announcement, our return of capital is increasing 45% to $3.3 billion during 2011, representing approximately 60% of our last 12 months' free cash flow and approximately 90% of our last 12 months' net income. That incorporates a 19% increase in our planned annual dividend to $0.45 per share and acceleration by 75% and our share repurchases to $2.1 billion for this year. When you combine all these elements together, we feel very good about our financial strength, our current operating momentum and opportunities in 2011. We have a terrific mix of assets, and we're looking forward to executing on the opportunities to build value for our shareholders. 
Now let me turn it over to Marlene for Q&A."

One of the advantages of waiting 13 or 14 months to get a deal closed due to regulatory approval is you get a chance to really get to know the assets, really get to know the people and get a chance to create a set of goals and plans and priorities for the future. We have a lot of big goals for NBC Universal. I would start with the fact that 80% of the EBITDA or 80% of the value are the Cable channels. The Cable channels are in fantastic shape, have been growing double digits. There you just want to make sure that we continue to make the right investments and continue the growth. The biggest opportunity I think over the next few years, and we certainly don't expect to see anything in the next year, but if you go out three, four, or five years, is the NBC network where we have some real strength in NBC News and some real weakness with primetime. And we think we can make progress, and we're doing a variety of things, putting a variety of things in place to get that progress. But I don't think we're going to see anything for a while. And then, I'm very excited about opportunities like Telemundo. You mentioned international. We think international is a real opportunity, so we think the assets are fantastic. And the real core of the assets, the cable channels, are in great shape. I want to continue to keep that going, but we're going to be opportunistic in terms of the places where we can invest and grow like international, like Telemundo, like the NBC network as well.

And for a long time, we were out there with On Demand, and people weren't sure that we were going to get the best content. And there were a number of critics saying well, it doesn't have this, it doesn't have that. And we just plowed the way at it year in and year out, and now we have 25,000 choices and more coming. And our technology gets cheaper and better every year, and all these digital devices allow you to access On Demand. And I think we're going to see the same thing occur over time. It's a focus, and our innovation machine that Neil is talking about is getting better, more reliable. And we had a very solid 2010, and we have a lot of excitement planned, and we've shown some of that for 2011. Mike?"

I think we have played a lot of offense with our investments. Although our capital intensity in terms of percentages, as well as dollars have come down, I really think we've been aggressive in terms of making pretty smart investments whether it's All-Digital, which we talked about, or DOCSIS 3.0 or VOD or XFINITY. And certainly, we're investing a lot in the small and medium-sized business with the medium being relatively new. And now we've got cell backhaul and Metro Ethernet, which Neil talked about. So I don't really see any large, large categories that we're not investing in. I think we're really got on ROI focused, and I think we're playing offense with our capital in trying to be as efficient as we can. So we're looking around the table. I don't think we're missing much."

We have $750 million due next month, and you look at those two particular payments combined with the increase in the dividend and the buy back, all that adds up to about 90% of our free cash flow. So we'll delever a little bit during 2011, not a whole heck of a lot. But we'll still be right in the middle of where our target is in terms of leverage. So again, I think we are trying to keep a very measured and balanced capital allocation strategy, and we're in this for the long term."

I'm delighted to begin this first call of the year with really only positive news. Today, we're reporting strong results for 2010.

I'm delighted to begin this first call of the year with really only positive news. Today, we're reporting strong results for 2010. We have successfully completed the NBC Universal transaction and really everything you will hear on this call points to an exciting new beginning for our company.
Our financial and operating performance accelerated throughout 2010, and we finished the year with real strength in financial and customer results in the fourth quarter. Our Cable and Programming teams achieved these results as they worked through a year-long regulatory approval process for NBC Universal, which is now complete with conditions that we believe will allow us to effectively execute on our plans for growth and innovation. Therefore, we're beginning 2011 in a wonderful position. We have strong financial and operating momentum. We're starting to execute on the many unique opportunities that are available to Comcast now that NBC Universal is part of our company. 
So let me briefly review the results. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenues increased 7% and operating cash flow increased 9%. We generated free cash flow of $1.1 billion for the quarter, up 46% and $5.4 billion for the year, an increase of 22%. This was the third consecutive year with growth in free cash flow above 20%, showing our real and consistent focus on free cash flow generation and an effective and disciplined approach to expense and capital management.
Combined with these solid financial results, we also saw real strength in customer metrics. In the fourth quarter, we had fewer video losses than in the third quarter and in last year's fourth quarter despite having a larger competitive footprint than a year ago. We also had strong growth in Voice and High-Speed Internet net additions. In fact, 2010 marks the fifth year in a row where we added more than 1 million High-Speed Internet customers. This strong momentum in Cable also demonstrates that the investments we have been making in technology for our XFINITY products combined with our focus on enhancing the customer experience are paying off. 
Our key technical initiatives, All-Digital and DOCSIS 3.0, are nearing completion, with All-Digital in 75% of our markets and DOCSIS 3.0 deployed in more than 85% of our footprint. We've also put in place a library server infrastructure, which we call our content delivery network for On Demand in the majority of our markets. All of this means we're delivering better products to our customers, we’re high-def and foreign-language programming, up to 25,000 On Demand choices, better guides, improved DVR functionality, more interactivity, as well as higher speeds for our High-Speed Internet customers.
We're also quickly leveraging these investments and taking advantage of technology advances in IP technology and new devices to continue to enhance the experience that provides our customers more choices and more ways to enjoy our services, online with xfinityTV.com, which gives you access to 150,000 entertainment choices, at home or on the go with tablets and mobile devices with our Xfinity TV app, which just for the iPad alone has been downloaded more than 1 million times since we'd launched it in mid-November. The app now combines the functionality of a remote, a TV guide and a mobile video player with play now, a streaming feature that initially gives customers access to 3,000 hours of movies and TV content. And later this year, we do plan to expand to include live programming.
Our XFINITY platform gives us the capability to build new products and features and to deliver more innovation to our customers. It also positions us to innovate faster than ever before and enables us to have new growth opportunities like Business Services and in advertising and in content. 
Now that we have completed the NBC Universal transaction, we are in a special position with a strategic mix of assets and a unique opportunity to build value for our shareholders, both near term with assets like the Cable networks, and longer term with Universal Films and NBC broadcast network. Our investment in NBC Universal is structured to provide solid returns. The financing was completed on terms that are better than we originally anticipated, and NBC Universal has good momentum going into 2011.
With scale in both distribution and content, we believe we can drive product leadership and innovation even faster. Reflecting all of this confidence and optimism in the future of our businesses, today we are pleased to announce a 19% increase in our planned annual dividend to $0.45 per share. And we're accelerating our share repurchases in 2011 by 75% to $2.1 billion.
So we really do start 2011 on a positive note. We have a strong foundation with increasingly diverse revenue streams, strong subscription businesses and opportunities to build new businesses. And our competitive position has never been better. Now it's really all about execution in order to maintain our financial and operating momentum and to drive profitable and sustainable growth. 
Under Neil Smit's leadership for over a year now, we are speeding up innovation and really moving forward with the customer experience. We have reinforced our focus on first call resolution for our customers and online self-service. And as a result, repeat service calls are down by 15%, and online transactions have increased by 20%. At the same time, customer awareness of our customer guarantee increased by 10 points last year. When taken together, these steps are driving higher customer satisfaction, as well as increased efficiencies in our Cable businesses.
At NBC Universal, Steve Burke is focused first on maintaining the strong performance and momentum of the Cable channels, which drive most of the profitability of NBC Universal. We're also integrating the Comcast networks into NBC Universal's wonderful group of cable properties and beginning to execute on the many new opportunities to come out of this combination. Across the board, we are focused on execution and on building value in each and every one of our businesses. 
Let me now pass to Michael to cover the fourth quarter and 2010 results in more detail."

Let me begin by briefly reviewing our consolidated results starting on Slide 5. We are pleased to report solid full year 2010 and fourth quarter results, which reflect a consistent focus on profitable growth and underscores the effective execution in our Residential, Commercial, Programming and Advertising businesses. We are particularly pleased with our fourth quarter results, which show real momentum and a balanced approach to financial and customer metrics in our Cable Operations. 
For the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue increased 7.2% to $9.7 billion, and operating cash flow grew 9% to $3.7 billion, resulting in a consolidated operating cash flow margin of 38.2% versus 37.6% in 2009. When adjusted for NBC U transaction costs, the operating cash flow growth was 9.1%, and our margin was 38.5%.
For the full year, consolidated revenue increased 6.1% to $37.9 billion, and operating cash flow grew 6.4% to $14.6 billion, resulting in a consolidated operating cash flow margin of 38.5%. Again, when adjusted for NBC U transaction costs, 2010 operating cash flow growth was 6.9%, and our margin was 38.7%. Given the economic and competitive environment we're facing, we are pleased with these financial results. 
Cable Advertising recovered this past year, and the business benefited from the 25.9% increase in revenues to $1.8 billion. This improvement was led by renewed strength in automotive and also political revenue, which added over $180 million to 2010's results. 
Shifting to our Programming segment, this business also benefited from a healthy advertising market with revenue growth of 11.8% and operating cash flow growth of 20.6%. 
Please refer to Slide 6. We also remain very focused on free cash flow, free cash flow per share and earnings per share as important metrics in evaluating the strength of the company. In each of these key metrics, our performance in the fourth quarter and during 2010 was very strong and reflects solid progress related to our continued focus on return on invested capital and on execution.
During the fourth quarter, we generated consolidated free cash flow of $1.1 billion, an increase of 46% compared to last year, primarily the result of higher consolidated operating cash flow, lower capital expenditures and changes in operating assets and liabilities. For the fourth quarter, free cash flow per share increased 48% to $0.40 per share. For the full year of 2010, our free cash flow increased 22% to $5.4 billion, and free cash flow per share increased 25% to $1.91 per share. Excluding total NBC Universal-related costs and other non-recurring items, EPS for the fourth quarter grew 20.7% to $0.35 per share. For the full year, again, excluding total NBC Universal costs and other non-recurring items, earnings per share grew 18% to $1.31 per share. Please refer to Table 4 in the press release for more details on these items.
Let's turn to Slide 7 to review the Cable division's results. For the fourth quarter, Cable revenue increased 6.9% to $9.2 billion, reflecting growth in our Residential business and continued strength in Business Services and Cable Advertising. As Brian previously mentioned, we experienced real strength in our customer metrics in the fourth quarter when compared to 2009 and in prior quarters. We added 414,000 total Video, High-Speed Internet and Voice customers during the fourth quarter. And we had fewer Video losses than in the prior quarter as well as compared to last year, signaling that the impact of the digital transition is now behind us.
In addition, we saw a strong growth in our High-Speed Internet additions as we continue to take share with product superiority, and we added healthy levels of Voice customers as we drove Voice additions with our Triple Play offers. We continue to manage the business for profitable growth, and we've been effective during 2010 in driving recurring revenue. Total revenue per Video customer increased 11% to over $133 per month in the fourth quarter, reflecting strong ARPU management, the higher contribution from Comcast Business Services and an increasing number of customers taking multiple products. At the end of the fourth quarter, 33% of our Video customers took all three services compared to 28% at the end of 2009.
For the fourth quarter, total Video revenue increased 2.1%. Video revenue continues to strengthen, reflecting rate adjustments and increasing number of our customers taking higher levels of digital and advanced services and increase in pay revenue. This quarter, we added 228,000 Advanced Service customers who subscribe to high-def and/or DVR services. We now have 10.1 million Advanced Service customers equal to 51% of our digital customer base and 44% of all Video customers. 
High-Speed Internet revenue increased a healthy 10.7% during the quarter, reflecting rate adjustments, continued growth in our customer base and an increasing number of customers taking higher-speed services. Today, 23% of our residential High-Speed Internet customers take the higher speed tier above our flagship service. We added 292,000 High-Speed Internet customers in the fourth quarter and 1.1 million in 2010. This compares to 247,000 for the fourth quarter of 2009 and 1 million for all of 2009. Our penetration continues to trend upward and is now at 33%.
Voice revenue also posted strong growth, increasing 11.8% for the quarter, reflecting continued growth in our residential customer base as we successfully bundle with the Triple Play and benefit from a growing contribution from Business Services. We added 257,000 total Voice customers in the fourth quarter and added 988,000 Voice customers during 2010 compared to 1.1 million last year. Over the last 12 months, our penetration has increased 160 basis points and is now at 17.3%.
We also had another strong performance in Business Services, with revenue increasing 53.5% to $365 million in the quarter and 53.1% to $1.3 billion for 2010. This business' margins are improving, and we expect the momentum in the small end of business market to continue. As I have mentioned previously, we are in the early stages of targeting medium-sized businesses and have invested in this effort during 2010. We remain very enthusiastic about the growth opportunities to serve midsized businesses and to also expand our cell backhaul efforts. 
As I mentioned, Cable Advertising performed well as fourth quarter revenue increased 29.3%. This improvement was, again, led by strength in automotive, as well as higher political revenue. Excluding the impact of political, core Cable Advertising revenue increased 10.2% this quarter and 16.4% for the full year.
Please refer to Slide 8, and let's review our Cable division's operating cash flow results. Fourth quarter Cable operating cash flow increased 8.7% to $3.8 billion. Our Cable operating cash flow margin increased to 41.2%, a 70 basis point improvement compared to last year's fourth quarter. For 2010, Cable operating cash flow increased 6.4% to $14.6 billion, and our Cable operating cash flow margin increased to 40.7% from 40.4%. Total expenses in our Cable segment increased 5.6%, reflecting higher video programming and marketing expenses, as well as continued investment to expand our capabilities in Business Services. 
Programming expenses increased 5.9% this quarter and 5.6% for all of 2010, reflecting an increasing number of our customers taking higher levels of our digital services, the addition of new programming and contract resets. As we enter new contracts, we are also receiving more value in our programming contracts, particularly with more On Demand Programming and increasing availability of content across multiple platforms. As we look to 2011, we expect programming expenses to grow at a slightly higher rate than in 2010 due in part to higher sports-related costs.
Marketing expenses increased 24.2% this quarter and 17.4% for the year, as a result of continued investment in direct sales, in our retail channels and in higher overall advertising and media spend, including our XFINITY branding. Our XFINITY brand is now launched in 84% of our footprint, and awareness of XFINITY now exceeds 90%. Among non-customers, we have seen consideration levels, that is potential customers willing to evaluate and consider our brand for purchase, grow by over 36% since the launch of the XFINITY one year ago. In addition, among our current customers, we have seen our ratings for being technologically advanced grow by more than 40%, and our scores for having good value for money increase by 30%. Our marketing investment is yielding positive results, driving connect activity and improving our competitive positioning in the market.
We also remain very focused on expense management throughout the entire enterprise. We are constantly evaluating our cost structure to gain efficiencies. In the fourth quarter, we realized improvements in network costs and reduced our direct costs for High-Speed Internet and Voice businesses. In addition, customer service and technical expenses were relatively flat for the year as we benefited from a number of efficiency initiatives, which resulted in lower activity levels and increasing call automation and customer self service. 
Please refer to Slide 9 to review our capital expenditures. In the fourth quarter, capital expenditures decreased $77 million to $1.5 billion, representing 15.8% of total revenue, continuing our trend of decreasing capital intensity, lower equipment pricing and strong return on invested capital. Fourth quarter CapEx reflects meaningful investments to support growth in Business Services and to expand our efforts in midsized businesses such as Metro-E and cell backhaul. We have now deployed almost 17 million digital adapters since the inception of the All-Digital project, including 1.9 million during the fourth quarter and 10.7 million during 2010. Our All-Digital project has freed up bandwidth for DOCSIS 3.0, as well as enabled our new content delivery network for On Demand. And as Brian mentioned, All-Digital is providing significant product enhancements for our customers.
We're generating incremental revenue from a reduction in theft of service and higher take rates for advanced services and pay-per-view. All-Digital is also helping to drive operating efficiencies with reduced truck rolls and higher utilization of self installation. As a result, the All-Digital project is providing double-digit returns, while generating significant strategic and operating benefits for the company. 
Another high-return capital investment area is our deployment of advanced digital boxes. We have articulated the investment returns for this area before. In the fourth quarter, we deployed 781,000 advanced high-def and/or DVR set tops. For the full year of 2010, capital expenditures decreased 3% to $5 billion, equal to 13.1% of revenue and, again, reflects decreased capital intensity. In addition, consistent with prior years, our growth-oriented CapEx represents approximately 71% of total Cable  capital expenditures.
With regard to 2011, we anticipate our capital intensity to moderate further as Cable capital expenditures are expected to be lower as a percentage of Cable revenue when compared to 2010. This further reduction in CapEx should occur even as we aggressively invest internally in strategic opportunities, which we believe have attractive risk adjusted returns and represent future organic growth. 
Please refer to Slide 10. Now let me provide an update on the NBC Universal transaction, which we view as strategically and financially attractive and consistent with our capital allocation strategy. The transaction is transformative to our content assets as we now have scale in both content and distribution. The transaction has been structured to yield strong double-digit returns, maintain Comcast's conservative balance sheet and strong investment grade ratings and allow us to accelerate our return of capital to shareholders. 
As you know, we closed the transaction on January 28. At closing, we funded $6.2 billion in cash and also contributed our national Programming networks, regional sports and news networks and several digital assets. The structure produces significant tax benefits associated with tax depreciation and amortization deductions that afford Comcast tax benefits similar to an asset purchase. The resulting tax benefits may exceed our previous estimate of $1.5 billion on a net present value basis. 
In the last year, we raised $13.1 billion of new attractively priced debt to fund this transaction, including $9.1 billion at NBC U and $4 billion at Comcast Corporation. At closing, our consolidated leverage is approximately 2.4x. And as we have said in the past, we remain comfortable with our debt to operating cash flow leverage target between 2.0x to 2.5x. 
We will consolidate NBC Universal, but we'll manage Comcast Cable and NBC Universal as two separate balance sheets and two separate pools of cash flow generation and funding capacity. Comcast Cable, which includes the Cable business and our corporate operations will continue to allocate its free cash flow generation to reinvestment in its businesses and to return capital to shareholders. NBC Universal will retain its free cash flow and debt capacity for reinvestment in its businesses and to fund future redemptions by GE. 
While day one integration went smoothly, and we are just beginning to operate these businesses, NBC Universal starts 2011 with good momentum. We are very excited about the opportunities. And as Marlene mentioned, we'll provide more details and transparency for NBC Universal and its operating segments with the first quarter results on May 4. 
Please refer to Slide 11. As we review 2010 and begin 2011, we have a consistent financial strategy that is balanced and disciplined. Our first priority remains to profitably invest in the operating and strategic needs of our businesses. And we will continue to deploy capital when it provides attractive risk-adjusted returns, enhances our competitive position and delivers sustainable organic growth. In terms of external investment, we expect our focus to be on execution and on the integration of NBC Universal. We remain extremely disciplined focusing on opportunities that extend our services and add features that allow us to build new complementary and profitable revenue streams.
In 2010, we returned approximately 42% of our consolidated free cash flow to shareholders or $2.3 billion, including dividend payments totaling $1.1 billion and share repurchases totaling $1.2 billion. With today's announcement, our return of capital is increasing 45% to $3.3 billion during 2011, representing approximately 60% of our last 12 months' free cash flow and approximately 90% of our last 12 months' net income. That incorporates a 19% increase in our planned annual dividend to $0.45 per share and acceleration by 75% and our share repurchases to $2.1 billion for this year. When you combine all these elements together, we feel very good about our financial strength, our current operating momentum and opportunities in 2011. We have a terrific mix of assets, and we're looking forward to executing on the opportunities to build value for our shareholders. 
Now let me turn it over to Marlene for Q&A."

We have a lot of big goals for NBC Universal. I would start with the fact that 80% of the EBITDA or 80% of the value are the Cable channels. The Cable channels are in fantastic shape, have been growing double digits. There you just want to make sure that we continue to make the right investments and continue the growth. The biggest opportunity I think over the next few years, and we certainly don't expect to see anything in the next year, but if you go out three, four, or five years, is the NBC network where we have some real strength in NBC News and some real weakness with primetime. And we think we can make progress, and we're doing a variety of things, putting a variety of things in place to get that progress. But I don't think we're going to see anything for a while. And then, I'm very excited about opportunities like Telemundo. You mentioned international. We think international is a real opportunity, so we think the assets are fantastic.

And if you had to look out the next couple of years, it's not at all inconceivable that many, many providers of these devices attached to the Internet through a Wi-Fi connection in your home is just going to give you an array of new experiences that you don't have historically. And I think that's going to work at high end and low end. The reality of the digital transition that Neil was describing was pretty much at the low end of our customers. So we are focused on our best customers and expanding that experience, but I think these things end up rippling throughout all of our customers with the fullness of time and the cost of the devices. On the sports question, Steve may want to clarify here. But at this point, we have a lot of opportunities with NBC Universal. It is not something we're singling out or focused on. People said are we doing something specific, different than the company has traditionally done. I don't really see that is a realistic thing. If people talk about ESPN and other things, I think we have a long-term opportunity to take these brands, to do things like between The Golf Channel and NBC sports and bring it to another level that's never been before, and that's where we're really focused to start. We have some long-term agreements in place. Olympics is in a category by itself. Steve, do you want to add anything?"

When you compare this to the peer landscape, most of your peers have adopted strategies to shrink the share count fairly aggressively to contribute to this growth. And as you benchmark sort of boosting the share repurchase today, but you're still a bit less aggressive in shrinking the share count. And I'm wondering, is the signaling here that you think you can grow the underlying business faster than peers, and that's really how you bridge the gap? And then second question just on Voice and broadband costs, both of them, the lowest levels in several years despite very good volumes in both, can you put some more context around this, and how we should think about further sort of declines in these costs?"

I think that when we look at our peers, and we look at our peers in terms of in our industries with regards to our market cap, with regards to our investment grade rating. And we look at our leverage, and we look at our payout ratios, we are right smack in the middle of where we think we should be with regards to our dividend yield, with regards to our dividend payout yield, whether it's on free cash flow or net income, as well as with our leverage ratios. So one thing we are doing is really focused on is free cash flow. And you can see from one of the slides how we've grown free cash flow pretty substantially since 2007 and been able to buy back stock at the same time and grow free cash flow per share I think pretty nicely where many of our peers I think would be enviable of that growth. So I think we're focused on a pretty balanced capital allocation strategy."

I'm delighted to begin this first call of the year with really only positive news. Today, we're reporting strong results for 2010.

I'm delighted to begin this first call of the year with really only positive news. Today, we're reporting strong results for 2010. We have successfully completed the NBC Universal transaction and really everything you will hear on this call points to an exciting new beginning for our company.
Our financial and operating performance accelerated throughout 2010, and we finished the year with real strength in financial and customer results in the fourth quarter. Our Cable and Programming teams achieved these results as they worked through a year-long regulatory approval process for NBC Universal, which is now complete with conditions that we believe will allow us to effectively execute on our plans for growth and innovation. Therefore, we're beginning 2011 in a wonderful position. We have strong financial and operating momentum. We're starting to execute on the many unique opportunities that are available to Comcast now that NBC Universal is part of our company. 
So let me briefly review the results. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenues increased 7% and operating cash flow increased 9%. We generated free cash flow of $1.1 billion for the quarter, up 46% and $5.4 billion for the year, an increase of 22%. This was the third consecutive year with growth in free cash flow above 20%, showing our real and consistent focus on free cash flow generation and an effective and disciplined approach to expense and capital management.
Combined with these solid financial results, we also saw real strength in customer metrics. In the fourth quarter, we had fewer video losses than in the third quarter and in last year's fourth quarter despite having a larger competitive footprint than a year ago. We also had strong growth in Voice and High-Speed Internet net additions. In fact, 2010 marks the fifth year in a row where we added more than 1 million High-Speed Internet customers. This strong momentum in Cable also demonstrates that the investments we have been making in technology for our XFINITY products combined with our focus on enhancing the customer experience are paying off. 
Our key technical initiatives, All-Digital and DOCSIS 3.0, are nearing completion, with All-Digital in 75% of our markets and DOCSIS 3.0 deployed in more than 85% of our footprint. We've also put in place a library server infrastructure, which we call our content delivery network for On Demand in the majority of our markets. All of this means we're delivering better products to our customers, more high-def and foreign-language programming, up to 25,000 On Demand choices, better guides, improved DVR functionality, more interactivity, as well as higher speeds for our High-Speed Internet customers.
We're also quickly leveraging these investments and taking advantage of technology advances in IP technology and new devices to continue to enhance the experience that provides our customers more choices and more ways to enjoy our services, online with xfinityTV.com, which gives you access to 150,000 entertainment choices, at home or on the go with tablets and mobile devices with our Xfinity TV app, which just for the iPad alone has been downloaded more than 1 million times since we'd launched it in mid-November. The app now combines the functionality of a remote, a TV guide and a mobile video player with play now, a streaming feature that initially gives customers access to 3,000 hours of movies and TV content. And later this year, we do plan to expand to include live programming.
Our XFINITY platform gives us the capability to build new products and features and to deliver more innovation to our customers. It also positions us to innovate faster than ever before and enables us to have new growth opportunities like Business Services and in advertising and in content. 
Now that we have completed the NBC Universal transaction, we are in a special position with a strategic mix of assets and a unique opportunity to build value for our shareholders, both near term with assets like the Cable networks, and longer term with Universal Films and NBC broadcast network. Our investment in NBC Universal is structured to provide solid returns. The financing was completed on terms that are better than we originally anticipated, and NBC Universal has good momentum going into 2011.
With scale in both distribution and content, we believe we can drive product leadership and innovation even faster. Reflecting all of this confidence and optimism in the future of our businesses, today we are pleased to announce a 19% increase in our planned annual dividend to $0.45 per share. And we're accelerating our share repurchases in 2011 by 75% to $2.1 billion.
So we really do start 2011 on a positive note. We have a strong foundation with increasingly diverse revenue streams, strong subscription businesses and opportunities to build new businesses. And our competitive position has never been better. Now it's really all about execution in order to maintain our financial and operating momentum and to drive profitable and sustainable growth. 
Under Neil Smit's leadership for over a year now, we are speeding up innovation and really moving forward with the customer experience. We have reinforced our focus on first call resolution for our customers and online self-service. And as a result, repeat service calls are down by 15%, and online transactions have increased by 20%. At the same time, customer awareness of our customer guarantee increased by 10 points last year. When taken together, these steps are driving higher customer satisfaction, as well as increased efficiencies in our Cable businesses.
At NBC Universal, Steve Burke is focused first on maintaining the strong performance and momentum of the Cable channels, which drive most of the profitability of NBC Universal. We're also integrating the Comcast networks into NBC Universal's wonderful group of cable properties and beginning to execute on the many new opportunities to come out of this combination. Across the board, we are focused on execution and on building value in each and every one of our businesses. 
Let me now pass to Michael to cover the fourth quarter and 2010 results in more detail."

Let me begin by briefly reviewing our consolidated results starting on Slide 5. We are pleased to report solid full year 2010 and fourth quarter results, which reflect a consistent focus on profitable growth and underscores the effective execution in our Residential, Commercial, Programming and Advertising businesses. We are particularly pleased with our fourth quarter results, which show real momentum and a balanced approach to financial and customer metrics in our Cable Operations. 
For the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue increased 7.2% to $9.7 billion, and operating cash flow grew 9% to $3.7 billion, resulting in a consolidated operating cash flow margin of 38.2% versus 37.6% in 2009. When adjusted for NBC U transaction costs, the operating cash flow growth was 9.1%, and our margin was 38.5%.
For the full year, consolidated revenue increased 6.1% to $37.9 billion, and operating cash flow grew 6.4% to $14.6 billion, resulting in a consolidated operating cash flow margin of 38.5%. Again, when adjusted for NBC U transaction costs, 2010 operating cash flow growth was 6.9%, and our margin was 38.7%. Given the economic and competitive environment we're facing, we are pleased with these financial results. 
Cable Advertising recovered this past year, and the business benefited from the 25.9% increase in revenues to $1.8 billion. This improvement was led by renewed strength in automotive and also political revenue, which added over $180 million to 2010's results. 
Shifting to our Programming segment, this business also benefited from a healthy advertising market with revenue growth of 11.8% and operating cash flow growth of 20.6%. 
Please refer to Slide 6. We also remain very focused on free cash flow, free cash flow per share and earnings per share as important metrics in evaluating the strength of the company. In each of these key metrics, our performance in the fourth quarter and during 2010 was very strong and reflects solid progress related to our continued focus on return on invested capital and on execution.
During the fourth quarter, we generated consolidated free cash flow of $1.1 billion, an increase of 46% compared to last year, primarily the result of higher consolidated operating cash flow, lower capital expenditures and changes in operating assets and liabilities. For the fourth quarter, free cash flow per share increased 48% to $0.40 per share. For the full year of 2010, our free cash flow increased 22% to $5.4 billion, and free cash flow per share increased 25% to $1.91 per share. Excluding total NBC Universal-related costs and other non-recurring items, EPS for the fourth quarter grew 20.7% to $0.35 per share. For the full year, again, excluding total NBC Universal costs and other non-recurring items, earnings per share grew 18% to $1.31 per share. Please refer to Table 4 in the press release for more details on these items.
Let's turn to Slide 7 to review the Cable division's results. For the fourth quarter, Cable revenue increased 6.9% to $9.2 billion, reflecting growth in our Residential business and continued strength in Business Services and Cable Advertising. As Brian previously mentioned, we experienced real strength in our customer metrics in the fourth quarter when compared to 2009 and in prior quarters. We added 414,000 total Video, High-Speed Internet and Voice customers during the fourth quarter. And we had fewer Video losses than in the prior quarter as well as compared to last year, signaling that the impact of the digital transition is now behind us.
In addition, we saw a strong growth in our High-Speed Internet additions as we continue to take share with product superiority, and we added healthy levels of Voice customers as we drove Voice additions with our Triple Play offers. We continue to manage the business for profitable growth, and we've been effective during 2010 in driving recurring revenue. Total revenue per Video customer increased 11% to over $133 per month in the fourth quarter, reflecting strong ARPU management, the higher contribution from Comcast Business Services and an increasing number of customers taking multiple products. At the end of the fourth quarter, 33% of our Video customers took all three services compared to 28% at the end of 2009.
For the fourth quarter, total Video revenue increased 2.1%. Video revenue continues to strengthen, reflecting rate adjustments and increasing number of our customers taking higher levels of digital and advanced services and increase in pay revenue. This quarter, we added 228,000 Advanced Service customers who subscribe to high-def and/or DVR services. We now have 10.1 million Advanced Service customers equal to 51% of our digital customer base and 44% of all Video customers. 
High-Speed Internet revenue increased a healthy 10.7% during the quarter, reflecting rate adjustments, continued growth in our customer base and an increasing number of customers taking higher-speed services. Today, 23% of our residential High-Speed Internet customers take the higher speed tier above our flagship service. We added 292,000 High-Speed Internet customers in the fourth quarter and 1.1 million in 2010. This compares to 247,000 for the fourth quarter of 2009 and 1 million for all of 2009. Our penetration continues to trend upward and is now at 33%.
Voice revenue also posted strong growth, increasing 11.8% for the quarter, reflecting continued growth in our residential customer base as we successfully bundle with the Triple Play and benefit from a growing contribution from Business Services. We added 257,000 total Voice customers in the fourth quarter and added 988,000 Voice customers during 2010 compared to 1.1 million last year. Over the last 12 months, our penetration has increased 160 basis points and is now at 17.3%.
We also had another strong performance in Business Services, with revenue increasing 53.5% to $365 million in the quarter and 53.1% to $1.3 billion for 2010. This business' margins are improving, and we expect the momentum in the small end of business market to continue. As I have mentioned previously, we are in the early stages of targeting medium-sized businesses and have invested in this effort during 2010. We remain very enthusiastic about the growth opportunities to serve midsized businesses and to also expand our cell backhaul efforts. 
As I mentioned, Cable Advertising performed well as fourth quarter revenue increased 29.3%. This improvement was, again, led by strength in automotive, as well as higher political revenue. Excluding the impact of political, core Cable Advertising revenue increased 10.2% this quarter and 16.4% for the full year.
Please refer to Slide 8, and let's review our Cable division's operating cash flow results. Fourth quarter Cable operating cash flow increased 8.7% to $3.8 billion. Our Cable operating cash flow margin increased to 41.2%, a 70 basis point improvement compared to last year's fourth quarter. For 2010, Cable operating cash flow increased 6.4% to $14.6 billion, and our Cable operating cash flow margin increased to 40.7% from 40.4%. Total expenses in our Cable segment increased 5.6%, reflecting higher video programming and marketing expenses, as well as continued investment to expand our capabilities in Business Services. 
Programming expenses increased 5.9% this quarter and 5.6% for all of 2010, reflecting an increasing number of our customers taking higher levels of our digital services, the addition of new programming and contract resets. As we enter new contracts, we are also receiving more value in our programming contracts, particularly with more On Demand Programming and increasing availability of content across multiple platforms. As we look to 2011, we expect programming expenses to grow at a slightly higher rate than in 2010 due in part to higher sports-related costs.
Marketing expenses increased 24.2% this quarter and 17.4% for the year, as a result of continued investment in direct sales, in our retail channels and in higher overall advertising and media spend, including our XFINITY branding. Our XFINITY brand is now launched in 84% of our footprint, and awareness of XFINITY now exceeds 90%. Among non-customers, we have seen consideration levels, that is potential customers willing to evaluate and consider our brand for purchase, grow by over 36% since the launch of the XFINITY one year ago. In addition, among our current customers, we have seen our ratings for being technologically advanced grow by more than 40%, and our scores for having good value for money increase by 30%. Our marketing investment is yielding positive results, driving connect activity and improving our competitive positioning in the market.
We also remain very focused on expense management throughout the entire enterprise. We are constantly evaluating our cost structure to gain efficiencies. In the fourth quarter, we realized improvements in network costs and reduced our direct costs for High-Speed Internet and Voice businesses. In addition, customer service and technical expenses were relatively flat for the year as we benefited from a number of efficiency initiatives, which resulted in lower activity levels and increasing call automation and customer self service. 
Please refer to Slide 9 to review our capital expenditures. In the fourth quarter, capital expenditures decreased $77 million to $1.5 billion, representing 15.8% of total revenue, continuing our trend of decreasing capital intensity, lower equipment pricing and strong return on invested capital. Fourth quarter CapEx reflects meaningful investments to support growth in Business Services and to expand our efforts in midsized businesses such as Metro-E and cell backhaul. We have now deployed almost 17 million digital adapters since the inception of the All-Digital project, including 1.9 million during the fourth quarter and 10.7 million during 2010. Our All-Digital project has freed up bandwidth for DOCSIS 3.0, as well as enabled our new content delivery network for On Demand. And as Brian mentioned, All-Digital is providing significant product enhancements for our customers.
We're generating incremental revenue from a reduction in theft of service and higher take rates for advanced services and pay-per-view. All-Digital is also helping to drive operating efficiencies with reduced truck rolls and higher utilization of self installation. As a result, the All-Digital project is providing double-digit returns, while generating significant strategic and operating benefits for the company. 
Another high-return capital investment area is our deployment of advanced digital boxes. We have articulated the investment returns for this area before. In the fourth quarter, we deployed 781,000 advanced high-def and/or DVR set tops. For the full year of 2010, capital expenditures decreased 3% to $5 billion, equal to 13.1% of revenue and, again, reflects decreased capital intensity. In addition, consistent with prior years, our growth-oriented CapEx represents approximately 71% of total Cable  capital expenditures.
With regard to 2011, we anticipate our capital intensity to moderate further as Cable capital expenditures are expected to be lower as a percentage of Cable revenue when compared to 2010. This further reduction in CapEx should occur even as we aggressively invest internally in strategic opportunities, which we believe have attractive risk adjusted returns and represent future organic growth. 
Please refer to Slide 10. Now let me provide an update on the NBC Universal transaction, which we view as strategically and financially attractive and consistent with our capital allocation strategy. The transaction is transformative to our content assets as we now have scale in both content and distribution. The transaction has been structured to yield strong double-digit returns, maintain Comcast's conservative balance sheet and strong investment grade ratings and allow us to accelerate our return of capital to shareholders. 
As you know, we closed the transaction on January 28. At closing, we funded $6.2 billion in cash and also contributed our national Programming networks, regional sports and news networks and several digital assets. The structure produces significant tax benefits associated with tax depreciation and amortization deductions that afford Comcast tax benefits similar to an asset purchase. The resulting tax benefits may exceed our previous estimate of $1.5 billion on a net present value basis. 
In the last year, we raised $13.1 billion of new attractively priced debt to fund this transaction, including $9.1 billion at NBC U and $4 billion at Comcast Corporation. At closing, our consolidated leverage is approximately 2.4x. And as we have said in the past, we remain comfortable with our debt to operating cash flow leverage target between 2.0x to 2.5x. 
We will consolidate NBC Universal, but we'll manage Comcast Cable and NBC Universal as two separate balance sheets and two separate pools of cash flow generation and funding capacity. Comcast Cable, which includes the Cable business and our corporate operations will continue to allocate its free cash flow generation to reinvestment in its businesses and to return capital to shareholders. NBC Universal will retain its free cash flow and debt capacity for reinvestment in its businesses and to fund future redemptions by GE. 
While day one integration went smoothly, and we are just beginning to operate these businesses, NBC Universal starts 2011 with good momentum. We are very excited about the opportunities. And as Marlene mentioned, we'll provide more details and transparency for NBC Universal and its operating segments with the first quarter results on May 4. 
Please refer to Slide 11. As we review 2010 and begin 2011, we have a consistent financial strategy that is balanced and disciplined. Our first priority remains to profitably invest in the operating and strategic needs of our businesses. And we will continue to deploy capital when it provides attractive risk-adjusted returns, enhances our competitive position and delivers sustainable organic growth. In terms of external investment, we expect our focus to be on execution and on the integration of NBC Universal. We remain extremely disciplined focusing on opportunities that extend our services and add features that allow us to build new complementary and profitable revenue streams.
In 2010, we returned approximately 42% of our consolidated free cash flow to shareholders or $2.3 billion, including dividend payments totaling $1.1 billion and share repurchases totaling $1.2 billion. With today's announcement, our return of capital is increasing 45% to $3.3 billion during 2011, representing approximately 60% of our last 12 months' free cash flow and approximately 90% of our last 12 months' net income. That incorporates a 19% increase in our planned annual dividend to $0.45 per share and acceleration by 75% and our share repurchases to $2.1 billion for this year. When you combine all these elements together, we feel very good about our financial strength, our current operating momentum and opportunities in 2011. We have a terrific mix of assets, and we're looking forward to executing on the opportunities to build value for our shareholders. 
Now let me turn it over to Marlene for Q&A."

One of the advantages of waiting 13 or 14 months to get a deal closed due to regulatory approval is you get a chance to really get to know the assets, really get to know the people and get a chance to create a set of goals and plans and priorities for the future. We have a lot of big goals for NBC Universal. I would start with the fact that 80% of the EBITDA or 80% of the value are the Cable channels. The Cable channels are in fantastic shape, have been growing double digits. There you just want to make sure that we continue to make the right investments and continue the growth. The biggest opportunity I think over the next few years, and we certainly don't expect to see anything in the next year, but if you go out three, four, or five years, is the NBC network where we have some real strength in NBC News and some real weakness with primetime. And we think we can make progress, and we're doing a variety of things, putting a variety of things in place to get that progress. But I don't think we're going to see anything for a while. And then, I'm very excited about opportunities like Telemundo. You mentioned international. We think international is a real opportunity, so we think the assets are fantastic. And the real core of the assets, the cable channels, are in great shape. I want to continue to keep that going, but we're going to be opportunistic in terms of the places where we can invest and grow like international, like Telemundo, like the NBC network as well.

We'll continue to focus on managing rate and volume, which I think is the delicate balance that we continue to maintain, and we'll continue to focus on that. With regards to commercial competitiveness, I think we saw great opportunity in SMB, and we'll continue to focus on that. It's a large channel. We have the capacity in place. I think in any new rollout into a segment or a sector, there's good growth in the beginning. And I think we're seeing that on the midsized business side. We have to build the capabilities of addressing that, the sales force, the back office system, but we're seeing good growth opportunity there right now."

I'm delighted to begin this first call of the year with really only positive news. Today, we're reporting strong results for 2010. We have successfully completed the NBCUniversal transaction and really everythi",1002,"Thanks, Marlene, and good morning, everyone. I'm delighted to begin this first call of the year with really only positive news. Today, we're reporting strong results for 2010. We have successfully completed the NBCUniversal transaction and really everything you will hear on this call points to an exciting new beginning for our company.
Our financial and operating performance accelerated throughout 2010, and we finished the year with real strength in financial and customer results in the fourth quarter. Our Cable and Programming teams achieved these results as they worked through a year-long regulatory approval process for NBCUniversal, which is now complete with conditions that we believe will allow us to effectively execute on our plans for growth and innovation. Therefore, we're beginning 2011 in a wonderful position. We have strong financial and operating momentum. We're starting to execute on the many unique opportunities that are available to Comcast now that NBC Universal is part of our company. 
So let me briefly review the results. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenues increased 7% and operating cash flow increased 9%. We generated free cash flow of $1.1 billion for the quarter, up 46% and $5.4 billion for the year, an increase of 22%. This was the third consecutive year with growth in free cash flow above 20%, showing our real and consistent focus on free cash flow generation and an effective and disciplined approach to expense and capital management.
Combined with these solid financial results, we also saw real strength in customer metrics. In the fourth quarter, we had fewer Video losses than in the third quarter and in last year's fourth quarter despite having a larger competitive footprint than a year ago. We also had strong growth in Voice and High-Speed Internet net additions. In fact, 2010 marks the fifth year in a row where we added more than 1 million High-Speed Internet customers. This strong momentum in Cable also demonstrates that the investments we have been making in technology for our XFINITY products combined with our focus on enhancing the customer experience are paying off. 
Our key technical initiatives, All-Digital and DOCSIS 3.0, are nearing completion, with All-Digital in 75% of our markets and DOCSIS 3.0 deployed in more than 85% of our footprint. We've also put in place a library server infrastructure, which we call our content delivery network for On Demand in the majority of our markets. All of this means we're delivering better products to our customers, more high-def and foreign-language programming, up to 25,000 On Demand choices, better guides, improved DVR functionality, more interactivity as well as higher speeds for our High-Speed Internet customers.
We're also quickly leveraging these investments and taking advantage of technology advances in IP technology and new devices to continue to enhance the experience that provides our customers more choices and more ways to enjoy our services, online with XfinityTV.com, which gives you access to 150,000 entertainment choices, at home or on the go with tablets and mobile devices with our Xfinity TV app, which just for the iPad alone has been downloaded more than 1 million times since we'd launched it in mid-November. The app now combines the functionality of a remote, a TV guide and a mobile video player with Play Now, a streaming feature that initially gives customers access to 3,000 hours of movies and TV content. And later this year, we plan to expand to include live programming.
Our XFINITY platform gives us the capability to build new products and features and to deliver more innovation to our customers. It also positions us to innovate faster than ever before and enables us to have new growth opportunities like business services and in advertising and in content. 
Now that we have completed the NBCUniversal transaction, we are in a special position with a strategic mix of assets and a unique opportunity to build value for our shareholders, both near term with assets like the cable networks, and longer term with Universal films and NBC broadcast network. Our investment in NBCUniversal is structured to provide solid returns. The financing was completed on terms that are better than we originally anticipated, and NBCUniversal has good momentum going into 2011.
With scale in both distribution and content, we believe we can drive product leadership and innovation even faster. Reflecting all of this confidence and optimism in the future of our businesses, today we are pleased to announce a 19% increase in our planned annual dividend to $0.45 per share. And we're accelerating our share repurchases in 2011 by 75% to $2.1 billion.
So we really do start 2011 on a positive note. We have a strong foundation with increasingly diverse revenue streams, strong subscription businesses and opportunities to build new businesses. And our competitive position has never been better. Now it's really all about execution in order to maintain our financial and operating momentum and to drive profitable and sustainable growth. 
Under Neil Smit's leadership for over a year now, we are speeding up innovation and really moving forward with the customer experience. We have reinforced our focus on first call resolution for our customers and online self-service. And as a result, repeat service calls are down by 15%, and online transactions have increased by 20%. At the same time, customer awareness of our customer guarantee increased by 10 points last year. When taken together, these steps are driving higher customer satisfaction as well as increased efficiencies in our Cable businesses.
At NBC Universal, Steve Burke is focused first on maintaining the strong performance and momentum of the Cable channels, which drive most of the profitability of NBC Universal. We're also integrating the Comcast networks into NBCUniversal's wonderful group of cable properties and beginning to execute on the many new opportunities to come out of this combination. Across the board, we are focused on execution and on building value in each and every one of our businesses. 
Let me now pass to Michael to cover the fourth quarter and 2010 results in more detail."

Let me begin by briefly reviewing our consolidated results starting on Slide 5. We are pleased to report solid full year 2010 and fourth quarter results, which reflect a consistent focus on profitable growth and underscores the effective execution in our Residential, Commercial, Programming and Advertising businesses. We are particularly pleased with our fourth quarter results, which show real momentum and a balanced approach to financial and customer metrics in our Cable operations. 
For the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue increased 7.2% to $9.7 billion, and operating cash flow grew 9% to $3.7 billion, resulting in a consolidated operating cash flow margin of 38.2% versus 37.6% in 2009. When adjusted for NBCU transaction costs, the operating cash flow growth was 9.1%, and our margin was 38.5%.
For the full year, consolidated revenue increased 6.1% to $37.9 billion, and operating cash flow grew 6.4% to $14.6 billion, resulting in a consolidated operating cash flow margin of 38.5%. Again, when adjusted for NBCU transaction costs, 2010's operating cash flow growth was 6.9%, and our margin was 38.7%. Given the economic and competitive environments we're facing, we are pleased with these financial results. 
Cable Advertising recovered this past year, and the business benefited from the 25.9% increase in revenues to $1.8 billion. This improvement was led by renewed strength in automotive and also political revenue, which added over $180 million to 2010's results. 
Shifting to our Programming segment. This business also benefited from a healthy advertising market with revenue growth of 11.8% and operating cash flow growth of 20.6%. 
Please refer to Slide 6. We also remain very focused on free cash flow, free cash flow per share and earnings per share as important metrics in evaluating the strength of the company. In each of these key metrics, our performance in the fourth quarter and during 2010 was very strong and reflects solid progress related to our continued focus on return on invested capital and on execution.
During the fourth quarter, we generated consolidated free cash flow of $1.1 billion, an increase of 46% compared to last year, primarily the result of higher consolidated operating cash flow, lower capital expenditures and changes in operating assets and liabilities. For the fourth quarter, free cash flow per share increased 48% to $0.40 per share. For the full year of 2010, our free cash flow increased 22% to $5.4 billion, and free cash flow per share increased 25% to $1.91 per share. 
Excluding total NBCUniversal-related costs and other non-recurring items, EPS for the fourth quarter grew 20.7% to $0.35 per share. For the full year, again, excluding total NBCUniversal costs and other non-recurring items, earnings per share grew 18% to $1.31 per share. Please refer to Table 4 in the press release for more details on these items.
Let's turn to Slide 7 to review the Cable division's results. For the fourth quarter, Cable revenue increased 6.9% to $9.2 billion, reflecting growth in our Residential business and continued strength in Business Services and Cable Advertising. As Brian previously mentioned, we experienced real strength in our customer metrics in the fourth quarter when compared to 2009 and in prior quarters. We added 414,000 total Video, High-Speed Internet and Voice customers during the fourth quarter. And we had fewer Video losses than in the prior quarter as well as compared to last year, signaling that the impact of the digital transition is now behind us.
In addition, we saw a strong growth in our High-Speed Internet additions as we continue to take share with product superiority, and we added healthy levels of Voice customers as we drove Voice additions with our Triple Play offers. We continue to manage the business for profitable growth, and we've been effective during 2010 in driving recurring revenue. Total revenue per Video customer increased 11% to over $133 per month in the fourth quarter, reflecting strong ARPU management, the higher contribution from Comcast Business Services and an increasing number of customers taking multiple products. At the end of the fourth quarter, 33% of our Video customers took all three services compared to 28% at the end of 2009.
For the fourth quarter, total Video revenue increased 2.1%. Video revenue continues to strengthen, reflecting rate adjustments and increasing number of our customers taking higher levels of digital and advanced services and an increase in Pay revenue. This quarter, we added 228,000 Advanced Service customers who subscribe to high-def and/or DVR services. We now have 10.1 million Advanced Service customers equal to 51% of our digital customer base and 44% of all Video customers. 
High-Speed Internet revenue increased a healthy 10.7% during the quarter, reflecting rate adjustments, continued growth in our customer base and an increasing number of customers taking higher-speed services. Today, 23% of our residential High-Speed Internet customers take the higher speed tier above our flagship service. We added 292,000 High-Speed Internet customers in the fourth quarter and 1.1 million in 2010. This compares to 247,000 for the fourth quarter of 2009 and 1 million for all of 2009. Our penetration continues to trend upward and is now at 33%.
Voice revenue also posted strong growth, increasing 11.8% for the quarter, reflecting continued growth in our residential customer base as we successfully bundle with the Triple Play and benefit from a growing contribution from Business Services. We added 257,000 total Voice customers in the fourth quarter and added 988,000 Voice customers during 2010 compared to 1.1 million last year. Over the last 12 months, our penetration has increased 160 basis points and is now at 17.3%.
We also had another strong performance in Business Services, with revenue increasing 53.5% to $365 million in the quarter and 53.1% to $1.3 billion for 2010. This business' margins are improving, and we expect the momentum in the small end of business market to continue. As I have mentioned previously, we are in the early stages of targeting medium-sized businesses and have invested in this effort during 2010. We remain very enthusiastic about the growth opportunities to serve midsized businesses and to also expand our cell backhaul efforts. 
As I mentioned, Cable Advertising performed well as fourth quarter revenue increased 29.3%. This improvement was, again, led by strength in automotive, as well as higher political revenue. Excluding the impact of political, core Cable Advertising revenue increased 10.2% this quarter and 16.4% for the full year.
Please refer to Slide 8, and let's review our Cable division's operating cash flow results. Fourth quarter Cable operating cash flow increased 8.7% to $3.8 billion. Our Cable operating cash flow margin increased to 41.2%, a 70 basis point improvement compared to last year's fourth quarter. For 2010, Cable operating cash flow increased 6.4% to $14.6 billion, and our Cable operating cash flow margin increased to 40.7% from 40.4%. Total expenses in our Cable segment increased 5.6%, reflecting higher video programming and marketing expenses as well as continued investment to expand our capabilities in Business Services. 
Programming expenses increased 5.9% this quarter and 5.6% for all of 2010, reflecting an increasing number of our customers taking higher levels of our digital services, the addition of new programming and contract resets. As we enter new contracts, we are also receiving more value in our programming contracts, particularly with more On Demand programming and increasing availability of content across multiple platforms. As we look to 2011, we expect programming expenses to grow at a slightly higher rate than in 2010 due in part to higher sports-related costs.
Marketing expenses increased 24.2% this quarter and 17.4% for the year, as a result of continued investment in direct sales, in our retail channels and in higher overall advertising and media spend, including our XFINITY branding. Our XFINITY brand is now launched in 84% of our footprint, and awareness of XFINITY now exceeds 90%. Among non-customers, we have seen consideration levels, that is potential customers willing to evaluate and consider our brand for purchase, grow by over 36% since the launch of the XFINITY one year ago. In addition, among our current customers, we have seen our ratings for being technologically advanced grow by more than 40%, and our scores for having good value for money increase by 30%. Our marketing investment is yielding positive results, driving connect activity and improving our competitive positioning in the market.
We also remain very focused on expense management throughout the entire enterprise. We are constantly evaluating our cost structure to gain efficiencies. In the fourth quarter, we realized improvements in network costs and reduced our direct costs for High-Speed Internet and Voice businesses. In addition, customer service and technical expenses were relatively flat for the year as we benefited from a number of efficiency initiatives, which resulted in lower activity levels and increasing call automation and customer self-service. 
Please refer to Slide 9 to review our capital expenditures. In the fourth quarter, capital expenditure decreased $77 million to $1.5 billion, representing 15.8% of total revenue, continuing our trend of decreasing capital intensity, lower equipment pricing and strong return on invested capital. Fourth quarter CapEx reflects meaningful investments to support growth in Business Services and to expand our efforts in midsized businesses such as Metro-E and cell backhaul. 
We have now deployed almost 17 million digital adapters since the inception of the All-Digital project, including 1.9 million during the fourth quarter and 10.7 million during 2010. Our All-Digital project has freed up bandwidth for DOCSIS 3.0 as well as enabled our new content delivery network for On Demand. And as Brian mentioned, All-Digital is providing significant product enhancements for our customers.
We're generating incremental revenue from a reduction in theft of service and higher take rates for advanced services and pay-per-view. All-Digital is also helping to drive operating efficiencies with reduced truck rolls and higher utilization of self installation. As a result, the All-Digital project is providing double-digit returns, while generating significant strategic and operating benefits for the company. 
Another high-return capital investment area is our deployment of advanced digital boxes. We have articulated the investment returns for this area before. In the fourth quarter, we deployed 781,000 advanced high-def and/or DVR set tops. For the full year of 2010, capital expenditures decreased 3% to $5 billion, equal to 13.1% of revenue and, again, reflects decreased capital intensity. In addition, consistent with prior years, our growth-oriented CapEx represents approximately 71% of total Cable  capital expenditures.
With regard to 2011, we anticipate our capital intensity to moderate further as Cable capital expenditures are expected to be lower as a percentage of Cable revenue when compared to 2010. This further reduction in CapEx should occur even as we aggressively invest internally in strategic opportunities, which we believe have attractive risk adjusted returns and represent future organic growth. 
Please refer to Slide 10. Now let me provide an update on the NBCUniversal transaction, which we view as strategically and financially attractive and consistent with our capital allocation strategy. The transaction is transformative to our content assets as we now have scale in both content and distribution. The transaction has been structured to yield strong double-digit returns, maintain Comcast's conservative balance sheet and strong investment grade ratings and allow us to accelerate our return of capital to shareholders. 
As you know, we closed the transaction on January 28. At closing, we funded $6.2 billion in cash and also contributed our national programming networks, regional sports and news networks and several digital assets. The structure produces significant tax benefits associated with tax depreciation and amortization deductions that afford Comcast tax benefits similar to an asset purchase. The resulting tax benefits may exceed our previous estimate of $1.5 billion on a net present value basis. 
In the last year, we raised $13.1 billion of new attractively priced debt to fund this transaction, including $9.1 billion at NBCU and $4 billion at Comcast Corporation. At closing, our consolidated leverage is approximately 2.4x. And as we have said in the past, we remain comfortable with our debt to operating cash flow leverage target between 2.0x to 2.5x. 
We will consolidate NBCUniversal, but will manage Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal as two separate balance sheets and two separate pools of cash flow generation and funding capacity. Comcast Cable, which includes the Cable business and our corporate operations, will continue to allocate its free cash flow generation to reinvestment in its businesses and to return capital to shareholders. NBCUniversal will retain its free cash flow and debt capacity for reinvestment in its businesses and to fund future redemptions by GE. 
While day one integration went smoothly, and we are just beginning to operate these businesses, NBCUniversal starts 2011 with good momentum. We are very excited about the opportunities. And as Marlene mentioned, we'll provide more details and transparency for NBCUniversal and its operating segments with the first quarter results on May 4. 
Please refer to Slide 11. As we review 2010 and begin 2011, we have a consistent financial strategy that is balanced and disciplined. Our first priority remains to profitably invest in the operating and strategic needs of our businesses. And we will continue to deploy capital when it provides attractive risk-adjusted returns, enhances our competitive position and delivers sustainable organic growth. In terms of external investment, we expect our focus to be on execution and on the integration of NBCUniversal. We remain extremely disciplined focusing on opportunities that extend our services and add features that allow us to build new complementary and profitable revenue streams.
In 2010, we returned approximately 42% of our consolidated free cash flow to shareholders or $2.3 billion, including dividend payments totaling $1.1 billion and share repurchases totaling $1.2 billion. With today's announcement, our return of capital is increasing 45% to $3.3 billion during 2011, representing approximately 60% of our last 12 months' free cash flow and approximately 90% of our last 12 months' net income. That incorporates a 19% increase in our planned annual dividend to $0.45 per share and an acceleration by 75% in our share repurchases to $2.1 billion for this year. 
When you combine all these elements together, we feel very good about our financial strength, our current operating momentum and opportunities in 2011. We have a terrific mix of assets, and we're looking forward to executing on the opportunities to build value for our shareholders. 
Now let me turn it over to Marlene for Q&A."

We have a lot of big goals for NBCUniversal. I would start with the fact that 80% of the EBITDA or 80% of the value are the cable channels. The cable channels are in fantastic shape, have been growing double digits. There you just want to make sure that we continue to make the right investments and continue the growth. The biggest opportunity I think over the next few years, and we certainly don't expect to see anything in the next year, but if you go out three, four, or five years, is the NBC network where we have some real strength in NBC News and some real weakness with primetime. And we think we can make progress, and we're doing a variety of things -- putting a variety of things in place to get that progress, but I don't think we're going to see anything for a while. And then, I'm very excited about opportunities like Telemundo. You mentioned international. We think international is a real opportunity, so we think the assets are fantastic. And the real core of the assets, the cable channels, are in great shape.

Regarding Sling, there was a time, five or 10 years ago, where you guys were very excited about VOD. And I think just procuring the content that you wanted maybe at the prices you wanted didn't happen and you ended up pursuing a twin strategy of doing VOD and DVR sort of in tandem. As you sort of navigate the TV Everywhere process, do you think it's possible you'll end up complementing that with the Sling product just because it's sort of easier for the consumer to get everything even if you can't procure the rights? And then for Mr. Smit, ultimately when we're all done with the All-Digital conversion, where do you think the average number of boxes per digital customer settles out? Is it sort of in the 2.8 range?

With regards to leverage, we're at 2.4x. The 60% commitment from free cash flow, when you add on top of that our principal payments, we made $1 billion principal payment last month. We have $750 million due next month, and you look at those two particular payments combined with the increase in the dividend and the buyback, all that adds up to about 90% of our free cash flow. So we'll delever a little bit during 2011, not a whole heck of a lot. But we'll still be right in the middle of where our target is in terms of leverage. So again, I think we are trying to keep a very measured and balanced capital allocation strategy, and we're in this for the long term."

First, we are now reporting our results in 5 segments: Cable Communications, cable networks, broadcast television, filmed entertainment and theme parks. Our revised trending schedule provides quarterly and full year 2010 pro forma results for these 5 segments, as well as pro forma and other consolidated metrics.

This is really an exciting time at Comcast and I'm delighted to report first quarter results that marked a terrific start to 2011. Cable had an outstanding quarter and this is our first opportunity to talk about the whole company, including the results of NBCUniversal. I really feel we've assembled a world-class management team at both Comcast and NBCUniversal and today's results demonstrate the early momentum of our new and dynamic company.
Let me begin with Cable. First quarter results showed continuing strength in 3 key areas: Financial performance, subscriber growth and customer service. Total cable revenue was up by 6% and operating cash flow increased by nearly 8%. Subscriber growth was particularly strong in High-Speed Internet, with 418,000 net additions as we continue to gain market share and to significantly outpace the net additions of our competitors. We're also continuing to put real differentiation between our high-speed service and DSL. In fact, during the quarter, we reinforced this superiority with a new 105 megabits high speed offering that is now available to more than 40 million homes in many of our major markets.
We are also really pleased with our improving video results. In the first quarter, we lost 39,000 video customers which is less than half of last year's first quarter, which continues the trend of improving year-over-year video performance while still facing a larger competitive footprint. Growth in voice services continues to be very consistent with 260,000 customer additions and our Business Services revenues grew by almost 50%. So all in all, financially and in product sales, Cable is doing quite well. Under Neil Smith's focused leadership, we are also executing well and seeing sustainable improvements in our operating performance metrics. Our key network projects, like All Digital and DOCSIS 3.0 and Infinity are almost complete. And these investments, together with our initiatives to transform the customer experience are really coming together to produce results. Our customer retention and service metrics are at the best levels since we've been tracking them, including record low churn levels across each of our products, repeat service calls that are at an all-time low and higher customer satisfaction.
Neil's other big initiative is accelerating innovation where we are leading the industry in delivering new products to our customers not just because we have scale, but because we now have the operational focus and excellence to make the experienced the best in the country.
Just last week, we added the top-rated TV series from ABC and Fox to our already extensive on-demand lineup of more than 600 TV series, making us the only paid TV provider to offer current TV series from all 4 major broadcast networks on demand. This new offering allows our customers to catch up on the most current episode, plus the 3 previous shows for almost all of these TV series anytime on-demand.
It also provides an opportunity for the broadcast networks to reach more consumers through time shifted viewing and to do so through our powerful on-demand service, which has now delivered more than 19 billion total views and generates about 350 million on-demand views a month from our customers.
Now while we've only been operating the NBCUniversal businesses for 3 months, we are encouraged that we've had a seamless integration with no surprises and a strong start to 2011, including some early successes in synergy among the NBCUniversal channels and between NBCUniversal and Comcast. Steve Burke has assembled talented and seasoned management teams across each of the businesses with an overarching goal of investing to build long-term value and making NBCUniversal the premier destination for content creators. The performance in the first quarter was led by the 16 national and 12 regional cable networks, which posted strong growth across the board and continued to drive its profitability. Broadcast, as we expected, continued to face challenges and saw its comparisons impacted by items from the prior year such as political advertising and the Olympics.
Our Film business had heavy marketing spend in the first quarter, ahead of second quarter releases which impacted its year-over-year comparisons. Theme Parks performed extremely well. So overall, we're generally pleased with NBCUniversal's first quarter results.
With this as background, let me give you a sense for how we are looking at these new businesses. Our focus when we announced the transaction and our continuing focus today is on the recurring revenue businesses of the Cable networks which generated more than 100% of NBCUniversal's operating cash flow. So we have begun investing even further in the Cable networks to continue to strengthen their content offerings and their brands. As I mentioned, these channels are performing very well and we believe they will be even better positioned in the future.
With the addition of NBCUniversal, we now have close to a $10 billion advertising business at Comcast. So even though advertising adds some variability, this new scale, along with our mix of local, regional and national advertising, gives us strong momentum now particularly given the strong ad market and should provide us longer-term opportunities to build new business like targeted and interactive advertising.
Film is a business of uneven timing and some hits and misses. Our early releases in 2011 underperformed plan, but so far in the second quarter, they are doing much better. On the Broadcast front, we are working toward a long-term turnaround and we need to be patient. We have a new, energized management team which is off to a great start. I'm optimistic about our prospects, but I'm also realistic and know that it's going to take some time to return NBC to industry level performance.
As I mentioned before, we've had some early successes that validate our belief that we can create real value with our combination of distribution and content businesses. Let me give you some examples.
In film, hop and FAS 5 opened very big following an unprecedented cross marketing push across both NBCUniversal and Comcast. In sports, the golf Channel on NBC and the NHL on NBC and VERSUS have both put up improved ratings powered by what we think as a smart integration and effective marketing campaigns. And in Broadcast, maybe the most exciting event for NBCUniversal this year has occurred in the last 2 weeks with the premier of the Voice on NBC.
In addition to being a critical and ratings success, the Voice demonstrated what can be accomplished when every one of NBC properties and the digital assets and Comcast cable come together to support a program. So as I step back and look across the entire company, I see strong recurring revenue businesses with terrific first quarter results, and opportunities to build on these businesses. Our competitive position in Cable continues to get stronger and we are leading with Xfinity in innovation. This is indeed a great start for 2011 and we are all really focused on maintaining the momentum.
Let me now pass to Michael to cover the first quarter results in greater detail."
173341,129306686,121774,"Comcast Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 04, 2011",2011-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Comcast Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Brian.

Before I begin to review our performance, I want to highlight that this quarter's results are a bit more obligated given the closing of the NBCUniversal transaction on January 28 which means that reported results include only 2 months of the NBCUniversal businesses and include transaction-related costs.
On the Cable side, reported results have also been impacted with the movement of the regional sports networks from Cable to NBCUniversal's Cable networks and Comcast Interactive Media has now moved from corporate and other to Cable. Because of all these ins and outs, we will mainly focus today's presentation on pro forma results, which is how management evaluates the performance of the organization and its segments. We believe that pro forma presentation provides a more meaningful comparison of the operating performance of the businesses, and also includes the effects of acquisition accounting and excludes certain costs and expenses directly related to the transaction. We have provided substantial transparency and detail on these items in our earnings press release and 10-Q. We hope they are helpful explanations and expect subsequent quarters will be less complicated.
So now let me begin by briefly reviewing our consolidated results which are not pro forma and start on Slide 4. Overall, we are very pleased with first quarter results, which reflect the fundamental strength in our Cable business and cable networks. These businesses performed well and are executing quite strongly on our 2011 plans. Our first quarter consolidated revenue, including 2 months of NBCUniversal, increased 32% to $12.1 billion and consolidated operating cash flow grew 14% to $4.1 billion. During the quarter, we incurred $107 million of transaction-related expenses related to the closing of the NBCUniversal transaction. Excluding these nonrecurring costs and $14 million last year's first quarter, our operating cash flow actually grew 16.6% on a normalized basis.
In addition to revenue and operating cash flow, we remain focused on free cash flow, free cash flow per share and earnings per share as important metrics in evaluating the strength of the company. In each of these key metrics, our performance in the first quarter was very strong. Free cash flow for the quarter increased 17.7% to $2.2 billion primarily reflecting higher operating cash flow from Cable and the inclusion of 2 months of NBCUniversal results, partially offset by higher capital expenditures. First quarter free cash flow per share increased 17.9% to $0.79 per share. On a reported basis, we generated earnings per share of $0.34 for the first quarter. However, again, excluding NBCUniversal transaction-related costs, our EPS increased 16.1% to $0.36 per share. Please refer to Table 4 in the press release for more detail on these items.
Please refer to Slide 5. As I mentioned on previous calls, while we manage and consolidate NBCUniversal, we will continue to view Comcast and NBCUniversal as 2 distinct pools of cash flow generation and funding capacity. As you can see on this slide, Comcast, which includes both Cable Communications and Corporate and Other, accounted for $1.8 billion or 80% of total free cash flow. NBCUniversal contributed $437 million in the 2 months since closing. At the end of the first quarter, we have $40.4 billion of debt on our consolidated balance sheet reflecting the addition of the $9.1 billion from NBCUniversal. Our consolidated debt to operating cash flow leverage is now 2.3x, which is within our target range of 2x and to to 2.5x. During the quarter, we issued $1.7 billion of commercial paper in order to partially fund the $6.2 billion payment related to the transaction, retire $1.7 billion of debt maturities and returned $787 million to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. We are executing our 2011 financial plan that we outlined in our last earnings call, including a 19% increase to our dividend and this year's planned completion of our existing share repurchase authorization, which now has $1.6 billion remaining. We continued to maintain the strength of our balance sheet and see it as a strategic asset giving us the ability to profitably invest in the operating and strategic needs of the businesses that enhance our competitive position and deliver sustainable organic growth.
Please refer to Slide 6 for our pro forma results. As I mentioned, we have substantially increased our level of disclosure to reflect the addition of the NBCUniversal businesses into 4 new segments. In addition, within the press release's trending schedules, our Cable Communications product line revenues now reflect only our Residential businesses as Business Services is now presented as a separate line item. For the first quarter, pro forma Cable revenue increased 5.8% and represented 68% of our consolidated revenue, while pro forma operating cash flow grew 7.7% and represented 90% of our consolidated operating cash flow.
NBCUniversal revenue declined 11.5% due to the impact of last year's Olympics, and operating cash flow increased 4.9%. On a consolidated basis, pro forma revenue of $13.3 billion was flat compared to last year's results and consolidated pro forma operating cash flow increased 7.8% to $4.2 billion. However, excluding last year's Olympics, in the NBCUniversal transaction-related costs, first quarter pro forma consolidated revenue increased 6.1% and consolidated pro forma operating cash flow increased 4.2%. As you can see, during the quarter, Cable Communications and Cable Networks generated strong results and drive our overall profitability accounting for 110% of this quarter's total pro forma operating cash flow.
Please refer to Slide 7 to review Cable Communications results. We had another strong quarter of financial and customer growth in Cable. For the first quarter, pro forma Cable Communications revenue increased a healthy 5.8% to $9.1 billion, reflecting growth in our Residential businesses and continued strength in Business Services and cable advertising. We've been effective in managing ARPU while driving customer growth. This quarter, total revenue per video customer increased 9% to $133 per month reflecting an increasing number of customers taking multiple products and a higher contribution from Business Services.
During the quarter, we added 639,000 total video High-Speed Internet and Voice customers equal to an 8.3% increase from last year's first quarter. Similar to the fourth quarter, we showed sequential improvement across all 3 products, including the lowest video customer loss in almost 4 years. As a reminder, we are entering the second quarter which is a seasonally slower period for our businesses due to the number of customers we have in college and vacation areas. However, as you can see in our first quarter results, we are executing well as we're competing better with improved products, and our focus on retention and customer service has helped drive our churn to an all-time low for all of our products.
As we look at the service categories, first quarter Video revenue increased 1.7%, reflecting modest rate adjustments in about 1/3 of our systems, more customers taking high level of digital and advanced services and increased in premium revenue. We now have $10.4 million high-definition and/or DVR customers equal to 52% of our digital customer base. High-Speed Internet revenue increased 8.8% during the quarter, reflecting rate adjustments, continued growth in our customer base and increasing number of customers taking higher speed services. Today, 23% of our residential high speed Internet customers take the higher speed tiers. A High-Speed Internet service is capturing market share and we continue to differentiate our product or service and speed enhancements.
Voice revenue increased 6.5% for the quarter, reflecting steady and continued success of our Triple Play offering. Customers recognize the value of Triple Play, and at the end of the first quarter, 34% of our Video customers took all 3 services compared to 30% at the end of last year's first quarter. As I mentioned, we continue to see real momentum in Business Services with revenue increasing 50% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the and NGT acquisitions which were completed in the first quarter of 2010, Business Services revenue grew 45%. We remain very focused and enthusiastic about this area's growth opportunity.
Cable Advertising continued to perform well, with first quarter revenue increasing 10.4%. This improvement was again led by strength in automotive, offset by lower political revenue. As a reminder, we generated over $180 million of political ad revenue in 2010, including $100 million in the fourth quarter, impacting our sequential growth rate and making comparisons more challenging as the year progresses.
Please refer to Slide 8 to review pro forma Cable Communications operating cash flow. First quarter pro forma Cable Communications operating cash flow increased 7.7% to $3.7 billion, resulting in a margin of 41.3% and 80 basis point improvement compared to last year's first quarter. Total expenses in cable increased 4.6% primarily reflecting higher video programming and marketing expenses, as well as continued investment to expand the capabilities in Business Services. Sales and marketing expenses, which have consistently been around 6% of Cable revenue for the past year, reflect our ongoing investment in the direct and retail channels. In the first quarter, marketing expenses increased 15.7% as the result of higher retail commissions and an increased overall advertising media spend, including Xfinity branding and the launch of the endless fun campaign. We remain focused on expense management and are constantly evaluating our cost structure to gain more efficiencies. In the first quarter, we continued to realize cost improvements in our high speed Internet and voice networks. In addition, bad debt expense was historically low level as we continue to refine our collection and screening processes. Our focus on improving customer service is also driving more efficiencies and improvements in churn and customer satisfaction.
Please refer to Slide 9 to review our Cable Communications capital expenditures. In the first quarter, Cable Communications capital expenditures is tracking to plan and increased 15.4% to $1.1 billion, equal to 11.6% of revenue, reflecting higher investments in CPE, network infrastructure and Business Services. As a reminder, the level of CapEx spend in the first quarter of 2010 was low as we accelerated equipment purchases in the fourth quarter of 2009 to take advantage of favorable tax treatment. In the first quarter of 2011, we deployed another 2.1 million digital adapters for a total of more than 19 million digital adapters since the inception of the all-digital project. We are now 80% complete with all digital, and we expect to complete this project by the end of this year.
During the quarter, we also deployed 848,000 advanced high-definition and/or DVR settops as we added 257,000 advanced service customers and added multiple services to existing customers. As we continue to reinforce our product leadership with High-Speed Internet, we purchased more equipment to enable faster speeds. Our 50 megabit service is now available in more than 45 million homes or almost 90% of our footprint. And as Brian mentioned, we recently launched our extreme 105 megabit service to more than 40 million homes or approximately 80% of our footprint.
First quarter CapEx also reflects meaningful investment to support the continued growth in Business Services and to expand our efforts in midsize businesses. Our investment in Business Services increased 57% to $152 million in the first quarter. We are executing our capital plan well and we continue to expect our full year Cable capital expenditures will be lower as a percentage of Cable revenue when compared to 2010.
Please refer to Slide 10 to review NBCUniversal's cable networks results. In addition to Cable Communications' strong performance, Cable Networks delivered strong growth. In the first quarter, Cable Network revenue increased 13% to $2 billion, driven by strength in advertising which was up 14% and a 13% increase in distribution revenue. First quarter operating cash flow increased 7% to $817 million as we are reinvesting some of this top line growth into new programming that further strengthens these franchises. We have the opportunity to further improve and grow these networks by strengthening their programming and increasing brand awareness, and our operating cash flow growth and margin reflect some of these investments.
This quarter's results reflect growth in both our established and emerging channels and we're making terrific progress in integrating this historical Comcast network into NBCUniversal. USA continues to lead basic cable networks in key demos on a success of its original programming. Also, we are seeing positive momentum at, both of which had their highest rated quarter ever. During the quarter, we also saw particular strength at our regional sports networks.
Please refer to Slide 11 to review Broadcast results. Broadcast television revenue declined 35% to $1.4 billion this quarter, reflecting the inclusion of $782 million of revenue from the Vancouver Olympics in last year's results. Excluding the Olympics impact, Broadcast revenue increased 4%, reflecting continued strength in advertising pricing. Broadcast operating cash flow improved $202 million to $20 million this quarter, again reflecting the absence of $223 million of losses related to last year's Olympics. Excluding these Olympic losses, Broadcast operating cash flow declined $21 million this quarter as a result of increased investment in programming, particularly NBC's primetime lineup compared to a light original programming schedule in the first quarter of 2010.
As Brian mentioned, we are focused on this challenge and we'll continue to invest in the NBC Broadcast network, a process that started in 2010 in order to build a solid foundation for growth. We are also investing in the NBC local stations to increase and improve our local news capabilities. This focused effort is not a quick fix. We believe this is an important opportunity for us and we will make operational and financial progress, but the results will take some time.
Please refer to Slide 12. Filmed entertainment revenue declined 8% to $975 million this quarter, driven by lower theatrical and home entertainment revenue as the result of the softer box office performance of this quarter's new releases and fewer titles released in DVD compared to last year's first quarter. This was partially offset by higher content licensing revenue from the pay and free TV Windows. Film operating cash flow declined $134 million to a loss of $146 million this quarter due to the revenue decline in substantial marketing spend for second quarter theatrical releases, including Hopp and FAS 5 which were released in April. We are well aware of the challenges and volatility of this segment and are focused on improving performance.
As we switch to Theme Parks, both Orlando and Hollywood parks are performing very well and revenue increased 16% to $95 million and operating cash flow increased to $41 million, reflecting strong attendance in per capita spending at both parks, which are benefiting from the success of newly launched attractions particularly the wizard and world of Harry Potter in Orlando and King Kong in Hollywood. Please note that the equity income from the Orlando joint venture is included in Themepark operating cash flow, was a significant driver of this quarter's increase in operating cash flow. However, the Orlando equity income is eliminated in NBCUniversal headquarters other and elimination lines as it included in the equity income for our consolidated reporting purposes.
So as we review the performance of the first quarter of 2011, we feel very good about our operating momentum and focus on execution. Our Cable Communications and Cable Networks businesses continue to perform well and deliver strong operational and financial results. We have a terrific mix of assets and we are looking forward to executing on the opportunities ahead to deliver long-term sustainable growth and build value for our shareholders.

So our service calls were down, our repeats were down and that's taking on unnecessary noise out of the system. I think third would be our retention focused. Our churn was at all-time lows and I think that's due to a number of things. First, we formed a specific retention channel focus. We formed centers of excellence for retention calls and we're doing better on the promotional rolloff. I think we're doing better marketing. Our endless fun campaign saw a double-digit increases and the intent to purchase, so we are really marketing better and we're targeting our marketing better. So I think it's due to all those factors.

We also have some other minor investments for a total of about $200 million in increased primetime investment if you look year-over-year. The real key to turning around NBC is not necessarily the increase in investment. The real key is making better shows. We are making about the same amount of pilots as last year, 21, which is up from 2 or 3 years ago, but about the same as last year. And it's really a matter of doing better, and then of course, there is $200 million more of investment largely due to having a full year of n10 o'clock shows as opposed to the Jay Leno Show at 10. On the Cable side, I think we are going to be investing about $100 million more this year on new shows and the way those new shows, the way the account it works on those new shows is those new shows are negative in the year that they launched and if they're good shows, they tend to be quite positive in subsequent years.

Brian mentioned in his introduction, we have 16 national cable channels and a 12 regional sports networks, and these are fantastic properties. And we've said this before, what we really bought when we did the deal for NBC universal was a bunch of very, very well run, very strong cable channel so I think priority number 1 is to make sure that those channels continue to get the investment they need and continue to grow at the kind of high growth rates they have been and I really want to highlight how great we feel about those channels now that we are inside the building as it were. Second big priority, we think the Broadcast business has tremendous upside for this company. We are underperforming relative to the under other 3 of the big 4 dramatically, many hundreds of millions of dollars worse than the other 3, both on the network side and the broadcast station side. And we look at that as a tremendous opportunity. You want to always sort of soften that optimism by the realization that it is a very tough business to turn around and I think it is likely to take us a number of years to turn it around. But when we do, going from fourth to third, would be hundreds of millions of dollars of swing, positive swing in terms of EBITDA, so that is obviously a very high priority. We're going out to see Bob Greenblatt's first bunch of pilots. Brian mentioned the Voice which I think -- we've been very fortunate the last 2 weeks. We have a big building block that we can put in place and build on with some other pilots. But we're very optimistic but tempered by the acknowledgment that it's going to be a multi-year process but what we think it's a big opportunity. I haven't even mentioned retransmission consent and some of the other things that are on the horizon there. We also have a variety and opportunities and sort of priority investment areas and other parts of the business. Telemundo is we think a real opportunity area. International,  you mentioned, Jessica, digital. Just the year expense of properties we have and the ability to get those properties moving more quickly than they have been, we think is a real opportunity. And then finally, having the company work together as 1 unit. We have a saying that we are better together and what really trying to do is make sure that when we have significant priorities like the Voice or a movie like hop that the entire company gets behind it both the NBCUniversal side and very importantly, the Comcast side. And that's having all sorts of activities that really focus people in what is otherwise a very fragmented universe on one or 2 things and we think that's going to be a big key to our success in the future."

And in terms of the upfront, I think most people that you talked to who studied the business would say that they feel both on the Broadcast and the Cable side, it is going to very a strong upfront, we're in an extremely strong scatter market and the pattern I think is very similar to what you see at this point when the economy comes out of a tough recession, which I think should bode well for the upfront both on the Broadcast and the Cable side. Interestingly, when we did all of our projections for NBCuniversal, we assumed an advertising market that would be much lower than it was in 2010 and 2011 and looks like it will be in 2012. So I think our timing in terms of where the advertising market was quite fortuitous."

Again, in the future, we may talk a little bit more about the, but these are relatively small business. With regards to Universal Orlando, just to level set, I think everyone knows that we have a 50-50 joint venture with Blackstone. Blackstone's been in that transaction for a number of times and have exercised a trigger. We haven't made any decisions at all. We will make a decision probably in another month or so. The businesses is well managed, it's growing nicely as you can see from the numbers. And I just want to make sure folks are aware of that. When we do make a decision strategically, it'll be the right one for us, and financially, it will be attractive. So I will just say stay tuned on that. With regards to cash taxes, we will benefit substantially on cash taxes this year due to the bonus depreciation. You will start to see some of that in the next quarter and through the rest of the year. Cash taxes doesn't play a role in the first quarter, but it will in the second, third and fourth quarter, so there will be quite a meaningful benefit in 2011 related to bonus depreciation."

We've got a lot on our plate. You can't look at any one business and not have a very financially disciplined approach to anything you do there. So I think that we are very much have a plan for 2011 and beyond. And we want to go out and execute it. Regarding Netflix and other OBD business models, I defer to them to talk about their companies. I think we should focus on what we are doing. We have a fantastic High-Speed Data business. I just want to underscore, it hasn't really come up in the questions. In my opinion, a lot of discussion on the video side of business and a great quarter there. But for me to have more than 100% net add growth rate in the first quarter versus first quarter last year tells you something very exciting is happening in that space. And I think the team is doing a great job with the Xfinity high speed data service period I think also presents business opportunities for us on the NBC side and the NBC universal side in terms of repurposing existing content. At the same time, we've been able to stretch our on-demand library by having catch-up which I think is a breakthrough kind of product where you know as a viewer, part of it is trying to create a sense of expectation that if there's a top show on television starting the next day, you can get it on demand and you can catch up if it's a new show, you discover you get all 4 episodes that are most current. So a lot of progress and I think by having the mix of assets we have, we're in a wonderful position to benefit as the world changes in some of that change won't always be great for one piece of the company, but overall, in the totality of the Comcast shareholders, I think we're extremely well-positioned as the world continues to evolve."

So the negative number in this quarter was primarily driven by that. But we did have some softness in the slate before we hit pop and FAS 5 which obviously is a big hit. We are well aware of the challenges in the Film business and the fact that the DVD business has declined and that's responsible for part of our fault part but part of it is we need to make a real area for us as well. In terms of cost synergies, there's a lot of ins and outs and there have been some minor areas of overlap where we've eliminated some positions.

This is really an exciting time at Comcast, and I'm delighted to report first quarter results that mark a terrific start to 2011. Cable had an outstanding quarter, and this is our first opportunity to talk about the whole company, including the results of NBCUniversal. I really feel we've assembled a world-class management team at both Comcast and NBCUniversal, and today's results demonstrate the early momentum of our new and dynamic company.
Let me begin with Cable. First quarter results show continuing strength in 3 key areas: financial performance, subscriber growth and customer service. Total Cable revenue was up by 6%, and operating cash flow increased by nearly 8%. Subscriber growth was particularly strong in High-Speed Internet, with 418,000 net additions, as we continue to gain market share, and to significantly outpace the net additions of our competitors. We're also continuing to put real differentiation between our high-speed service and DSL. In fact, during the quarter, we reinforced this superiority with a new 105 megabits high speed offering that is now available to more than 40 million homes in many of our major markets.
We're also really pleased with our improving video results. In the first quarter, we lost 39,000 video customers, which is less than half of last year's first quarter, which continues the trend of improving year-over-year video performance, while still facing a larger competitive footprint. Growth in Voice Services continues to be very consistent with 260,000 customer additions, and our Business Services revenues grew by almost 50%. So all in all, financially and in product sales, Cable is doing quite well. Under Neil Smit's focused leadership, we are also executing well, and seeing sustainable improvements in our operating performance metrics. Our key network projects, like All-Digital and DOCSIS 3.0 and Infinity are almost complete. And these investments, together with our initiatives to transform the customer experience, are really coming together to produce results. Our customer retention and service metrics are at the best levels since we've been tracking them, including record-low churn levels across each of our products, repeat service calls that are at all-time low and higher customer satisfaction.
Neil's other big initiative is accelerating, where we are leading the industry in delivering new products to our customers, not just because we have scale, but because we now have the operational focus and excellence to make the XFINITY experience the best in the country.
Just last week, we added the top-rated TV series from ABC and Fox to our already extensive on-demand lineup of more than 600 TV series, making us the only-paid TV provider to offer current TV series from all 4 major broadcast networks on demand. This new offering allows our customers to catch up on the most current episode, plus the 3 previous shows for almost all of these TV series anytime On Demand. It also provides an opportunity for the broadcast networks to reach more consumers through time-shifted viewing, and to do so through our powerful On Demand service, which has now delivered more than 19 billion total views, and generates about 350 million On Demand views a month from our customers.
Now while we've only been operating the NBCUniversal businesses for 3 months, we're encouraged that we've had a seamless integration with no surprises and a strong start to 2011, including some early successes in synergy among the NBCUniversal channels, and between NBCUniversal and Comcast. Steve Burke has assembled talented and seasoned management teams across each of the businesses, with an overarching goal of investing to build long-term value, and making NBCUniversal the premier destination for content creators. The performance in the first quarter was led by the 16 national and 12 regional Cable Networks, which posted strong growth across the board, and continued to drive its profitability. Broadcast, as we expected, continued to face challenges, and saw its comparisons impacted by items from the prior year such as political advertising and the Olympics.  Our Film business had heavy marketing spend in the first quarter, ahead of second quarter releases, which impacted its year-over-year comparisons. Theme Parks performed extremely well. So overall, we're generally pleased with NBCUniversal's first quarter results.
With this as background, let me give you a sense for how we're looking at these new businesses. Our focus when we announced the transaction and our continuing focus today is on the recurring revenue businesses of the Cable networks, which generated more than 100% of NBCUniversal's operating cash flow. So we have begun investing even further in the Cable networks to continue to strengthen their content offerings and their brands. As I mentioned, these channels are performing very well, and we believe they will be even better positioned in the future.  With the addition of NBCUniversal, we now have close to a $10 billion advertising business at Comcast. So even though advertising adds some variability, this new scale, along with our mix of local, regional and national advertising, gives us strong momentum now, particularly, given the strong ad market, and should provide us longer-term opportunities to build new business like targeted and interactive advertising.
Film is a business of uneven timing, and some hits and misses. Our early releases in 2011 underperformed plan, but so far in the second quarter, they're doing much better. On the Broadcast front, we are working toward a long-term turnaround and we need to be patient. We have a new, energized management team, which is off to a great start. I'm optimistic about our prospects, but I'm also realistic, and know that it's going to take some time to return NBC to industry-level performance.  
As I mentioned before, we've had some early successes that validate our belief that we can create real value with our combination of distribution and content businesses. Let me give you some examples.  In film, Hop and Fast Five opened very big, following an unprecedented cross-marketing push across both NBCUniversal and Comcast. In sports, the Golf Channel on NBC and the NHL on NBC and Versus have both put up improved ratings, powered by what we think as a smart integration and effective marketing campaigns. And in Broadcast, maybe the most exciting event for NBCUniversal this year has occurred in the last 2 weeks with the premier of The Voice on NBC.  In addition to being a critical and ratings success, The Voice demonstrated what can be accomplished when every one of NBC properties and the digital assets and Comcast Cable come together to support a program. So as I step back and look across the entire company, I see strong recurring revenue businesses with terrific first quarter results, and opportunities to build on these businesses. Our competitive position in Cable continues to get stronger, and we are leading with XFINITY in innovation. This is indeed a great start for 2011, and we are all really focused on maintaining the momentum.
Let me now pass to Michael to cover the first quarter results in greater detail."
173341,129306686,121986,"Comcast Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 04, 2011",2011-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Comcast Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Brian. Before I begin to review our performance, I want to highlight that this quarter's results are a bit more complicated, given the closing of the NBCUniversal transaction on January 28, which means that reported results include only 2 month",2588,"Thank you, Brian. Before I begin to review our performance, I want to highlight that this quarter's results are a bit more complicated, given the closing of the NBCUniversal transaction on January 28, which means that reported results include only 2 months of the NBCUniversal businesses, and include transaction-related costs.
On the Cable side, reported results have also been impacted with the movement of the regional sports networks from Cable to NBCUniversal's Cable networks, and Comcast Interactive Media has now moved from Corporate and Other to Cable. Because of all these ins and outs, we will mainly focus today's presentation on pro forma results, which is how management evaluates the performance of the organization and its segments. We believe that pro forma presentation provides a more meaningful comparison of the operating performance of the businesses, and also includes the effects of acquisition accounting, and excludes certain costs and expenses directly related to the transaction. We have provided substantial transparency in detail on these items in our earnings press release and 10-Q. We hope they are helpful explanations, and expect subsequent quarters will be less complicated.
So now let me begin by briefly reviewing our consolidated results, which are not pro forma and start on Slide 4. Overall, we are very pleased with first quarter results, which reflect the fundamental strength in our Cable business and Cable Networks. These businesses performed well, and are executing quite strongly on our 2011 plans. Our first quarter consolidated revenue, including 2 months of NBCUniversal, increased 32% to $12.1 billion, and consolidated operating cash flow grew 14% to $4.1 billion. During the quarter, we incurred $107 million of transaction-related expenses related to the closing of the NBCUniversal transaction. Excluding these non-recurring costs in $14 million in last year's first quarter, our operating cash flow actually grew 16.6% on a normalized basis.
In addition to revenue and operating cash flow, we remain focused on free cash flow, free cash flow per share and earnings per share as important metrics in evaluating the strength of the company. In each of these key metrics, our performance in the first quarter was very strong. Free cash flow for the quarter increased 17.7% to $2.2 billion, primarily reflecting higher operating cash flow from Cable, and the inclusion of 2 months of NBCUniversal results, partially offset by higher capital expenditures. First quarter free cash flow per share increased 17.9% to $0.79 per share.  On a reported basis, we generated earnings per share of $0.34 for the first quarter. However, again, excluding NBCUniversal transaction-related costs, our EPS increased 16.1% to $0.36 per share. Please refer to Table 4 in the press release for more detail on these items.
Please refer to Slide 5. As I mentioned on previous calls, while we manage and consolidate NBCUniversal, we will continue to view Comcast and NBCUniversal as 2 distinct pools of cash flow generation and funding capacity. As you can see on this slide, Comcast, which includes both Cable Communications and Corporate and Other, accounted for $1.8 billion or 80% of total free cash flow, and NBCUniversal contributed $437 million in the 2 months since closing. At the end of the first quarter, we have $40.4 billion of debt on our consolidated balance sheet, reflecting the addition of the $9.1 billion from NBCUniversal. Our consolidated debt to operating cash flow leverage is now 2.3x, which is within our target range of 2x and to 2.5x. During the quarter, we issued $1.7 billion of commercial paper in order to partially fund the $6.2 billion payment related to the transaction, retired $1.7 billion of debt maturities, and returned $787 million to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. 
We are executing our 2011 financial plan that we outlined in our last earnings call, including a 19% increase to our dividend in this year's planned completion of our existing share repurchase authorization, which now has $1.6 billion remaining. We continue to maintain the strength of our balance sheet, and see it as a strategic asset, giving us the ability to profitably invest in the operating and strategic needs of the businesses that enhance our competitive position and deliver sustainable organic growth.
Please refer to Slide 6 for our pro forma results. As I mentioned, we have substantially increased our level of disclosure to reflect the addition of the NBCUniversal businesses into 4 new segments. In addition, within the press release's trending schedules, our Cable Communications product line revenues now reflect only our Residential businesses, as Business Services is now presented as a separate line item. For the first quarter, pro forma Cable revenue increased 5.8%, and represented 68% of our consolidated revenue, while pro forma operating cash flow grew 7.7%, and represented 90% of our consolidated operating cash flow.
NBCUniversal revenue declined 11.5% due to the impact of last year's Olympics, and operating cash flow increased 4.9%. On a consolidated basis, pro forma revenue of $13.3 billion was flat compared to last year's results, and consolidated pro forma operating cash flow increased 7.8% to $4.2 billion. However, excluding last year's Olympics, in the NBCUniversal transaction-related costs, first quarter pro forma consolidated revenue increased 6.1%, and consolidated pro forma operating cash flow increased 4.2%. As you can see, during the quarter, Cable Communications and Cable Networks generated strong results and drive our overall profitability, accounting for 110% of this quarter's total pro forma operating cash flow.
Please refer to Slide 7 to review Cable Communications results. We had another strong quarter of financial and customer growth in Cable. For the first quarter, pro forma Cable Communications revenue increased a healthy 5.8% to $9.1 billion, reflecting growth in our Residential businesses, and continued strength in Business Services and Cable advertising. We've been effective in managing ARPU while driving customer growth. This quarter, total revenue per video customer increased 9% to $133 per month, reflecting an increasing number of customers taking multiple products, and a higher contribution from Business Services.
During the quarter, we added 639,000 total Video, High-Speed Internet and Voice customers equal to an 8.3% increase from last year's first quarter. Similar to the fourth quarter, we showed sequential improvement across all 3 products, including the lowest Video customer loss in almost 4 years. As a reminder, we are entering the second quarter, which is a seasonally slower period for our businesses due to the number of customers we have in college and vacation areas. However, as you can see in our first quarter results, we are executing well as we're competing better with improved products, and our focus on retention and customer service has helped drive our churn to an all-time low for all of our products.
As we look at the Service categories, first quarter Video revenue increased 1.7%, reflecting modest rate adjustments in about 1/3 of our systems, more customers taking higher level of digital and advanced services, and an increase in premium revenue. We now have $10.4 million high-definition and/or DVR customers equal to 52% of our Digital customer base. High-Speed Internet revenue increased 8.8% during the quarter, reflecting rate adjustments, continued growth in our customer base, and an increasing number of customers taking higher speed services. Today, 23% of our residential High-Speed Internet customers take the higher speed tiers. Our High-Speed Internet service is capturing market share, and we continue to differentiate our products through service and speed enhancements.
Voice revenue increased 6.5% for the quarter, reflecting steady and continued success with our Triple Play offering. Customers recognize the value of Triple Play, and at the end of the first quarter, 34% of our Video customers took all 3 services compared to 30% at the end of last year's first quarter. As I mentioned, we continue to see real momentum in Business Services, with revenue increasing 50% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the Cimco and NGT [New Global Telecom] acquisitions, which were completed in the first quarter of 2010, Business Services revenue grew 45%. We remain very focused and enthusiastic about this area's growth opportunity.
Cable Advertising continued to perform well, with first quarter revenue increasing 10.4%. This improvement was again led by strength in Automotive, offset by lower Political revenue. As a reminder, we generated over $180 million of Political Ad [Advertising] revenue in 2010, including $100 million in the fourth quarter, impacting our sequential growth rate, and making comparisons more challenging as the year progresses.
Please refer to Slide 8 to review pro forma Cable Communications operating cash flow. First quarter pro forma Cable Communications operating cash flow increased 7.7% to $3.7 billion, resulting in a margin of 41.3%, and 80 basis point improvement compared to last year's first quarter. Total expenses in Cable increased 4.6%, primarily reflecting higher Video programming and marketing expenses, as well as continued investment to expand the capabilities in Business Services. Sales and marketing expenses, which have consistently been around 6% of Cable revenue for the past year, reflect our ongoing investment in the direct and retail channels. 
In the first quarter, marketing expenses increased 15.7% as a result of higher retail commissions and an increased overall Advertising and media spend, including XFINITY branding in the launch of the Endless Fun campaign. We remain very focused on expense management, and are constantly evaluating our cost structure to gain more efficiencies. In the first quarter, we continued to realize cost improvements in our High-Speed Internet and Voice networks. In addition, bad debt expense was at historically low level as we continued to refine our collection and screening processes. Our focus on improving customer service is also driving more efficiencies and improvements in churn and customer satisfaction.
Please refer to Slide 9 to review our Cable Communications capital expenditures. In the first quarter, Cable Communications capital expenditures is tracking to plan, and increased 15.4% to $1.1 billion, equal to 11.6% of revenue, reflecting higher investments in CPE, network infrastructure and Business Services. As a reminder, the level of CapEx spend in the first quarter of 2010 was low, as we accelerated equipment purchases in the fourth quarter of 2009 to take advantage of favorable tax treatment. In the first quarter of 2011, we deployed another 2.1 million digital adapters for a total of more than 19 million digital adapters since the inception of the all-digital project. We are now 80% complete with All-Digital, and we expect to complete this project by the end of this year.
During the quarter, we also deployed 848,000 advanced high-definition and/or DVR set-tops, as we added 257,000 advanced Service customers, and added multiple services to existing customers. As we continue to reinforce our product leadership with High-Speed Internet, we purchased more equipment to enable faster speeds. Our 50-megabit service is now available in more than 45 million homes, or almost 90% of our footprint. And as Brian mentioned, we recently launched our extreme 105-megabit service to more than 40 million homes or approximately 80% of our footprint.
First quarter CapEx also reflects meaningful investment to support the continued growth in Business Services, and to expand our efforts in mid-sized businesses. Our investment in Business Services increased 57% to $152 million in the first quarter. We are executing our capital plan well, and we continue to expect our full-year Cable capital expenditures will be lower as a percentage of Cable revenue when compared to 2010.
Please refer to Slide 10 to review NBCUniversal's Cable Networks results. In addition to Cable Communications' strong performance, Cable Networks delivered strong growth. In the first quarter, Cable Network revenue increased 13% to $2 billion, driven by strength in advertising, which was up 14%, and a 13% increase in distribution revenue. First quarter operating cash flow increased 7% to $817 million, as we are reinvesting some of this top line growth into new programming that further strengthens these franchises. We have the opportunity to further improve and grow these networks by strengthening their programming and increasing brand awareness, and our operating cash flow growth and margin reflect some of these investments.
This quarter's results reflect growth in both our established and emerging channels, and we're making terrific progress in integrating this historical Comcast networks into NBCUniversal. USA continues to lead basic Cable Networks in key demos on the success of its original programming. Also, we are seeing positive momentum at E and Bravo, both of which had their highest-rated quarters ever. During the quarter, we also saw particular strength at our regional sports networks.
Please refer to Slide 11 to review Broadcast results. Broadcast Television revenue declined 35% to $1.4 billion this quarter, reflecting the inclusion of $782 million of revenue from the Vancouver Olympics in last year's results. Excluding the Olympics impact, Broadcast revenue increased 4%, reflecting continued strength in advertising pricing. Broadcast operating cash flow improved $202 million to $20 million this quarter, again reflecting the absence of $223 million of losses related to last year's Olympics. Excluding these Olympic losses, Broadcast operating cash flow declined $21 million this quarter as a result of increased investment in programming, particularly NBC's prime time lineup compared to a light original programming schedule in the first quarter of 2010.
As Brian mentioned, we are focused on this challenge, and we'll continue to invest in the NBC Broadcast network, a process that started in 2010 in order to build a solid foundation for growth. We are also investing in the NBC local stations to increase and improve our local news capabilities. This focused effort is not a quick fix. We believe this is an important opportunity for us, and we will make operational and financial progress, but the results will take some time.
Please refer to Slide 12. Filmed Entertainment revenue declined 8% to $975 million this quarter, driven by lower theatrical and home entertainment revenue, as a result of the softer box office performance of this quarter's new releases, and fewer titles released in DVD compared to last year's first quarter. This was partially offset by higher content licensing revenue from the pay and free TV windows. Film operating cash flow declined $134 million to a loss of $146 million this quarter due to the revenue decline in substantial marketing spend for second quarter theatrical releases, including Hop and FAST FIVE, which were released in April. We are well aware of the challenges and volatilities of this segment, and are focused on improving performance.
As we switch to Theme Parks, both Orlando and Hollywood parks are performing very well, and revenue increased 16% to $95 million, and operating cash flow increased to $41 million, reflecting strong attendance in per capita spending at both parks, which are benefiting from the success of newly launched attractions, particularly the Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Orlando, and King Kong in Hollywood. Please note that the equity income from the Orlando joint venture is included in Theme Park operating cash flow. It was a significant driver of this quarter's increase in operating cash flow. However, the Orlando equity income is eliminated in NBCUniversal headquarters' other and elimination line, as it included in the equity income for our consolidated reporting purposes.
So as we review the performance of the first quarter of 2011, we feel very good about our operating momentum and focus on execution. Our Cable Communications and Cable Networks businesses continue to perform well and deliver strong operational and financial results. We have a terrific mix of assets, and we're looking forward to executing on the opportunities ahead to deliver long-term sustainable growth, and build value for our shareholders.

Is that a function of churn continuing to come down, or better gross adds? And do you think we can get to a situation where we begin to grow the Video base again? And then switching over to NBC, it seems you mentioned it a couple of times in the slides that there's higher spending going on to improve prime time and maybe the profitability of the Cable Network. One, is this a level that we should expect in terms of spending to improve things going forward and/or do you expect to spend more than you're doing now overtime to catch up for your peers?

We're really focusing on getting it right the first time, and getting higher reliability of our service. So our service calls were down. Our repeats were down, and that's taking unnecessary noise out of a system. I think third would be our retention focus. Our churn was at all-time lows, and I think that's due to a number of things. First, we formed a specific retention channel focus. We formed centers of excellence for retention calls, and we're doing better on the promotional roll off. I think we're doing better marketing. Our Endless Fun campaign saw a double-digit increases and the intent to purchase, so we're really marketing better, and we're targeting our marketing better. So I think it's due to all those factors. What really drove the total numbers was more retention than it was growth adds, and I think that's healthy for the business both from a sub-perspective and a financial perspective. Steve?"

This year, with the full year of 10 o'clock shows, you've got an investment there. We also have some other minor investments for a total of about $200 million in increased prime time investment if you look year-over-year. The real key to turning around NBC is not necessarily the increase in investment. The real key is making better shows. We're making about the same amount of pilots as last year, 21, which is up from 2 or 3 years ago, but about the same as last year. And it's really a matter of doing better and then of course, there is $200 million more of investment largely due to having a full year of 10 o'clock shows as opposed to the Jay Leno Show at 10. On the Cable side, I think we're going to be investing about $100 million more this year on new shows, and the way those new shows, the way the accounting works on those new shows is those new shows are negative in the year that they launched. And if they're good shows, they tend to be quite positive in subsequent years. So on the Broadcast side, about $200 million. On the Cable side, about $100 million."

We've got the sales force in place. We've got the operational aspect of it improving. We're trying to reduce the install times, and the PRI is beginning to sell very nicely.

With regards to churn, we generally don't disclose churn. I can tell you though, some of the steps we've taken on churn, which I mentioned previously, but we've improved our credit screening, and we've got much more focused credit screening, a mix of both our financial and our marketing teams have really come up with a very methodical way of doing that, and we're focusing more on how we handle every call and every promotional roll off.

Brian mentioned in his introduction, we have 16 national Cable channels and a 12 regional sports networks, and these are fantastic properties. And we've said this before, what we really bought when we did the deal for NBC universal was a bunch of very, very well run, very strong Cable channel. So I think priority number one is to make sure that those channels continue to get the investment they need, and continue to grow at the kind of high growth rates they have been, and I really want to highlight how great we feel about those channels now that we're inside the building as it were. Second big priority, we think the Broadcast business has tremendous upside for this company. We are underperforming relative to the other 3 of the big 4. Dramatically, many hundreds of millions of dollars worse than the other 3, both on the Network side and the Broadcast station side. And we look at that as a tremendous opportunity. You want to always sort of soften that optimism by the realization that it is a very tough business to turn around, and I think it is likely to take us a number of years to turn it around. But when we do, going from fourth to third, would be hundreds of millions of dollars of swing, positive swing in terms of EBITDA. So that is obviously a very high priority. We're going out to see Bob Greenblatt's first bunch of pilots. Brian mentioned the Voice, which I think we've been very fortunate the last 2 weeks. We may have a big building block that we can put in place and build on with some other pilots. But we're very optimistic, but tempered by the acknowledgment that it's going to be a multi-year process, but what we think it's a big opportunity. I haven't even mentioned retransmission consent and some of the other things that are on the horizon there. We also have a variety of opportunities and sort of priority investment areas in other parts of the business. Telemundo, we think, is a real opportunity area, internationally, you mentioned, Jessica, Digital. Just the year expense of properties that we have, and the ability to get those properties moving more quickly than they have been, we think is a real opportunity. And then finally, having the company work together as one unit. We have a saying that we're better together, and what we're really trying to do is make sure that when we have significant priorities like the Voice or a movie like Hop, that the entire company gets behind it, both the NBCUniversal side and very importantly, the Comcast side. And that's having all sorts of activities that really focus people in what is otherwise a very fragmented universe on one or 2 things, and we think that's going to be a big key to our success in the future."

And secondly, in NBCU, can you talk a bit about how, you said, strategically complete, but in terms of thoughts on acquisitions, how you look at other potential assets that might be in the marketplace, and how you decide whether or not those fit with the portfolio?"

The trends seemed to be fairly similar to what they've been in the previous quarters, but we continue to monitor that closely and hope for an uptick there. Brian?"

Again, in the future, we may talk a little bit more about it, but these are relatively small businesses. With regards to Universal Orlando, just to level set, I think everyone knows that we have a 50-50 joint venture with Blackstone. Blackstone's been in that transaction for a number of times, and have exercised a trigger. We haven't made any decisions at all. We will make a decision probably in another month or so. The businesses is well managed. It's growing nicely, as you can see from the numbers. But I just want to make sure folks are aware of that. When we do make a decision, strategically, it'll be the right one for us. And financially, it will be attractive. So I would just say stay tuned on that. With regards to cash taxes, we will benefit substantially on cash taxes this year due to the bonus depreciation. You'll start to see some of that in the next quarter and through the rest of the year. Cash taxes doesn't play a role in the first quarter, but it will in the second, third and fourth quarter. So there will be quite a meaningful benefit in 2011 related to bonus depreciation."

And we want to go out and execute it. Regarding Netflix and other OVD business models, I defer to them to talk about their companies. I think we should focus on what we're doing. We have a fantastic High-Speed Data business. I just want to underscore, it hasn't really come up on the questions. In my opinion, a lot of discussion on the Video side of business and a great quarter there. But for me, to have more than 100% net add growth rate in the first quarter versus the first quarter last year tells you something very exciting is happening in that space. And I think the team is doing a great job with the XFINITY High-Speed Data service. And I think it also presents business opportunities for us on the NBC side and the NBC universal side in terms of re-purposing existing content. At the same time, we've been able to stretch our On Demand library by having catch-up, which I think, is a breakthrough kind of product where you'll know who's the viewer. And part of it is trying to create a sense of expectation that if there's a top show on television starting the next day, you can get it On Demand, and you can catch up if it's a new show, you discover you get all the 4 episodes that are most current. So a lot of progress, and I think by having the mix of assets we have, we're in a wonderful position to benefit as the world changes, and some of that change won't always be great for one piece of the company, but overall, in the totality of the Comcast shareholders, I think we're extremely well-positioned as the world continues to evolve."

Some quarters will be slightly higher than others as we launch our new shows. As it relates to the Film business, we think the size of the slate is about right. This quarter actually was more negatively affected by the fact that we launched a bunch of big films at the end of the quarter and in April, most notably, Hop and FAST FIVE. So the negative number in this quarter was primarily driven by that. But we did have some softness in the slate before we hit Hop and FAST FIVE, which obviously is a big hit. We're well aware of the challenges in the Film business, and the fact that the DVD business has declined. And that's responsible for -- part of our fault, but part of it is we need to make better films and that's a real area of focus for us as well.

This is really an exciting time at Comcast, and I'm delighted to report first quarter results that mark a terrific start to 2011. Cable had an outstanding quarter, and this is our first opportunity to talk abou",1161,"Thanks, Marlene, and good morning, everyone. This is really an exciting time at Comcast, and I'm delighted to report first quarter results that mark a terrific start to 2011. Cable had an outstanding quarter, and this is our first opportunity to talk about the whole company, including the results of NBCUniversal. I really feel we've assembled a world-class management team at both Comcast and NBCUniversal, and today's results demonstrate the early momentum of our new and dynamic company.
Let me begin with Cable. First quarter results show continuing strength in three key areas: financial performance, subscriber growth and customer service. Total Cable revenue was up by 6%, and operating cash flow increased by nearly 8%. Subscriber growth was particularly strong in High-Speed Internet, with 418,000 net additions, as we continue to gain market share, and to significantly outpace the net additions of our competitors. We're also continuing to put real differentiation between our high-speed service and DSL. In fact, during the quarter, we reinforced this superiority with a new 105 megabits high speed offering that is now available to more than 40 million homes in many of our major markets.
We're also really pleased with our improving video results. In the first quarter, we lost 39,000 video customers, which is less than half of last year's first quarter, which continues the trend of improving year-over-year video performance, while still facing a larger competitive footprint. Growth in Voice Services continues to be very consistent with 260,000 customer additions, and our Business Services revenues grew by almost 50%. So all in all, financially and in product sales, Cable is doing quite well. Under Neil Smit's focused leadership, we are also executing well, and seeing sustainable improvements in our operating performance metrics. Our key network projects, like All-Digital and DOCSIS 3.0 and Infinity are almost complete. And these investments, together with our initiatives to transform the customer experience, are really coming together to produce results. Our customer retention and service metrics are at the best levels since we've been tracking them, including record-low churn levels across each of our products, repeat service calls that are at all-time low and higher customer satisfaction.
Neil's other big initiative is accelerating, where we are leading the industry in delivering new products to our customers, not just because we have scale, but because we now have the operational focus and excellence to make the XFINITY experience the best in the country.
Just last week, we added the top-rated TV series from ABC and Fox to our already extensive on-demand lineup of more than 600 TV series, making us the only-paid TV provider to offer current TV series from all four major broadcast networks on demand. This new offering allows our customers to catch up on the most current episode, plus the three previous shows for almost all of these TV series anytime On Demand. It also provides an opportunity for the broadcast networks to reach more consumers through time-shifted viewing, and to do so through our powerful On Demand service, which has now delivered more than 19 billion total views, and generates about 350 million On Demand views a month from our customers.
Now while we've only been operating the NBCUniversal businesses for three months, we're encouraged that we've had a seamless integration with no surprises and a strong start to 2011, including some early successes in synergy among the NBCUniversal channels, and between NBCUniversal and Comcast. Steve Burke has assembled talented and seasoned management teams across each of the businesses, with an overarching goal of investing to build long-term value, and making NBCUniversal the premier destination for content creators. The performance in the first quarter was led by the 16 national and 12 regional Cable Networks, which posted strong growth across the board, and continued to drive its profitability. Broadcast, as we expected, continued to face challenges, and saw its comparisons impacted by items from the prior year such as political advertising and the Olympics.  Our Film business had heavy marketing spend in the first quarter, ahead of second quarter releases, which impacted its year-over-year comparisons. Theme Parks performed extremely well. So overall, we're generally pleased with NBCUniversal's first quarter results.
With this as background, let me give you a sense for how we're looking at these new businesses. Our focus when we announced the transaction and our continuing focus today is on the recurring revenue businesses of the Cable networks, which generated more than 100% of NBCUniversal's operating cash flow. So we have begun investing even further in the Cable networks to continue to strengthen their content offerings and their brands. As I mentioned, these channels are performing very well, and we believe they will be even better positioned in the future.  With the addition of NBCUniversal, we now have close to a $10 billion advertising business at Comcast. So even though advertising adds some variability, this new scale, along with our mix of local, regional and national advertising, gives us strong momentum now, particularly, given the strong ad market, and should provide us longer-term opportunities to build new business like targeted and interactive advertising.
Film is a business of uneven timing, and some hits and misses. Our early releases in 2011 underperformed plan, but so far in the second quarter, they're doing much better. On the Broadcast front, we are working toward a long-term turnaround and we need to be patient. We have a new, energized management team, which is off to a great start. I'm optimistic about our prospects, but I'm also realistic, and know that it's going to take some time to return NBC to industry-level performance.  
As I mentioned before, we've had some early successes that validate our belief that we can create real value with our combination of distribution and content businesses. Let me give you some examples.  In film, Hop and Fast Five opened very big, following an unprecedented cross-marketing push across both NBCUniversal and Comcast. In sports, the Golf Channel on NBC and the NHL on NBC and Versus have both put up improved ratings, powered by what we think as a smart integration and effective marketing campaigns. And in Broadcast, maybe the most exciting event for NBCUniversal this year has occurred in the last two weeks with the premier of The Voice on NBC.  In addition to being a critical and ratings success, The Voice demonstrated what can be accomplished when every one of NBC properties and the digital assets and Comcast Cable come together to support a program. So as I step back and look across the entire company, I see strong recurring revenue businesses with terrific first quarter results, and opportunities to build on these businesses. Our competitive position in Cable continues to get stronger, and we are leading with XFINITY in innovation. This is indeed a great start for 2011, and we are all really focused on maintaining the momentum.
Let me now pass to Michael to cover the first quarter results in greater detail."

Before I begin to review our performance, I want to highlight that this quarter's results are a bit more complicated, given the closing of the NBCUniversal transaction on January 28, which means that reported results include only two months of the NBCUniversal businesses, and include transaction-related costs.
On the Cable side, reported results have also been impacted with the movement of the regional sports networks from Cable to NBCUniversal's Cable networks, and Comcast Interactive Media has now moved from Corporate and Other to Cable. Because of all these ins and outs, we will mainly focus today's presentation on pro forma results, which is how management evaluates the performance of the organization and its segments. We believe that pro forma presentation provides a more meaningful comparison of the operating performance of the businesses, and also includes the effects of acquisition accounting, and excludes certain costs and expenses directly related to the transaction. We have provided substantial transparency in detail on these items in our earnings press release and 10-Q. We hope they are helpful explanations, and expect subsequent quarters will be less complicated.
So now let me begin by briefly reviewing our consolidated results, which are not pro forma and start on Slide 4. Overall, we are very pleased with first quarter results, which reflect the fundamental strength in our Cable business and Cable Networks. These businesses performed well, and are executing quite strongly on our 2011 plans. Our first quarter consolidated revenue, including two months of NBCUniversal, increased 32% to $12.1 billion, and consolidated operating cash flow grew 14% to $4.1 billion. During the quarter, we incurred $107 million of transaction-related expenses related to the closing of the NBCUniversal transaction. Excluding these non-recurring costs in $14 million in last year's first quarter, our operating cash flow actually grew 16.6% on a normalized basis.
In addition to revenue and operating cash flow, we remain focused on free cash flow, free cash flow per share and earnings per share as important metrics in evaluating the strength of the company. In each of these key metrics, our performance in the first quarter was very strong. Free cash flow for the quarter increased 17.7% to $2.2 billion, primarily reflecting higher operating cash flow from Cable, and the inclusion of two months of NBCUniversal results, partially offset by higher capital expenditures. First quarter free cash flow per share increased 17.9% to $0.79 per share.  On a reported basis, we generated earnings per share of $0.34 for the first quarter. However, again, excluding NBCUniversal transaction-related costs, our EPS increased 16.1% to $0.36 per share. Please refer to Table 4 in the press release for more detail on these items.
Please refer to Slide 5. As I mentioned on previous calls, while we manage and consolidate NBCUniversal, we will continue to view Comcast and NBCUniversal as two distinct pools of cash flow generation and funding capacity. As you can see on this slide, Comcast, which includes both Cable Communications and Corporate and Other, accounted for $1.8 billion or 80% of total free cash flow, and NBCUniversal contributed $437 million in the two months since closing. At the end of the first quarter, we have $40.4 billion of debt on our consolidated balance sheet, reflecting the addition of the $9.1 billion from NBCUniversal. Our consolidated debt to operating cash flow leverage is now 2.3x, which is within our target range of two times and to two and a half times. During the quarter, we issued $1.7 billion of commercial paper in order to partially fund the $6.2 billion payment related to the transaction, retired $1.7 billion of debt maturities, and returned $787 million to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. 
We are executing our 2011 financial plan that we outlined in our last earnings call, including a 19% increase to our dividend in this year's planned completion of our existing share repurchase authorization, which now has $1.6 billion remaining. We continue to maintain the strength of our balance sheet, and see it as a strategic asset, giving us the ability to profitably invest in the operating and strategic needs of the businesses that enhance our competitive position and deliver sustainable organic growth.
Please refer to Slide 6 for our pro forma results. As I mentioned, we have substantially increased our level of disclosure to reflect the addition of the NBCUniversal businesses into four new segments. In addition, within the press release's trending schedules, our Cable Communications product line revenues now reflect only our Residential businesses, as Business Services is now presented as a separate line item. For the first quarter, pro forma Cable revenue increased 5.8%, and represented 68% of our consolidated revenue, while pro forma operating cash flow grew 7.7%, and represented 90% of our consolidated operating cash flow.
NBCUniversal revenue declined 11.5% due to the impact of last year's Olympics, and operating cash flow increased 4.9%. On a consolidated basis, pro forma revenue of $13.3 billion was flat compared to last year's results, and consolidated pro forma operating cash flow increased 7.8% to $4.2 billion. However, excluding last year's Olympics, in the NBCUniversal transaction-related costs, first quarter pro forma consolidated revenue increased 6.1%, and consolidated pro forma operating cash flow increased 4.2%. As you can see, during the quarter, Cable Communications and Cable Networks generated strong results and drive our overall profitability, accounting for 110% of this quarter's total pro forma operating cash flow.
Please refer to Slide 7 to review Cable Communications results. We had another strong quarter of financial and customer growth in Cable. For the first quarter, pro forma Cable Communications revenue increased a healthy 5.8% to $9.1 billion, reflecting growth in our Residential businesses, and continued strength in Business Services and Cable advertising. We've been effective in managing ARPU while driving customer growth. This quarter, total revenue per video customer increased 9% to $133 per month, reflecting an increasing number of customers taking multiple products, and a higher contribution from Business Services.
During the quarter, we added 639,000 total Video, High-Speed Internet and Voice customers equal to an 8.3% increase from last year's first quarter. Similar to the fourth quarter, we showed sequential improvement across all three products, including the lowest Video customer loss in almost four years. As a reminder, we are entering the second quarter, which is a seasonally slower period for our businesses due to the number of customers we have in college and vacation areas. However, as you can see in our first quarter results, we are executing well as we're competing better with improved products, and our focus on retention and customer service has helped drive our churn to an all-time low for all of our products.
As we look at the Service categories, first quarter Video revenue increased 1.7%, reflecting modest rate adjustments in about a third of our systems, more customers taking higher level of digital and advanced services, and an increase in premium revenue. We now have $10.4 million high-definition and/or DVR customers equal to 52% of our Digital customer base. High-Speed Internet revenue increased 8.8% during the quarter, reflecting rate adjustments, continued growth in our customer base, and an increasing number of customers taking higher speed services. Today, 23% of our residential High-Speed Internet customers take the higher speed tiers. Our High-Speed Internet service is capturing market share, and we continue to differentiate our products through service and speed enhancements.
Voice revenue increased 6.5% for the quarter, reflecting steady and continued success with our Triple Play offering. Customers recognize the value of Triple Play, and at the end of the first quarter, 34% of our Video customers took all three services compared to 30% at the end of last year's first quarter. As I mentioned, we continue to see real momentum in Business Services, with revenue increasing 50% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the Cimco and NGT [New Global Telecom] acquisitions, which were completed in the first quarter of 2010, Business Services revenue grew 45%. We remain very focused and enthusiastic about this area's growth opportunity.
Cable Advertising continued to perform well, with first quarter revenue increasing 10.4%. This improvement was again led by strength in Automotive, offset by lower Political revenue. As a reminder, we generated over $180 million of Political Ad [Advertising] revenue in 2010, including $100 million in the fourth quarter, impacting our sequential growth rate, and making comparisons more challenging as the year progresses.
Please refer to Slide 8 to review pro forma Cable Communications operating cash flow. First quarter pro forma Cable Communications operating cash flow increased 7.7% to $3.7 billion, resulting in a margin of 41.3%, and 80 basis point improvement compared to last year's first quarter. Total expenses in Cable increased 4.6%, primarily reflecting higher Video programming and marketing expenses, as well as continued investment to expand the capabilities in Business Services. Sales and marketing expenses, which have consistently been around 6% of Cable revenue for the past year, reflect our ongoing investment in the direct and retail channels. 
In the first quarter, marketing expenses increased 15.7% as a result of higher retail commissions and an increased overall Advertising and media spend, including XFINITY branding in the launch of the Endless Fun campaign. We remain very focused on expense management, and are constantly evaluating our cost structure to gain more efficiencies. In the first quarter, we continued to realize cost improvements in our High-Speed Internet and Voice networks. In addition, bad debt expense was at historically low level as we continued to refine our collection and screening processes. Our focus on improving customer service is also driving more efficiencies and improvements in churn and customer satisfaction.
Please refer to Slide 9 to review our Cable Communications capital expenditures. In the first quarter, Cable Communications capital expenditures is tracking to plan, and increased 15.4% to $1.1 billion, equal to 11.6% of revenue, reflecting higher investments in CPE, network infrastructure and Business Services. As a reminder, the level of CapEx spend in the first quarter of 2010 was low, as we accelerated equipment purchases in the fourth quarter of 2009 to take advantage of favorable tax treatment. In the first quarter of 2011, we deployed another 2.1 million digital adapters for a total of more than 19 million digital adapters since the inception of the all-digital project. We are now 80% complete with All-Digital, and we expect to complete this project by the end of this year.
During the quarter, we also deployed 848,000 advanced high-definition and/or DVR set-tops, as we added 257,000 advanced Service customers, and added multiple services to existing customers. As we continue to reinforce our product leadership with High-Speed Internet, we purchased more equipment to enable faster speeds. Our 50-megabit service is now available in more than 45 million homes, or almost 90% of our footprint. And as Brian mentioned, we recently launched our extreme 105-megabit service to more than 40 million homes or approximately 80% of our footprint.
First quarter CapEx also reflects meaningful investment to support the continued growth in Business Services, and to expand our efforts in mid-sized businesses. Our investment in Business Services increased 57% to $152 million in the first quarter. We are executing our capital plan well, and we continue to expect our full-year Cable capital expenditures will be lower as a percentage of Cable revenue when compared to 2010.
Please refer to Slide 10 to review NBCUniversal's Cable Networks results. In addition to Cable Communications' strong performance, Cable Networks delivered strong growth. In the first quarter, Cable Network revenue increased 13% to $2 billion, driven by strength in advertising, which was up 14%, and a 13% increase in distribution revenue. First quarter operating cash flow increased 7% to $817 million, as we are reinvesting some of this top line growth into new programming that further strengthens these franchises. We have the opportunity to further improve and grow these networks by strengthening their programming and increasing brand awareness, and our operating cash flow growth and margin reflect some of these investments.
This quarter's results reflect growth in both our established and emerging channels, and we're making terrific progress in integrating this historical Comcast networks into NBCUniversal. USA continues to lead basic Cable Networks in key demos on the success of its original programming. Also, we are seeing positive momentum at E and Bravo, both of which had their highest-rated quarters ever. During the quarter, we also saw particular strength at our regional sports networks.
Please refer to Slide 11 to review Broadcast results. Broadcast Television revenue declined 35% to $1.4 billion this quarter, reflecting the inclusion of $782 million of revenue from the Vancouver Olympics in last year's results. Excluding the Olympics impact, Broadcast revenue increased 4%, reflecting continued strength in advertising pricing. Broadcast operating cash flow improved $202 million to $20 million this quarter, again reflecting the absence of $223 million of losses related to last year's Olympics. Excluding these Olympic losses, Broadcast operating cash flow declined $21 million this quarter as a result of increased investment in programming, particularly NBC's prime time lineup compared to a light original programming schedule in the first quarter of 2010.
As Brian mentioned, we are focused on this challenge, and we'll continue to invest in the NBC Broadcast network, a process that started in 2010 in order to build a solid foundation for growth. We are also investing in the NBC local stations to increase and improve our local news capabilities. This focused effort is not a quick fix. We believe this is an important opportunity for us, and we will make operational and financial progress, but the results will take some time.
Please refer to Slide 12. Filmed Entertainment revenue declined 8% to $975 million this quarter, driven by lower theatrical and home entertainment revenue, as a result of the softer box office performance of this quarter's new releases, and fewer titles released in DVD compared to last year's first quarter. This was partially offset by higher content licensing revenue from the pay and free TV windows. Film operating cash flow declined $134 million to a loss of $146 million this quarter due to the revenue decline in substantial marketing spend for second quarter theatrical releases, including Hop and FAST FIVE, which were released in April. We are well aware of the challenges and volatilities of this segment, and are focused on improving performance.
As we switch to Theme Parks, both Orlando and Hollywood parks are performing very well, and revenue increased 16% to $95 million, and operating cash flow increased to $41 million, reflecting strong attendance in per capita spending at both parks, which are benefiting from the success of newly launched attractions, particularly the Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Orlando, and King Kong in Hollywood. Please note that the equity income from the Orlando joint venture is included in Theme Park operating cash flow. It was a significant driver of this quarter's increase in operating cash flow. However, the Orlando equity income is eliminated in NBCUniversal headquarters' other and elimination line, as it included in the equity income for our consolidated reporting purposes.
So as we review the performance of the first quarter of 2011, we feel very good about our operating momentum and focus on execution. Our Cable Communications and Cable Networks businesses continue to perform well and deliver strong operational and financial results. We have a terrific mix of assets, and we're looking forward to executing on the opportunities ahead to deliver long-term sustainable growth, and build value for our shareholders.
Now let me turn it over to Marlene for Q&A."

Is that a function of churn continuing to come down, or better gross adds? And do you think we can get to a situation where we begin to grow the Video base again? And then switching over to NBC, it seems you mentioned it a couple of times in the slides that there's higher spending going on to improve prime time and maybe the profitability of the Cable Network. One, is this a level that we should expect in terms of spending to improve things going forward and/or do you expect to spend more than you're doing now overtime to catch up for your peers? And is this the sort of the main avenue that you expect to pursue to improve the performance of those businesses?"

We're really focusing on getting it right the first time, and getting higher reliability of our service. So our service calls were down. Our repeats were down, and that's taking unnecessary noise out of a system. I think third would be our retention focus. Our churn was at all-time lows, and I think that's due to a number of things. First, we formed a specific retention channel focus. We formed centers of excellence for retention calls, and we're doing better on the promotional roll off. I think we're doing better marketing. Our Endless Fun campaign saw a double-digit increases and the intent to purchase, so we're really marketing better, and we're targeting our marketing better. So I think it's due to all those factors. What really drove the total numbers was more retention than it was growth adds, and I think that's healthy for the business both from a sub-perspective and a financial perspective. Steve?"

This year, with the full year of ten o'clock shows, you've got an investment there. We also have some other minor investments for a total of about $200 million in increased prime time investment if you look year-over-year. The real key to turning around NBC is not necessarily the increase in investment. The real key is making better shows. We're making about the same amount of pilots as last year, 21, which is up from two or three years ago, but about the same as last year. And it's really a matter of doing better and then of course, there is $200 million more of investment largely due to having a full year of ten o'clock shows as opposed to the Jay Leno Show at ten. On the Cable side, I think we're going to be investing about $100 million more this year on new shows, and the way those new shows, the way the accounting works on those new shows is those new shows are negative in the year that they launched. And if they're good shows, they tend to be quite positive in subsequent years. So on the Broadcast side, about $200 million. On the Cable side, about $100 million."

The Metro-E, I think, we see that overall mid-size markets as about the same size as our SMB [small & medium sized business] market. And the Metro-E, we're in 11 of 19 markets. We've got the sales force in place. We've got the operational aspect of it improving. We're trying to reduce the install times, and the PRI is beginning to sell very nicely.

With regards to churn, we generally don't disclose churn. I can tell you though, some of the steps we've taken on churn, which I mentioned previously, but we've improved our credit screening, and we've got much more focused credit screening, a mix of both our financial and our marketing teams have really come up with a very methodical way of doing that, and we're focusing more on how we handle every call and every promotional roll off.

Brian mentioned in his introduction, we have 16 national Cable channels and a 12 regional sports networks, and these are fantastic properties. And we've said this before, what we really bought when we did the deal for NBC universal was a bunch of very, very well run, very strong Cable channels. So I think priority number one is to make sure that those channels continue to get the investment they need, and continue to grow at the kind of high growth rates they have been, and I really want to highlight how great we feel about those channels now that we're inside the building as it were. Second big priority, we think the Broadcast business has tremendous upside for this company. We are underperforming relative to the other three of the big four. Dramatically, many hundreds of millions of dollars worse than the other three, both on the Network side and the Broadcast station side. And we look at that as a tremendous opportunity. You want to always sort of soften that optimism by the realization that it is a very tough business to turn around, and I think it is likely to take us a number of years to turn it around. But when we do, going from fourth to third, would be hundreds of millions of dollars of swing, positive swing in terms of EBITDA. So that is obviously a very high priority. We're going out to see Bob Greenblatt's first bunch of pilots. Brian mentioned the Voice, which I think we've been very fortunate the last two weeks. We may have a big building block that we can put in place and build on with some other pilots. But we're very optimistic, but tempered by the acknowledgment that it's going to be a multi-year process, but what we think it's a big opportunity. I haven't even mentioned retransmission consent and some of the other things that are on the horizon there. We also have a variety of opportunities and sort of priority investment areas in other parts of the business. Telemundo, we think, is a real opportunity area, internationally, you mentioned, Jessica, Digital. Just the year expense of properties that we have, and the ability to get those properties moving more quickly than they have been, we think is a real opportunity. And then finally, having the company work together as one unit. We have a saying that we're better together, and what we're really trying to do is make sure that when we have significant priorities like the Voice or a movie like Hop, that the entire company gets behind it, both the NBCUniversal side and very importantly, the Comcast side. And that's having all sorts of activities that really focus people in what is otherwise a very fragmented universe on one or two things, and we think that's going to be a big key to our success in the future."

Again, in the future, we may talk a little bit more about it, but these are relatively small businesses. With regards to Universal Orlando, just to level set, I think everyone knows that we have a 50-50 joint venture with Blackstone. Blackstone's been in that transaction for a number of times, and have exercised a trigger. We haven't made any decisions at all. We will make a decision probably in another month or so. The business is well managed. It's growing nicely, as you can see from the numbers. But I just want to make sure folks are aware of that. When we do make a decision, strategically, it'll be the right one for us. And financially, it will be attractive. So I would just say stay tuned on that. With regards to cash taxes, we will benefit substantially on cash taxes this year due to the bonus depreciation. You'll start to see some of that in the next quarter and through the rest of the year. Cash taxes doesn't play a role in the first quarter, but it will in the second, third and fourth quarter. So there will be quite a meaningful benefit in 2011 related to bonus depreciation."

And we want to go out and execute it. Regarding Netflix and other OVD business models, I defer to them to talk about their companies. I think we should focus on what we're doing. We have a fantastic High-Speed Data business. I just want to underscore, it hasn't really come up on the questions. In my opinion, a lot of discussion on the Video side of business and a great quarter there. But for me, to have more than 100% net add growth rate in the first quarter versus the first quarter last year tells you something very exciting is happening in that space. And I think the team is doing a great job with the XFINITY High-Speed Data service. And I think it also presents business opportunities for us on the NBC side and the NBC universal side in terms of re-purposing existing content. At the same time, we've been able to stretch our On Demand library by having catch-up, which I think, is a breakthrough kind of product where you know who's the viewer. And part of it is trying to create a sense of expectation that if there's a top show on television starting the next day, you can get it On Demand, and you can catch up if it's a new show, you discover you get all the four episodes that are most current. So a lot of progress, and I think by having the mix of assets we have, we're in a wonderful position to benefit as the world changes, and some of that change won't always be great for one piece of the company, but overall, in the totality of the Comcast shareholders, I think we're extremely well-positioned as the world continues to evolve."

So the negative number in this quarter was primarily driven by that. But we did have some softness in the slate before we hit Hop and FAST FIVE, which obviously is a big hit. We're well aware of the challenges in the Film business, and the fact that the DVD business has declined. And that's responsible for -- part of our fault, but part of it is we need to make better films and that's a real area of focus for us as well.

Cable had an outstanding quarter, and this is our first opportunity to talk about the whole company, including the results of NBCUniversal. I really feel we've assembled a world-class management team at both Comcast and NBCUniversal, and today's results demonstrate the early momentum of our new and dynamic company.
Let me begin with Cable. First quarter results show continuing strength in 3 key areas: financial performance, subscriber growth and customer service. Total Cable revenue was up by 6%, and operating cash flow increased by nearly 8%. Subscriber growth was particularly strong in High-Speed Internet, with 418,000 net additions, as we continue to gain market share, and to significantly outpace the net additions of our competitors. We're also continuing to put real differentiation between our high-speed service and DSL. In fact, during the quarter, we reinforced this superiority with a new 105 megabits high speed offering that is now available to more than 40 million homes in many of our major markets.
We're also really pleased with our improving video results. In the first quarter, we lost 39,000 video customers, which is less than half of last year's first quarter, which continues the trend of improving year-over-year video performance, while still facing a larger competitive footprint. Growth in Voice Services continues to be very consistent with 260,000 customer additions, and our Business Services revenues grew by almost 50%. So all in all, financially and in product sales, Cable is doing quite well. Under Neil Smit's focused leadership, we are also executing well, and seeing sustainable improvements in our operating performance metrics. Our key network projects, like All-Digital and DOCSIS 3.0 and Infinity are almost complete. And these investments, together with our initiatives to transform the customer experience, are really coming together to produce results. Our customer retention and service metrics are at the best levels since we've been tracking them, including record-low churn levels across each of our products, repeat service calls that are at all-time low and higher customer satisfaction.
Neil's other big initiative is accelerating, where we are leading the industry in delivering new products to our customers, not just because we have scale, but because we now have the operational focus and excellence to make the XFINITY experience the best in the country.
Just last week, we added the top-rated TV series from ABC and Fox to our already extensive on-demand lineup of more than 600 TV series, making us the only-paid TV provider to offer current TV series from all 4 major broadcast networks on demand. This new offering allows our customers to catch up on the most current episode, plus the 3 previous shows for almost all of these TV series anytime On Demand. It also provides an opportunity for the broadcast networks to reach more consumers through time-shifted viewing, and to do so through our powerful On Demand service, which has now delivered more than 19 billion total views, and generates about 350 million On Demand views a month from our customers.
Now while we've only been operating the NBCUniversal businesses for 3 months, we're encouraged that we've had a seamless integration with no surprises and a strong start to 2011, including some early successes in synergy among the NBCUniversal channels, and between NBCUniversal and Comcast. Steve Burke has assembled talented and seasoned management teams across each of the businesses, with an overarching goal of investing to build long-term value, and making NBCUniversal the premier destination for content creators. The performance in the first quarter was led by the 16 national and 12 regional Cable Networks, which posted strong growth across the board, and continued to drive its profitability. Broadcast, as we expected, continued to face challenges, and saw its comparisons impacted by items from the prior year such as political advertising and the Olympics.  Our Film business had heavy marketing spend in the first quarter, ahead of second quarter releases, which impacted its year-over-year comparisons. Theme Parks performed extremely well. So overall, we're generally pleased with NBCUniversal's first quarter results.
With this as background, let me give you a sense for how we're looking at these new businesses. Our focus when we announced the transaction and our continuing focus today is on the recurring revenue businesses of the Cable networks, which generated more than 100% of NBCUniversal's operating cash flow. So we have begun investing even further in the Cable networks to continue to strengthen their content offerings and their brands. As I mentioned, these channels are performing very well, and we believe they will be even better positioned in the future.  With the addition of NBCUniversal, we now have close to a $10 billion advertising business at Comcast. So even though advertising adds some variability, this new scale, along with our mix of local, regional and national advertising, gives us strong momentum now, particularly, given the strong ad market, and should provide us longer-term opportunities to build new business like targeted and interactive advertising.
Film is a business of uneven timing, and some hits and misses. Our early releases in 2011 underperformed plan, but so far in the second quarter, they're doing much better. On the Broadcast front, we are working toward a long-term turnaround and we need to be patient. We have a new, energized management team, which is off to a great start. I'm optimistic about our prospects, but I'm also realistic, and know that it's going to take some time to return NBC to industry-level performance.  
As I mentioned before, we've had some early successes that validate our belief that we can create real value with our combination of distribution and content businesses. Let me give you some examples.  In film, Hop and Fast Five opened very big, following an unprecedented cross-marketing push across both NBCUniversal and Comcast. In sports, the Golf Channel on NBC and the NHL on NBC and Versus have both put up improved ratings, powered by what we think as a smart integration and effective marketing campaigns. And in Broadcast, maybe the most exciting event for NBCUniversal this year has occurred in the last 2 weeks with the premier of The Voice on NBC.  In addition to being a critical and ratings success, The Voice demonstrated what can be accomplished when every one of NBC properties and the digital assets and Comcast Cable come together to support a program. So as I step back and look across the entire company, I see strong recurring revenue businesses with terrific first quarter results, and opportunities to build on these businesses. Our competitive position in Cable continues to get stronger, and we are leading with XFINITY in innovation. This is indeed a great start for 2011, and we are all really focused on maintaining the momentum.
Let me now pass to Michael to cover the first quarter results in greater detail."
173341,129306686,122427,"Comcast Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 04, 2011",2011-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Comcast Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Brian. Before I begin to review our performance, I want to highlight that this quarter's results are a bit more complicated, given the closing of the NBCUniversal transaction on January 28, which means that reported results include only 2 month",2588,"Thank you, Brian. Before I begin to review our performance, I want to highlight that this quarter's results are a bit more complicated, given the closing of the NBCUniversal transaction on January 28, which means that reported results include only 2 months of the NBCUniversal businesses, and include transaction-related costs.
On the Cable side, reported results have also been impacted with the movement of the regional sports networks from Cable to NBCUniversal's Cable networks, and Comcast Interactive Media has now moved from Corporate and Other to Cable. Because of all these ins and outs, we will mainly focus today's presentation on pro forma results, which is how management evaluates the performance of the organization and its segments. We believe that pro forma presentation provides a more meaningful comparison of the operating performance of the businesses, and also includes the effects of acquisition accounting, and excludes certain costs and expenses directly related to the transaction. We have provided substantial transparency in detail on these items in our earnings press release and 10-Q. We hope they are helpful explanations, and expect subsequent quarters will be less complicated.
So now let me begin by briefly reviewing our consolidated results, which are not pro forma and start on Slide 4. Overall, we are very pleased with first quarter results, which reflect the fundamental strength in our Cable business and Cable Networks. These businesses performed well, and are executing quite strongly on our 2011 plans. Our first quarter consolidated revenue, including 2 months of NBCUniversal, increased 32% to $12.1 billion, and consolidated operating cash flow grew 14% to $4.1 billion. During the quarter, we incurred $107 million of transaction-related expenses related to the closing of the NBCUniversal transaction. Excluding these non-recurring costs in $14 million in last year's first quarter, our operating cash flow actually grew 16.6% on a normalized basis.
In addition to revenue and operating cash flow, we remain focused on free cash flow, free cash flow per share and earnings per share as important metrics in evaluating the strength of the company. In each of these key metrics, our performance in the first quarter was very strong. Free cash flow for the quarter increased 17.7% to $2.2 billion, primarily reflecting higher operating cash flow from Cable, and the inclusion of 2 months of NBCUniversal results, partially offset by higher capital expenditures. First quarter free cash flow per share increased 17.9% to $0.79 per share.  On a reported basis, we generated earnings per share of $0.34 for the first quarter. However, again, excluding NBCUniversal transaction-related costs, our EPS increased 16.1% to $0.36 per share. Please refer to Table 4 in the press release for more detail on these items.
Please refer to Slide 5. As I mentioned on previous calls, while we manage and consolidate NBCUniversal, we will continue to view Comcast and NBCUniversal as 2 distinct pools of cash flow generation and funding capacity. As you can see on this slide, Comcast, which includes both Cable Communications and Corporate and Other, accounted for $1.8 billion or 80% of total free cash flow, and NBCUniversal contributed $437 million in the 2 months since closing. At the end of the first quarter, we have $40.4 billion of debt on our consolidated balance sheet, reflecting the addition of the $9.1 billion from NBCUniversal. Our consolidated debt to operating cash flow leverage is now 2.3x, which is within our target range of 2x and to 2.5x. During the quarter, we issued $1.7 billion of commercial paper in order to partially fund the $6.2 billion payment related to the transaction, retired $1.7 billion of debt maturities, and returned $787 million to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. 
We are executing our 2011 financial plan that we outlined in our last earnings call, including a 19% increase to our dividend in this year's planned completion of our existing share repurchase authorization, which now has $1.6 billion remaining. We continue to maintain the strength of our balance sheet, and see it as a strategic asset, giving us the ability to profitably invest in the operating and strategic needs of the businesses that enhance our competitive position and deliver sustainable organic growth.
Please refer to Slide 6 for our pro forma results. As I mentioned, we have substantially increased our level of disclosure to reflect the addition of the NBCUniversal businesses into 4 new segments. In addition, within the press release's trending schedules, our Cable Communications product line revenues now reflect only our Residential businesses, as Business Services is now presented as a separate line item. For the first quarter, pro forma Cable revenue increased 5.8%, and represented 68% of our consolidated revenue, while pro forma operating cash flow grew 7.7%, and represented 90% of our consolidated operating cash flow.
NBCUniversal revenue declined 11.5% due to the impact of last year's Olympics, and operating cash flow increased 4.9%. On a consolidated basis, pro forma revenue of $13.3 billion was flat compared to last year's results, and consolidated pro forma operating cash flow increased 7.8% to $4.2 billion. However, excluding last year's Olympics, in the NBCUniversal transaction-related costs, first quarter pro forma consolidated revenue increased 6.1%, and consolidated pro forma operating cash flow increased 4.2%. As you can see, during the quarter, Cable Communications and Cable Networks generated strong results and drive our overall profitability, accounting for 110% of this quarter's total pro forma operating cash flow.
Please refer to Slide 7 to review Cable Communications results. We had another strong quarter of financial and customer growth in Cable. For the first quarter, pro forma Cable Communications revenue increased a healthy 5.8% to $9.1 billion, reflecting growth in our Residential businesses, and continued strength in Business Services and Cable advertising. We've been effective in managing ARPU while driving customer growth. This quarter, total revenue per video customer increased 9% to $133 per month, reflecting an increasing number of customers taking multiple products, and a higher contribution from Business Services.
During the quarter, we added 639,000 total Video, High-Speed Internet and Voice customers equal to an 8.3% increase from last year's first quarter. Similar to the fourth quarter, we showed sequential improvement across all 3 products, including the lowest Video customer loss in almost 4 years. As a reminder, we are entering the second quarter, which is a seasonally slower period for our businesses due to the number of customers we have in college and vacation areas. However, as you can see in our first quarter results, we are executing well as we're competing better with improved products, and our focus on retention and customer service has helped drive our churn to an all-time low for all of our products.
As we look at the Service categories, first quarter Video revenue increased 1.7%, reflecting modest rate adjustments in about 1/3 of our systems, more customers taking higher level of digital and advanced services, and an increase in premium revenue. We now have $10.4 million high-definition and/or DVR customers equal to 52% of our Digital customer base. High-Speed Internet revenue increased 8.8% during the quarter, reflecting rate adjustments, continued growth in our customer base, and an increasing number of customers taking higher speed services. Today, 23% of our residential High-Speed Internet customers take the higher speed tiers. Our High-Speed Internet service is capturing market share, and we continue to differentiate our products through service and speed enhancements.
Voice revenue increased 6.5% for the quarter, reflecting steady and continued success with our Triple Play offering. Customers recognize the value of Triple Play, and at the end of the first quarter, 34% of our Video customers took all 3 services compared to 30% at the end of last year's first quarter. As I mentioned, we continue to see real momentum in Business Services, with revenue increasing 50% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the Cimco and NGT [New Global Telecom] acquisitions, which were completed in the first quarter of 2010, Business Services revenue grew 45%. We remain very focused and enthusiastic about this area's growth opportunity.
Cable Advertising continued to perform well, with first quarter revenue increasing 10.4%. This improvement was again led by strength in Automotive, offset by lower Political revenue. As a reminder, we generated over $180 million of Political Ad [Advertising] revenue in 2010, including $100 million in the fourth quarter, impacting our sequential growth rate, and making comparisons more challenging as the year progresses.
Please refer to Slide 8 to review pro forma Cable Communications operating cash flow. First quarter pro forma Cable Communications operating cash flow increased 7.7% to $3.7 billion, resulting in a margin of 41.3%, and 80 basis point improvement compared to last year's first quarter. Total expenses in Cable increased 4.6%, primarily reflecting higher Video programming and marketing expenses, as well as continued investment to expand the capabilities in Business Services. Sales and marketing expenses, which have consistently been around 6% of Cable revenue for the past year, reflect our ongoing investment in the direct and retail channels. 
In the first quarter, marketing expenses increased 15.7% as a result of higher retail commissions and an increased overall Advertising and media spend, including XFINITY branding in the launch of the Endless Fun campaign. We remain very focused on expense management, and are constantly evaluating our cost structure to gain more efficiencies. In the first quarter, we continued to realize cost improvements in our High-Speed Internet and Voice networks. In addition, bad debt expense was at historically low level as we continued to refine our collection and screening processes. Our focus on improving customer service is also driving more efficiencies and improvements in churn and customer satisfaction.
Please refer to Slide 9 to review our Cable Communications capital expenditures. In the first quarter, Cable Communications capital expenditures is tracking to plan, and increased 15.4% to $1.1 billion, equal to 11.6% of revenue, reflecting higher investments in CPE, network infrastructure and Business Services. As a reminder, the level of CapEx spend in the first quarter of 2010 was low, as we accelerated equipment purchases in the fourth quarter of 2009 to take advantage of favorable tax treatment. In the first quarter of 2011, we deployed another 2.1 million digital adapters for a total of more than 19 million digital adapters since the inception of the all-digital project. We are now 80% complete with All-Digital, and we expect to complete this project by the end of this year.
During the quarter, we also deployed 848,000 advanced high-definition and/or DVR set-tops, as we added 257,000 advanced Service customers, and added multiple services to existing customers. As we continue to reinforce our product leadership with High-Speed Internet, we purchased more equipment to enable faster speeds. Our 50-megabit service is now available in more than 45 million homes, or almost 90% of our footprint. And as Brian mentioned, we recently launched our extreme 105-megabit service to more than 40 million homes or approximately 80% of our footprint.
First quarter CapEx also reflects meaningful investment to support the continued growth in Business Services, and to expand our efforts in mid-sized businesses. Our investment in Business Services increased 57% to $152 million in the first quarter. We are executing our capital plan well, and we continue to expect our full-year Cable capital expenditures will be lower as a percentage of Cable revenue when compared to 2010.
Please refer to Slide 10 to review NBCUniversal's Cable Networks results. In addition to Cable Communications' strong performance, Cable Networks delivered strong growth. In the first quarter, Cable Network revenue increased 13% to $2 billion, driven by strength in advertising, which was up 14%, and a 13% increase in distribution revenue. First quarter operating cash flow increased 7% to $817 million, as we are reinvesting some of this top line growth into new programming that further strengthens these franchises. We have the opportunity to further improve and grow these networks by strengthening their programming and increasing brand awareness, and our operating cash flow growth and margin reflect some of these investments.
This quarter's results reflect growth in both our established and emerging channels, and we're making terrific progress in integrating this historical Comcast networks into NBCUniversal. USA continues to lead basic Cable Networks in key demos on the success of its original programming. Also, we are seeing positive momentum at E and Bravo, both of which had their highest-rated quarters ever. During the quarter, we also saw particular strength at our regional sports networks.
Please refer to Slide 11 to review Broadcast results. Broadcast Television revenue declined 35% to $1.4 billion this quarter, reflecting the inclusion of $782 million of revenue from the Vancouver Olympics in last year's results. Excluding the Olympics impact, Broadcast revenue increased 4%, reflecting continued strength in advertising pricing. Broadcast operating cash flow improved $202 million to $20 million this quarter, again reflecting the absence of $223 million of losses related to last year's Olympics. Excluding these Olympic losses, Broadcast operating cash flow declined $21 million this quarter as a result of increased investment in programming, particularly NBC's prime time lineup compared to a light original programming schedule in the first quarter of 2010.
As Brian mentioned, we are focused on this challenge, and we'll continue to invest in the NBC Broadcast network, a process that started in 2010 in order to build a solid foundation for growth. We are also investing in the NBC local stations to increase and improve our local news capabilities. This focused effort is not a quick fix. We believe this is an important opportunity for us, and we will make operational and financial progress, but the results will take some time.
Please refer to Slide 12. Filmed Entertainment revenue declined 8% to $975 million this quarter, driven by lower theatrical and home entertainment revenue, as a result of the softer box office performance of this quarter's new releases, and fewer titles released in DVD compared to last year's first quarter. This was partially offset by higher content licensing revenue from the pay and free TV windows. Film operating cash flow declined $134 million to a loss of $146 million this quarter due to the revenue decline in substantial marketing spend for second quarter theatrical releases, including Hop and FAST FIVE, which were released in April. We are well aware of the challenges and volatilities of this segment, and are focused on improving performance.
As we switch to Theme Parks, both Orlando and Hollywood parks are performing very well, and revenue increased 16% to $95 million, and operating cash flow increased to $41 million, reflecting strong attendance in per capita spending at both parks, which are benefiting from the success of newly launched attractions, particularly the Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Orlando, and King Kong in Hollywood. Please note that the equity income from the Orlando joint venture is included in Theme Park operating cash flow. It was a significant driver of this quarter's increase in operating cash flow. However, the Orlando equity income is eliminated in NBCUniversal headquarters' other and elimination line, as it included in the equity income for our consolidated reporting purposes.
So as we review the performance of the first quarter of 2011, we feel very good about our operating momentum and focus on execution. Our Cable Communications and Cable Networks businesses continue to perform well and deliver strong operational and financial results. We have a terrific mix of assets, and we're looking forward to executing on the opportunities ahead to deliver long-term sustainable growth, and build value for our shareholders.
Now let me turn it over to Marlene for Q&A."

Is that a function of churn continuing to come down, or better gross adds? And do you think we can get to a situation where we begin to grow the Video base again? And then switching over to NBC, it seems you mentioned it a couple of times in the slides that there's higher spending going on to improve prime time and maybe the profitability of the Cable Network. One, is this a level that we should expect in terms of spending to improve things going forward and/or do you expect to spend more than you're doing now overtime to catch up for your peers? And is this the sort of the main avenue that you expect to pursue to improve the performance of those businesses?"

We're really focusing on getting it right the first time, and getting higher reliability of our service. So our service calls were down. Our repeats were down, and that's taking unnecessary noise out of a system. I think third would be our retention focus. Our churn was at all-time lows, and I think that's due to a number of things. First, we formed a specific retention channel focus. We formed centers of excellence for retention calls, and we're doing better on the promotional roll off. I think we're doing better marketing. Our Endless Fun campaign saw a double-digit increases and the intent to purchase, so we're really marketing better, and we're targeting our marketing better. So I think it's due to all those factors. What really drove the total numbers was more retention than it was growth adds, and I think that's healthy for the business both from a sub-perspective and a financial perspective. Steve?"

We also have some other minor investments for a total of about $200 million in increased prime time investment if you look year-over-year. The real key to turning around NBC is not necessarily the increase in investment. The real key is making better shows. We're making about the same amount of pilots as last year, 21, which is up from 2 or 3 years ago, but about the same as last year. And it's really a matter of doing better and then of course, there is $200 million more of investment largely due to having a full year of 10:00 shows as opposed to the Jay Leno Show at 10:00. On the Cable side, I think we're going to be investing about $100 million more this year on new shows, and the way those new shows, the way the accounting works on those new shows is those new shows are negative in the year that they launched. And if they're good shows, they tend to be quite positive in subsequent years. So on the Broadcast side, about $200 million. On the Cable side, about $100 million."

A lot of our growth has come from the small and medium, as you know. We're now getting into the Metro-E business. We've launched PRI across 90% of our footprint, and our Cell Backhaul business is ramping nicely. The Metro-E, I think, we see that overall mid-size markets as about the same size as our SMB [small & medium sized business] market. And the Metro-E, we're in 11 of 19 markets. We've got the sales force in place. We've got the operational aspect of it improving. We're trying to reduce the install times, and the PRI is beginning to sell very nicely. It's a great product, good value for our customers, and we increased our Cell Backhaul towers by about 80% last year, so that business is an incremental, complementary business, and it's going very well. With regards to churn, we generally don't disclose churn. I can tell you though, some of the steps we've taken on churn, which I mentioned previously, but we've improved our credit screening, and we've got much more focused credit screening, a mix of both our financial and our marketing teams have really come up with a very methodical way of doing that, and we're focusing more on how we handle every call and every promotional roll off. And we index generally higher, we reduced the number of high-value customers we're losing, which has had a really positive effect on the financials. Steve?"

Brian mentioned in his introduction, we have 16 national Cable channels and a 12 regional sports networks, and these are fantastic properties. And we've said this before, wha",499,"So in terms of priorities, Jessica, I think you'd start with the Cable channels. Brian mentioned in his introduction, we have 16 national Cable channels and a 12 regional sports networks, and these are fantastic properties. And we've said this before, what we really bought when we did the deal for NBC universal was a bunch of very, very well run, very strong Cable channels. So I think priority number one is to make sure that those channels continue to get the investment they need, and continue to grow at the kind of high growth rates they have been, and I really want to highlight how great we feel about those channels now that we're inside the building as it were. Second big priority, we think the Broadcast business has tremendous upside for this company. We are underperforming relative to the other 3 of the big 4. Dramatically, many hundreds of millions of dollars worse than the other 3, both on the Network side and the Broadcast station side. And we look at that as a tremendous opportunity. You want to always sort of soften that optimism by the realization that it is a very tough business to turn around, and I think it is likely to take us a number of years to turn it around. But when we do, going from fourth to third, would be hundreds of millions of dollars of swing, positive swing in terms of EBITDA. So that is obviously a very high priority. We're going out to see Bob Greenblatt's first bunch of pilots. Brian mentioned the Voice, which I think we've been very fortunate the last 2 weeks. We may have a big building block that we can put in place and build on with some other pilots. But we're very optimistic, but tempered by the acknowledgment that it's going to be a multi-year process, but what we think it's a big opportunity. I haven't even mentioned retransmission consent and some of the other things that are on the horizon there. We also have a variety of opportunities and sort of priority investment areas in other parts of the business. Telemundo, we think, is a real opportunity area, internationally, you mentioned, Jessica, Digital. Just the year expense of properties that we have, and the ability to get those properties moving more quickly than they have been, we think is a real opportunity. And then finally, having the company work together as one unit. We have a saying that we're better together, and what we're really trying to do is make sure that when we have significant priorities like the Voice or a movie like Hop, that the entire company gets behind it, both the NBCUniversal side and very importantly, the Comcast side. And that's having all sorts of activities that really focus people in what is otherwise a very fragmented universe on one or 2 things, and we think that's going to be a big key to our success in the future."

With regards to Universal Orlando, just to level set, I think everyone knows that we have a 50-50 joint venture with Blackstone. Blackstone's been in that transaction for a number of times, and have exercised a trigger. We haven't made any decisions at all. We will make a decision probably in another month or so. The business is well managed. It's growing nicely, as you can see from the numbers. But I just want to make sure folks are aware of that. When we do make a decision, strategically, it'll be the right one for us. And financially, it will be attractive. So I would just say stay tuned on that. With regards to cash taxes, we will benefit substantially on cash taxes this year due to the bonus depreciation. You'll start to see some of that in the next quarter and through the rest of the year. Cash taxes doesn't play a role in the first quarter, but it will in the second, third and fourth quarter. So there will be quite a meaningful benefit in 2011 related to bonus depreciation."

We have a fantastic High-Speed Data business. I just want to underscore, it hasn't really come up on the questions. In my opinion, a lot of discussion on the Video side of business and a great quarter there. But for me, to have more than 100% net add growth rate in the first quarter versus the first quarter last year tells you something very exciting is happening in that space. And I think the team is doing a great job with the XFINITY High-Speed Data service. And I think it also presents business opportunities for us on the NBC side and the NBC universal side in terms of re-purposing existing content. At the same time, we've been able to stretch our On Demand library by having catch-up, which I think, is a breakthrough kind of product where you know who's the viewer. And part of it is trying to create a sense of expectation that if there's a top show on television starting the next day, you can get it On Demand, and you can catch up if it's a new show, you discover you get all the 4 episodes that are most current.

And that's responsible for -- part of our fault, but part of it is we need to make better films and that's a real area of focus for us as well. In terms of cost synergies, there's a lot of ins and outs, and there have been some minor areas of overlap where we've eliminated some positions. But basically, the assets are complementary, and most of the focus has been on ways to grow them."

Today, I'm pleased to report that we achieved strong operating and financial results for the second quarter in Cable and in NBCUniversal.

Today, I'm pleased to report that we achieved strong operating and financial results for the second quarter in Cable and in NBCUniversal. These results demonstrate our operational focus while also speeding up innovation and investing in content to strengthen our brands and our franchises. 
So let me begin with Cable. In the second quarter, revenue was up by nearly 6%. Operating cash flow increased by nearly 7%, and Cable generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow. Customer additions for our combined Video, Voice and data services increased by 18%, continuing the trend of improving year-over-year performance even in a seasonally weak quarter. Our High-Speed Internet Service was once again one of the real highlights and was the largest contributor to Cable's growth this quarter. The second quarter marks the eighth quarter in a row where we significantly Outpaced the net additions of our competitors. This is due to strong execution and expanding differentiation between our High-Speed Service and DSL. 
Business Services was another significant contributor to Cable's performance in the second quarter with 42% growth in revenue. This business has solid momentum, and we are continuing to build its capabilities for future growth, including expanding Metro-E services to 20 of our major markets. We also made steady improvements in our operating performance metrics, marking another quarter with better customer retention and Service scores and higher customer satisfaction. We have real operational focus and are making our Service and the overall XFINITY experience the best in the business. As we continue to use our scale to our advantage, we are delivering new products and faster innovation to our Cable customers. 
Our current and future services represent an exciting new product road map that includes higher-speed Internet, a growing array of IP and cloud-based applications, new offerings like XFINITY signature support and new lines of businesses like home security. And soon working with Skype, we will also begin to offer a new high-definition video calling experience right to your television. What is particularly exciting is the leverage we are gaining from the previous significant investments we made in our network. So it's easier and faster now to drive new technologies and product innovation. I believe all this, together with our initiatives to transform the customer experience, is generating results and helping us make sustainable improvements that will continue to yield benefits. 
So let me now switch to NBCUniversal. As you know, our overarching goal for NBC and Universal is to build long-term value. And yes, there'll be some hits and misses and a bit more volatility, but I continue to believe that our timing was just right as we have benefited from a much stronger advertising market since we signed the agreement and near-seamless integration, mostly the continuing strength of many of their businesses, particularly the Cable channels with their wonderful brands. 
We had a busy quarter. We invested in lots of new shows in both Cable and Broadcast. We extended our NHL rights. We purchased the other 50% of Universal Orlando and brought together all of our company's capabilities in a successful and I think important bid for the Olympics. Our Olympic rights now stretch over a decade and extend to all technology and media. However, they may change through the year 2020, giving us real opportunity to build out the network and Cable and digital capabilities of NBCUniversal and to make the Olympics profitable for our company over the term of this new agreement. 
Even as we invest, NBCUniversal's second quarter financial results highlight the health of its businesses with double-digit revenue growth in each of its segments and 19% operating cash flow growth when you exclude accounting adjustments related to the acquisition. So all in all, I'm very pleased with our financial and operating performance so far this year. We are making real progress on all fronts. We have strong recurring revenue businesses. We're focused on operational excellence, and we have a disciplined investment approach that is yielding positive results and will continue to build value. With that, let me now pass to Michael to cover the second quarter results in detail."
173341,134605136,151192,"Comcast Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2011",2011-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Comcast Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Brian. Let me begin by briefly reviewing our consolidated financial results starting on Slide 4. Overall, we are very pleased with second quarter results. Second quarter consolidated revenue increased 50.5% to $14.3 billion, and consolidated op",2304,"Thank you, Brian. Let me begin by briefly reviewing our consolidated financial results starting on Slide 4. Overall, we are very pleased with second quarter results. Second quarter consolidated revenue increased 50.5% to $14.3 billion, and consolidated operating cash flow grew 28.5% to $4.8 billion. In addition to revenue and operating cash flow, we remain focused on free cash flow, free cash flow per share and earnings per share as important metrics in evaluating the performance and strength of the company. 
In each of these key metrics, our results in the second quarter were very strong. Free cash flow for the quarter, which excludes the impact of the economic stimulus, increased 12.2% to $1.5 billion, primarily reflecting growth in consolidated operating cash flow, partially offset by increases in working capital, cash interest expense and capital expenditures. Second quarter free cash flow per share increased 12.5% to $0.54 per share. We generated earnings per share of $0.37 for the second quarter. However, excluding NBCUniversal transaction-related costs and $137 million nonrecurring, noncash income tax charge resulting from a state tax law change, earnings per share increased 27.3% to $0.42 per share. Please refer to Table 4 in the press release for more detail on these items. 
Let's go to Slide 5. As you know, we view Comcast and NBCUniversal as 2 distinct pools of cash flow generation and funding capacity. Both Comcast and NBCUniversal's first priority is to generate strong returns by reinvesting in their core businesses. Beyond this reinvestment, NBCUniversal retained its free cash flow to fund future equity redemptions by General Electric, while Comcast allocate its free cash flow to consistent return capital to shareholders. As I mentioned before, in the second quarter, our free cash flow increased 12.2% to $1.5 billion. For the first half of the year, we generated $3.7 billion of free cash flow, an increase of 15.4% over the first half of 2010. Year-to-date, free cash flow per share has increased 16.5% to $1.34 per share. 
As you can see in this slide in the second quarter, Comcast, which includes both Cable Communications and Corporate and Other, accounted for $1.3 billion or 88% of total free cash flow, and NBCUniversal contribute $175 million. For the first half of 2011, Comcast accounted for $3.1 billion or 84% of total free cash flow, and NBCUniversal contributed $612 million of free cash flow. 
In the second quarter, we returned $836 million or 62% of Comcast's free cash flow to our shareholders, including share repurchases, totaling $525 million and dividend payments totaling $311 million. We are executing our 2011 financial plan, including this year's planned completion of our existing share repurchase authorization, which now has $1.1 billion remaining and will be reviewed by our board at year end. Please refer to Slide 6 for our pro forma results. 
Now let's take a look at pro forma results of our Cable and NBCUniversal businesses, which is how we evaluate the performance of the organization into segments. We believe the pro forma presentation provides a more meaningful comparison of the operating performance of the businesses. In the second quarter, consolidated pro forma revenue of $14.3 billion increased 9.4% compared to last year's results, and consolidated pro forma operating cash flow increased 6.7% to $4.8 billion. Included in pro forma operating cash flow for the second quarter, a noncash acquisition-related accounting revisions and costs totaling $131 million, which impact NBCUniversal's Cable Networks, Broadcast and Film results. 
Excluding these items, consolidated pro forma operating cash flow increased 9.6%. In the second quarter, pro forma Cable Communications revenue increased 5.6% and represented 65% of consolidated revenue, while pro forma operating cash flow grew 6.8% and represented 81% of consolidated operating cash flow. I will review our Cable results in more detail on the next few slides, but let me now review NBCUniversal's results. 
NBCUniversal revenue increased 17.1% with double-digit revenue increases across all 4 segments, and operating cash flow increased 5.2%. Excluding the $131 million of acquisition-related accounting revisions and costs, NBCUniversal operating cash flow increased 18.9% for the quarter. As we review NBCUniversal segments, the Cable Networks generated $2.2 billion in revenue, an increase of 12.6%, driven by a 10% increase in distribution revenue and a 10% increase in advertising revenue. Other revenue increased 44% or $59 million, primarily due to increases in the licensing of own content from the Cable production studio. 
Cable Net's second quarter operating cash flow increased to $846 million or 1.1%. Excluding the acquisition-related accounting revisions and costs of $48 million, Cable Net's operating cash flow increased 6.8% as we are reinvesting some of the top line growth and original programming and incur higher marketing expenses to support the recent launches of new series and other new programming across a number of our Cable Networks.
As we move to Broadcast, second quarter Broadcast Television revenue increased 18.5% to $1.7 billion, reflecting higher advertising revenue from improved pricing and ratings at the NBC broadcast network, as well as higher content licensing revenue, which includes the immediate recognition of revenue related to prior season and library content being made available under a new licensing agreement. Broadcast operating cash flow increased 8.8% to $190 million. Excluding the acquisition-related accounting revisions and costs of $56 million, Broadcast operating cash flow increased 40.8%. These results reflect higher revenue, partially offset by increased Programming costs associated with a greater number of original primetime series compared to the second quarter of 2010 and higher news coverage costs during the quarter. 
With regards to Filmed Entertainment, revenue increased 21% to $1.3 billion this quarter, driven by higher theatrical revenue from the strong box office performance of Fast Five and Bridesmaids, partially offset by lower content licensing from the pay-TV window and lower home entertainment revenue due to a decline in DVD sales. 
Film operating cash flow for the quarter was $27 million compared to $4 million in 2010. Excluding acquisition-related accounting revisions and costs of $20 million, OCF was $47 million in the quarter. These results reflect strong theatrical revenue growth, partially offset by higher marketing costs for the second and third quarter film releases. In order to manage our net investment in film production, we are utilizing third-party financing to cover part of the film slates. For example, we own 25% of Cowboys and Aliens, which is coproduced with other studios, and Universal only distributes the film domestically. 
Switching to Theme Parks. Both the Orlando and Hollywood parks continue to perform very well. And revenue increased 22.5% to $147 million, reflecting strong attendance and per capita spending at both parks, which are benefiting from the success of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Orlando and King Kong in Hollywood. 
Second quarter operating cash flow increased to $119 million compared to $46 million for the same period last year. As you know, we now own 100% of the Orlando Park as we closed this transaction on July 1. Beginning in the third quarter, we will consolidate 100% of Orlando's results, and we are very pleased with the park's performance, which with the June 30 quarter end, Orlando's last 12 months operating cash flow is $577 million. We have financed this transaction with internal funds and are now refinancing some of Universal Orlando's existing debt facilities to lower interest costs for NBCUniversal. 
Please refer to Slide 7 to now review our Cable Communications results. We had another solid quarter of financial and customer growth in our Cable segment. For the second quarter, pro forma Cable Communications revenue increased 5.6% to $9.3 billion, reflecting solid performance in our recurring residential businesses and continued strength in Business Services, partially offset by a slowdown in pay-per-view and advertising revenue. 
Cable advertising revenue increased 3.7%, reflecting lower political revenue and a slowdown in foreign automotive advertising, which was caused by a shortfall in auto supplies related to the challenges in Japan. Excluding political revenue, Cable advertising increased 7.5%. As a reminder, we generated over $180 million of political ad revenue in 2010, including $100 million in the fourth quarter, which will continue to impact our sequential growth rates and make comparisons more challenging as the year progresses. 
The core Cable business is performing well as we are effectively managing this business for profitable growth. Total revenue per Video customer increased 9% to $138 per month in the second quarter, reflecting strong ARPU management and higher contribution from Comcast Business Services and an increasing number of residential customers taking multiple products. 
Despite the typical seasonality in our Cable markets, in the second quarter, we added 99,000 total Video, High-Speed Internet and Voice customers equal to an 18.2% increase from last year's second quarter. We are competing better with improved products and are focused on retention and customer service has continued to reduce churn for all of our services. 
As we look at the individual Service categories, second quarter Video revenue increased 1.3%, reflecting great adjustment in about 2/3 of our systems year-to-date and increasing number of customers taking higher levels of digital and Advanced Services, partially offset by lower pay-per-view revenue and Video customer losses. In the second quarter, we lost 238,000 Video customers, 10% improvement over the second quarter of 2010 despite seasonal weakness in a competitive footprint that is grown by over 1.5 million homes. 
High-Speed Internet revenue increased 10.3% during the quarter, reflecting rate adjustments, continued growth in our customer base and an increasing number of our customers taking higher-speed services. Today, 24% of our residential High-Speed Internet customers take the higher-speed tiers. As we continue to differentiate our products through Service and speed enhancements, our High-Speed Internet services is capturing market share. 
In the second quarter, we added 144,000 new High-Speed Internet customers, and our penetration is now at 34% of our homes passed. Voice revenue increased 7% for the quarter, reflecting continued success with our Triple Play offering. In the second quarter, we added 193,000 Voice customers as the value and benefits of our Triple Play is recognized. We continue to focus on providing multiple services to our customers. And at the end of the second quarter, 35% of our Video customers took all 3 services compared to 31% at the end of last year's second quarter. 
As I mentioned previously, we continue to see real momentum and opportunity in Business Services with revenue increasing 41.7% in the quarter to $435 million in accretive margins. Please refer to Slide 8 to review pro forma Cable Communications operating cash flow. Second quarter pro forma Cable Communications operating cash flow increased 6.8% to $3.9 billion, resulting in a margin of 41.6%, a 40 basis point improvement compared to last year's second quarter. For the first half of 2011, Cable operating cash flow increased 7.2% to $7.6 billion resulting in a margin of 41.4%, a 50 basis point improvement compared to the same period last year. 
In the second quarter, total expenses in Cable increased 4.8%, primarily reflecting higher Video Programming and marketing expenses, as well as continued investment to expand the capabilities in Business Services. Sales and marketing expenses, which have consistently been around 6% of Cable revenue for the past year reflects our ongoing investment in the direct and retail channels. In the second quarter, marketing expenses increased 15.5% as a result of higher retail commissions and increased overall advertising and media spend. 
In the second quarter, bad debt expense improved as we continue to refine our retention, collection and screening processes. In addition, customer service expenses continue to be relatively flat this quarter as we continue to gain efficiencies even as we focus on improving service, reducing churn and increasing customer satisfaction. 
Please refer to Slide 9 to review our Cable Communications capital expenditures. In the second quarter, Cable capital expenditures are tracking to plan and increased 5.5% to $1.2 billion equal to 12.6% of revenue, reflecting higher investments in network infrastructure in Business Services to enhance and expand our product offerings, partially offset by lower CPU spending. 
In the second quarter of 2011, we deployed 1.5 million digital adapters for a total of 20.6 million digital adapters deployed since inception of the All-Digital project. We are now 89% complete with All-Digital, and we expect to complete this project by the end of the year. During the quarter, we also deployed 494,000 advanced HD and/or DVR set-top boxes, and we added 132,000 advanced service customers. We now have 10.5 million HD and/or DVR customers equal to 52% of our digital customer base. 
In the second quarter, we increased our investment in network infrastructure to enable product enhancements, including increasing Internet speeds to our customers to reinforce our product leadership in High-Speed Internet. We are raising speeds of our flagship product from 12 to 15 megabits and raising speeds of our blast product from 20 to 25 megabits. In addition, we have recently introduced faster tiers of Service as our 50 megabit Service is now available to more than 45 million homes or almost 90% of our footprint. And our extreme 105 megabit Service is available to more than 40 million homes or approximately 80% of our footprint. 
Second quarter CapEx also reflects meaningful investments to support the continued growth in Business Services and to expand our efforts in the midsized business area. Our investment in Business Services increased 40% to $154 million in the second quarter and has increased 48% to $305 million through the first half of 2011. Year-to-date, capital expenditures increased 10% to $2.2 billion, equal to 12.1% of revenue. We are executing well on our capital plan. We continue to expect our full year Cable CapEx will be lower as a percentage of Cable revenue when compared to 2010 even as we invest capital in areas that provide attractive returns, expand our product offerings and drive future organic growth. 
Now let me turn the call back to Brian."

Since we just passed the 6-month anniversary mark for NBCUniversal, it does seem a good time to give a quick update on how we're doing. The bottom line is we're off to a very good start. As we said previously, 2011 is both a transition year",910,"Thanks, Brian. Since we just passed the 6-month anniversary mark for NBCUniversal, it does seem a good time to give a quick update on how we're doing. The bottom line is we're off to a very good start. As we said previously, 2011 is both a transition year and an investment year so we can better position the company's assets for future growth. The good news is we're making investments, and they're starting to work. We're also successfully juggling the goals of investing in growing operating cash flow at the same time. 
Now let me give you some examples of the types of investment we are making. I'll start with the new show, The Voice. Shortly after close, we realize The Voice was the type of broad-based concept that could be a big success for NBC, and we decided to really get behind it. We increased our production budget several times to make sure we would have 4 great coaches and high-quality performances. We then invested in marketing, so awareness was high when the show launched. Finally, we made The Voice the company's #1 promotional priority across all NBCUniversal assets, as well as Comcast Cable. The results surpassed our most optimistic expectations as The Voice became a bona fide hit and NBC's biggest new show in years. 
The Voice aired from April 26 to June 28 and along with America's Got Talent, The Voice helped NBC become the #1 network in the United States for 4 weeks at the end of the quarter. Despite the increased investment, The Voice also helped our financial performance in the second quarter at both the network and our own television stations. We've invested in other new shows for our primetime schedule and expect to have a competitive lineup this fall and next spring. We'll bring The Voice back mid-season and put it behind the 2012 Super Bowl. We expect The Voice will be an important cornerstone of our schedule and hopefully participate in the network's turnaround in the future. 
Moving on to another part of our broadcast group, we also invested in our own television stations during the first half of this year. We're focusing on improving local news and think there's a real opportunity to increase news ratings. We are adding news hours and about 135 people across 10 television stations, including over 40 reporters, 20 producers and investigative units in 5 markets. While it will take time for these investments to pay off, we're already seeing some improvements in markets like New York. 
Moving to Telemundo. We launched the telenovela named that became a big hit, driving our primetime ratings up 22%. Given the growth in the Hispanic market, we think Telemundo is an attractive growth opportunity for us in the future. 
At our Cable channels, we had a strong quarter with double-digit revenue growth on the majority of our channels. During the second quarter, we aired 58 original series, including 12 new series and increased the total number of the original episodes by 12% versus the prior year. New shows depressed cash flow initially as we spend to launch the amortized production cost, but ultimately if successful, new shows become profitable in their own right and drive CPM and affiliate fee increases in the future. 
During the quarter, USA launched 2 new shows necessary roughness that became top 10 Cable shows. These are 2 shows that were green lit after the deal closed, which now promise to be important new franchises for USA for many years to come. SCI FI launched its most-watched new show in 2 years, and Bravo had its best second quarter ever as the Real Housewives of New Jersey had its highest-rated season premier in history. 
We also saw invested for future growth in other parts of the company. Mike mentioned our new deal to purchase the 50% of the Universal Orlando we didn't own. We think our Theme Parks represent a great growth opportunity and we're doing well currently on both coast with Harry Potter in Orlando and King Kong in Hollywood. 
We think our Olympics deal represents a smart investment and one that will be profitable over the term of the new agreement. And finally, we've invested in our people and made a lot of very strong senior hires in the last 6 months, which will help position us well for the future. The last area I'd like to touch on is how we put the collective power of NBCUniversal and Comcast behind the investments once we make them. We call this strategy Symphony, and it's been behind our success on shows like The Voice and big films like Hop. 
Comcast Cable got behind both and promoted them across its multiple platforms, including Video On Demand and online. We're also working on many other opportunities, including targeted and interactive advertising. And just last week, announced that we're beginning to use dynamic ad insertion on our OnDemand platform with Programming from USA, E! SCI FI, Bravo and Oxygen. We believe enabling dynamic ad insertion will create more value for advertisers, for NBCUniversal and other content owners and for Comcast Cable, as well as allowing us to present more relevant advertising to our customers. 
So in summary, after 6 months, we're feeling very positive. We know there's a lot of work still to do, but we're very pleased with our progress and feel like there's still a lot of opportunity in the quarters and years to come."

We're innovating at an accelerated pace and delivering great new products to our customers. Our customer service is a focused priority and continues to improve. As a result, we're driving solid growth, both financially and from a customer perspective. And we believe this momentum is sustainable for several reasons. 
First, we're competing better with superior products. Our major platform initiatives, All-Digital and DOCSIS 3.0, are nearing completion with All-Digital in 89% of our markets, DOCSIS 3.0 deployed in 90% of our footprint and our Content Delivery Network for OnDemand in the majority of our markets. These major platform upgrades are the foundation enabling us to deliver better products to our customers to drive faster innovation.

We're doing this by standardizing best practices from across the country, which has improved both our effectiveness and efficiency. We're focusing on 2 different areas: convenience and reliability. From a convenience perspective, we're making it easier for customers to interact with us and on their schedule. We're providing customers a better online experience, and recently, we've also rolled out to our Service windows and a customer guarantee that we'll always be on time. 
On the reliability front, we're using much better tools to monitor the network, so we can diagnose and quickly resolve a network outage issue and often before customers even realize there's a problem. This quarter, repeat service calls, which means that we'd have to go back and fix something a second time, improved by 15%. And repair phone calls or the number of times customers called us to fix a problem improved by 9%. 
We also estimate that by the end of this year, we'll have reduced Service-related truck rolls by 2 million and Service-related phone calls by 10 million compared to 2009. That equates to a real savings. That's taking unnecessary noise out of the system. All this is tough block-and-tackle work, but I'm really pleased with the focus and execution of our field teams. 
Finally, we're building a strong growth engine. Our marketing team is effectively targeting the right offers to the right customers and strengthening our XFINITY brand. Our sales teams are effectively selling and as evidenced by our 9% ARPU growth year-to-date. We've built an effective retention marketing team, and the entire business is focused on retaining our customers. We're more precise in our upfront credit screening, our call handling and our promotional roll-off tactics. Our customer churn has been down across all 3 products for the past 6 months in a row. In fact, retention has been the biggest driver of our net gain improvement. Last but not least, we continue to invest in Business Services, and the team there is delivering. SMB continues to be our primary growth driver, but at the same time, new businesses like Metro-E and are expected to become solid contributors in 2012 and beyond. So overall, I'm pleased with the progress we've made over the past year. I think some of the fundamental changes we've made, along with disciplined execution, will continue to yield positive results.

I think in general, we see this year and next year probably as investment years. We think the business, particularly on the Broadcast side, has not gotten the investment necessary to really compete. And so I think our focus right now is on product and making sure that we have a competitive NBC primetime schedule, making sure that the stations have the right kind of resources to be competitive in the local markets. And the juggling act that we're going through, which we've been successful at for the first half is to continue to grow OCF while making the investments that are going to pay off in the future. I do think that content is more valuable today than the data did the deal.  It's interesting if you go back, it's over 18 months ago when we actually signed the deal with General Electric. I think retransmission consent now is a bigger number than it was then. The kind of money that online Video providers are paying for content is infinitely, almost significantly greater than it was 18 months ago. So in my opinion, content is more valuable and the outlook, particularly for Broadcast Television, is much rosier than it was 18 months ago. But at the same time, I want to caution everyone, we're in fourth place at NBC. We've got a lot of investments, and we've told people that it doesn't happen in 1 year, probably won't even happen in 2 years. It might take 3 or 4. I'm very confident we will get there, but we need to invest along the way. I wouldn't expect any miracles financially or in terms of performance."

We responded very quickly by adjusting our channel mix, more DRT, more digital, more direct. And we saw connect improvement in late June and into July. I think from a competitive perspective, I think the economy, as I said, is still slow. And it's caused some more aggressive offers. However, I don't think it's markedly different than what we've seen in the past, and we understand how to compete. I mean, my focus is really getting the quick response to the changing market conditions via target marketing sales effectiveness and retention.

We can't force that redemption right, which is 3 years from now. So obviously, pretty far away. If they so choose to exercise that right, then we have, you're right, the option to increase from roughly 68% to 100%. I think we'll evaluate that very carefully at that point in time. That's quite a ways away. And our goal is at NBCUniversal generate the financial capacity to meet that possible redemption. So it's hard to forecast what one will do in 3-plus years from now. But also if we were to exercise our option, we would extinguish the carried interest, which would last another 3.5 years, which we believe has real value creation for our shareholders.

I think in terms of ability to drive the PSUs, I think a lot of that's in the marketing of the product, it's in the product itself and it's in the execution of the sales team. So it's all of 3 things combined. And it's obviously in the customer service. So I think PSUs are driven in part by the branding, but it's got to be backed up by great product and great service."

Today, I'm pleased to report that we achieved strong operating and financial results for the second quarter in Cable and in NBCUniversal. These results demonstrate our operational focus while also speeding up i",690,"Thanks, Marlene, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm pleased to report that we achieved strong operating and financial results for the second quarter in Cable and in NBCUniversal. These results demonstrate our operational focus while also speeding up innovation and investing in content to strengthen our brands and our franchises. 
So let me begin with Cable. In the second quarter, revenue was up by nearly 6%. Operating cash flow increased by nearly 7%, and Cable generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow. Customer additions for our combined video, voice and data services increased by 18%, continuing the trend of improving year-over-year performance even in a seasonally weak quarter. Our high-speed Internet service was once again one of the real highlights and was the largest contributor to Cable's growth this quarter. The second quarter marks the eighth quarter in a row where we significantly outpaced the net additions of our competitors. This is due to strong execution and expanding differentiation between our high-speed service and DSL. 
Business services was another significant contributor to Cable's performance in the second quarter with 42% growth in revenue. This business has solid momentum, and we are continuing to build its capabilities for future growth, including expanding Metro E services to 20 of our major markets. We also made steady improvements in our operating performance metrics, marking another quarter with better customer retention and Service scores and higher customer satisfaction. We have real operational focus and are making our service and the overall XFINITY experience the best in the business. As we continue to use our scale to our advantage, we are delivering new products and faster innovation to our Cable customers. 
Our current and future services represent an exciting new product roadmap that includes higher-speed Internet, a growing array of IP and cloud-based applications, new offerings like XFINITY Signature Support and new lines of businesses like home security. And soon working with Skype, we will also begin to offer a new high-definition video calling experience right to your television. What is particularly exciting is the leverage we are gaining from the previous significant investments we made in our network. So it's easier and faster now to drive new technologies and product innovation. I believe all this, together with our initiatives to transform the customer experience, is generating results and helping us make sustainable improvements that will continue to yield benefits. 
So let me now switch to NBCUniversal. As you know, our overarching goal for NBC and Universal is to build long-term value. And yes, there'll be some hits and misses and a bit more volatility, but I continue to believe that our timing was just right as we have benefited from a much stronger advertising market since we signed the agreement in your seamless integration, mostly the continuing strength of many of their businesses, particularly the Cable channels with their wonderful brands. 
We had a busy quarter. We invested in lots of new shows in both Cable and Broadcast. We extended our NHL rights. We purchased the other 50% of Universal Orlando and brought together all of our company's capabilities in a successful and I think important bid for the Olympics. 
Our Olympic rights now stretch over a decade and extend to all technology and media. However, they may change through the year 2020, giving us real opportunity to build out the network and Cable and digital capabilities of NBCUniversal and to make the Olympics profitable for our company over the term of this new agreement. 
Even as we invest, NBCUniversal's second quarter financial results highlight the health of its businesses with double-digit revenue growth in each of its segments and 19% operating cash flow growth when you exclude accounting adjustments related to the acquisition. So all in all, I'm very pleased with our financial and operating performance so far this year. We are making real progress on all fronts. We have strong recurring revenue businesses. We're focused on operational excellence, and we have a disciplined investment approach that is yielding positive results and will continue to build value. 
With that, let me now pass to Michael to cover the second quarter results in detail."
173341,134605136,151344,"Comcast Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2011",2011-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Comcast Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Brian. Let me begin by briefly reviewing our consolidated financial results starting on Slide 4. Overall, we were very pleased with second quarter results. Second quarter consolidated revenue increased 50.5% to $14.3 billion, and consolidated o",2308,"Thank you, Brian. Let me begin by briefly reviewing our consolidated financial results starting on Slide 4. Overall, we were very pleased with second quarter results. Second quarter consolidated revenue increased 50.5% to $14.3 billion, and consolidated operating cash flow grew 28.5% to $4.8 billion. In addition to revenue and operating cash flow, we remain focused on free cash flow, free cash flow per share and earnings per share as important metrics in evaluating the performance and strength of the company. 
In each of these key metrics, our results in the second quarter were very strong. Free cash flow for the quarter, which excludes the impact of the economic stimulus, increased 12.2% to $1.5 billion, primarily reflecting growth in consolidating operating cash flow, partially offset by increases in working capital, cash interest expense and capital expenditures. 
Second quarter free cash flow per share increased 12.5% to $0.54 per share. We generated earnings per share of $0.37 for the second quarter. However, excluding NBCUniversal transaction-related costs and $137 million nonrecurring, noncash income tax charge resulting from a state tax law change, earnings per share increased 27.3% to $0.42 per share. Please refer to Table 4 in the press release for more detail on these items. 
Let's go to Slide 5. As you know, we view Comcast and NBCUniversal as 2 distinct pools of cash flow generation and funding capacity. Both Comcast and NBCUniversal's first priority is to generate strong returns by reinvesting in their core businesses. Beyond this reinvestment, NBCUniversal retained its free cash flow to fund future equity redemptions by General Electric, while Comcast allocated free cash flow to consistently return capital to shareholders. 
As I mentioned before, in the second quarter, our free cash flow increased 12.2% to $1.5 billion. For the first half of the year, we generated $3.7 billion of free cash flow, an increase of 15.4% over the first half of 2010. Year-to-date, free cash flow per share has increased 16.5% to $1.34 per share. 
As you can see in this slide in the second quarter, Comcast, which includes both Cable Communications and Corporate and Other, accounted for $1.3 billion or 88% of total free cash flow, and NBCUniversal contribute $175 million. For the first half of 2011, Comcast accounted for $3.1 billion or 84% of total free cash flow, and NBCUniversal contributed $612 million of free cash flow. 
In the second quarter, we returned $836 million or 62% of Comcast's free cash flow to our shareholders, including share repurchases, totaling $525 million and dividend payments totaling $311 million. We are executing our 2011 financial plan, including this year's planned completion of our existing share repurchase authorization, which now has $1.1 billion remaining and will be reviewed by our board at year end. 
Please refer to Slide 6 for our pro forma results.  Now let's take a look at pro forma results of our Cable and NBCUniversal businesses, which is how we evaluate the performance of the organization in the segments. We believe the pro forma presentation provides a more meaningful comparison of the operating performance of the businesses. In the second quarter, consolidated pro forma revenue of $14.3 billion increased 9.4% compared to last year's results, and consolidated pro forma operating cash flow increased 6.7% to $4.8 billion. Included in pro forma operating cash flow for the second quarter, a noncash acquisition-related accounting revisions and costs totaling $131 million, which impact NBCUniversal's Cable Networks, Broadcast and Film results. Excluding these items, consolidated pro forma operating cash flow increased 9.6%. 
In the second quarter, pro forma Cable Communications revenue increased 5.6% and represented 65% of consolidated revenue, while pro forma operating cash flow grew 6.8% and represented 81% of consolidated operating cash flow. I will review our Cable results in more detail on the next few slides, but let me now review NBCUniversal's results. 
NBCUniversal revenue increased 17.1% with double-digit revenue increases across all 4 segments, and operating cash flow increased 5.2%. Excluding the $131 million of acquisition-related accounting revisions and costs, NBCUniversal operating cash flow increased 18.9% for the quarter. As we review NBCUniversal segments, the Cable Networks generated $2.2 billion in revenue, an increase of 12.6%, driven by a 10% increase in distribution revenue and a 10% increase in advertising revenue. Other revenue increased 44% or $59 million, primarily due to increases in the licensing of own content from the Cable production studio. 
Cable Net's second quarter operating cash flow increased to $846 million or 1.1%. Excluding the acquisition-related accounting revisions and costs of $48 million, Cable Net's operating cash flow increased 6.8% as we are reinvesting some of the top line growth and original programming and incur higher marketing expenses to support the recent launches of new series and other new programming across a number of our Cable Networks.
As we move to Broadcast, second quarter Broadcast Television revenue increased 18.5% to $1.7 billion, reflecting higher advertising revenue from improved pricing and ratings at the NBC broadcast network, as well as higher content licensing revenue, which includes the immediate recognition of revenue related to prior season and library content being made available under a new licensing agreement. 
Broadcast operating cash flow increased 8.8% to $190 million. Excluding the acquisition-related accounting revisions and costs of $56 million, Broadcast operating cash flow increased 40.8%. These results reflect higher revenue, partially offset by increased programming costs associated with a greater number of original primetime series compared to the second quarter of 2010 and higher news coverage costs during the quarter. 
With regards to Filmed Entertainment, revenue increased 21% to $1.3 billion this quarter, driven by higher theatrical revenue from the strong box office performance of Fast Five and Bridesmaids, partially offset by lower content licensing from the pay-TV window and lower home entertainment revenue due to a decline in DVD sales. 
Film operating cash flow for the quarter was $27 million compared to $4 million in 2010. Excluding acquisition-related accounting revisions and costs of $20 million, OCF was $47 million in the quarter. These results reflect strong theatrical revenue growth, partially offset by higher marketing costs for the second and third quarter film releases. In order to manage our net investment in film production, we are utilizing third-party financing to cover part of the film slates. For example, we own 25% of Cowboys and Aliens, which is coproduced with other studios, and Universal only distributes the film domestically. 
Switching to Theme Parks. Both the Orlando and Hollywood parks continue to perform very well. And revenue increased 22.5% to $147 million, reflecting strong attendance and per capita spending at both parks, which are benefiting from the success of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Orlando and King Kong in Hollywood. 
Second quarter operating cash flow increased to $119 million compared to $46 million for the same period last year. As you know, we now own 100% of the Orlando park as we closed this transaction on July 1. Beginning in the third quarter, we will consolidate 100% of Orlando's results, and we are very pleased with the park's performance, which with the June 30 quarter end, Orlando's last 12 months operating cash flow is $577 million. We have financed this transaction with internal funds and are now refinancing some of Universal Orlando's existing debt facilities to lower interest costs for NBCUniversal. 
Please refer to Slide 7 to now review our Cable Communications results. We had another solid quarter of financial and customer growth in our Cable segment. For the second quarter, pro forma Cable Communications revenue increased 5.6% to $9.3 billion, reflecting solid performance in our recurring residential businesses and continued strength in business services, partially offset by a slowdown in Pay-Per-View and advertising revenue. 
Cable advertising revenue increased 3.7%, reflecting lower political revenue and a slowdown in foreign automotive advertising, which was caused by a shortfall in auto supplies related to the challenges in Japan. Excluding political revenue, Cable advertising increased 7.5%. As a reminder, we generated over $180 million of political ad revenue in 2010, including $100 million in the fourth quarter, which will continue to impact our sequential growth rates and make comparisons more challenging as the year progresses. 
The core Cable business is performing well as we are effectively managing this business for profitable growth. Total revenue per video customer increased 9% to $138 per month in the second quarter, reflecting strong ARPU management and higher contribution from Comcast Business Services and an increasing number of residential customers taking multiple products. 
Despite the typical seasonality in our Cable markets in the second quarter, we added 99,000 total video, high-speed Internet and voice customers equal to an 18.2% increase from last year's second quarter. We are competing better with improved products and our focus on retention and customer service has continued to reduce churn for all of our services. 
As we look at the individual service categories, second quarter video revenue increased 1.3%, reflecting great adjustment in about 2/3 of our systems year-to-date and an increasing number of customers taking higher levels of digital and advanced services, partially offset by lower pay-per-view revenue and video customer losses. In the second quarter, we lost 238,000 video customers, a 10% improvement over the second quarter of 2010 despite seasonal weakness in a competitive footprint that has grown by over 1.5 million homes. 
High-speed Internet revenue increased 10.3% during the quarter, reflecting rate adjustments, continued growth in our customer base and an increasing number of our customers taking higher-speed services. Today, 24% of our residential high-speed Internet customers take the higher-speed tiers. As we continue to differentiate our products through service and speed enhancements, our high-speed Internet services is capturing market share.
In the second quarter, we added 144,000 new high-speed Internet customers, and our penetration is now at 34% of our homes passed. Voice revenue increased 7% for the quarter, reflecting continued success with our Triple Play offering. In the second quarter, we added 193,000 voice customers as the value and benefits of our Triple Play is recognized. We continue to focus on providing multiple services to our customers. And at the end of the second quarter, 35% of our video customers took all 3 services compared to 31% at the end of last year's second quarter. 
As I mentioned previously, we continue to see real momentum and opportunity in business services with revenue increasing 41.7% in the quarter to $435 million in accretive margins. 
Please refer to Slide 8 to review pro forma Cable Communications operating cash flow. Second quarter pro forma Cable Communications operating cash flow increased 6.8% to $3.9 billion, resulting in a margin of 41.6%, a 40 basis point improvement compared to last year's second quarter. For the first half of 2011, Cable operating cash flow increased 7.2% to $7.6 billion resulting in a margin of 41.4%, a 50 basis point improvement compared to the same period last year. 
In the second quarter, total expenses in Cable increased 4.8%, primarily reflecting higher video programming and marketing expenses, as well as continued investment to expand the capabilities in business services. Sales and marketing expenses, which have consistently been around 6% of Cable revenue for the past year reflect our ongoing investment in the direct and retail channels. In the second quarter, marketing expenses increased 15.5% as a result of higher retail commissions and increased overall advertising and media spend. 
In the second quarter, bad debt expense improved as we continue to refine our retention, collection and screening processes. In addition, customer service expenses continue to be relatively flat this quarter as we continue to gain efficiencies even as we focus on improving service, reducing churn and increasing customer satisfaction. 
Please refer to Slide 9 to review our Cable Communications capital expenditures. In the second quarter, Cable capital expenditures are tracking to plan and increased 5.5% to $1.2 billion equal to 12.6% of revenue, reflecting higher investments in network infrastructure in business services to enhance and expand our product offerings, partially offset by lower CPU spending. 
In the second quarter of 2011, we deployed 1.5 million digital adapters for a total of 20.6 million digital adapters deployed since the inception of the All-Digital project. We are now 89% complete with All-Digital, and we expect to complete this project by the end of the year. During the quarter, we also deployed 494,000 advanced HD and/or DVR set-top boxes, and we added 132,000 advanced service customers. We now have 10.5 million HD and/or DVR customers equal to 52% of our digital customer base. 
In the second quarter, we increased our investment in network infrastructure to enable product enhancements, including increasing Internet speeds to our customers to reinforce our product leadership in high-speed Internet. We are raising speeds of our flagship product from 12 to 15 megabits and raising speeds of our Blast! product from 20 to 25 megabits. In addition, we have recently introduced faster tiers of service as our 50 megabit service is now available to more than 45 million homes or almost 90% of our footprint. And our extreme 105 megabit service is available to more than 40 million homes or approximately 80% of our footprint. 
Second quarter CapEx also reflects meaningful investments to support the continued growth in business services and to expand our efforts in the mid-sized business area. Our investment in business services increased 40% to $154 million in the second quarter and has increased 48% to $305 million through the first half of 2011. Year-to-date, capital expenditures increased 10% to $2.2 billion, equal to 12.1% of revenue. We are executing well on our capital plan. And we continue to expect our full year Cable CapEx will be lower as a percentage of Cable revenue when compared to 2010 even as we invest capital in areas that provide attractive returns, expand our product offerings and drive future organic growth. 
Now let me turn the call back to Brian."

Since we just passed the 6-month anniversary mark for the NBCUniversal, it does seem a good time to give a quick update on how we're doing. The bottom line is we're off to a very good start. As we've said previously, 2011 is both a transi",916,"Thanks, Brian. Since we just passed the 6-month anniversary mark for the NBCUniversal, it does seem a good time to give a quick update on how we're doing. 
The bottom line is we're off to a very good start. As we've said previously, 2011 is both a transition year and an investment year so we can better position the company's assets for future growth. The good news is we're making investments, and they're starting to work. We're also successfully juggling the goals of investing and growing operating cash flow at the same time. 
Now let me give you some examples of the types of investment we are making. I'll start with the new show, The Voice. Shortly after close, we realized The Voice was the type of broad-based concept that could be a big success for NBC, and we decided to really get behind it. We increased our production budget several times to make sure we would have 4 great coaches and high-quality performances. We then invested in marketing, so awareness was high when the show launched. Finally, we made The Voice the company's #1 promotional priority across all NBCUniversal assets, as well as Comcast Cable. The results surpassed our most optimistic expectations as The Voice became a bona fide hit and NBC's biggest new show in years. 
The Voice aired from April 26 to June 28 and along with America's Got Talent, The Voice helped NBC become the #1 network in the United States for 4 weeks at the end of the quarter. Despite the increased investment, The Voice also helped our financial performance in the second quarter at both the network and our own television stations. We've invested in other new shows for our primetime schedule and expect to have a competitive lineup this fall and next spring. We'll bring The Voice back mid-season and put it behind the 2012 Super Bowl. We expect The Voice will be an important cornerstone of our schedule and hopefully participate in the network's turnaround in the future. 
Moving on to another part of our broadcast group, we also invested in our own television stations during the first half of this year. We're focusing on improving local news and think there's a real opportunity to increase news ratings. We're adding news hours and about 135 people across 10 television stations, including over 40 reporters, 20 producers and investigative units in 5 markets. While it will take time for these investments to pay off, we're already seeing some improvements in markets like New York. 
Moving to Telemundo. We launched the telenovela named, La Reina del Sur that became a big hit, driving our primetime ratings up 22%. Given the growth in the Hispanic market, we think Telemundo is an attractive growth opportunity for us in the future. 
At our Cable channels, we had a strong quarter with double-digit revenue growth on the majority of our channels. During the second quarter, we aired 58 original series, including 12 new series and increased the total number of the original episodes by 12% versus the prior year. New shows depressed cash flow initially as we spent to launch them in amortized production cost. But ultimately if successful, new shows become profitable in their own right and drive CPM and affiliate fee increases in the future. 
During the quarter, USA launched 2 new shows, Suits and Necessary Roughness that became top 10 Cable shows. These are 2 shows that were greenlit after the deal closed, which now promise to be important new franchises for USA for many years to come. Syfy launched Alphas, its most-watched new show in 2 years. And Bravo had its best second quarter ever as the Real Housewives of New Jersey had its highest-rated season premiere in history. 
We also saw invested for future growth in other parts of the company. Mike mentioned our new deal to purchase the 50% of the Universal Orlando we didn't own. We think our Theme Parks represent a great growth opportunity, and we're doing well currently on both coast with Harry Potter in Orlando and King Kong in Hollywood. 
We think our Olympics deal represents a smart investment and one that will be profitable over the term of the new agreement. And finally, we've invested in our people and made a lot of very strong senior hires in the last 6 months, which will help position us well for the future. 
The last area I'd like to touch on is how we put the collective power of NBCUniversal and Comcast behind key investments once we make them. We call this strategy, Symphony, and it's been behind our success on shows like The Voice and big films like Hop. 
Comcast Cable got behind both and promoted them across its multiple platforms, including Video On Demand and online. We're also working on many other opportunities, including targeted and interactive advertising, and just last week, announced that we're beginning to use dynamic ad insertion on our On Demand platform with programming from USA, E!, Syfy, Bravo and Oxygen. We believe enabling dynamic ad insertion will create more value for advertisers, for NBCUniversal and other content owners and for Comcast Cable, as well as allowing us to present more relevant advertising to our customers. 
So in summary, after 6 months, we're feeling very positive. We know there's a lot of work still to do, but we're very pleased with our progress and feel like there's still a lot of opportunity in the quarters and years to come."

It's been an exciting year, and I've been really pleased with the team and our execution. We're innovating at an accelerated pace and delivering great new products to our customers.

We're innovating at an accelerated pace and delivering great new products to our customers. Our customer service is a focused priority and continues to improve. As a result, we're driving solid growth, both financially and from a customer perspective. And we believe this momentum is sustainable for several reasons. 
First, we're competing better with superior products. Our major platform initiatives, All-Digital and DOCSIS 3.0 are nearing completion with All-Digital in 89% of our markets, DOCSIS 3.0 deployed in 90% of our footprint and our Content Delivery Network for OnDemand in the majority of our markets. These major platform upgrades are the foundation enabling us to deliver better products to our customers to drive faster innovation. 
We're now delivering more high def and foreign-language programming, over 30,000 OnDemand choices, better program guides, more advanced advertising and higher speeds for our HSD customers. We've launched xfinityTV.com, our XFINITY TV app and catch up, keep up for VOD. And we're working on exciting new products, such as next generation TV next generation TV, 1 gigahertz HSD and dynamic ad insertion. I feel like we're just getting started on the innovation front. 
Second, we're improving customer service. Our objective is to fundamentally transform the customer experience, focusing on getting it right the first time and improving the reliability of our service. We're doing this by standardizing best practices from across the country, which has improved both our effectiveness and efficiency. We're focusing on 2 different areas: convenience and reliability. From a convenience perspective, we're making it easier for customers to interact with us and on their schedule. We're providing customers a better online experience, and recently, we've also rolled out 2-hour service windows and a customer guarantee that we'll always be on time. 
On the reliability front, we're using much better tools to monitor the network, so we can diagnose and quickly resolve a network outage issue and often before customers even realize there's a problem. This quarter, repeat service calls, which means that we'd have to go back and fix something a second time, improved by 15% and repair phone calls or the number of times customers called us to fix the problem improved by 9%. 
We also estimate that by the end of this year, we'll have reduced service-related truck rolls by 2 million and service-related phone calls by 10 million compared to 2009. That equates to real savings. That's taking unnecessary noise out of the system. All this is tough block-and-tackle work, but I'm really pleased with the focus and execution of our field teams. 
Finally, we're building a strong growth engine. Our marketing team is effectively targeting the right offers to the right customers and strengthening our XFINITY brand. Our sales teams are effectively selling and as evidenced by our 9% ARPU growth year-to-date. We built an effective retention marketing team, and the entire business is focused on retaining our customers. We're more precise in our upfront credit screening, our call handling and our promotional roll-off tactics. Our customer churn has been down across all 3 products for the past 6 months in a row. In fact, retention has been the biggest driver of our net gain improvement. 
Last but not least, we continue to invest in business services, and the team there is delivering. SMB continues to be our primary growth driver, while at the same time, new businesses like Metro E and cell backhaul are expected to become solid contributors in 2012 and beyond. 
So overall, I'm pleased with the progress we've made over the past year. I think some of the fundamental changes we've made, along with disciplined execution, will continue to yield positive results. Marlene?"

I was just wondering if you look out sort of 1 or 2 years, do you see enough cost cuts that can occur that will still allow you to sort of maintain these nominally 41% OCF margins?

I think we're just taking noise out of the system, and I think that will hopefully continue as we just get a better experience. But it -- that's being offset obviously by compressing video margins. So it's hard to project going forward, but we're going stay the course. HSD seems to be gaining share at a good clip, and business services is up 42%. So I think we see continued growth in both those businesses."

I think in general, we see this year and next year probably as investment years. We think the business, particularly on the broadcast side, has not gotten the investment necessary to really compete. And so I think our focus right now is on product and making sure that we have a competitive NBC primetime schedule, making sure that the stations have the right kind of resources to be competitive in the local markets. And the juggling act that we're going through, which we've been successful at for the first half is to continue to grow OCF while making the investments that are going to pay off in the future. I do think that content is more valuable today than the day that we did the deal. It's interesting if you go back. It's over 18 months ago when we actually signed the deal with General Electric. I think retransmission consent now is a bigger number than it was then. The kind of money that online video providers are paying for content is infinitely, almost significantly greater than it was 18 months ago. So in my opinion, content is more valuable and the outlook, particularly for Broadcast Television, is much rosier than it was 18 months ago. But at the same time, I want to caution everyone, we're in fourth place at NBC. And we've got a lot of investments, and we've told people that it doesn't happen in 1 year, probably won't even happen in 2 years, it might take 3 or 4. I'm very confident we will get there, but we need to invest and -- along the way, I wouldn't expect any miracles financially or in terms of performance."

One pool is within the Comcast side, which the majority is being used to return capital through buybacks and dividends. Then with the NBCUniversal pool, which is primarily being used for ultimately an equity redemption from General Electric. Now #1, General Electric has to exercise their redemption right. We can't force that redemption right, which is 3 years from now. So obviously, pretty far away. If they so choose to exercise that right, then we have, you're right, the option to increase from roughly 68% to 100%. I think we'll evaluate that very carefully at that point in time. That's quite a ways away. And our goals at NBCUniversal generate the financial capacity to meet that possible redemption. So it's hard to forecast what one will do in 3-plus years from now. But also if we were to exercise our option, we would extinguish the carried interest, which would last another 3.5 years, which we believe has real value creation for our shareholders. So it's a good spot to be in and something that we will evaluate really carefully in about 3 years from now. But I want to make sure the point is that the goals at NBCUniversal, its free cash flow is really being utilized to build that capacity to meet that potential redemption in year -- in 3-plus years."

I mean, there's 50 million homes in the U.S. that can't get any service from Comcast. IP allows you to do a lot of things you couldn't do before on the video front. Bandwidth speeds are going up around the country. It just seems like you've built an infrastructure that has huge opportunity beyond what we might traditionally think of as the Cable business.

We had some free On Demand product with Fancast. It did not prove profitable.

That's our focus for now. And I think Neil summarized really well a lot of the progress that's been made. I do think we're leading in some of this innovation. Some of those products we might be able to wholesale to others as we have our digital media center in Denver.

Today, I'm pleased to report that we achieved strong operating and financial results for the second quarter in Cable and in NBCUniversal.

Today, I'm pleased to report that we achieved strong operating and financial results for the second quarter in Cable and in NBCUniversal. These results demonstrate our operational focus while also speeding up innovation and investing in content to strengthen our brands and our franchises. 
So let me begin with Cable. In the second quarter, revenue was up by nearly 6%. Operating cash flow increased by nearly 7%, and Cable generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow. Customer additions for our combined video, voice and data services increased by 18%, continuing the trend of improving year-over-year performance even in a seasonally weak quarter. Our high-speed Internet service was once again one of the real highlights and was the largest contributor to Cable's growth this quarter. The second quarter marks the eighth quarter in a row where we significantly outpaced the net additions of our competitors. This is due to strong execution and expanding differentiation between our high-speed service and DSL. 
Business services was another significant contributor to Cable's performance in the second quarter with 42% growth in revenue. This business has solid momentum, and we are continuing to build its capabilities for future growth, including expanding Metro E services to 20 of our major markets. We also made steady improvements in our operating performance metrics, marking another quarter with better customer retention and Service scores and higher customer satisfaction. We have real operational focus and are making our service and the overall XFINITY experience the best in the business. As we continue to use our scale to our advantage, we are delivering new products and faster innovation to our Cable customers. 
Our current and future services represent an exciting new product roadmap that includes higher-speed Internet, a growing array of IP and cloud-based applications, new offerings like XFINITY Signature Support and new lines of businesses like home security. And soon working with Skype, we will also begin to offer a new high-definition video calling experience right to your television. What is particularly exciting is the leverage we are gaining from the previous significant investments we made in our network. So it's easier and faster now to drive new technologies and product innovation. I believe all this, together with our initiatives to transform the customer experience, is generating results and helping us make sustainable improvements that will continue to yield benefits. 
So let me now switch to NBCUniversal. As you know, our overarching goal for NBC and Universal is to build long-term value. And yes, there'll be some hits and misses and a bit more volatility, but I continue to believe that our timing was just right as we have benefited from a much stronger advertising market since we signed the agreement in your seamless integration, mostly the continuing strength of many of their businesses, particularly the Cable channels with their wonderful brands. 
We had a busy quarter. We invested in lots of new shows in both Cable and Broadcast. We extended our NHL rights. We purchased the other 50% of Universal Orlando and brought together all of our company's capabilities in a successful and I think important bid for the Olympics. 
Our Olympic rights now stretch over a decade and extend to all technology and media. However, they may change through the year 2020, giving us real opportunity to build out the network and Cable and digital capabilities of NBCUniversal and to make the Olympics profitable for our company over the term of this new agreement. 
Even as we invest, NBCUniversal's second quarter financial results highlight the health of its businesses with double-digit revenue growth in each of its segments and 19% operating cash flow growth when you exclude accounting adjustments related to the acquisition. So all in all, I'm very pleased with our financial and operating performance so far this year. We are making real progress on all fronts. We have strong recurring revenue businesses. We're focused on operational excellence, and we have a disciplined investment approach that is yielding positive results and will continue to build value. 
With that, let me now pass to Michael to cover the second quarter results in detail."
173341,134605136,151483,"Comcast Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2011",2011-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Comcast Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Brian. Let me begin by briefly reviewing our consolidated financial results starting on Slide 4. Overall, we were very pleased with second quarter results. Second quarter consolidated revenue increased 50.5% to $14.3 billion, and consolidated o",2308,"Thank you, Brian. Let me begin by briefly reviewing our consolidated financial results starting on Slide 4. Overall, we were very pleased with second quarter results. Second quarter consolidated revenue increased 50.5% to $14.3 billion, and consolidated operating cash flow grew 28.5% to $4.8 billion. In addition to revenue and operating cash flow, we remain focused on free cash flow, free cash flow per share and earnings per share as important metrics in evaluating the performance and strength of the company. 
In each of these key metrics, our results in the second quarter were very strong. Free cash flow for the quarter, which excludes the impact of the economic stimulus, increased 12.2% to $1.5 billion, primarily reflecting growth in consolidating operating cash flow, partially offset by increases in working capital, cash interest expense and capital expenditures. 
Second quarter free cash flow per share increased 12.5% to $0.54 per share. We generated earnings per share of $0.37 for the second quarter. However, excluding NBCUniversal transaction-related costs and $137 million nonrecurring, noncash income tax charge resulting from a state tax law change, earnings per share increased 27.3% to $0.42 per share. Please refer to Table 4 in the press release for more detail on these items. 
Let's go to Slide 5. As you know, we view Comcast and NBCUniversal as 2 distinct pools of cash flow generation and funding capacity. Both Comcast and NBCUniversal's first priority is to generate strong returns by reinvesting in their core businesses. Beyond this reinvestment, NBCUniversal retained its free cash flow to fund future equity redemptions by General Electric, while Comcast allocated free cash flow to consistently return capital to shareholders. 
As I mentioned before, in the second quarter, our free cash flow increased 12.2% to $1.5 billion. For the first half of the year, we generated $3.7 billion of free cash flow, an increase of 15.4% over the first half of 2010. Year-to-date, free cash flow per share has increased 16.5% to $1.34 per share. 
As you can see in this slide in the second quarter, Comcast, which includes both Cable Communications and Corporate and Other, accounted for $1.3 billion or 88% of total free cash flow, and NBCUniversal contribute $175 million. For the first half of 2011, Comcast accounted for $3.1 billion or 84% of total free cash flow, and NBCUniversal contributed $612 million of free cash flow. 
In the second quarter, we returned $836 million or 62% of Comcast's free cash flow to our shareholders, including share repurchases, totaling $525 million and dividend payments totaling $311 million. We are executing our 2011 financial plan, including this year's planned completion of our existing share repurchase authorization, which now has $1.1 billion remaining and will be reviewed by our board at year end. 
Please refer to Slide 6 for our pro forma results.  Now let's take a look at pro forma results of our Cable and NBCUniversal businesses, which is how we evaluate the performance of the organization in the segments. We believe the pro forma presentation provides a more meaningful comparison of the operating performance of the businesses. In the second quarter, consolidated pro forma revenue of $14.3 billion increased 9.4% compared to last year's results, and consolidated pro forma operating cash flow increased 6.7% to $4.8 billion. Included in pro forma operating cash flow for the second quarter, a noncash acquisition-related accounting revisions and costs totaling $131 million, which impact NBCUniversal's Cable Networks, Broadcast and Film results. Excluding these items, consolidated pro forma operating cash flow increased 9.6%. 
In the second quarter, pro forma Cable Communications revenue increased 5.6% and represented 65% of consolidated revenue, while pro forma operating cash flow grew 6.8% and represented 81% of consolidated operating cash flow. I will review our Cable results in more detail on the next few slides, but let me now review NBCUniversal's results. 
NBCUniversal revenue increased 17.1% with double-digit revenue increases across all 4 segments, and operating cash flow increased 5.2%. Excluding the $131 million of acquisition-related accounting revisions and costs, NBCUniversal operating cash flow increased 18.9% for the quarter. As we review NBCUniversal segments, the Cable Networks generated $2.2 billion in revenue, an increase of 12.6%, driven by a 10% increase in distribution revenue and a 10% increase in advertising revenue. Other revenue increased 44% or $59 million, primarily due to increases in the licensing of own content from the Cable production studio. 
Cable Net's second quarter operating cash flow increased to $846 million or 1.1%. Excluding the acquisition-related accounting revisions and costs of $48 million, Cable Net's operating cash flow increased 6.8% as we are reinvesting some of the top line growth in original programming and incur higher marketing expenses to support the recent launches of new series and other new programming across a number of our Cable Networks.
As we move to Broadcast, second quarter Broadcast Television revenue increased 18.5% to $1.7 billion, reflecting higher advertising revenue from improved pricing and ratings at the NBC broadcast network, as well as higher content licensing revenue, which includes the immediate recognition of revenue related to prior season and library content being made available under a new licensing agreement. 
Broadcast operating cash flow increased 8.8% to $190 million. Excluding the acquisition-related accounting revisions and costs of $56 million, Broadcast operating cash flow increased 40.8%. These results reflect higher revenue, partially offset by increased programming costs associated with a greater number of original primetime series compared to the second quarter of 2010 and higher news coverage costs during the quarter. 
With regards to Filmed Entertainment, revenue increased 21% to $1.3 billion this quarter, driven by higher theatrical revenue from the strong box office performance of Fast Five and Bridesmaids, partially offset by lower content licensing from the pay-TV window and lower home entertainment revenue due to a decline in DVD sales. 
Film operating cash flow for the quarter was $27 million compared to $4 million in 2010. Excluding acquisition-related accounting revisions and costs of $20 million, OCF was $47 million in the quarter. These results reflect strong theatrical revenue growth, partially offset by higher marketing costs for the second and third quarter film releases. In order to manage our net investment in film production, we are utilizing third-party financing to cover part of the film slates. For example, we own 25% of Cowboys and Aliens, which is coproduced with other studios, and Universal only distributes the film domestically. 
Switching to Theme Parks. Both the Orlando and Hollywood parks continue to perform very well. And revenue increased 22.5% to $147 million, reflecting strong attendance and per capita spending at both parks, which are benefiting from the success of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Orlando and King Kong in Hollywood. 
Second quarter operating cash flow increased to $119 million compared to $46 million for the same period last year. As you know, we now own 100% of the Orlando park as we closed this transaction on July 1. Beginning in the third quarter, we will consolidate 100% of Orlando's results, and we are very pleased with the park's performance, which with the June 30 quarter end, Orlando's last 12 months operating cash flow is $577 million. We have financed this transaction with internal funds and are now refinancing some of Universal Orlando's existing debt facilities to lower interest costs for NBCUniversal. 
Please refer to Slide 7 to now review our Cable Communications results. We had another solid quarter of financial and customer growth in our Cable segment. For the second quarter, pro forma Cable Communications revenue increased 5.6% to $9.3 billion, reflecting solid performance in our recurring residential businesses and continued strength in business services, partially offset by a slowdown in Pay-Per-View and advertising revenue. 
Cable advertising revenue increased 3.7%, reflecting lower political revenue and a slowdown in foreign automotive advertising, which was caused by a shortfall in auto supplies related to the challenges in Japan. Excluding political revenue, Cable advertising increased 7.5%. As a reminder, we generated over $180 million of political ad revenue in 2010, including $100 million in the fourth quarter, which will continue to impact our sequential growth rates and make comparisons more challenging as the year progresses. 
The core Cable business is performing well as we are effectively managing this business for profitable growth. Total revenue per video customer increased 9% to $138 per month in the second quarter, reflecting strong ARPU management and higher contribution from Comcast Business Services and an increasing number of residential customers taking multiple products. 
Despite the typical seasonality in our Cable markets in the second quarter, we added 99,000 total video, high-speed Internet and voice customers equal to an 18.2% increase from last year's second quarter. We are competing better with improved products and our focus on retention and customer service has continued to reduce churn for all of our services. 
As we look at the individual service categories, second quarter video revenue increased 1.3%, reflecting great adjustment in about 2/3 of our systems year-to-date and an increasing number of customers taking higher levels of digital and advanced services, partially offset by lower pay-per-view revenue and video customer losses. In the second quarter, we lost 238,000 video customers, a 10% improvement over the second quarter of 2010 despite seasonal weakness in a competitive footprint that has grown by over 1.5 million homes. 
High-speed Internet revenue increased 10.3% during the quarter, reflecting rate adjustments, continued growth in our customer base and an increasing number of our customers taking higher-speed services. Today, 24% of our residential high-speed Internet customers take the higher-speed tiers. As we continue to differentiate our products through service and speed enhancements, our high-speed Internet services is capturing market share.
In the second quarter, we added 144,000 new high-speed Internet customers, and our penetration is now at 34% of our homes passed. Voice revenue increased 7% for the quarter, reflecting continued success with our Triple Play offering. In the second quarter, we added 193,000 voice customers as the value and benefits of our Triple Play is recognized. We continue to focus on providing multiple services to our customers. And at the end of the second quarter, 35% of our video customers took all 3 services compared to 31% at the end of last year's second quarter. 
As I mentioned previously, we continue to see real momentum and opportunity in business services with revenue increasing 41.7% in the quarter to $435 million in accretive margins. 
Please refer to Slide 8 to review pro forma Cable Communications operating cash flow. Second quarter pro forma Cable Communications operating cash flow increased 6.8% to $3.9 billion, resulting in a margin of 41.6%, a 40 basis point improvement compared to last year's second quarter. For the first half of 2011, Cable operating cash flow increased 7.2% to $7.6 billion resulting in a margin of 41.4%, a 50 basis point improvement compared to the same period last year. 
In the second quarter, total expenses in Cable increased 4.8%, primarily reflecting higher video programming and marketing expenses, as well as continued investment to expand the capabilities in business services. Sales and marketing expenses, which have consistently been around 6% of Cable revenue for the past year reflect our ongoing investment in the direct and retail channels. In the second quarter, marketing expenses increased 15.5% as a result of higher retail commissions and increased overall advertising and media spend. 
In the second quarter, bad debt expense improved as we continue to refine our retention, collection and screening processes. In addition, customer service expenses continue to be relatively flat this quarter as we continue to gain efficiencies even as we focus on improving service, reducing churn and increasing customer satisfaction. 
Please refer to Slide 9 to review our Cable Communications capital expenditures. In the second quarter, Cable capital expenditures are tracking to plan and increased 5.5% to $1.2 billion equal to 12.6% of revenue, reflecting higher investments in network infrastructure in business services to enhance and expand our product offerings, partially offset by lower CPU spending. 
In the second quarter of 2011, we deployed 1.5 million digital adapters for a total of 20.6 million digital adapters deployed since the inception of the All-Digital project. We are now 89% complete with All-Digital, and we expect to complete this project by the end of the year. During the quarter, we also deployed 494,000 advanced HD and/or DVR set-top boxes, and we added 132,000 advanced service customers. We now have 10.5 million HD and/or DVR customers equal to 52% of our digital customer base. 
In the second quarter, we increased our investment in network infrastructure to enable product enhancements, including increasing Internet speeds to our customers to reinforce our product leadership in high-speed Internet. We are raising speeds of our flagship product from 12 to 15 megabits and raising speeds of our Blast! product from 20 to 25 megabits. In addition, we have recently introduced faster tiers of service as our 50 megabit service is now available to more than 45 million homes or almost 90% of our footprint. And our extreme 105 megabit service is available to more than 40 million homes or approximately 80% of our footprint. 
Second quarter CapEx also reflects meaningful investments to support the continued growth in business services and to expand our efforts in the mid-sized business area. Our investment in business services increased 40% to $154 million in the second quarter and has increased 48% to $305 million through the first half of 2011. Year-to-date, capital expenditures increased 10% to $2.2 billion, equal to 12.1% of revenue. We are executing well on our capital plan. And we continue to expect our full year Cable CapEx will be lower as a percentage of Cable revenue when compared to 2010 even as we invest capital in areas that provide attractive returns, expand our product offerings and drive future organic growth.

Since we just passed the 6-month anniversary mark for the NBCUniversal, it does seem a good time to give a quick update on how we're doing. The bottom line is we're off to a very good start. As we've said previously, 2011 is both a transi",916,"Thanks, Brian. Since we just passed the 6-month anniversary mark for the NBCUniversal, it does seem a good time to give a quick update on how we're doing. 
The bottom line is we're off to a very good start. As we've said previously, 2011 is both a transition year and an investment year so we can better position the company's assets for future growth. The good news is we're making investments, and they're starting to work. We're also successfully juggling the goals of investing and growing operating cash flow at the same time. 
Now let me give you some examples of the types of investment we are making. I'll start with the new show, The Voice. Shortly after close, we realized The Voice was the type of broad-based concept that could be a big success for NBC, and we decided to really get behind it. We increased our production budget several times to make sure we would have 4 great coaches and high-quality performances. We then invested in marketing, so awareness was high when the show launched. Finally, we made The Voice the company's #1 promotional priority across all NBCUniversal assets, as well as Comcast Cable. The results surpassed our most optimistic expectations as The Voice became a bona fide hit and NBC's biggest new show in years. 
The Voice aired from April 26 to June 28 and along with America's Got Talent, The Voice helped NBC become the #1 network in the United States for 4 weeks at the end of the quarter. Despite the increased investment, The Voice also helped our financial performance in the second quarter at both the network and our own television stations. We've invested in other new shows for our primetime schedule and expect to have a competitive lineup this fall and next spring. We'll bring The Voice back mid-season and put it behind the 2012 Super Bowl. We expect The Voice will be an important cornerstone of our schedule and hopefully participate in the network's turnaround in the future. 
Moving on to another part of our broadcast group, we also invested in our own television stations during the first half of this year. We're focusing on improving local news and think there's a real opportunity to increase news ratings. We're adding news hours and about 135 people across 10 television stations, including over 40 reporters, 20 producers and investigative units in 5 markets. While it will take time for these investments to pay off, we're already seeing some improvements in markets like New York. 
Moving to Telemundo. We launched the telenovela named, La Reina del Sur that became a big hit, driving our primetime ratings up 22%. Given the growth in the Hispanic market, we think Telemundo is an attractive growth opportunity for us in the future. 
At our Cable channels, we had a strong quarter with double-digit revenue growth on the majority of our channels. During the second quarter, we aired 58 original series, including 12 new series and increased the total number of the original episodes by 12% versus the prior year. New shows depressed cash flow initially as we spent to launch them in amortized production cost. But ultimately if successful, new shows become profitable in their own right and drive CPM and affiliate fee increases in the future. 
During the quarter, USA launched 2 new shows, Suits and Necessary Roughness that became top 10 Cable shows. These are 2 shows that were greenlit after the deal closed, which now promise to be important new franchises for USA for many years to come. Syfy launched Alphas, its most-watched new show in 2 years. And Bravo had its best second quarter ever as the Real Housewives of New Jersey had its highest-rated season premiere in history. 
We also saw invested for future growth in other parts of the company. Mike mentioned our new deal to purchase the 50% of the Universal Orlando we didn't own. We think our Theme Parks represent a great growth opportunity, and we're doing well currently on both coast with Harry Potter in Orlando and King Kong in Hollywood. 
We think our Olympics deal represents a smart investment and one that will be profitable over the term of the new agreement. And finally, we've invested in our people and made a lot of very strong senior hires in the last 6 months, which will help position us well for the future. 
The last area I'd like to touch on is how we put the collective power of NBCUniversal and Comcast behind key investments once we make them. We call this strategy, Symphony, and it's been behind our success on shows like The Voice and big films like Hop. 
Comcast Cable got behind both and promoted them across its multiple platforms, including Video On Demand and online. We're also working on many other opportunities, including targeted and interactive advertising, and just last week, announced that we're beginning to use dynamic ad insertion on our On Demand platform with programming from USA, E!, Syfy, Bravo and Oxygen. We believe enabling dynamic ad insertion will create more value for advertisers, for NBCUniversal and other content owners and for Comcast Cable, as well as allowing us to present more relevant advertising to our customers. 
So in summary, after 6 months, we're feeling very positive. We know there's a lot of work still to do, but we're very pleased with our progress and feel like there's still a lot of opportunity in the quarters and years to come."

It's been an exciting year, and I've been really pleased with the team and our execution. We're innovating at an accelerated pace and delivering great new products to our customers.

We're innovating at an accelerated pace and delivering great new products to our customers. Our customer service is a focused priority and continues to improve. As a result, we're driving solid growth, both financially and from a customer perspective. And we believe this momentum is sustainable for several reasons. 
First, we're competing better with superior products. Our major platform initiatives, All-Digital and DOCSIS 3.0 are nearing completion with All-Digital in 89% of our markets, DOCSIS 3.0 deployed in 90% of our footprint and our Content Delivery Network for OnDemand in the majority of our markets. These major platform upgrades are the foundation enabling us to deliver better products to our customers to drive faster innovation. 
We're now delivering more high def and foreign-language programming, over 30,000 OnDemand choices, better program guides, more advanced advertising and higher speeds for our HSD customers. We've launched xfinityTV.com, our XFINITY TV app and catch up, keep up for VOD. And we're working on exciting new products, such as next generation TV, 1 gigahertz HSD and dynamic ad insertion. I feel like we're just getting started on the innovation front. 
Second, we're improving customer service. Our objective is to fundamentally transform the customer experience, focusing on getting it right the first time and improving the reliability of our service. We're doing this by standardizing best practices from across the country, which has improved both our effectiveness and efficiency. We're focusing on 2 different areas: convenience and reliability. From a convenience perspective, we're making it easier for customers to interact with us and on their schedule. We're providing customers a better online experience, and recently, we've also rolled out 2-hour service windows and a customer guarantee that we'll always be on time. 
On the reliability front, we're using much better tools to monitor the network, so we can diagnose and quickly resolve a network outage issue and often before customers even realize there's a problem. This quarter, repeat service calls, which means that we'd have to go back and fix something a second time, improved by 15% and repair phone calls or the number of times customers called us to fix the problem improved by 9%. 
We also estimate that by the end of this year, we'll have reduced service-related truck rolls by 2 million and service-related phone calls by 10 million compared to 2009. That equates to real savings. That's taking unnecessary noise out of the system. All this is tough block-and-tackle work, but I'm really pleased with the focus and execution of our field teams. 
Finally, we're building a strong growth engine. Our marketing team is effectively targeting the right offers to the right customers and strengthening our XFINITY brand. Our sales teams are effectively selling and as evidenced by our 9% ARPU growth year-to-date. We built an effective retention marketing team, and the entire business is focused on retaining our customers. We're more precise in our upfront credit screening, our call handling and our promotional roll-off tactics. Our customer churn has been down across all 3 products for the past 6 months in a row. In fact, retention has been the biggest driver of our net gain improvement. 
Last but not least, we continue to invest in business services, and the team there is delivering. SMB continues to be our primary growth driver, while at the same time, new businesses like Metro E and cell backhaul are expected to become solid contributors in 2012 and beyond. 
So overall, I'm pleased with the progress we've made over the past year. I think some of the fundamental changes we've made, along with disciplined execution, will continue to yield positive results. Marlene?"

I was just wondering if you look out sort of 1 or 2 years, do you see enough cost cuts that can occur that will still allow you to sort of maintain these nominally 41% OCF margins?

So it's hard to project going forward, but we're going stay the course. HSD seems to be gaining share at a good clip, and business services is up 42%.

I think in general, we see this year and next year probably as investment years. We think the business, particularly on the broadcast side, has not gotten the investment necessary to really compete. And so I think our focus right now is on product and making sure that we have a competitive NBC primetime schedule, making sure that the stations have the right kind of resources to be competitive in the local markets. And the juggling act that we're going through, which we've been successful at for the first half is to continue to grow OCF while making the investments that are going to pay off in the future. I do think that content is more valuable today than the day that we did the deal. It's interesting if you go back. It's over 18 months ago when we actually signed the deal with General Electric. I think retransmission consent now is a bigger number than it was then. The kind of money that online video providers are paying for content is infinitely, almost significantly greater than it was 18 months ago. So in my opinion, content is more valuable and the outlook, particularly for Broadcast Television, is much rosier than it was 18 months ago. But at the same time, I want to caution everyone, we're in fourth place at NBC. And we've got a lot of investments, and we've told people that it doesn't happen in 1 year, probably won't even happen in 2 years, it might take 3 or 4.

And we saw a connect improvement in late June and into July. I think from the competitive perspective, I think the economy, as I said, is still slow. And it's caused some more aggressive offers.

One pool is within the Comcast side, which the majority is being used to return capital through buybacks and dividends.

We can't force that redemption right, which is 3 years from now. So obviously, pretty far away. If they so choose to exercise that right, then we have, you're right, the option to increase from roughly 68% to 100%. I think we'll evaluate that very carefully at that point in time. That's quite a ways away. And our goals at NBCUniversal generate the financial capacity to meet that possible redemption. So it's hard to forecast what one will do in 3-plus years from now. But also if we were to exercise our option, we would extinguish the carried interest, which would last another 3.5 years, which we believe has real value creation for our shareholders. So it's a good spot to be in and something that we will evaluate really carefully in about 3 years from now.

173341,140764805,182743,"Comcast Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2011",2011-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Comcast Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Marlene, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm pleased to report another quarter of strong performance across key financial, operating and product areas. Our primary focus has been on great operational execution and on extending our industry lead",878,"Thanks, Marlene, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm pleased to report another quarter of strong performance across key financial, operating and product areas. Our primary focus has been on great operational execution and on extending our industry leadership.
Let's begin with Cable, which really had an outstanding quarter, making this the fourth consecutive quarter of improving customer metrics. Our combined Video, Voice and data customer additions increased 13%. In addition to customer growth in High-Speed Internet and Voice, we saw a continuing improvement in Video, where we reduced our customer losses by 110,000 over last year's third quarter. High-Speed Internet was, once again, the largest contributors to Cable's revenue growth. Every quarter this year, we've added more High-Speed Internet customers than in the same quarter in 2010, and we continue to take share as we expand the differentiation between our high-speed service and DSL. 
Business Services is also becoming a significant driver of our growth as annualized revenue approaching $2 billion and 39% growth in the quarter. I'm excited about the prospects for this business, which continues to post strong results on the small end of the market and has a big opportunity still ahead with the midsized businesses. We are making significant progress in delivering a better Service experience for our customers with higher customer retention and Service course and increasing customer satisfaction. 
We recognize that we still have work to do, but I am really encouraged by the focus that Neil and the whole Cable team have on delivering the best customer experience and by our consistent steps forward in this effort.
At the same time, we are driving product leadership in innovation. A couple of years ago, we decided to invest in DOCSIS 3.0 and to convert the majority of our analog bandwidth to digital. I'm happy to say that we have completed DOCSIS 3.0 and All-Digital projects, and the results are fantastic. In fact, I really believe that it is a significant contributor to our strong results.
We're now delivering more high def and foreign-language Programming and have assembled the best collection of OnDemand content anywhere including over 30,000 choices on TV, 200,000 choices online and 7,000 hours available on our XFINITY app. Today, with 90% of all the major broadcast networks, fall TV series are available on XFINITY On Demand or xfinityTV.com. We're also making it easier for our customers to search, discover and access all this great content. We're expanding availability of OnDemand to the Xbox, and we recently relaunched xfinityTV.com with better personalization and recommendations, and we continue to enhance our guide across all our platforms. 
We're seeing early success from our latest new product, Xfinity Signature Support or expanding businesses like XFINITY home security. We're also working on the next round of exciting new products like next-gen TV, dynamic ad and more. It's really an exciting time. 
I think Cable's result so far this year showed that our scale, our XFINITY brand and our intensified focus on Service and innovation are coming together to make a real difference. Our Cable business is in terrific shape today and in a very solid position for the future.
Let me now switch to NBCUniversal, where we continue to make progress toward a successful integration and our goal of long-term growth in the value of these assets.
NBCUniversal's results this quarter, once again, underscored the strength of the core Cable Networks business, as well as terrific momentum at the Theme Parks. As you know, Cable Networks drive the profitably of NBCUniversal, and they continue to perform well with consistently strong revenue growth. We are investing in Programming to make them even more valuable for our customers and distributors. And the good news is that we're already starting to see the benefits of our investments. 
For example, this summer, USA had 7 of the top 10 scripted series on basic Cable and E! had the highest rated September in its history. The Theme Parks, the Harry Potter and King Kong attractions, have set new levels of performance, and we're excited to see that continue in the third quarter. As you know, NBCUniversal now owns 100% of Universal Orlando, and we see real opportunities to further build the Theme Park business. 
At the same time, Telemundo just won the exclusive U.S. Spanish-language rights to the FIFA World Cup soccer from 2015 to 2022. This agreement includes both the men's and women's World Cups, 2 World Cups each, hundreds of matches and many other FIFA soccer events for 8 years. It includes all platforms, so we will cover and cross promote games and events across our various channels on broadcast and Cable, as well as online, wireless and OnDemand. This investment should be profitable for Telemundo, a real game changer for that business and opportunity for our company.
We feel we are making real progress in all fronts, and that our disciplined investment approach is yielding positive results. Overall, I'm really pleased with this quarter's results including over $900 million of capital returned to shareholders. I believe the stability of our businesses and free cash flow generation will allow us to continue to build value and consistently return capital to shareholders. 
Let me now pass to Michael Angelakis to cover the third quarter results in greater detail."
173341,140764805,182743,"Comcast Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2011",2011-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Comcast Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Brian. Let me begin by reviewing our consolidated financial results starting on Slide 4. Overall, we are very pleased with third quarter results. Third quarter consolidated revenue increased 51.1% to $14.3 billion, and consolidated operating ca",2382,"Thank you, Brian. Let me begin by reviewing our consolidated financial results starting on Slide 4. Overall, we are very pleased with third quarter results. Third quarter consolidated revenue increased 51.1% to $14.3 billion, and consolidated operating cash flow grew 27.8% to $4.6 billion, reflecting strong organic growth in our Cable business, as well as consolidating the acquisitions of NBCUniversal on January 28 and the remaining 50% of Universal Orlando on July 1. 
Free cash flow for the quarter, which excludes the impact of the economic stimulus, increased 36% to $1.4 billion, primarily reflecting growth in operating cash flow that was partially offset by an increase in working capital. In addition, third quarter free cash flow per share increased 39% to $0.50 per share. 
Earnings per share in the third quarter grew 6.5% to $0.33 per share from $0.31 per share last year. This quarter's EPS growth was negatively impacted by a $256 million or $0.05 per share decline in investment income that was primarily driven by noncash mark-to-market adjustments in our investment portfolio. 
Please refer to Slide 5. As I have mentioned previously, we view Comcast and NBCUniversal as 2 distinct pools of cash flow generation and funding capacity. As you can see on this slide, year-to-date we generated $5.1 billion of total free cash flow. In Comcast, which includes Cable Communications and Corporate and Other, accounted for just over $4 billion or 78% of total free cash flow while NBCUniversal contributed $1.1 billion of free cash flow. 
In terms of capital allocation, our priority for both Comcast and NBCUniversal is to generate strong returns by investing in their core businesses. Beyond this investment, NBCUniversal retains its free cash flow to fund future equity redemptions while Comcast allocates the majority of its free cash flow to consistently return capital to shareholders. 
As Brian mentioned, in the third quarter, we returned $909 million, including share repurchases totaling $600 million and dividend payments totaling $309 million. Year-to-date, we have returned $2.5 billion or 63% of Comcast Cable's free cash flow to shareholders. 
We continue to execute on our financial plan for 2011. We expect to complete our existing share repurchase authorization by year end. Our return of capital plan for 2012 will be reviewed by management and our board in the next few months, and we'll provide an update for 2012 on our year-end earnings call in February.
Please refer to Slide 6 in order to review our pro forma results. This slide represents the pro forma results of our Cable Communications and NBCUniversal businesses just how we evaluate the performance of our organization and segments. We believe the pro forma presentation provides a more meaningful comparison of the operating performance of the businesses. 
In the third quarter, consolidated revenue increased 4.9% to $14.3 billion, and consolidated adjusted operating cash flow increased 5% to $4.7 billion. Please note that the adjustment to operating cash flow excludes $82 million of noncash acquisition-related accounting revisions and costs.
In the third quarter, Cable Communications revenue increased 5%, represented 65% of consolidated revenue while Cable operating cash flow grew 6.7% and represented 80% of consolidated operating cash flow. I will review our Cable results in more detail in the next few slides, but let me first briefly review NBCUniversal's results. Third quarter NBCUniversal revenue increased 4.6%, and adjusted operating cash flow decreased 1.4%, reflecting strong results at Cable Networks and Parks, offset by weaker performance at Broadcast and Film. 
The Cable Networks generated revenue of $2.1 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 12%, primarily driven by a 10% increase in distribution revenue and a 9.5% increase in advertising revenue reflecting the continued strength of our Cable network franchises. Other revenue increased 37% or $54 million, primarily due to increased volume of our Cable production studio for both NBCUniversal and third-party Cable Networks.
Third quarter Cable Networks adjusted operating cash flow increased 8.5%, reflecting the strong top line growth, partially offset by our ongoing investment in original Programming. Year-to-date, Cable Networks revenue has increased 12.6% to $6.3 billion, and adjusted operating cash flow has increased 7.6% to $2.5 billion. We have terrific momentum at USA, which continues to be the highest rated basic Cable network driven by the success of its original Programming. We're applying the same successful formula to some of our other entertainment channels like Style, which launched several new shows driving a more than 90% increase in its key demographic during the third quarter. 
We have a great portfolio of channels with a good mix of established and emerging networks. And with the appropriate investment and cross promotion, we are confident we can continue to generate strong results.
Moving to our Broadcast group. Third quarter Broadcast Television revenue increased 2.9% to $1.5 billion, primarily reflecting flat advertising revenue and higher content licensing revenue from the international TV production, including Downtown Abbey and domestic syndication of 30 Rock. This quarter's flat advertising revenue growth reflects higher pricing that was partially offset by weaker primetime ratings at NBC, as well as lower Political Advertising on our own TV stations. 
Similar to our local Cable Advertising business of Spotlight, Political Advertising comparisons will be a bit more difficult in the fourth quarter as the NBC Local stations generated $50 million of Political Advertising in the fourth quarter of 2010. Third quarter Broadcast adjusted operating cash flow decreased to $17 million from $70 million in 2010, reflecting increased Programming and marketing costs associated with the NBC primetime schedule, higher news coverage cost and increased investment at our local TV stations during the quarter. Year-to-date, Broadcast revenue has increased 8.7% to $4.6 billion, and adjusted operating cash flow has decreased 1.1% to $283 million, excluding the impact of the Olympics in 2010's results.
Moving on to Film. Filmed Entertainment revenue declined 7.8% to $1.1 billion this quarter principally due to a lower theatrical revenue for this quarter's releases compared to the success of Despicable Me in the third quarter of 2010. Home entertainment revenue increased 20% this quarter, driven by the success of Bridesmaids and the international DVD release of Fast Five. Film adjusted operating cash flow decreased to $18 million compared to $66 million in the third quarter of 2010, mostly reflecting this quarter's weak box office results. Year-to-date, Film revenue has increased 1.2% to $3.3 billion, and adjusted operating cash flow has declined $139 million to a loss of $81 million.
With the consolidation of 100% of Universal Orlando, we reported $580 million of revenue at the Theme Park group, a 9% increase that was driven by double-digit increases in per capita spending and relatively stable attendance at both parks. Third quarter operating cash flow increased 12.6% to $285 million compared to $252 million in the same period last year. Year-to-date, Theme Parks revenue has increased 32.9% to $1.5 billion, and adjusted operating cash flow has increased 61.2% to $644 million. 
Please refer to Slide 7 to review Cable Communications results. We had another strong quarter of financial and customer growth in our Cable segment as we continue to successfully balance unit and ARPU growth. For the third quarter, Cable Communications revenue increased 5% to $9.3 billion reflected solid performance in our recurring Residential business and continued strength in Business Services, partially offset by a lower advertising revenue. Year-to-date, our Cable segment revenue has increased 5.5% to $27.8 billion. 
The Cable business continues to perform well as we are managing the business for sustainable and profitable growth. In the third quarter, total revenue per Video customer increased 8% to $139 per month, reflecting an increasing number of residential customers taking multiple products and a higher contribution from Comcast Business Services partially offset by lower advertising revenue. We continue to focus on providing multiple services to our customers. At the end of the third quarter, 70% of our Video customers took at least 2 products and 36% took all 3 services. 
We had a strong back-to-school season during the third quarter, driving 229,000 total Video, High-Speed Internet and Voice customer additions, a 13% increase in net additions versus a year ago and marking the fourth consecutive quarter of improved year-over-year total customer growth. We are competing better with improved products and are focused on retention and customer service again resulted in lower churn year-over-year across all of our services. 
As we look at the residential Service categories, third quarter Video revenue increased 1.1%, reflecting rate adjustments and an increasing number of customers taking higher levels of digital and Advanced Services. In the third quarter, we lost 165,000 Video subscribers, a 40% improvement over the third quarter of 2010. In addition, we added 126,000 high def and/or DVR customers in the third quarter and now have 10.6 million HD or DVR customers equal to 53% of our digital customer base. 
High-Speed Internet revenue increased 9.8% during the quarter, reflecting rate adjustments, continued growth in our customer base and increasing number of customers taking higher-speed services. Today, over 24% of our residential HSD customers take a higher-speed tier above our primary Service. Our HSD Service is capturing more market share as we continue to differentiate our product through Service and speed enhancements. In the third quarter, we added 261,000 new High-Speed Data customers compared to 249,000 last year, and our penetration is now 34% of homes passed. 
Voice revenue increased 6.3% for the quarter, reflecting continued growth in our customer base. In the third quarter, we added 133,000 Voice customers and our penetration is now 18% of homes passed. Business Services also continue to be a significant contributors to our performance with revenue increasing 39.4% in the quarter to $464 million. Our momentum continues to be strong on the small end of the market, and we now have Metro-E and PRI Voice available in all our markets and are just beginning to execute on the midsized market opportunity. 
In the third quarter, Cable advertising revenue decreased 4%. However, this decrease was impacted by a decline in political revenue. Excluding this political revenue, Cable advertising increased 3.1%. As a reminder, we generated $100 million of political ad revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010, which, as I said before, will make comparisons a bit more challenging next quarter.
In the third quarter, total Cable revenue, excluding advertising, increased 5.6%, which is consistent with the first half of the year. Please refer to Slide 8. Third quarter Cable Communications operating cash flow increased 6.7% to $3.7 billion, resulting in a margin of 39.8%, a 60 basis point improvement compared to last year's third quarter. Year-to-date, our Cable segment's operating cash flow has increased 7.1% to $11.3 billion, resulting in a margin of 40.9%, also a 60 basis point improvement compared to the same period in 2010.
In the third quarter, total expenses in Cable increased 3.9%, reflecting a 6.4% increase in Video Program expense, as well as increased marketing spend. Sales and marketing expenses increased 10.7% this quarter as a result of higher overall media spend and a continued investment in direct sales to more effectively target customers and enhance our competitive position. Our marketing investment is clearly yielding positive results. 
Our XFINITY brand is now launched in 100% of our footprint, and we've seen consideration levels among non-customers, that is potential customers, willing to evaluate and consider our brand for purchase grow by over 47% since the launch of XFINITY. In addition, we continue to invest to expand the capabilities of Business Services, including the hiring of over 600 people in the last 12 months to support our growth in small business and our entry into the midsized market. We remain very focused on expense management, driving greater efficiencies and effectiveness throughout the organization. 
Similar to prior quarters, ad expense improved as we continue to improve our retention, collection and screening processes. In addition, meaningful improvements in our operating metrics are not only assisting to improve our customers experience, but are also driving operating efficiencies throughout the business. 
In the third quarter, even as we incurred incremental costs and activity levels from Hurricane Irene and a strong back-to-school season, customer service expense was flat compared to last year, and technical labor expenses declined by 1%. Please refer to Slide 9 to review our Cable Communications capital expenditures. 
Through improved efficiencies, we continue to reduce the capital intensity of our Cable business. In the third quarter, Cable capital expenditures decreased 4.9% to $1.3 billion, representing 13.4% of revenue. This quarter's decline reflects lower spending on CPE, primarily driven by more favorable pricing. In the third quarter, we deployed 479,000 advanced HD and/or DVR set-top boxes. And as I mentioned earlier, 53% of our digital Video customers now take an advanced Service. Also during the quarter, we deployed 1.3 million digital adapters for a total of 21.9 million digital adapters deployed since the inception of the All-Digital project, which, as Brian mentioned, is now complete. This has been a terrific initiative that has provided significant product enhancements and operational benefits, as well as generating strong financial returns. 
Over the past year, we begun to recapture the remaining B1 analog bandwidth in a number of our markets. We plan to continue this effort as we anticipate additional operating efficiencies and strategic benefits from fully digitizing our systems. Third quarter CapEx also reflects meaningful investments to support the continued growth in Business Services and to expand our efforts in the midsized business area. Our investment in Business Services increased 15% to $147 million in the third quarter, and year-to-date has increased 35% to $453 million. 
Year-to-date, total Cable capital expenditures has increased 4.1% to $3.5 billion equal to 12.6% of revenue. We are executing well on our 2011 capital plan and believe our capital intensity can continue to moderate even as we invest capital in areas that provide attractive returns, expand our Service and product offerings and drive future organic growth. So as we review the performance for the third quarter and year-to-date, we feel very good about our operating momentum and focus on execution. The Cable Communications business continues to perform well and deliver strong operational and financial results. Also in the 9 months, we are pleased with the progress at NBCUniversal and look forward to executing on the opportunities ahead of us.

I think we're improving our customer Service from both the reliability and convenience perspective. We are offering more customer Service features online, for example. I think we've improved our retention and our focus there. We're doing better customer roll-offs, and I've been really proud of our field teems and how they're servicing the customer better, and I think our marketing investments have paid off. We increased marketing this quarter. It was very targeted, and the XFINITY brand is now taking stronghold. Non-customer consideration is up over 45%.

I think we tried to signal to people is that we thought this would be a flattish year in terms of operating cash flow, and that we would be making those investments in 2011 and 2012. The obvious question is are you going to make a lot more? I think once you got yourself at a level where you're making the right amount of investment and certain businesses like prime time and the Cable channels, you don't need to exceed that level. So I think we're where we thought we would be. I don't think there's a huge amount of incremental investment in Cable and broadcast. But on the other hand, we're still finding areas where we think there are very good ROI solid investments that we don't want to box ourselves in. It's only been 9 months since we arrived and started making these investments. So I don't think there is a material increase. But on the other hand, when we find something that we think is worth investing in, and I think the World Cup soccer rights for Telemundo were a perfect example. If you're going to be in the business of Hispanic television, there are 2 major players. We have 20% market share, Univision has 80%. The Premier property is World Cup soccer, and we think we structured a very attractive long-term deal to get those rights for Telemundo and certainly don't want to box ourselves into not being able to make those investments when they present themselves."

173341,140764805,182908,"Comcast Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2011",2011-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Comcast Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Marlene, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm pleased to report another quarter of strong performance across key financial, operating and product areas. Our primary focus has been on great operational execution and on extending our industry lead",883,"Thanks, Marlene, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm pleased to report another quarter of strong performance across key financial, operating and product areas. Our primary focus has been on great operational execution and on extending our industry leadership.
Let's begin with Cable, which really had an outstanding quarter, making this the fourth consecutive quarter of improving customer metrics. Our combined video, voice and data customer additions increased 13%. In addition to customer growth in high-Speed Internet and voice, we saw a continuing improvement in video, where we reduced our customer losses by 110,000 over last year's third quarter. 
High-speed Internet was, once again, the largest contributor to Cable's revenue growth. Every quarter this year, we've added more high-speed Internet customers than in the same quarter of 2010, and we continue to take share as we expand the differentiation between our high-speed service and DSL. 
Business services is also becoming a significant driver of our growth, as annualized revenue approaching $2 billion and 39% growth in the quarter. I'm excited about the prospects for this business, which continues to post strong results on the small end of the market and has a big opportunity still ahead with the midsized businesses. 
We are making significant progress in delivering a better service experience for our customers, with higher customer retention and service scores and increasing customer satisfaction. 
We recognize that we still have work to do, but I am really encouraged by the focus that Neil and the whole Cable team have on delivering the best customer experience and by our consistent steps forward in this effort. 
At the same time, we are driving product leadership in innovation.  A couple of years ago, we decided to invest in DOCSIS 3.0 and to convert the majority of our analog bandwidth to digital. I'm happy to say that we have completed DOCSIS 3.0 and All-Digital projects, and the results are fantastic. In fact, I really believe that it is a significant contributor to our strong results.
We are now delivering more high def and foreign-language programming and have assembled the best collection of On Demand content anywhere, including over 30,000 choices on TV; 200,000 choices online; and 7,000 hours available on our XFINITY app. Today, more than 90% of all the major broadcast networks' fall TV series are available on XFINITY On Demand or xfinityTV.com. 
We're also making it easier for our customers to search, discover and access all this great content. We're expanding availability of On Demand to the Xbox, and we recently relaunched xfinityTV.com with better personalization and recommendations, and we continue to enhance our guides across all our platforms. 
We're seeing early success from our latest new product, Xfinity Signature Support or expanding businesses like XFINITY Home Security. We're also working on the next round of exciting new products like next-gen TV, dynamic ad insertion and more. It's really an exciting time. 
I think Cable's result so far this year showed that our scale, our XFINITY brand and our intensified focus on service and innovation are coming together to make a real difference. Our Cable business is in terrific shape today and in a very solid position for the future.
Let me now switch to NBCUniversal, where we continue to make progress toward a successful integration and our goal of long-term growth in the value of these assets. NBCUniversal's results this quarter, once again, underscored the strength of the core Cable Networks business, as well as terrific momentum at the Theme Parks. 
As you know, Cable Networks drive the profitably of NBCUniversal, and they continue to perform well with consistently strong revenue growth. We are investing in programming to make them even more valuable for our customers and distributors, and the good news is that we're already starting to see the benefits of our investments. 
For example, this summer, USA had 7 of the top 10 scripted series on basic Cable, and E! had the highest rated September in its history. The Theme Parks, the Harry Potter and King Kong attractions, have set new levels of performance, and we're excited to see that continued in the third quarter. As you know, NBCUniversal now owns 100% of Universal Orlando, and we see real opportunities to further build the Theme Parks business. 
At the same time, Telemundo just won the exclusive U.S. Spanish-language rights to the FIFA World Cup soccer from 2015 to 2022. This agreement includes both the men's and women's World Cups, 2 World Cups each, hundreds of matches and many other FIFA soccer events for 8 years. It includes all platforms, so we will cover and cross-promote games and events across our various channels on broadcast and cable, as well as online, wireless and On Demand. This investment should be profitable for Telemundo, a real game changer for that business and opportunity for our company.
We feel we are making real progress in all fronts and that our disciplined investment approach is yielding positive results. Overall, I'm really pleased with this quarter's results, including over $900 million of capital returned to shareholders. I believe the stability of our businesses and free cash flow generation will allow us to continue to build value and consistently return capital to shareholders. 
Let me now pass to Mike Angelakis to cover the third quarter results in greater detail."
173341,140764805,182908,"Comcast Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2011",2011-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Comcast Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Brian. Let me begin by reviewing our consolidated financial results starting on Slide 4. Overall, we are very pleased with third quarter results. Third quarter consolidated revenue increased 51.1% to $14.3 billion, and consolidated operating ca",2382,"Thank you, Brian. Let me begin by reviewing our consolidated financial results starting on Slide 4. Overall, we are very pleased with third quarter results. Third quarter consolidated revenue increased 51.1% to $14.3 billion, and consolidated operating cash flow grew 27.8% to $4.6 billion, reflecting strong organic growth in our Cable business, as well as consolidating the acquisitions of NBCUniversal on January 28 and the remaining 50% of Universal Orlando on July 1. 
Free cash flow for the quarter, which excludes the impact of the economic stimulus, increased 36% to $1.4 billion, primarily reflecting growth in operating cash flow, that was partially offset by an increase in working capital. In addition, third quarter free cash flow per share increased 39% to $0.50 per share. 
Earnings per share in the third quarter grew 6.5% to $0.33 per share from $0.31 per share last year. This quarter's EPS growth was negatively impacted by a $256 million or $0.05 per share decline in investment income that was primarily driven by noncash mark-to-market adjustments in our investment portfolio. 
Please refer to Slide 5. As I have mentioned previously, we view Comcast and NBCUniversal as 2 distinct pools of cash flow generation and funding capacity. As you can see on this slide, year-to-date we generated $5.1 billion of total free cash flow. In Comcast, which includes Cable Communications and Corporate and Other, accounted for just over $4 billion or 78% of total free cash flow, while NBCUniversal contributed $1.1 billion of free cash flow. 
In terms of capital allocation, our priority for both Comcast and NBCUniversal is to generate strong returns by investing in their core businesses. Beyond this investment, NBCUniversal retains its free cash flow to fund future equity redemptions, while Comcast allocates the majority of its free cash flow to consistently return capital to shareholders. 
As Brian mentioned, in the third quarter, we returned $909 million, including share repurchases totaling $600 million and dividend payments totaling $309 million. Year-to-date, we have returned $2.5 billion or 63% of Comcast Cable's free cash flow to shareholders. 
We continue to execute on our financial plan for 2011. We expect to complete our existing share repurchase authorization by year-end. Our return of capital plan for 2012 will be reviewed by management and our board in the next few months, and we'll provide an update for 2012 on our year-end earnings call in February.
Please refer to Slide 6 in order to review our pro forma results. This slide represents the pro forma results of our Cable Communications and NBCUniversal businesses, just how we evaluate the performance of our organization and segments. We believe the pro forma presentation provides a more meaningful comparison of the operating performance of the businesses. 
In the third quarter, consolidated revenue increased 4.9% to $14.3 billion, and consolidated adjusted operating cash flow increased 5% to $4.7 billion. Please note that the adjustment to operating cash flow excludes $82 million of noncash acquisition-related accounting revisions and costs.
In the third quarter, Cable Communications revenue increased 5%, represented 65% of consolidated revenue, while Cable operating cash flow grew 6.7% and represented 80% of consolidated operating cash flow. I will review our Cable results in more detail in the next few slides, but let me first briefly review NBCUniversal's results. Third quarter NBCUniversal revenue increased 4.6%, and adjusted operating cash flow decreased 1.4%, reflecting strong results at Cable Networks and Parks, offset by weaker performance at Broadcast and Film. 
The Cable Networks generated revenue of $2.1 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 12%, primarily driven by a 10% increase in distribution revenue and a 9.5% increase in advertising revenue reflecting the continued strength of our Cable network franchises. Other revenue increased 37% or $54 million, primarily due to increased volume of our Cable production studio for both NBCUniversal and third-party cable networks.
Third quarter Cable Networks adjusted operating cash flow increased 8.5%, reflecting the strong top line growth, partially offset by our ongoing investment in original programming. Year-to-date, Cable Networks revenue has increased 12.6% to $6.3 billion, and adjusted operating cash flow has increased 7.6% to $2.5 billion. We have terrific momentum at USA, which continues to be the highest rated basic cable network, driven by the success of its original programming. We're applying the same successful formula to some of our other entertainment channels like Style, which launched several new shows driving a more than 90% increase in its key demographic during the third quarter. 
We have a great portfolio of channels with a good mix of established and emerging networks. And with the appropriate investment and cross-promotion, we are confident we can continue to generate strong results.
Moving to our Broadcast group. Third quarter Broadcast Television revenue increased 2.9% to $1.5 billion, primarily reflecting flat advertising revenue and higher content licensing revenue from the international TV production, including Downtown Abbey and domestic syndication of 30 Rock. 
This quarter's flat advertising revenue growth reflects higher pricing that was partially offset by weaker prime time ratings in NBC, as well as lower political advertising on our own TV stations. Similar to our local cable advertising business of Spotlight, political advertising comparisons will be a bit more difficult in the fourth quarter, as the NBC local stations generated $50 million of political advertising in the fourth quarter of 2010. Third quarter Broadcast adjusted operating cash flow decreased to $17 million from $70 million in 2010, reflecting increased programming and marketing costs associated with the NBC prime time schedule, higher news coverage costs and increased investment at our local TV stations during the quarter. Year-to-date, Broadcast revenue has increased 8.7% to $4.6 billion, and adjusted operating cash flow has decreased 1.1% to $283 million, excluding the impact of the Olympics in 2010's results.
Moving on to Film. Filmed Entertainment revenue declined 7.8% to $1.1 billion this quarter principally due to lower theatrical revenue for this quarter's releases compared to the success of Despicable Me in the third quarter of 2010. Home entertainment revenue increased 20% this quarter, driven by the success of Bridesmaids and the international DVD release of Fast Five. 
Film adjusted operating cash flow decreased to $18 million compared to $66 million in the third quarter of 2010, mostly reflecting this quarter's weak box office results. Year-to-date, Film revenue has increased 1.2% to $3.3 billion, and adjusted operating cash flow has declined $139 million to a loss of $81 million.
With the consolidation of 100% of Universal Orlando, we reported $580 million of revenue at the Theme Park group, a 9% increase that was driven by double-digit increases in per capita spending and relatively stable attendance at both parks. Third quarter operating cash flow increased 12.6% to $285 million compared to $252 million in the same period last year. Year-to-date, Theme Parks revenue has increased 32.9% to $1.5 billion, and adjusted operating cash flow has increased 61.2% to $644 million. 
Please refer to Slide 7 to review Cable Communications results. We had another strong quarter of financial and customer growth in our Cable segment, as we continue to successfully balance unit and ARPU growth. For the third quarter, Cable Communications revenue increased 5% to $9.3 billion, reflected solid performance in our recurring Residential business and continued strength in business services, partially offset by lower advertising revenue. Year-to-date, our Cable segment's revenue has increased 5.5% to $27.8 billion. 
The Cable business continues to perform well, as we are managing the business for sustainable and profitable growth. In the third quarter, total revenue per video customer increased 8% to $139 per month, reflecting an increasing number of residential customers taking multiple products and a higher contribution from Comcast business services, partially offset by lower advertising revenue. We continue to focus on providing multiple services to our customers. At the end of the third quarter, 70% of our video customers took at least 2 products and 36% took all 3 services. 
We had a strong back-to-school season during the third quarter, driving 229,000 total video, high-speed Internet and voice customer additions, a 13% increase in net additions versus a year ago and marking the fourth consecutive quarter of improved year-over-year total customer growth. We are competing better with improved products, and our focused on retention and customer service has again resulted in lower churn year-over-year across all of our services. 
As we look at the residential service categories, third quarter video revenue increased 1.1%, reflecting rate adjustments and an increasing number of customers taking higher levels of digital and advanced services. In the third quarter, we lost 165,000 video subscribers, a 40% improvement over the third quarter of 2010. In addition, we added 126,000 high def and/or DVR customers in the third quarter and now have 10.6 million HD or DVR customers, equal to 53% of our digital customer base. 
High-speed Internet revenue increased 9.8% during the quarter, reflecting rate adjustments, continued growth in our customer base and increasing number of customers taking higher-speed services. Today, over 24% of our residential HSD customers take a higher-speed tier above our primary service. Our HSD service is capturing more market share, as we continue to differentiate our product through service and speed enhancements. In the third quarter, we added 261,000 new High-speed Data customers compared to 249,000 last year, and our penetration is now 34% of homes passed. 
Voice revenue increased 6.3% for the quarter, reflecting continued growth in our customer base. In the third quarter, we added 133,000 voice customers, and our penetration is now 18% of homes passed. 
Business services also continues to be a significant contributor to our performance, with revenue increasing 39.4% in the quarter to $464 million. Our momentum continues to be strong on the small end of the market, and we now have Metro-E and PRI trunk voice available in all our markets and are just beginning to execute on the midsize market opportunity. 
In the third quarter, cable advertising revenue decreased 4%. However, this decrease was impacted by a decline in political revenue. Excluding this political revenue, cable advertising increased 3.1%. As a reminder, we generated $100 million of political ad revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010, which, as I said before, will make comparisons a bit more challenging next quarter.
In the third quarter, total Cable revenue, excluding advertising, increased 5.6%, which is consistent with the first half of the year. Please refer to Slide 8. Third quarter Cable Communications operating cash flow increased 6.7% to $3.7 billion, resulting in a margin of 39.8%, a 60 basis point improvement compared to last year's third quarter. 
Year-to-date, our Cable segment's operating cash flow has increased 7.1% to $11.3 billion, resulting in a margin of 40.9%, also a 60 basis point improvement compared to the same period in 2010.
In the third quarter, total expenses in Cable increased 3.9%, reflecting a 6.4% increase in video program expense, as well as increased marketing spend. Sales and marketing expenses increased 10.7% this quarter, as a result of higher overall media spend and a continued investment in direct sales to more effectively target customers and enhance our competitive position. Our marketing investment is clearly yielding positive results. 
Our XFINITY brand is now launched in 100% of our footprint, and we've seen consideration levels among non-customers, that is potential customers willing to evaluate and consider our brand for purchase, grow by over 47% since the launch of XFINITY. In addition, we continue to invest to expand the capabilities of business services, including the hiring of over 600 people in the last 12 months to support our growth in small business and our entry into the midsize market. We remain very focused on expense management, driving greater efficiencies and effectiveness throughout the organization. 
Similar to prior quarters, ad expense improved as we continue to improve our retention, collection and screening processes. In addition, meaningful improvements in our operating metrics are not only assisting to improve our customers' experience, but are also driving operating efficiencies throughout the business. 
In the third quarter, even as we incurred incremental costs and activity levels from Hurricane Irene and a strong back-to-school season, customer service expense was flat compared to last year, and technical labor expenses declined by 1%. Please refer to Slide 9 to review our Cable Communications capital expenditures. 
Through improved efficiencies, we continue to reduce the capital intensity of our Cable business. In the third quarter, Cable capital expenditures decreased 4.9% to $1.3 billion, representing 13.4% of revenue. This quarter's decline reflects lower spending on CPE, primarily driven by more favorable pricing. 
In the third quarter, we deployed 479,000 advanced HD and/or DVR set-top boxes. And as I mentioned earlier, 53% of our digital video customers now take an advanced service. Also during the quarter, we deployed 1.3 million digital adapters, for a total of 21.9 million digital adapters deployed since the inception of the All-Digital project, which, as Brian mentioned, is now complete. This has been a terrific initiative that has provided significant product enhancements and operational benefits, as well as generating strong financial returns. 
Over the past year, we've begun to recapture the remaining B1 analog bandwidth in a number of our markets. We plan to continue this effort as we anticipate additional operating efficiencies and strategic benefits from fully digitizing our systems. Third quarter CapEx also reflects meaningful investments to support the continued growth in business services and to expand our efforts in the midsize business area. Our investment in business services increased 15% to $147 million in the third quarter, and year-to-date has increased 35% to $453 million. 
Year-to-date, total Cable capital expenditures has increased 4.1% to $3.5 billion, equal to 12.6% of revenue. We are executing well on our 2011 capital plan and believe our capital intensity can continue to moderate even as we invest capital in areas that provide attractive returns, expand our service and product offerings and drive future organic growth. 
So as we review the performance for the third quarter and year-to-date, we feel very good about our operating momentum and focus on execution. Our Cable Communications business continues to perform well and deliver strong operational and financial results. Also in the 9 months, we are pleased with the progress at NBCUniversal and look forward to executing on the opportunities ahead of us.

We'll go to a major market in the first half of the year, and then we'll be rolling it out on a more widespread basis during the year. And we'll be able to roll out Xcalibur across a variety of platforms including the Parker box that we have in Augusta, additional high-end set-top boxes and other COM devices, customer-owned and maintained devices, such as the Xbox and other devices. So from a positioning perspective, we're not quite clear how we want to position it yet. We're working on that into what customers it'll go and the pricing and whatnot. So that's work in progress."

I think we're improving our customer service from both the reliability and convenience perspective. We're offering more customer service features online, for example. I think we've improved our retention and our focus there. We're doing better customer roll-offs, and I've been really proud of our field teams and how they're servicing the customer better. And I think our marketing investments have paid off. We increased marketing this quarter. It was very targeted, and the XFINITY brand is now taking stronghold. Non-customer consideration is up over 45%. So I believe that a lot of those investments are sustainable as it pertains to the actual subs themselves. We're pleased with the initial results.

But on the other hand, we're still finding areas where we think there are very good ROI, solid investments that we don't want to box ourselves in. It's only been 9 months since we arrived and started making these investments. So I don't think there is a material increase.

Today, I'm pleased to report another quarter of strong performance across key financial, operating and product areas. Our primary focus has been on great operational execution and on extending our industry lead",883,"Thanks, Marlene, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm pleased to report another quarter of strong performance across key financial, operating and product areas. Our primary focus has been on great operational execution and on extending our industry leadership.
Let's begin with Cable, which really had an outstanding quarter, making this the fourth consecutive quarter of improving customer metrics. Our combined video, voice and data customer additions increased 13%. In addition to customer growth in high-Speed Internet and voice, we saw a continuing improvement in video, where we reduced our customer losses by 110,000 over last year's third quarter. 
High-speed Internet was, once again, the largest contributor to Cable's revenue growth. Every quarter this year, we've added more high-speed Internet customers than in the same quarter of 2010, and we continue to take share as we expand the differentiation between our high-speed service and DSL. 
Business services is also becoming a significant driver of our growth, as annualized revenue approaching $2 billion and 39% growth in the quarter. I'm excited about the prospects for this business, which continues to post strong results on the small end of the market and has a big opportunity still ahead with the midsized businesses. 
We are making significant progress in delivering a better service experience for our customers, with higher customer retention and service scores and increasing customer satisfaction. 
We recognize that we still have work to do, but I am really encouraged by the focus that Neil and the whole Cable team have on delivering the best customer experience and by our consistent steps forward in this effort. 
At the same time, we are driving product leadership in innovation.  A couple of years ago, we decided to invest in DOCSIS 3.0 and to convert the majority of our analog bandwidth to digital. I'm happy to say that we have completed DOCSIS 3.0 and All-Digital projects, and the results are fantastic. In fact, I really believe that it is a significant contributor to our strong results.
We are now delivering more high def and foreign-language programming and have assembled the best collection of On Demand content anywhere, including over 30,000 choices on TV; 200,000 choices online; and 7,000 hours available on our XFINITY app. Today, more than 90% of all the major broadcast networks' fall TV series are available on XFINITY On Demand or xfinityTV.com. 
We're also making it easier for our customers to search, discover and access all this great content. We're expanding availability of On Demand to the Xbox, and we recently relaunched xfinityTV.com with better personalization and recommendations, and we continue to enhance our guides across all our platforms. 
We're seeing early success from our latest new product, Xfinity Signature Support or expanding businesses like XFINITY Home Security. We're also working on the next round of exciting new products like next-gen TV, dynamic ad insertion and more. It's really an exciting time. 
I think Cable's results so far this year showed that our scale, our XFINITY brand and our intensified focus on service and innovation are coming together to make a real difference. Our Cable business is in terrific shape today and in a very solid position for the future.
Let me now switch to NBCUniversal, where we continue to make progress toward a successful integration and our goal of long-term growth in the value of these assets. NBCUniversal's results this quarter, once again, underscored the strength of the core Cable Networks business, as well as terrific momentum at the Theme Parks. 
As you know, Cable Networks drive the profitably of NBCUniversal, and they continue to perform well with consistently strong revenue growth. We are investing in programming to make them even more valuable for our customers and distributors, and the good news is that we're already starting to see the benefits of our investments. 
For example, this summer, USA had 7 of the top 10 scripted series on basic Cable, and E! had the highest rated September in its history. The Theme Parks, the Harry Potter and King Kong attractions, have set new levels of performance, and we're excited to see that continued in the third quarter. As you know, NBCUniversal now owns 100% of Universal Orlando, and we see real opportunities to further build the Theme Parks business. 
At the same time, Telemundo just won the exclusive U.S. Spanish-language rights to the FIFA World Cup soccer from 2015 to 2022. This agreement includes both the men's and women's World Cups, 2 World Cups each, hundreds of matches and many other FIFA soccer events for 8 years. It includes all platforms, so we will cover and cross-promote games and events across our various channels on broadcast and cable, as well as online, wireless and On Demand. This investment should be profitable for Telemundo, a real game changer for that business and opportunity for our company.
We feel we are making real progress in all fronts and that our disciplined investment approach is yielding positive results. Overall, I'm really pleased with this quarter's results, including over $900 million of capital returned to shareholders. I believe the stability of our businesses and free cash flow generation will allow us to continue to build value and consistently return capital to shareholders. 
Let me now pass to Mike Angelakis to cover the third quarter results in greater detail."
173341,140764805,183124,"Comcast Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2011",2011-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Comcast Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Brian. Let me begin by reviewing our consolidated financial results starting on Slide 4. Overall, we are very pleased with third quarter results. Third quarter consolidated revenue increased 51.1% to $14.3 billion, and consolidated operating ca",2382,"Thank you, Brian. Let me begin by reviewing our consolidated financial results starting on Slide 4. Overall, we are very pleased with third quarter results. Third quarter consolidated revenue increased 51.1% to $14.3 billion, and consolidated operating cash flow grew 27.8% to $4.6 billion, reflecting strong organic growth in our Cable business, as well as consolidating the acquisitions of NBCUniversal on January 28 and the remaining 50% of Universal Orlando on July 1. 
Free cash flow for the quarter, which excludes the impact of the economic stimulus, increased 36% to $1.4 billion, primarily reflecting growth in operating cash flow, that was partially offset by an increase in working capital. In addition, third quarter free cash flow per share increased 39% to $0.50 per share. 
Earnings per share in the third quarter grew 6.5% to $0.33 per share from $0.31 per share last year. This quarter's EPS growth was negatively impacted by a $256 million or $0.05 per share decline in investment income that was primarily driven by noncash mark-to-market adjustments in our investment portfolio. 
Please refer to Slide 5. As I have mentioned previously, we view Comcast and NBCUniversal as 2 distinct pools of cash flow generation and funding capacity. As you can see on this slide, year-to-date we generated $5.1 billion of total free cash flow. In Comcast, which includes Cable Communications and Corporate and Other, accounted for just over $4 billion or 78% of total free cash flow, while NBCUniversal contributed $1.1 billion of free cash flow. 
In terms of capital allocation, our priority for both Comcast and NBCUniversal is to generate strong returns by investing in their core businesses. Beyond this investment, NBCUniversal retains its free cash flow to fund future equity redemptions, while Comcast allocates the majority of its free cash flow to consistently return capital to shareholders. 
As Brian mentioned, in the third quarter, we returned $909 million, including share repurchases totaling $600 million and dividend payments totaling $309 million. Year-to-date, we have returned $2.5 billion or 63% of Comcast Cable's free cash flow to shareholders. 
We continue to execute on our financial plan for 2011. We expect to complete our existing share repurchase authorization by year-end. Our return of capital plan for 2012 will be reviewed by management and our board in the next few months, and we'll provide an update for 2012 on our year-end earnings call in February.
Please refer to Slide 6 in order to review our pro forma results. This slide represents the pro forma results of our Cable Communications and NBCUniversal businesses, just how we evaluate the performance of our organization and segments. We believe the pro forma presentation provides a more meaningful comparison of the operating performance of the businesses. 
In the third quarter, consolidated revenue increased 4.9% to $14.3 billion, and consolidated adjusted operating cash flow increased 5% to $4.7 billion. Please note that the adjustment to operating cash flow excludes $82 million of noncash acquisition-related accounting revisions and costs.
In the third quarter, Cable Communications revenue increased 5%, represented 65% of consolidated revenue, while Cable operating cash flow grew 6.7% and represented 80% of consolidated operating cash flow. I will review our Cable results in more detail in the next few slides, but let me first briefly review NBCUniversal's results. Third quarter NBCUniversal revenue increased 4.6%, and adjusted operating cash flow decreased 1.4%, reflecting strong results at Cable Networks and Parks, offset by weaker performance at Broadcast and Film. 
The Cable Networks generated revenue of $2.1 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 12%, primarily driven by a 10% increase in distribution revenue and a 9.5% increase in advertising revenue reflecting the continued strength of our Cable network franchises. Other revenue increased 37% or $54 million, primarily due to increased volume of our Cable production studio for both NBCUniversal and third-party cable networks.
Third quarter Cable Networks adjusted operating cash flow increased 8.5%, reflecting the strong top line growth, partially offset by our ongoing investment in original programming. Year-to-date, Cable Networks revenue has increased 12.6% to $6.3 billion, and adjusted operating cash flow has increased 7.6% to $2.5 billion. We have terrific momentum at USA, which continues to be the highest rated basic cable network, driven by the success of its original programming. We're applying the same successful formula to some of our other entertainment channels like Style, which launched several new shows driving a more than 90% increase in its key demographic during the third quarter. 
We have a great portfolio of channels with a good mix of established and emerging networks. And with the appropriate investment and cross-promotion, we are confident we can continue to generate strong results.
Moving to our Broadcast group. Third quarter Broadcast Television revenue increased 2.9% to $1.5 billion, primarily reflecting flat advertising revenue and higher content licensing revenue from the international TV production, including Downtown Abbey and domestic syndication of 30 Rock. 
This quarter's flat advertising revenue growth reflects higher pricing that was partially offset by weaker prime time ratings in NBC, as well as lower political advertising on our own TV stations. Similar to our local cable advertising business of Spotlight, political advertising comparisons will be a bit more difficult in the fourth quarter, as the NBC local stations generated $50 million of political advertising in the fourth quarter of 2010. Third quarter Broadcast adjusted operating cash flow decreased to $17 million from $70 million in 2010, reflecting increased programming and marketing costs associated with the NBC prime time schedule, higher news coverage costs and increased investment at our local TV stations during the quarter. Year-to-date, Broadcast revenue has increased 8.7% to $4.6 billion, and adjusted operating cash flow has decreased 1.1% to $283 million, excluding the impact of the Olympics in 2010's results.
Moving on to Film. Filmed Entertainment revenue declined 7.8% to $1.1 billion this quarter principally due to lower theatrical revenue from this quarter's releases compared to the success of Despicable Me in the third quarter of 2010. Home entertainment revenue increased 20% this quarter, driven by the success of Bridesmaids and the international DVD release of Fast Five. 
Film adjusted operating cash flow decreased to $18 million compared to $66 million in the third quarter of 2010, mostly reflecting this quarter's weak box office results. Year-to-date, Film revenue has increased 1.2% to $3.3 billion, and adjusted operating cash flow has declined $139 million to a loss of $81 million.
With the consolidation of 100% of Universal Orlando, we reported $580 million of revenue at the Theme Park group, a 9% increase that was driven by double-digit increases in per capita spending and relatively stable attendance at both parks. Third quarter operating cash flow increased 12.6% to $285 million compared to $252 million in the same period last year. Year-to-date, Theme Parks revenue has increased 32.9% to $1.5 billion, and adjusted operating cash flow has increased 61.2% to $644 million. 
Please refer to Slide 7 to review Cable Communications results. We had another strong quarter of financial and customer growth in our Cable segment, as we continue to successfully balance unit and ARPU growth. For the third quarter, Cable Communications revenue increased 5% to $9.3 billion, reflected solid performance in our recurring Residential business and continued strength in business services, partially offset by lower advertising revenue. Year-to-date, our Cable segment's revenue has increased 5.5% to $27.8 billion. 
The Cable business continues to perform well, as we are managing the business for sustainable and profitable growth. In the third quarter, total revenue per video customer increased 8% to $139 per month, reflecting an increasing number of residential customers taking multiple products and a higher contribution from Comcast business services, partially offset by lower advertising revenue. We continue to focus on providing multiple services to our customers. At the end of the third quarter, 70% of our video customers took at least 2 products and 36% took all 3 services. 
We had a strong back-to-school season during the third quarter, driving 229,000 total video, high-speed Internet and voice customer additions, a 13% increase in net additions versus a year ago and marking the fourth consecutive quarter of improved year-over-year total customer growth. We are competing better with improved products, and our focused on retention and customer service has again resulted in lower churn year-over-year across all of our services. 
As we look at the residential service categories, third quarter video revenue increased 1.1%, reflecting rate adjustments and an increasing number of customers taking higher levels of digital and advanced services. In the third quarter, we lost 165,000 video subscribers, a 40% improvement over the third quarter of 2010. In addition, we added 126,000 high def and/or DVR customers in the third quarter and now have 10.6 million HD or DVR customers, equal to 53% of our digital customer base. 
High-speed Internet revenue increased 9.8% during the quarter, reflecting rate adjustments, continued growth in our customer base and increasing number of customers taking higher-speed services. Today, over 24% of our residential HSD customers take a higher-speed tier above our primary service. Our HSD service is capturing more market share, as we continue to differentiate our product through service and speed enhancements. In the third quarter, we added 261,000 new High-speed Data customers compared to 249,000 last year, and our penetration is now 34% of homes passed. 
Voice revenue increased 6.3% for the quarter, reflecting continued growth in our customer base. In the third quarter, we added 133,000 voice customers, and our penetration is now 18% of homes passed. 
Business services also continues to be a significant contributor to our performance, with revenue increasing 39.4% in the quarter to $464 million. Our momentum continues to be strong on the small end of the market, and we now have Metro-E and PRI trunked voice available in all our markets and are just beginning to execute on the midsize market opportunity. 
In the third quarter, cable advertising revenue decreased 4%. However, this decrease was impacted by a decline in political revenue. Excluding this political revenue, cable advertising increased 3.1%. As a reminder, we generated $100 million of political ad revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010, which, as I said before, will make comparisons a bit more challenging next quarter.
In the third quarter, total Cable revenue, excluding advertising, increased 5.6%, which is consistent with the first half of the year. Please refer to Slide 8. Third quarter Cable Communications operating cash flow increased 6.7% to $3.7 billion, resulting in a margin of 39.8%, a 60 basis point improvement compared to last year's third quarter. 
Year-to-date, our Cable segment's operating cash flow has increased 7.1% to $11.3 billion, resulting in a margin of 40.9%, also a 60 basis point improvement compared to the same period in 2010.
In the third quarter, total expenses in Cable increased 3.9%, reflecting a 6.4% increase in video program expense, as well as increased marketing spend. Sales and marketing expenses increased 10.7% this quarter, as a result of higher overall media spend and a continued investment in direct sales to more effectively target customers and enhance our competitive position. Our marketing investment is clearly yielding positive results. 
Our XFINITY brand is now launched in 100% of our footprint, and we've seen consideration levels among non-customers, that is potential customers willing to evaluate and consider our brand for purchase, grow by over 47% since the launch of XFINITY. In addition, we continue to invest to expand the capabilities of business services, including the hiring of over 600 people in the last 12 months to support our growth in small business and our entry into the midsize market. We remain very focused on expense management, driving greater efficiencies and effectiveness throughout the organization. 
Similar to prior quarters, ad expense improved as we continue to improve our retention, collection and screening processes. In addition, meaningful improvements in our operating metrics are not only assisting to improve our customers' experience, but are also driving operating efficiencies throughout the business. 
In the third quarter, even as we incurred incremental costs and activity levels from Hurricane Irene and a strong back-to-school season, customer service expense was flat compared to last year, and technical labor expenses declined by 1%. Please refer to Slide 9 to review our Cable Communications capital expenditures. 
Through improved efficiencies, we continue to reduce the capital intensity of our Cable business. In the third quarter, Cable capital expenditures decreased 4.9% to $1.3 billion, representing 13.4% of revenue. This quarter's decline reflects lower spending on CPE, primarily driven by more favorable pricing. 
In the third quarter, we deployed 479,000 advanced HD and/or DVR set-top boxes. And as I mentioned earlier, 53% of our digital video customers now take an advanced service. Also during the quarter, we deployed 1.3 million digital adapters, for a total of 21.9 million digital adapters deployed since the inception of the All-Digital project, which, as Brian mentioned, is now complete. This has been a terrific initiative that has provided significant product enhancements and operational benefits, as well as generating strong financial returns. 
Over the past year, we've begun to recapture the remaining B1 analog bandwidth in a number of our markets. We plan to continue this effort as we anticipate additional operating efficiencies and strategic benefits from fully digitizing our systems. Third quarter CapEx also reflects meaningful investments to support the continued growth in business services and to expand our efforts in the midsize business area. Our investment in business services increased 15% to $147 million in the third quarter, and year-to-date has increased 35% to $453 million. 
Year-to-date, total Cable capital expenditures has increased 4.1% to $3.5 billion, equal to 12.6% of revenue. We are executing well on our 2011 capital plan and believe our capital intensity can continue to moderate even as we invest capital in areas that provide attractive returns, expand our service and product offerings and drive future organic growth. 
So as we review the performance for the third quarter and year-to-date, we feel very good about our operating momentum and focus on execution. Our Cable Communications business continues to perform well and deliver strong operational and financial results. Also in the 9 months, we are pleased with the progress at NBCUniversal and look forward to executing on the opportunities ahead of us.

I think we've improved our retention and our focus there. We're doing better customer roll-offs, and I've been really proud of our field teams and how they're servicing the customer better. And I think our marketing investments have paid off. We increased marketing this quarter. It was very targeted, and the XFINITY brand is now taking stronghold. Non-customer consideration is up over 45%. So I believe that a lot of those investments are sustainable as it pertains to the actual subs themselves. We're pleased with the initial results.

Given that the lackluster results we've seen from other cable operators, there's been considerable concern about the prospects of this business. I was wondering if you could comment on how you guys determine what the best value is for this business. Is it you keep the price where it is and to maybe grow high subscribers?

So voice will be a mainstay of our offering, and we'll continue to balance rate and volume."
