In addition, investors should be aware that Generally Accepted Accounting Principles prescribe when a company may reserve for particular risks, including litigation exposures. Accordingly, results for a given reporting period could be significantly affected if and when a reserve is established for one or more contingencies. Also our regular reserve reviews may result in adjustments of varying magnitude as additional information regarding claims activity becomes known. Reported results therefore may be volatile in certain accounting periods.

Very good question, it's an important question for us for this year. We will likely make Snapshot, and I think by my saying likely, you can probably put definitely, a feature of our Investor Relations meeting in June. The reason I say that is that we have some significant developments between now and then. We will increase over the next 60 to 90 days general marketing activity around this product. So we've been rolling out in different stages, as you know. And we are getting traction. This is a product that we're being dealing with for some period of time. So you can assume from that, that we're taking a fair amount of diligence to make sure that we get what we think are the critical elements right and by the mere fact that we're saying we're ready to approach national rollout and advertising, you can input from that that we're at a level of comfort that is greater than we could ever think before. To try to get to a couple of your questions, the Snapshot redesign involves a device that is reasonably expensive, I'm not going to give a lot of numbers here because it seems to have a lot of interest for others as well. So a number that we are closely incorporated our pricing, but the new design of Snapshot requires that the consumer only have that device for a period of time. So if you think of sort of inventory turns, we're actually using the device multiple times, as we progress, and we recognize that while there are always trade-offs with the amount of information we've designed this so that we think we get a very effective contribution to our underwriting by taking it as the name implies, a Snapshot of behavior. Of course, we can all come up with scenarios where that's not a perfect issue. Nothing's perfect in underwriting. We actually feel very good about this approach and good about the fact that the unit itself can be reused on multiple occasions. There's another cost associated with that, and that is the cost of getting the data. We use essentially the cell network to do that, and that cost is also built into our estimates of what we can afford to discount based on certain behaviors. So there's a little bit of cost ad, and there is behavioral characteristics that are being so attractive. This is something that we're just very, very excited about."

We get to the marketplace, we understand data, we use data that we get everyday and try to do something better with it the next day. And for my personal attention and the last number of folks that are working on this, what I tell them is keep your head down, get it to market, be the leader, and that's where we're best. To the extent that we have some patents and we've told you about those patents, and probably another issue that's worthwhile noting is that regulators have been very, I think, appropriate and accommodating with us and allow us to file our algorithms with them, but under a nondisclosure to the public. So this is not something that is readily determined, and I think that's a very constructive way to work when there are patents in place. To the extent that the intellectual property we have, we will protect that. We will take actions, but I'll let the rule of America to determine exactly how to deal with those things after-the-fact.

And I said on numerous occasions, I think both GEICO and Progressive sort of validate, obviously, we have our independent agency channel that we're very proud of and that's working terrifically well. But they sort of validate the whole direct to the consumer model. And while we will be arch competitors on always, we recognize that in some stance, both of the models are producing very successful results. What I see from them, and I think you've probably seen if you read the actual report, that they're also quite successful in the concept of bundling with their homeowners approach, and we're seeing very parallel results with our almost identical type approach in the marketplace. So the ability to keep growing and improve margin and improve retention, all characteristics you've heard me talk about a lot, and I'm sure they're both to them as well, are all a function of actions that are very easily determined in the marketplace. And while we are interested in every segment of the business, it's pretty exciting to see some of the things we've been able to do by bundling. And I think that model that both is executed by GEICO and Progressive has received, quite frankly, in my opinion, to simply my opinion, a lot of validity over the last several years that consumers that choose to buy their order directly are quite comfortable bundling with a carrier that's selling them quality product for their home. Now that will continue to produce growth for both of us, and those are very good customers, and we should be able to price them at good margins as well."

There are other markets Minnesota and tuff, but let's just focus on the three. I think that sort of covers the spectrum. Yes, Paul, this is sort of one of those coverages that gives me nightmares throughout my career because whenever something goes wrong, it always we seems to be associated with tip, whether it's in anyone of those states. But for -- so with some guardrails on a statement, the actions we've taken in Florida, Florida was not a great success for us last year. It was going backwards, trying on growth, trying to correct the issues that we needed to correct. The good news is, and I think it started to indicate this towards the latter part of my the year and some of my writings is that Florida, while it slowed down, also had come back to profitability and rate levels that we think we're comfortable. Our expectations now, and literally as of today, are that Florida is in a good position, and we have started to grow again in Florida. It's the high average premium state for us. We absolutely want to grow there. That's an important contribution to Progressive, overall, top and bottom line. And we think we have got the tip issues under control, under appropriate control, and some of that with rate, some of that was underwriting. We don't typically do a lot of underwriting per se. We do pricing more than we do underwriting. In some cases, tip has to be a little bit more dramatic. All those things have been done. We have no current activity that's in place. In other words, trying to sort of work their way through. We've got all the activities that we expected to put in place in place. And we're actually looking for Florida to be a real like a real contributor this year. So that'll be nice. New York, I think the story is similar. Michigan is still one where Pip is of great concern. For those who don't know, in Michigan, the limits in Pip in Michigan are actually quite different than in any other state, allowing the underlying limit before it goes onto the state pool in excess of $400,000. So this is the sort of place that we really need to get it right. So Pip is a generally much better outlook picture. New York and Florida, specifically, New Jersey look like they could be contributors this year in ways that they were not last year. And Michigan is still a work in progress, but the work has been done. We just need to see it come through and produce the results we expect. Brian, do you..."

I think they give a real fresh look to a lot of what we've been doing, and it needed to be freshened up some. We've got a messenger campaign coming along, which is a nice companion campaigns. We've got Snapshot ready to sort of break loose over the next 60, 90 days. And those are really very exciting things for us, and we intend to support them. So for us, I think we have different and better creative. We have different and better messages. We have some bundling messages along with the comments I made earlier on our PHA. So you're going to see Progressive continue to advertise because we've got real messages to get out there. Relative to spending, I would say spending will be up slightly from last year. And unfortunately, having said that, I can't tell you that the share voice will be any greater because I think there are probably one or two others that are spending just a little bit more as well."

Other than I would tell you that when you've your largest single state by market share not contributing from a growth perspective, it's a meaningful drag. But I don't have a better quantification of that, so I don't want to guess that. With regard to PIP growth, yes, it was actually a great year. I mean, last year, nice year, anytime you put on a good three quarters of a million customers, great. But having said that, we've done better than that. So this is not something that we're saying is some high-water mark and we can do better. We can do a lot better. PIP Growth function of several things, you know them.  Policy life extension, we gave you some data in the annual report and 10-K with regard to policy life extension, So we're seeing better peel use that measure that makes the most sense. Clearly, last year was a story, at least for directive two half years, but first half year, very, very strong. New business growth, not nearly a strong in the second half. We recognize that. I've acknowledged deceleration a little bit through that second half and leading into the first month of this year. But the plans that I've outlined with new advertising with Snapshot, I should've probably zoomed in there. Special lines season, which start sort of anytime the sudden breakthrough, which can happen in February, but normally, it's a little bit more to late March and April. We have announced in late February, a very, very significant deal with Ally Davidson to be the exclusive supplier to the Harley-Davidson franchises that sell insurance on their premises. So lots of very good things happening there for us. So we think that our actions on retention continue, and we see no reason why they won't continue to show the trends that we've been reporting for several years now. So that will help with PIP growth as well and new business generation. The ideas that I went through, those are certainly things that I'd like to see the new business growth. Perhaps this half year is different way than last year. It's a little slower in builds during the course of the year. Absolute numbers are still pretty strong. It really is a little bit, there's no excuse implied here, a numerator, denominator issue. We had just a very, very strong first couple of months into 2010. That get your..."

I'm trying to figure out how best to answer. A lot of focus on state-by-state. There's one other factor to consider also as you got at least a couple of the right ones there is that some geographic mix can drive, there are quite dramatic differences in average premium by states. And I've already mentioned Florida being a lower contributor, so that will be another change. Unfortunately, as I look at macro numbers, I know exactly what you're asking. I don't think there's any easy way to answer that. That really has to be what we call mixed level reporting at the state vehicle type, customer type, multicar, single car. But the general direction that we try to give, and I know it's very broad in the 10 or annual report that it is a mix issue. My suspicion is that it won't, I don't know that we'll necessarily seeing the same kind I'm not making any prediction at average premium, but we'll continue to see mix changes happen. As long as we've got sort of the unemployment rate that we have, I don't think we will see a correspondingly attractive growth in our nonstandard part of the business. I absolutely wouldn't want to be totally positioned to take that part of the business. That's the part of the business we know. And like, that's a mix shift that would happen if the economy changed. With regard to preferred, as long as we continue to do the sorts of things that we're doing in PHA, adding carriers, taking an approach where we can give a quote without necessarily making it feel like it's two quotes, more of a combined quote. We've done a lot to make our servicing of that customer through a household perspective  rather than a customer perspective. My suspicions is we're going to continue to make penetration into the preferred marketplace. So we're going to continue to see mix shifts for some time. I appreciate the question. Let me give some consideration to how maybe we can give you a better insight into that. I don't think it's a one-word answer, and maybe we'll incorporate into our June meeting in New York, where we can perhaps give, I'm liking the idea, some way of creating a framework where you can see and ultimately appreciate the mix shift relative to some of the metrics that we provided you."

After the period of observation, which is sort of a 30 days, and we'll give you an indication in the six months, will value what we now believe, sent back the chip, we're going to re-use that chip. There is no weak store, no customer data after that period of time. We obviously store the relative data, but it's not tied to a customer. So the only period of exposure there, and I'll have a clear answer as to what possible subpoena or anything else that could be applied, would be during the period you actually had it in your car for the most part, I would hope that we see kind, and I'm forecasting here into the future, so just go with me on the vision, but this is fundamentally an underwriting question. If we could ask a question, how good a driver are you, we would ask it. Unfortunately, there's no way to answer that. So this is a observe and verify and quantify, and we think we can do that very effectively with a six-month Snapshot. But after that, we have no real reason or interest for that matter. In fact, we have a vested interest in not knowing what you're really doing because we don't want to be involved in your privacy or anything else.

These risks and uncertainties include without limitation uncertainties related to estimates, assumptions and projections, generally; inflation and changes in interest rates and security prices; the financial condition of and other issues relating to the strength of and liquidity available to issuers of securities held in our investment portfolios and other companies with which we have ongoing business relationships, including counter-parties to certain financial transactions; the accuracy and adequacy of our pricing and loss reserving methodologies; the competitiveness of our pricing and the effectiveness of our initiatives to retain more customers; initiatives by competitors and the effectiveness of our response; our ability to obtain regulatory approval for requested rate changes and the timing thereof; the effectiveness of our brand strategy and advertising campaigns relative to those of competitors; legislative and regulatory developments, including but not limited to, healthcare reform and tax law changes; disputes relating to intellectual property rights; the outcome of litigation pending or that may be filed against us; weather conditions; changes in driving patterns and loss trends; acts of war and terrorist activities; our ability to maintain the uninterrupted operation of our facilities, systems and business functions; court decisions and trends in litigation and healthcare and auto repair costs; and other matters described from time to time by us in other releases and publications.
In addition, investors should be aware that Generally Accepted Accounting Principles prescribe when a company may reserve for particular risks, including litigation exposures. Accordingly, results for a given reporting period could be significantly affected if and when a reserve is established for one or more contingencies. Also our regular reserve reviews may result in adjustments of varying magnitude as additional information regarding claims activity becomes known. The reported results therefore may be volatile in certain accounting periods.

Perfect question, it's an important question for us for this year. We will likely make Snapshot, and I think by my saying likely, you can probably put definitely, a feature of our Investor Relations meeting in June. The reason I say that is that we have some significant developments between now and then. We will increase over the next 60 to 90 days general marketing activity around this product. So we've been rolling it out in different states as you know, and we are gaining traction. This is the product that we've been dealing with for some period of time. So you can assume from that, that we are taking a fair amount of diligence to make sure that we get what we think are the critical elements right and by the mere fact that we're saying we're ready to approach national rollout and advertising, you can infer from that, that we're at a level of comfort that is greater than we have ever been before. To try to get to a couple of your questions, the Snapshot redesign involves a device that is reasonably expensive. I'm not going to give a lot of numbers here because it seems to have a lot of interest for others as well. So a number that we, of course, incorporated into our pricing, but the new design of Snapshot requires that the consumer only have that device for a period of time. So if you think of sort of inventory turns, we're actually using the device multiple times, as we progress, and we recognize that while there are always trade-offs with the amount of information, we've designed this so that we think we get a very effective contribution to our underwriting by taking, as the name implies, a Snapshot of behavior. Of course, we can all come up with scenarios where that's not a perfect issue. Nothing's perfect in underwriting. We actually feel very good about this approach and good about the fact that the unit itself can be reused on multiple occasions. There is another cost associated with that, and that is the cost of getting the data. We use essentially a cell network to do that, and that cost is also built into our estimates of what we can afford to discount based on certain behaviors. So there's a little bit of cost ad, and there is behavioral characteristics that have been so attractive. This is something that we're just very, very excited about."

We get to the marketplace, we understand data, we use data that we get everyday and try to do something better with it the next day. And for my personal attention and the large number of folks that are working on this, what I tell them is keep your head down, get it to market, be the leader, and that's where we're best. To the extent that we have some patents and we've told you about those patents, and probably another issue that's worthwhile noting is that regulators have been very, I think, appropriate and accommodating with us and allow us to file our algorithms with them, but under a nondisclosure to the public. So this is not something that is readily determined, and I think that's a very constructive way to work when there are patents in place. To the extent that the intellectual property we have, we'll protect that. We will take actions, but I'll let the rule of law of America to determine exactly how to deal with those things after the facts. What I want to make sure is Progressive's in the driving seat, and we're going ahead and just doing what we do best."

And I've said on numerous occasions, I think both GEICO and Progressive sort of validate -- obviously, we have our independent agency channel that we're very proud of, and that's working terrifically well. But they sort of validate the whole direct-to-the-consumer model. And while we will be arch competitors on always, we recognize that in some stance, both of the models are producing very successful results. What I see from them, and I think you've probably seen if you've read the brochure report, that they're also quite successful in the concept of bundling with their homeowners approach, and we're seeing very parallel results with our almost identical-type approach in the marketplace. So the ability to keep growing and improve margin and improve retention, all characteristics you've heard me talk about a lot and I'm sure they're important to them as well, are all a function of actions that are very easily determined in the marketplace. And while we are interested in every segment of the business, it's pretty exciting to see some of the things we've been able to do by bundling. And I think that model that both is executed by GEICO and Progressive has received, quite frankly, in my opinion, to simply my opinion, a lot of validity over the last several years that consumers that choose to buy their order directly are quite comfortable bundling with a carrier that's selling them a quality product for their home. Now if that will continue to produce growth for both of us and those are very good customers, then we should be able to price them at good margins as well."

But for -- so with some guardrails on a statement, the actions we've taken in Florida, Florida was not a great success for us last year. It was going backwards, trying on growth, trying to correct the issues that we needed to correct. The good news is, and I think it started to indicate this towards the latter part of the year in some of my writings is that Florida, while it slowed down, also had come back to profitability and rate levels that we think we're comfortable. Our expectations now, and literally as of today, are that Florida is in a good position, and we have started to grow again in Florida. It's a high average premium state for us. We absolutely want to grow there. That's an important contribution to Progressive, overall, top and bottom line. And we think we have got the PIP issues under control, under appropriate control, and some of that was rate, some of that was underwriting. We don't typically do a lot of underwriting per se. We do pricing more than we do underwriting. In some cases, PIP has to be a little bit more dramatic. All those things have been done. We have no current activity that's in place. In other words, trying to sort of work their way through. We've got all the activities that we expected to put in place in place. And we're actually looking for Florida to be a like a real contributor this year. So that'll be nice. New York, I think the story is similar. Michigan is still one where PIP is of great concern. For those of you who don't know, in Michigan, the limits in PIP in Michigan are actually quite different than in any other state, allowing the underlying limit before it goes onto the state pool in excess of $400,000. So this is the sort of place that we really need to get it right. So PIP is a generally much better outlook picture. New York and Florida, specifically, New Jersey look like they could be contributors this year in ways that they were not last year. And Michigan is still a work in progress, but the work has been done. We just need to see it come through and produce the results we expect. Brian, do you..."

So it's not surprising that there are many others sort of entering direct, or doing a direct program, it's part of what they're doing or perhaps as in the case of insurance, so must a directly focused direct company, that doesn't surprise me at all. What is interesting, and I think it's important for all of you to have your own theories on this, is just how difficult it is to break into a marketplace with the level of advertising that's going on today. Whether I like it or don't like it, it sets a lot of parameters as to how to play in that space. And we intend to play very aggressively. But no, I'm not surprised. I think the movement beyond this, which almost certainly would have to be on everybody's radar screen is mobile.

I don't have an answer. We're guessing at that, so I'd prefer not to do that. But I guess the question, other than I would tell you that when you've got your largest single state by market share not contributing from a growth perspective, it's a meaningful drag. But I don't have a better quantification of that, so I don't want to guess that, if it's all right. With regard to the PIF growth, yes, it was actually a great year. I mean, last year, nice year, anytime you put on a growth of three quarters of a million customers is great. But having said that, we've done better than that. So this is not something that we're saying is some high-water mark and we can do better. We can do a lot better. PIF growth, a function of several things, you know them.  Policy life extension, we gave you some data in the annual report and 10-K with regard to policy life extension. So we're seeing better PLEs, our measure that makes the most sense. Clearly, last year was a story, at least for Direct, two half years, but first half year, very, very strong. New business growth, not nearly a strong in the second half. We recognize that. I've acknowledged deceleration a little bit through that second half and leading into the first month of this year. But the plans that I've outlined with new advertising with Snapshot, I should've probably thrown in there. Our special lines season, which starts sort of anytime the sudden breakthrough, which can happen in February, but normally, it's a little bit more to late March and April. We have announced in late February, a very, very significant deal with Harley-Davidson to be the exclusive supplier to the Harley-Davidson franchises that sell insurance on their premises. So lots of very good things happening there for us. So we think that our actions on retention continue, and we see no reason why they won't continue to show the trends that we've been reporting for several years now. So that will help with PIF growth as well and new business generation. The ideas that I went through, those are certainly things that I'd like to see the new business growth. Perhaps this half year is different way than last year. It's tad a little slower in builds during the course of the year. Absolute numbers are still pretty strong. It really is a little bit, there's no excuse implied here, a numerator-denominator issue. We had just a very, very strong first couple of months into 2010. That got your..."

I'm trying to figure out how best to answer since we really I think are focused on state-by-state. There's one other factor to consider also as you got at least a couple of the right ones there is that some geographic mix can drive, there are quite dramatic differences in average premium by states. And I've already mentioned Florida being a lower contributor, so that will be another change. Unfortunately, as I look at macro numbers, I know exactly what you're asking. I don't think there's any easy way to answer that. That really has to be at what we call, ""mixed level reporting"" at the state vehicle type, customer type, multicar, single car. But the general direction that we try to give, and I know it's very broad in the 10 or annual report that it is a mix issue. My suspicion is that it won't, I don't know that we'll necessarily see the same kind of -- I'm not making any prediction about average premium, but we'll continue to see mix changes happen. As long as we've got sort of the unemployment rate that we have, I don't think we will see a correspondingly attractive growth in our non-standard part of the business. I absolutely want to be totally positioned to take that part of the business. That's the part of the business we know and like. That's a mix shift that would happen if the economy changed. With regard to preferred, as long as we continue to do the sorts of things that we're doing in PHA, adding carriers, taking an approach where we can give a quote without necessarily making it feel like it's two quotes, more of a combined quote. We've done a lot to make our servicing of that customer through a household perspective  rather than a customer perspective. My suspicions is we're going to continue to make penetration into the preferred marketplace. So we're going to continue to see mix shifts for some time. I appreciate the question. Let me give some consideration to how maybe we can give you a better insight into that. I don't think it's a one-word answer, and maybe we will incorporate into our June meeting in New York, where we can perhaps give, I'm liking the idea, some way of creating a framework where you can see and ultimately appreciate the mix shift relative to some of the metrics that we provided you."

So can I take the liberty of saying I know it's a couple of months off, we will absolutely address that in June. I will tell you, as someone who has it in their car right now, I have therefore the same issues. I will tell you after our period of observation, and it is important to see how this redesign was actually targeted at addressing several issues. After the period of observation, which is sort of a 30 days, and we'll give you an indication in the six months, we'll value what we now believe, send back the chip, we're going to re-use that chip. There is no weak store, no customer data after that period of time. We obviously store the relative data, but it's not tied to a customer. So the only period of exposure there, and I'll have a clear answer as to what possible subpoena or anything else that could be applied, would be during the period you actually had it in your car. For the most part, I would hope that we see, and I'm forecasting here into the future, so just go with me on the vision, but this is fundamentally an underwriting question. If we could ask the question, ""How good a driver are you?,"" we would ask it. Unfortunately, there's no way to answer that. So this is a observe and verify and quantify, and we think we can do that very effectively with the six-month Snapshot. But after that, we have no real reason or interest for that matter. In fact, we have an invested interest in not knowing what you're really doing because we don't want to be involved in your privacy or anything else. So it's only an exposure period of six months, and we have no interest whatsoever in doing anything with the data other than what is in our best interest to give people an accurate rate that reflects their driving behavior.

Statements in this conference call that are not historical fact are forward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed herein.
These risks and uncertainties include without limitation uncertainties related to estimates, assumptions and projections, generally; inflation and changes in interest rates and security prices; the financial condition of and other issues relating to the strength of and liquidity available to issuers of securities held in our investment portfolios and other companies with which we have ongoing business relationships, including counter-parties to certain financial transactions; the accuracy and adequacy of our pricing and loss reserving methodologies; the competitiveness of our pricing and the effectiveness of our initiatives to retain more customers; initiatives by competitors and the effectiveness of our response; our ability to obtain regulatory approval for requested rate changes and the timing thereof; the effectiveness of our brand strategy and advertising campaigns relative to those of competitors; legislative and regulatory developments, including but not limited to healthcare reform and tax law changes; disputes relating to intellectual property rights; the outcome of litigation pending or that may be filed against us; weather conditions; changes in driving patterns and loss trends; acts of war and terrorist activities; our ability to maintain an uninterrupted operation of our facilities, systems and business functions; court decisions and trends in litigation and healthcare and auto repair costs; and other matters described from time to time by us in other releases and publications.
In addition, investors should be aware that Generally Accepted Accounting Principles prescribe when a company may reserve for particular risks, including litigation exposures. Accordingly, results for a given reporting period could be significantly affected if and when a reserve is established for one or more contingencies. Also our regular reserve reviews may result in adjustments of varying magnitude as additional information regarding claims activity becomes known. The reported results therefore may be volatile in certain accounting periods.
We're now ready to take our first question."

Perfect question, it's an important question for us for this year. We will likely make Snapshot, and I think by my saying likely, you can probably put definitely, a feature of our Investor Relations meeting in June. The reason I say that is there’ll be some significant developments between now and then. We will increase over the next 60 to 90 days general marketing activity around this product. So we've been rolling it out in different states, as you know, and we are gaining traction. This is the product that we've been dealing with for some period of time. So you can assume from that, that we are taking a fair amount of diligence to make sure that we get what we think are the critical elements right and by the mere fact that we're saying we're ready to approach national rollout and advertising, you can infer from that, that we're at a level of comfort that is greater than we have ever been before. To try to get to a couple of your questions, the Snapshot redesign involves a device that is reasonably expensive. I'm not going to give a lot of numbers here because it seems to have a lot of interest for others as well. So a number that we, of course, incorporate into our pricing, but the new design of Snapshot requires that the consumer only have that device for a period of time. So if you think of sort of inventory turns, we're actually using the device multiple times as we progress, and we recognize that while there are always trade-offs with the amount of information, we've designed this so that we think we get a very effective contribution to our underwriting by taking, as the name implies, a Snapshot of behavior. Of course, we can all come up with scenarios where that's not a perfect issue. Nothing's perfect in underwriting. We actually feel very good about this approach and good about the fact that the unit itself can be reused on multiple occasions. There is another cost associated with that, and that is the cost of getting the data. We use, essentially, a cell network to do that, and that cost is also built into our estimates of what we can afford to discount based on certain behaviors. So there's a little bit of cost add, and there is behavioral characteristics that have been so attractive. This is something that we're just very, very excited about."

We get to the marketplace, we understand data, we use data that we get every day and try to do something better with it the next day. And for my personal attention and the large number of folks that are working on this, what I tell them is, “Keep your head down, get it to market, be the leader.” And that's where we're best. To the extent that we have some patents, and we've told you about those patents, and probably another issue that's worthwhile noting is that regulators have been very, I think, appropriate and accommodating with us and allow us to file our algorithms with them, but under a nondisclosure to the public. So this is not something that is readily determined, and I think that's a very constructive way to work when there are patents in place. To the extent that the intellectual property we have, we will protect that. We will take actions, but I'll let the rule of law of America determine exactly how to deal with those things after the fact.

But they sort of validate the whole direct-to-the-consumer model. And while we will be arch competitors on -- always, we recognize that in some sense, both of the models are producing very successful results. What I see from them, and I think you've probably seen if you've read the brochure report, that they're also quite successful in the concept of bundling with their homeowners approach, and we're seeing very parallel results with our almost identical-type approach in the marketplace. So the ability to keep growing and improve margin and improve retention, all characteristics you've heard me talk about a lot, and I'm sure they're important to them as well, are all a function of actions that are very easily determined in the marketplace. And while we are interested in every segment of the business, it's pretty exciting to see some of the things we've been able to do by bundling. And I think that model that both is executed by GEICO and Progressive has received, quite frankly, in my opinion, just simply my opinion, a lot of validity over the last several years that consumers that choose to buy their order directly are quite comfortable bundling with a carrier that's selling them a quality product for their home. Now if that will continue to produce growth for both of us and those are very good customers, then we should be able to price them at good margins as well."

Yes, Paul, PIP is sort of one of those coverages that gives me nightmares throughout my career because whenever something goes wrong, it always seems to be associated with PIP, whether it's in any one of those states. But for -- so with some guardrails on a statement, the actions we've taken in Florida, Florida was not a great success for us last year. It was going backwards, trying, on growth, trying to correct the issues that we needed to correct. The good news is, and I think I started to indicate this towards the latter part of the year in some of my writings, is that Florida, while slowed down, also had come back to profitability and rate levels that we think were comfortable. Our expectations now, and literally as of today, are that Florida is in a good position, and we have started to grow again in Florida. It's a high average premium state for us. We absolutely want to grow there. That's an important contribution to Progressive, overall, top and bottom line. And we think we have got the PIP issues under control, under appropriate control, and some of that was rate, some of that was underwriting. We don't typically do a lot of underwriting per se. We do pricing more than we do underwriting. In some cases, PIP has to be a little bit more dramatic. All those things have been done. We have no current activity that's in place. In other words, trying to sort of work their way through. We've got all the activities that we expected to put in place in place. And we're actually looking for Florida to be a -- like a real contributor this year. So that'll be nice. New York, I think the story is similar. Michigan is still one where PIP is of great concern. For those of you who don't know, in Michigan, the limits in PIP in Michigan are actually quite different than in any other state, allowing the underlying limit before it goes onto the state pool in excess of $400,000. So this is the sort of place that we really need to get it right. So PIP is a generally much better outlook picture. New York and Florida, specifically, New Jersey looked like they could be contributors this year in ways that they were not last year. And Michigan is still a work in progress, but the work has been done. We just need to see it come through and produce the results we expect. Brian, do you..."

So it's not surprising that there are many others sort of entering direct or doing a direct program as part of what they're doing or perhaps as in the case of Esurance, almost a directly focused direct company, that doesn't surprise me at all. What is interesting, and I think it's important for all of you to have your own theories on this, is just how difficult it is to break into a marketplace with the level of advertising that's going on today. Whether I like it or don't like it, it sets a lot of parameters as to how to play in that space. And we intend to play very aggressively. But no, I'm not surprised. I think the movement beyond this, which almost certainly would have to be on everybody's radar screen, is mobile. And the implications for what mobile can do, we like to think of it as not sort of just making mobile a smaller Internet application. It really is about what does mobile allow you to do that other forms or interactions with the consumer couldn't allow you to do, and I suspect that'll be a whole new battlefield and a really exciting one for the next several years."

We've got Snapshot ready to sort of break loose over the next 60, 90 days. And those are really very exciting things for us, and we intend to support them.

But I don't have a better quantification of that, so I don't want to guess at it. Sorry. With regard to the PIF growth, yes, it was actually a great year. I mean, last year, nice year, anytime you put on a good three quarters of a million customers, great. But having said that, we've done better than that. So this is not something that we're saying is some high-water mark, and we can do better. We can do a lot better. PIF growth, a function of several things, you know them. Policy life extension, we gave you some data in the annual report and 10-K with regard to policy life extension. So we're seeing better PLEs, our measure that makes the most sense. Clearly, last year was a story, at least for Direct, of two half years. The first half year, very, very strong new business growth. Not nearly as strong in the second half. We recognize that. I've acknowledged deceleration a little bit through that second half and leading into the first month of this year. But the plans that I've outlined with new advertising with Snapshot, I should've probably thrown in there. Our special lines season, which starts sort of anytime the sun breaks through, which can happen in February, but normally, it's a little bit more through late March and April. We have announced in late February a very, very significant deal with Harley-Davidson to be the exclusive supplier to the Harley-Davidson franchises that sell insurance on their premises. So lots of very good things happening there for us. So we think that our actions on retention continue, and we see no reason why they won't continue to sow the trends that we've been reporting for several years now. So that will help with PIF growth as well and new business generation. The ideas that I went through, those are certainly things that I'd like to see the new business growth. Perhaps this half year is different in a way than last year. It starts a little slower and builds during the course of the year. Absolute numbers are still pretty strong. It really is a little bit, there's no excuse implied here, a numerator-denominator issue. We had just a very, very strong first couple of months into 2010. That get your..."

There's one other factor to consider also as you got at least a couple of the right ones there is that some geographic mix can drive, there are quite dramatic differences in average premium by states. And I've already mentioned Florida being a lower contributor, so that will be another change. Unfortunately, as I look at macro numbers, I know exactly what you're asking. I don't think there's any easy way to answer that. That really has to be at what we call, ""mixed level reporting"" at the state. Vehicle type, customer type, multicar, single car. But the general direction that we try to give, and I know it's very broad in the 10 or annual report that it is a mix issue. My suspicion is that it won't, I don't know that we'll necessarily see the same kind of -- I'm not making any prediction about average premium, but we'll continue to see mix changes happen.

I absolutely want to be totally positioned to take that part of the business. That's the part of the business we know and like. That's a mix shift that would happen if the economy changed. With regard to preferred, as long as we continue to do the sorts of things that we're doing in PHA, adding carriers, taking an approach where we can give a quote without necessarily making it feel like it's two quotes, more of a combined quote. We've done a lot to make our servicing of that customer through a household perspective rather than a customer perspective. My suspicion is we're going to continue to make penetration into the preferred marketplace. So we're going to continue to see mix shifts for some time. I appreciate the question. Let me give some consideration to how maybe we can give you a better insight into that. I don't think it's a one-word answer, and maybe we will incorporate into our June meeting in New York, where we can perhaps give, I'm liking the idea, some way of creating a framework where you can see and ultimately appreciate the mix shift relative to some of the metrics that we provide you."

So can I take the liberty of saying, I know it's a couple of months off, we will absolutely address that in June. I will tell you, as someone who has it in their car right now, I have, therefore, the same issues. I will tell you after our period of observation, and it is important to see how this redesign was actually targeted at addressing several issues. After the period of observation, which is sort of a 30 days, and we'll give you an indication. In the six months, we'll value [ph] what we now believe. Send back the chip; we're going to re-use that chip. There is no week store, no customer data after that period of time. We obviously store the relative data, but it's not tied to a customer. So the only period of exposure there, and I'll have a clear answer as to what possible subpoena or anything else that could be applied, would be during the period you actually had it in your car. For the most part, I would hope that we see, and I'm forecasting here into the future, so just go with me on the vision, but this is fundamentally an underwriting question. If we could ask the question, ""How good a driver are you?"" we would ask it. Unfortunately, there's no way to answer that. So this is a observe and verify and quantify, and we think we can do that very effectively with the six-month Snapshot. But after that, we have no real reason or interest for that matter. In fact, we have a vested interest in not knowing what you're really doing because we don't want to be involved in your privacy or anything else. So it's only an exposure period of six months, and we have no interest whatsoever in doing anything with the data other than what is in our best interest to give people an accurate rate that reflects their driving behavior.

That doesn't mean were going to work at it every day, but happy with New York, less growth. Michigan, growth really hasn't been the issue of Michigan. Michigan is getting sort of the control around profitability and we're much happy than we were in Michigan and starting to get to a point where our growth and profitability is a lot better balanced.

And over the past year, year and a half, we have raised fairly consistently and aggressively in the state of Michigan.

So I hit a couple of things in snapshot and then I will at least comment on your second question of noncustomers. In general, we remain as comfortable and optimistic as we were in June. We think the branding work we've done some since then and a couple of new adds that have yet to air continuing to allow us to own that space and that was very important to us, sort of get something where usage basis is really highly associated with Progressive and our measure tells us that we are achieving that. I would tell you on a both personal and as best as we can determine objective measure. We've yet to really describe snapshot to the consuming public, as well as we ultimately we need to do so. My suspicion is that it will require continuous exposure and different presentations and we're actually pretty excited about the couple of more within the harbor, but we recognize that, that's not a quick one add everybody gets it and get excited and therefore takes it up. The take rate in the Direct channel, I mentioned this in my comments for the annual report letter remains very strong. Our agency distribution is actually starting to accept the concept and get certified in the reason online certification process for our agents before they can use that, about 50% of our agents are now certified to use it. The take rate in Agency is about half to maybe a little less than half of what it is in the Direct channel. I don't read too much into that at this point in time. I think it's a new concept just as it is for consumers. But based there are no roadblocks there that we could in continually report improvement on all of those numbers. Important into was clearly would've start to go, I'll we've been testing for a long, long time. But important when we really get to this new model is profitability and our loss ratio and our target seem to be in line with our expectations and we're actually quite happy there. And thirdly retention and at this stage, we can really comment on is what I'll call early term retention of customers since we don't have long-term customers on the product, but the early term attention is actually a very encouraging for us. so good things on snapshot. We continue to actually produce a fair percentage of our business. I gave you sort of rough numbers in it I'm not going to continue to comment on numbers that really a discount in our regular product, but at of the customers that will come to us on a monthly basis think in terms of 30,000 and 40,000 customers that are taking the product. So we're starting to get a significant base on which to derive these conclusions around profitability retention and brand acceptance as a more general concept. So sort of a really just a continuing positive update to the June comment. Clearly, you know in our overall growth numbers so it's not something that pulled in significant numbers of customers that we weren't otherwise getting and we continue to hope to see that those numbers can get greater over time. With regard to nonprogressive policy holders using the product and I was trying to be direct in New York. Well we have clearly thoughts on that matter. We have not disclosed and are not in the position to disclose our ultimate game plan on that one. But there are options available to us that we will intend to capitalize on."

So I don't have a macro response to you that sort of suggest that they're more committed shoppers I'm not sure that that's necessarily true and I understand the logic but we can only really report what we see and by looking at this as in many ways as we can whether through agent production, Internet, comparative rating, so on and so forth, we do believe that shopping is down. And conversion is much more a function of just our rate level in individual states. We are feeling good about our rate level. Our margins I think margins in general for the industry is starting to approach a little bit more of the mid-90s as opposed to lower 90s. Those rate changes I think in the industry be at about 1.6 or our estimate is about 1.6 or a little faster than is providing another reason to believe that maybe conversion is maybe stronger for us is really a state-by-state issue.

And a little bit, keep in mind average premiums for policy and direct have gone down a little bit markedly but a little bit. So net, net our aggregate cost per sale or cost per acquisition is higher this year than versus a year ago."

So we continue to reevaluate how much we spend and we have meetings regularly even though if you look at next quarter spend maybe remaining years or so. We will continue to reevaluate that based upon where we feel our yield is relative to targets. The second component piece in all of our expense ratios, a large amount of it is sort of labor costs and we are trying in continuing to try to increase efficiency and everything we do.

Brian went through the numerator very well and certainly that's the one that ultimately we are accountable for controlling and I don't think there's any lack of attention on the company on that. But the big issue I think for those that follow us in the industry which is the denominator. And for some time, at least for Progressive as our mix is changing, as our acceptance on the Direct channel specifically is changing would be on a fairly long-term decline in average written premium. There are some factors that are general to all lines of business and there are some factors that are more specific to Progressive's direct business and our entry and quite successful entry into bundled products. It does appear and I will continue to give the numbers rather than opinions, but it does appear that, that decline in average written premiums have slowed somewhat and I think that we're probably at a point where the denominator is not working against this on the ratio -- the expense ratio itself. That will clearly bear out there out as you see the numbers coming forward in the next several quarters but I think we are probably at a level that we can expect that the denominator will not be working against us."

That's going to affect everything. Yes, Progressive is seeing in some states more so than others and more of a shift to a different mix of customer and I want to reinforce every time I say that. We want, we welcome every customer but we are able to now have a product that attacks as classic customers that we previously didn't attract that is a decline on a per unit basis and have written premium but in a lifetime premium basis, that's a very welcome situation.

Our focus is always on preserving the ability to write as much insurance as we can possibly read. We think that our value proposition to shareholders' equity the operational part of this business exceptionally well. So post 2008, where we don't think we were necessarily way out of balance, we've taken changes. We've addressed those changes and have communicated them, for example, one of them would be a lower position in preferred. We still have a lot of preferreds that we have at that time, never covered many cases during that 90. They're not at a point where they're closing as distress and not necessarily so liquid that we can change the position of a night and we want to. But in general, you'll see that the balance sheet is strong. And this time, to the extent that I'll say this time we've got a significant market disruption, we've got a very strong balance sheet. We are not in any way concerned about the operating company or overall capital. We want the flexibility. There was some discussions about the money at the holding company that gives us most flexibility that describes our capital in 3 levels, 3 tiers. And we have the will be completed has the most flexibility.
And frankly we feel right now with our position Bill commented maybe being short with interest rates going lower with the safe combination but we're still feeling very good about our overall position. We don't feel particularly threatened in any one area or vulnerability and a lot of flexibility in the holding company that frankly we are very happy to have at this time, and if we see opportunities that are in our best interest, the shareholders' best interest obviously, we are in a position to take advantage of them.

Obviously, Paul sees some forced sort of lag there, but the growth that I was referring to is we've seen a significant increase in new application counts, both in the agency channel and also in the direct channel. New Jersey, we're also seeing positive growth in new business applications. The Michigan story is a little bit different there. It is we had some concerns about the profitability, and over the past year, year and a half, we have raised fairly consistently and aggressively in the state of Michigan. So that wouldn't be a growth in new application story right now, but we feel much better about our rate adequacy and overall rate level you had there. Growth there will be slower to come."

No, it doesn't affect how we think about our total portfolio or about treasuries particularly. We still feel pretty confident that we'll perceive all our timely interest and principal payments in the treasury portfolio. Our weighted average credit rating post the downgrade remained at AA-. But you're right, if you add up our cash and our treasury portfolio, it's roughly 30% of our total fixed income portfolio, which is substantial. And that honestly feels pretty good to us right about now, as we're seeing a little bit more turmoil. That may give us some dry powder if there are some opportunities down the road. We've kept our duration short, which hasn't worked out as rates have fallen. But as rates get lower and lower, the math gets really tough there, and it doesn't take much of a price move to wipe out a full year's worth of income. So we're maintaining a pretty short duration portfolio and looking for high-quality spread product in the front end when we couldn't find it."

In general, we remain as comfortable and optimistic as we were in June. We think the branding work we've done, some since then, and a couple of new adds that have yet to air are continuing to allow us to own that space, and that was very important to us, sort of get something where usage base is really highly associated with Progressive. And our measures tell us that we're achieving that. I would tell you, on both personal and as best we can determine objective measure, we've yet to really describe Snapshot to the consuming public, as well as we ultimately will need to do so. My suspicion is that it will require continuous exposure and different presentations, and we're actually pretty excited about a couple more that are in the harbor. But we recognize that that's not a quick one-add, everybody gets it and gets excited and therefore, takes it up. The take rate in the direct channel, I mentioned this in my comments for the annual report letter, remains very strong. Our agency distribution is actually starting to accept the concept and get certified, and there is an online certification process for our agents before they can use that. About 50% of our agents are now certified to use it. The take rate in agency is about half to maybe a little less than half of what it is in the direct channel. I don't read too much into that at this point in time. I think it's a new concept, just as it is for consumers. But there appears to be no roadblocks there that we couldn't continually report improvement on all of those numbers. Important to us, clearly when we started to go, we've been testing for a long, long time but important when we really get to this new model is profitability. And our loss ratio and our targets seem to be in line with our expectations, and we're actually quite happy there. And thirdly, retention. And at this stage, all we can really comment on is what I'll call, ""early term retention of customers,"" since we don't have long-term customers on the product, but the early term attention is actually very encouraging for us. So good things on Snapshot. We continue to actually produce a fair percentage of our business. I gave you sort of rough numbers though I said I'm not going to continue to comment on numbers that are really a discount in our regular product but of the customers that will come to us on a monthly basis, think in terms of between 30,000 and 40,000 customers are taking this product. So we're starting to get a significant market -- or base on which to drive -- derive these conclusions around profitability, retention and brand acceptance as a more general concept. So really, just a continuing positive update to the June comment. Clearly, you know in our overall growth numbers, so it's not something that has sort of pulled in significant numbers of customers that we weren't otherwise getting, and we continue to hope to see that those numbers can get greater over time. With regard to non-progressive policyholders using the product, and as I was trying to be fairly direct in New York, while we have clearly thoughts on that matter, we have not disclosed and are not in a position to disclose our ultimate game plan on that one. But there are options available to us that we will intend to capitalize on."

I wouldn't disagree with your premise but in some cases, we've had to -- we've taken rate which will actually force lower conversion rates.

And Brian mentioned earlier that we took rate down in Florida but to prior that, we were taking rate up a fair amount. That clearly affects conversion, and the rate decrease will do the opposite to that. So I don't have a macro response to you that sort of suggests that there are more committed shoppers. I'm not sure that that is necessarily true. I understand the logic, but we can only really report what we see. And by looking at this as many ways as we can, whether through agent production, Internet, comparative rating, so on and so forth, we do believe that shopping is down. And conversion is much more a function of just our rate level in the individual states. We are feeling good about our rate level. Our margins -- I think the margins in general for the industry is starting to approach a little bit more of the mid-90s as opposed to lower 90s. Those rate changes -- I think the industry has been at about 1.6, or our estimate is about 1.6 or a little faster than us. Again, another reason to believe that maybe conversion would be stronger for us, but it's really a state-by-state issue. We'll just keep reporting what we see. I'd love to think that some of the comments I've made with Florida and New Jersey will help us with aggregate conversion."

There are some factors that are general to all lines of business, and there are some factors that are more specific to Progressive's Direct business and our entry and quite successful entry into bundled products. It does appear, and I will continue to give the numbers rather than opinions, but it does appear that that decline in average written premiums have slowed somewhat, and I think that we're probably at a point where the denominator is not working against this on the ratio, the expense ratio itself.

Yes, Progressive is seeing, in some states more so than others, a more of a shift to a different mix of customer.

Guys, the other question is just in -- if we look back at -- who knows what's going to happen with markets? Your guess is as good as mine. If I look back at kind of what the balance sheet looked like 4 years ago, you had some pretty significant kind of single-shot returns of capital. The portfolio at that time, the leverage was higher, asset-to-equity, certainly the duration was longer. I think there was less cash or term issues on the book, and there was a much bigger kind of preferred exposure on the balance sheet. Do you think, kind of where things sit today, what would it take -- I'd just be curious whether or not kind of your -- how you're thinking about risk and vis-à-vis capital flexibility, and not kind of approaching this from a standpoint that I think there's a dramatic change to your capital flexibility coming. I guess it has more to do with how you would think about deploying that flexibility against the backdrop? Or perhaps things are getting a little bit more challenging?"

But I would tell you I would start with repeating something I wrote significantly during the somewhat awkward days of 2008, 2009 from a risk perspective. Our focus is always on preserving the ability to write as much insurance as we can possibly write. We think that's our value proposition to shareholders, that we do the operational part of this business exceptionally well. So post-2008, where we don't think we were necessarily way out of balance, we've taken changes. We've addressed those changes and we've communicated them. For example, one of them would be -- have a lower position in preferreds. We still have a lot of the preferreds that we have at that time. They've recovered, in many cases, very nicely, but they're not at a point where they're causing us distress, and they're not necessarily so liquid that we can change the position overnight nor do we want to. But in general, you'll see that the balance sheet is strong. And this time, to the extent that I'll say this time, that we've got a significant market disruption, we've got a very strong balance sheet. We're not in any way concerned about the operating company or overall capital. We want the flexibility. There was some discussion about money at the holding company that gives us the most flexibility. We've described our capital in 3 levels, 3 tiers. It's at the holding company that we have the most flexibility. And frankly, we feel right now with our position, Bill commented, maybe being short with interest rates going lower with a strange combination, but we're still feeling very good about our overall position. We don't feel particularly threatened in any one area or vulnerability and a lot of flexibility at the holding company that frankly we are very happy to have at this time. And if we see opportunities that are in our best interest, the shareholders' best interests obviously, we're in position to take advantage of them. Anything you'd like to add, Brian or Bill, that ties together that question with more specificity?"

I can tell you that what we've done has been consistent with staying relatively in the front of the curve, and some spread parts will go a little bit longer but not change in the overall portfolio duration. In the second quarter, we slowed down our purchase of spread product to a little bit less than half of what it was in the next quarter as spreads compress. Right now, we're seeing this lower treasury benchmark yields but wider spreads to a significant degree, which may give us some opportunity at the same levels.

And I am going to tell you just point blank, we're going to stay with that 96 target because it is not something we're going to change tactically for the moment in time. Our long-term goal remains even as lofty as it sounds. It is absolutely long-term goal that drives us to be the consumers' #1 choice for auto insurance to do that. That requires getting more customers, so our focus is getting more customers, clearly not at any cost, so therefore we define what we mean by acceptable margin. And 96 not only serves us well financially, and I understand the trade-offs there, not only serves us well financially, but culturally, it's a very, very, very strong goal. And I would say, clearly I'm biased on this one, that Progressive is the company it is, probably because it has constancy of purpose.

It is we had some concerns about the profitability, and over the past year, 1.5 years, we have raised rates fairly consistently and aggressively in the state of Michigan. So that wouldn't be a growth in new applications story right now, but we feel much better about our rate adequacy and overall rate level yet there. Growth there will be slower to come."

No, it doesn't affect how we think about our total portfolio or about treasuries particularly.

But you're right, if you add up our cash and our treasury portfolio, it's roughly 30% of our total fixed income portfolio, which is substantial. And that honestly feels pretty good to us right about now, as we're seeing a little bit more turmoil. That may give us some dry powder if there are some opportunities down the road. But we've kept our duration short, which hasn't worked out as rates have fallen. But as rates get lower and lower, the math gets really tough there, in that it doesn't take much of a price move to wipe out a full year's worth of income. So we're maintaining a pretty short duration portfolio and looking for high-quality spread product in the front end when we can find it."

In general, we remain as comfortable and optimistic as we were in June. We think the branding work we've done, some since then, and a couple of new adds that have yet to air are continuing to allow us to own that space, and that was very important to us, to sort of get something where usage base is really highly associated with Progressive. And our measures tell us that we're achieving that. I would tell you, on a both personal and as best we can determine objective measure, we've yet to really describe Snapshot to the consuming public, as well as we ultimately will need to do so. My suspicion is that it will require continuous exposure and different presentations, and we're actually pretty excited about a couple more that are in the hopper. But we recognize that that's not a quick one-add, everybody gets it and gets excited and therefore, takes it up. The take rate in the direct channel, I mentioned this in my comments for the annual report letter, remains very strong. Our agency distribution is actually starting to accept the concept and get certified, and there is an online certification process for our agents before they can use that. About 50% of our agents are now certified to use it. The take rate in agency is about half to maybe a little less than half of what it is in the direct channel. I don't read too much into that at this point in time. I think it's a new concept, just as it is for consumers. But there appears to be no roadblocks there that we couldn't continually report improvement on all of those numbers. Important to us, clearly when we start to go, we've done testing for a long, long time but important when we really get to this new model is profitability. And our loss ratio and our targets seem to be in line with our expectations, and we're actually quite happy there. And thirdly, retention. And at this stage, all we can really comment on is what I'll call, early term retention of customers, since we don't have long-term customers on the product, but the early term retention is actually very encouraging for us. So good things on Snapshot. We continue to actually produce a fair percentage of our business. I’ll give you sort of rough numbers though I’ve said I'm not going to continue to comment on numbers that are really a discount in our regular product but of the customers that will come to us on a monthly basis, think in terms of between 30,000 and 40,000 customers are taking this product. So we're starting to get a significant market -- or base on which to derive these conclusions around profitability, retention and brand acceptance as a more general concept. So really, just a continuing positive update to the June comment. Clearly, you know our overall growth numbers, so it's not something that has sort of pulled in significant numbers of customers that we weren't otherwise getting, and we continue to hope to see that those numbers can get greater over time. With regard to non-Progressive policyholders using the product, and as I was trying to be fairly direct in New York, while we have clearly thoughts on that matter, we have not disclosed and are not in a position to disclose our ultimate game plan on that one. But there are options available to us that we will intend to capitalize on."

I wouldn't disagree with your premise but in some cases, we've had to -- we've taken rate which will actually force lower conversion rates. So over the first 6 months or so, even though our average or our aggregate rate take would be about 0.6%, you have individual states that have taken more. And Brian mentioned earlier that we took rate down in Florida but to prior that, we were taking rate up a fair amount. That clearly affects conversion, and the rate decrease will do the opposite to that. So I don't have a macro response to you that sort of suggests that there are more committed shoppers. I'm not sure that that is necessarily true. I understand the logic, but we can only really report what we see. And by looking at this as many ways as we can, whether through agent production, Internet, comparative rating, so on and so forth, we do believe that shopping is down. And conversion is much more a function of just our rate level in the individual states. We are feeling good about our rate level. Our margins -- I think the margins in general for the industry are starting to approach a little bit more of the mid-90s as opposed to lower 90s. Those rate changes -- I think the industry has been at about a 1.6%, or our estimate is about a 1.6%, so a little faster than us. Again, another reason to believe that maybe conversion would be stronger for us, but it's really a state-by-state issue. We'll just keep reporting what we see. I'd love to think that some of the comments I've made with Florida and New Jersey will help us with aggregate conversion."

But a big issue, I think, for those that are followers of the industry is really the denominator. And for some time, at least for Progressive as our mix is changing, as our acceptance of our direct channel specifically is changing, we've been on a fairly long-term decline in average written premium. There are some factors that are general to all lines of business, and there are some factors that are more specific to Progressive's Direct business and our entry and quite successful entry into bundled products. It does appear, and I will continue to give the numbers rather than opinions, but it does appear that, that decline in average written premium has slowed somewhat, and I think that we're probably at a point where the denominator is not working against us on the ratio, the expense ratio itself.

That overall, we've been seeing a fairly significant long-term trend in frequency decline. That's going to affect everything. Yes, Progressive is seeing, in some states more so than others, a more of a shift to a different mix of customer. And I want to reinforce every time I say that, we want -- we welcome every customer, but we are able to now have a product that attracts us classic customers that previously we didn't attract, and that is a decline on a per unit basis in average written premium. But in a lifetime premium basis, that's a very welcome situation. So those are sort of the 3 factors that I'd say are generic.

But I would tell you, I would start with repeating something I wrote significantly during the somewhat awkward days of 2008, 2009 from a risk perspective. Our focus is always on preserving the ability to write as much insurance as we can possibly write. We think that's our value proposition to shareholders, that we do the operational part of this business exceptionally well. So post-2008, where we don't think we were necessarily way out of bounds, we've taken changes. We've addressed those changes and we've communicated them. For example, one of them would be have a lower position in preferreds. We still have a lot of the preferreds that we had at that time. They've recovered, in many cases, very nicely, but they're not at a point where they're causing us distress, and they're not necessarily so liquid that we can change the position overnight nor do we want to. But in general, you'll see that the balance sheet is strong. And this time, to the extent that I'll say this time, that we've got a significant market disruption, we've got a very strong balance sheet. We're not in any way concerned about the operating company or overall capital. We want the flexibility. There was some discussion about money at the holding company that gives us the most flexibility. We've described our capital in 3 levels, 3 tiers. It's at the holding company that we have the most flexibility. And frankly, we feel right now with our position, Bill commented, maybe being short with interest rates going lower was a strange combination, but we're still feeling very good about our overall position. We don't feel particularly threatened in any one area or a vulnerability, and a lot of flexibility at the holding company that frankly we are very happy to have at this time.

I can tell you that what we've done has been consistent of staying relatively in the front end of the curve, and some spread products will go a little bit longer but not changing the overall portfolio duration. In the second quarter, we slowed down our purchase of spread product to little bit less than half of what it was in the next quarter as spreads compress. Right now, what we're seeing is lower treasury benchmark yields but wider spreads to a significant degree, which may give us some opportunity at the same levels. I could tell you, just as a fact on an FTE basis, what we’ve bought in June had a yield of about 2.8%. But I don't think I would use that as guidance going forward."

But now that we're not just seeing rates lower since then but 2 more years of rates being this low, if I, I don't know, I'm trying to do some very quick math, but if we've lost 200 basis points of pretax investment yield, that's equivalent to over 1 point on the combined ratio, maybe 1.5 points. Does that 96 need to become a 95 at some point?"

But as you also know, there is very, very competitive environment out there for our product and probably an all-time high in advertising, quality players' advertising. And I am going to tell you just point blank, we're going to stay with that 96 target because it is not something we're going to change tactically for the moment in time. Our long-term goal remains even as lofty as it sounds, it is absolutely the long-term goal that drives us to be the consumers' #1 choice for auto insurance. To do that, that requires getting more customers, so our focus is getting more customers, clearly not at any cost, so therefore we define what we mean by acceptable margin. And 96 not only serves us well financially, and I understand the trade-offs there, not only serves us well financially, but culturally, it's a very, very, very strong goal. And I would say, clearly I'm biased on this one, that Progressive is the company it is, probably because it has constancy of purpose. And that constancy of purpose, while it's okay to challenge it from time to time, has to be an extraordinary challenge to change it. And I'd just tell you, I have not reached that conclusion."

Actually, I probably should have shown Massachusetts in there, although I sort of don't think of it as one our classical PIP states. But Massachusetts, I think I've said this before as a quick recap, we went in at the wrong rate level. I can probably make a longer story out of that, but that would be the same outcome whichever way you get to it. We have very talented product management in that position now, and they have done a very, very good job of being able to get us back to a rate level and try to manage the customer set that we've had. Clearly, we've lost some of those customers that we took on at the wrong rate level as we adjust rate level. But we're at a point now, I would tell you, that we have a rate level that we can attract new customers at. Some of our renewal customers, arguably maybe still a little bit off, but not by a lot and not something that is on my top 10 list of things to worry about. And I would look forward to next year, maybe even the latter part of this year, but with starting to turn the direction on Massachusetts and increasing our customer count there at the same kind of disciplines that you would expect us to do in most other states. So a longer entry than I had expected, but I think we're back on course."
